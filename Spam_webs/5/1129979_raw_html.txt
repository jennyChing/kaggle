         Thousands of years ago, Ayurvedic medicine already used oil pulling as one of multipurpose natural remedies. In the United States, it is a relatively new approach to the solving of certain health problems. Coconut oil pulling is a very simple procedure, which reminds rinsing your mouth out with a mouthwash. Nevertheless, if you do it correctly and regularly, you will improve not only your dental health, but also the entire body condition as stated at

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         The major way, in which oil pulling works, is detoxifying or cleansing the body trough the lymph system, states
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_pulling">
          <i>

         . Coconut oil can remove different types of toxins and bacteria, so that the promoting of disease stops and the body gain strength to treat itself. Therefore, oil pulling with coconut oil can improve various unhealthy general conditions, such as asthma, chronic skin problems, diabetes, migraine headaches, chronic fatigue, PMS.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         At first, after starting oil-pulling therapy with coconut oil, you notice the general improving of your oral health  whiter teeth, fresher breath, healthier looking tongue and gums. Then dental problems diminish  gingivitis, tooth decay, cavities, bleeding gums. Finally, when significant amount of toxins are gone, the body starts fighting chronic diseases and our overall health improves.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Coconut oil possesses powerful antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties. When we do oil pulling, coconut oil acts as a cleanser. It picks up bacteria and other debris from our mouth and lymph nodes. Expelling harmful substances from our bodies together with the oil we spit, we render detoxifying effect.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         It is surprising how many viruses, microbes, fungi and other parasites are in our mouth. While functioning, they all leave toxic waste products. Our most common residents are Candida and Streptococcus. They are the main cause of gum disease and tooth decay. Besides, they contribute to the development of general unhealthy conditions, such as arthritis and heart disease. We do not get much harm from them until our immune system weakens due to different factors. However, as soon as it becomes overloaded, harmful microorganisms get the chance to spread throughout the body and cause the development of infections and chronic inflammation.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Many naturopathic physicians recommend oil pulling with coconut oil as the effective method of detoxification, healing and prevention of uncontrolled bacteria growth. The therapy works fast. Usually people notice the first improvements within a few days. Obviously, serious chronic problems require longer time  up to several months.

          Coconut oil
         </a>
         is one of the healthiest and nutritionally rich oils on the market. Its recognition has developed rather recently. Nevertheless, already many experts of dietary, natural medicine and beauty industry admit the amazing power of coconut oil.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         According to
         <a href="http://oilyoily.com/18-incredible-health-benefits-of-coconut-oil/">
          http://oilyoily.com/18-incredible-health-benefits-of-coconut-oil/
         </a>
         , modern industry offers the following varieties of coconut oil:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <b>
           RBD  refined, bleached &amp; deodorized coconut oil.
          </b>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
         This type is the most processed one. Copra  dried flesh of coconut oil undergoes mechanical and chemical procedures, which make the oil colorless, odorless and homogenous (no particles like protein). Obviously, such a type is lack of all the valuable nutrients the coconut oil is praised for. The only benefits of RBD coconut oil is its stability to high temperatures and versatility for different dishes, as it does not change the taste of ingredients. However, actually it is pure saturated fats, although not the worst ones. It is the cheapest and the most common of the coconut oil types, which is sold in stores as cooking oil.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <b>
           Virgin coconut oil.
          </b>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
         This type is derived not from dry copra, but from fresh coconut milk. Such processes as fermentation, centrifugal separation and enzyme action are involved. The most harmful for nutrients aspect  heat is used as little as possible during extraction. It is a respected type of oil. It preserves antioxidants, vitamins and fatty acids; it also smells and tastes peculiar and good. The production of this type is less economical, but it has found its consumers due to numerous health benefits of coconut oil.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <b>
           Extra virgin coconut oil
          </b>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
         <a href="http://www.health-benefits-of.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coconuts-and-coconut-oil_23644_673646668.jpg">

         </a>
         This is the most challenged and controversial type as there are no common standards for the virginity of coconut oil. Therefore, the name does not make much sense. It is only a marketing label used by manufacturers to attract inexperienced customers.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <b>
           Pure coconut oil
          </b>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
         This oil is derived from copra but it does not undergo the process of refining and bleaching. In other words, it is crude oil without any additives. Pure coconut oil benefits are numerous in different applications from cooking to cosmetology and medicine.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <b>
           Organic coconut oil
          </b>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
         To marked as organic the oil must be obtained from the coconuts of environmentally clear plantations. There is strict control on the use of chemicals, preservatives and genetic modification during production.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          <b>
           Cold pressed coconut oil
          </b>
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p align="justify">
         It is guaranteed that this type of oil was not exposed to heat during extraction. This fact ensure healthier product with more valuable nutrients in it.

         study,it has been found helpful in weight control. It was noted that four teaspoons of coconut oil per day would make your weight loss program more effective.

         However there have been a number people who stated that it doesnt really work for them. Some found it to be too heavy while others stated that hair stayed as dry as it used to be before using the product.

        <p>
         There are a lot of natural remedies, which become fashionable all of the sudden. Even though it might seem as a scam there is no smoke without fire so it is worth trying things out for yourself and finding what best works for you.

         As a general advice, just know the norm. Neither your skin nor your hair would like too much oil on it. It would simply feel greasy and would have no extra benefit to it. Professionals advise using a dime-size potion of coconut oil at a time. Even though it is stated to be PH neutral, always use the oil on a small skin area first to check for allergic reactions. Everyone is different so it wouldnt be wise to put it all over yourself during your first use. Read reviews carefully and discover the best and safest way to use it for you personally. In many cases where people found it ineffective, they might simply have been using it in the wrong way.

         Omega-3 fatty acids  DHA an EPA are important for the prenatal development of the brain and the eye. The best source of these nutrients is cold-water or fatty fish. In fact, unless you consume enough of the right fish at least two times per week, you should get omega-3s from supplements. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should carefully watch daily dosage of omega-3 to minimize the risk of fish oil supplements side effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends consuming about 300mg of DHA a day during pregnancy. If you eat fish or omega-3 enriched food regularly, limit your DHA intake to 200mg a day.

         Olive oil effectiveness for the improving of health condition is very difficult-to-match. The key factors of so many benefits of olive oil are its unique phytonutrient composition and the ideal ratio of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Polyphenols in the phytonutrient composition of olive oil is the most functional for the human body.

Olive oil health benefits are easy to understand knowing the number and variety of polyphenols. There are at least nine categories of polyphenols and each of them contains several anti-inflammatory nutrients. Their total amount is over twenty.

         1.Anti-Inflammatory
        </h4>
        <p align="justify">
         The anti-inflammatory properties of olive oil are scientifically proved. It is surprising as all plant oils are almost pure fat, the excessive intake of which leads to unwanted health conditions including inflammation. Nevertheless, olive oil benefits provide help in the inflamed part of the body. The source of its main strength is polyphenols. They work in a variety of ways to reduce our risk of inflammatory problems and to solve already existing problems.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         You do not need large doses to get olive oil anti-inflammatory benefits. According researches, 1-2 tablespoons per day is enough to reduce inflammation in the body.

        <h4>
         2.Cardiovascular benefits
        </h4>
        <p align="justify">
         Olive oil is able to influence positively the two main causes of cardiovascular problems, including atherosclerosis. These harmful factors are oxidative stress and chronic and low-level inflammation.

         In the first case, olive oil lowers the risk of oxygen damage to lipids in our bloodstream and to the cells that line our blood vessels. Fat-containing molecules (including LDL) need protection from oxygen damage, which significantly increases the possibility of cardiovascular diseases. Studies prove that polythenols of olive oil have powerful antioxidant activity and provide the body with that protection.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         The anti-inflammatory olive oil benefits have been mentioned above. Few other healthy dietary foods are as rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds as extra virgin olive oil.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Another benefit of olive oil for the circulatory system is preventing the platelets in the blood vessels from clumping together. We need this process for sealing wounds, but it is highly undesirable in an ongoing way. The polyphenols of olive oil control the condition of the platelets preventing the appearance of too much clumped together platelets.

         Coconut oil has high saturated-fat content. However, it is a mistake to exclude the oil from your diet as it has a row of health benefits. Among them is coconut oil efficiency for weight loss according to
         <a href="http://oilypedia.com/coconut-oil-and-weight-loss/">
          this research
         </a>
         . It is scientifically proved that medium-chain fatty acids of coconut oil boost metabolism and control the level of sugar in the blood. Therefore, the body is able to burn fat more quickly.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         According to
         <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/healthandwellbeing.foodanddrink">

         , coconut oil is included in the diet of athletes, which need muscles but do not need fat in their bodies. The reason is that it can enhance performance and energy without overloading digestive system.

        <h3>
         Coconut oil secret
        </h3>
        <p align="justify">
         It looks suspect that the consuming of saturated fats can lead to weight loss. The point is the molecular structure of coconut oil lipids. The majority of them are medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) while. In the body, these chemicals make directly for the liver. They are easy to absorb, so they quickly provide energy. Other vegetable oils and butter contain long-chain fatty acids, which are burn off comparatively slowly and tend to be deposited in fat cells.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Another beneficial property of MTC is its ability to increase metabolism rate in the body. If a meal contains coconut oil, then the body uses more energy for digestion than it would without coconut oil addition. A study published in Obesity Research (2003) stated that overweight men burn more calories and lost weight with coconut oil in their daily menu.

         Partly substitute your traditional oils and butter with coconut oil. First of all, cut out all polyunsaturated fats from your diet.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Incorporate coconut oil in your diet gradually to give your body time to get used to the oil metabolism boosting and detox activity.

        <p align="justify">
         Take the first spoonful of coconut oil before breakfast. It keeps your appetite for carbs under control, provide valuable nutrients and controls sugar rate. You will soon feel very energetic.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
         Go for cold-pressed virgin coconut oil only. Refined and deodorized types of the oil are lack of medium-chain fatty acids, which are responsible for possible weight loss.
