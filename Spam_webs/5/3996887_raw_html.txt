         <p>
          The guts of the homemade sun jar are made using a solar garden light. These can be found at hardware and garden stores, and there are lots of types to choose from. Obviously since were ripping it apart well be using the cheap ones. I love the solar garden lights for their intended purpose and will probably get some for our front walk. They work like this: the solar panel charges the NiCAD battery during the day, the batteries power the LED light when it turns dark, and a little diode turns the light off during the daylight hours. You put the jar on a sunny window sill and thats it, it runs itself.
         </p>
         <p>
          At stores I also found solar lights for floating in pools, and ones made to

           first try
          </a>
          where I discovered that the components had been glued into place, I compared a few kinds until I found one that worked. I found that the components needed to unscrew easily, and have one battery. My unscientific testing and general assumptions bring me to say two batteries take longer to charge during the day. These are the ones that didnt work: set of 4 Hampton Bay lights from Home Depot, glued in place; set of 6 Malibu brand lights from Fred Meyer, had 2 batteries; set of 4 Westinghouse brand lights from Sears, I was completely unable to get open. There might be other kinds out there that work just great, but at this point I was tired and running up against a deadline.

         <p>
          I settled on Malibu brand lights from Lowes which come individually packaged, about $10 each:
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="467" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/malibubox.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          These come apart easily and there is no separate light sensing diode as shown in the Instructables site, if you cover the solar panel the light comes on. The LED light is mounted underneath the battery already, making it very simple to assemble for the jar. Also the solar panel is just the right size to fit inside the jar lid and still allow it to close. The light in these is amber.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, after this initial happy find I bought six boxes of these (we were making them as gifts) and found that the components inside were not always the same! Tragedy! Here are the three kinds we found:

          BAD  Two batteries.

          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/thebattery.jpg" width="350"/>
          <br/>
          GOOD! Single battery. That little orange strip is blocking the battery from engaging.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you feel like you can get away with it while in the store, open the box and peek inside. You want the one that looks like the picture just above.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unscrew the  four (or sometimes two) screws that are holding the solar panel into the frame, youll need a tiny phillips head screwdriver. Do not unscrew the screws holding the battery pack to the electronic bits, that can stay just as it is. The solar panel and battery bits which are attached to one another with wires. Discard the protective plastic sheet and plastic frame, as well as the rest of the bits that come in the box, lets hope they are recyclable in your area.
         </p>
         <p>
          We used Ikea jars  the
          <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?topcategoryId=15570&amp;catalogId=10103&amp;storeId=12&amp;productId=13562&amp;langId=-1&amp;categoryId=16468&amp;chosenPartNumber=40065867">
           smallest in the Slom series
          </a>
          (about $3) which you can find in the kitchen marketplace area. The jars seem really small in the store but we found the medium jar too large for the reach of the LED light to do a good job.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/thejar.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Happy surprise: the Ikea jar wire bits come off easily with a little pushing and pulling.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/thejar_halfapart.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          The only part which needs some help is the hinge:
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/thejar_pliers.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          This makes painting the jars far easier. We used a glass frosting spray paint which worked nicely. You dont want to spray the jar top, it needs to stay clear as that is where the solar panel will be mounted to collect sunlight. We put the jars up on some skewers so they wouldnt stick to the paper.

          Two coats, it dried pretty quickly.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now we prepare the light guts. In these pictures we used a silicone sealer glue (its essentially clear caulking, I think), but the Instructables project uses Blue Tak, aka that sticky moldable stuff you used to hang posters in high school. We decided to use glue because we were shipping the jars across the country and didnt want them to shake apart in transit, but when we make our own Im going to use the tacky stuff as it worked plenty well in my test. Also, if the battery should need to be replaced it will be easier to get to.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is what well be doing: attach the solar panel to the inside of the jar top so that it catches light during the day. But first well attach the battery and light to the bottom of the solar panel so that when the jar is closed the light is pointing down inside.
         </p>
         <p>
          Stick the battery and light to the
          <i>
           bottom side
          </i>
          of the solar panel with the light at the center, pointing straight up:
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/gluedtopalel.jpg" width="350"/>
          <br/>
          (In this picture were using a skewer to prop up the battery back while drying.)
         </p>
         <p>
          Then dot the four compass points of the
          <i>
           inside
          </i>
          of the jar lid with the sticky stuff of your choice:
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/glueonlid.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          And put the solar panel, with the top of the solar panel facing towards what will be the top of the jar, on the sticky bits, centered carefully:
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/panelonglue.jpg" width="350"/>
          <br/>
          (Those wooden things are simply propping up the battery while the glue dries, theyll go away.)
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/panelonglue_sideview.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          Now, reassemble the jar and youre done.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/fini_topview.jpg" width="350"/>
          <br/>
          The solar panel, mounted on the inside of the jar lid.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/fini_quarterview.jpg" width="350"/>
          <br/>
          You can see the dark bits through the jar, and also the strip blocking the battery which will be removed to use.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="" border="0" height="263" src="/images/tomake/sunjar/fini_sideview.jpg" width="350"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          This was a lot of fun, but of course the homemade jars wont look as good at the
          <a href="http://www.suck.uk.com/product.php?rangeID=50%23">
           real thing
          </a>
          . Also, we tested these during a rainy, overcast Seattle December and found that the battery was barely charged by the end of the day. We got a few hours of light before it faded. Were sure there will be stronger light during the summer months, but were pretty happy anyhow.

            UPDATE:
           </em>
          </strong>
          Its been a few years since I first made this tutorial and the option for lights to fit inside a jar are easier to find. I found the following at Lowes, they are individually sold garden lights and the small top portion simply pops off of the ground stake they are mounted on. The top component is small enough to fit inside the top of a jar and wouldnt need any modification. All you need is some glue to mount it underneath the lid of the jar. Neat, eh?

          That looks like a very simple circuit. I would think that something like it could be built from components for much less than ten dollars.

          Fred  I agree, however I consider the $10 a reasonable price for the savings in time and ease on the part of somebody who doesnt know how, or have the correct tools to, create these from scratch. Especially if somebody is only making one or two.

          i made these too.  i used the two AA battery malibu lights from lowes that came in a 4-pack and they seem to work ok, but ill see after a few days. i hope they work since ive already given them out as presents. other things i found that may be  useful  i sprayed the inside of the jar, so it isnt gross to touch on the outside.  also, you dont have to take the jar apart to glue the stuff to the top. i used this glue stuff made by GE that i found at AC MOORE and i just applied it to the four corners of the top of the solar panel, and affixed it to the interior of the lid of the jar, with the lid of the jar laying flat on the ground. then you can carefully close the jar once it is all dry. another heads up  buy the amber led lights, because they look a lot prettier than the white ones. as far as how much light it puts out, think like a really really soft nightlight.

          Beth  I took them apart only to spray paint them. I considered spraying the inside but I was afraid it would be patchy  (and we only had one dry afternoon before Christmas to get it done so I didnt have time to find out). How did spraying the inside of the jar work out? Did you have trouble keeping the spray from bleeding onto the top or hinge?

          Susan  I couldnt say with any authority. Its not as bright as a candle, it certainly isnt bright enough to use as a way to see in the dark. Really its just a decoration you dont have to turn on and off.

          So I made a couple of these but ran into a few problems First off, I cant find glass frosting spray anywere. Lowes, HD, all the area craft stores I ended up using a matte clearcoat, and it worked pretty good, just not quite as frosty as I would like. The other thing is that I too am in Seattle, and they usually drain the battery of any energy by the time I get home from work. The circuit doesnt look that complicated, and if there are any electronics gurus out there, I would love for them to take a look at this and figure it out. Im sure you just have to replace the resistor, or one of the transistors with one of a higher or lower capacity to change the threshhold of the circuit.

          These lights typically have very simple circuitry.
         </p>
         <p>
          The one that Im looking at right now consists of a:
          <br/>
          LED
          <br/>
          diode
          <br/>
          transistor
          <br/>
          resistor
          <br/>
          cadmium sulfide cell.
         </p>
         <p>
          The diode is to block the voltage from the batteries discharging into the solar cell which would happen during periods of darkness (nighttime).
         </p>
         <p>
          The cadmium sulfide cell is a light sensitive resistor its at the top between the two solar cells. This light sensitive resistor is going turn the transistor on or off.
         </p>
         <p>
          The transistor then acting as a switch either allows electricity to flow through the LEDs or not.
         </p>
         <p>
          Bypassing the cadmium sulfide cell and the transistor with a manual switch would allow you to do the same thing physically.

          I found jars that will work at Hobby Lobby! Yay!  They are squared but should look fine.  One last question though  how did you attach the battery pack to the bottom of the solar panel?  My battery pack (and I am pretty sure it is the same one you used) has two little feet on it so there isnt a flat surface for glue.  Thanks for your help!

          Oh, I love this project.  Id like to give it a mention in my blog, and was wondering if I could use one of your pictures (linked back here, of course) to do so?

          I saw this in Readymade and made one for my Friends Easter basket. She was QUITE impressed, and I had a blast making it.
          <br/>
          The glass frosting spray was dificult to find, but I did find it at Michaels. The Malibu lights I used came from The Evil Empire 4 for $12, single cell, amber, snap apart. Fun project!

          I have attepmted  and failed miserably  at trying to make a Sun Jar. I now live in New Zealand and, sadly, am without an Ikea or a Lowes. I found a jar that resembles the Slom and a cheap solar garden light with single battery (which I was pretty happy about). BUT when I tried to remove the battery, etc, it was all glued and the battery was held in by a chunky plastic tray. SO I thought Id break all the plastic off and find another way to hold the battery in place  huge mistake. Also, the solar panel was too big for the jar lid, the corners stuck way out and prevented the lid from closing. Arrrgh. Ill try again with a different brand of light.

          I finally found an excuse to make the sun jars but didnt have time to get to Ikea for the Slom jars so I ended up using straight sided jars.  I didnt like the fact that the shadow from fron the battery showed so much so I placed a small mirror that I bought at Michaels in the bottom.  I havent tested it yet but I hpe it will help.

          Thanks for the inspiration!

          Im thinking maybe Etching Cream might work well to frost the glass.  I have used it a lot before (on christmas bulbs), and its smelly, but easy to use and its permanent.  Its easily found in craft stores.  I think I will try it with that.

          Andee  I considered that, but a friend reported that she was having uneven results when using etching cream on medium sized patches when she did designs on drinking glasses. I was afraid of going through the trouble only to have uneven results.

          If you coat it a couple of times, the unevenness goes away.  You can redo the process several times.  With the ornament glass, though, it gets fragile.  But I think with the thick glass on the jars, it will work fine. You can also get Amaco Rub n Buff,(at art supply) that coats the etched glass and it makes it look even brighter, and it comes in colors that will tint the glass.   Use silver if you dont want color.

          Long time lurker at notmartha, first time crafter with notmarthas instructions.
         </p>
         <p>
          I bookmarked this page a while back and got a whim the make some of these sun jars this weekend.  Firstly, Id like to thank notmartha for just spelling out what we needed*I* didnt have to hoof it about town to figure out what would and wouldnt fit!  That was the bombTHANK YOU!
         </p>
         <p>
          To answer some of the questions in previous postsI quessed that the spray might scrape off and I wanted to use these camping (which means that they would get a lot of bumping and scraping).  Since I already had some glass etching acid (you can get it at a good hobby shop), I elected to use that.  I etched the sides of the glass from the glass ridge down and about 1/4 inch of the bottom.  I left the bottom clear.  It was fine.  Maybe it wasnt a even as if I done 2-3 fine sprays of frosted glass spray, but it looks really really goodand definately will not scratch off.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also tried several different glues 
          <br/>
          silicon  fail
          <br/>
          super glue gel (the cheap kind)  fail
          <br/>
          JB Weld (24 hour set)  black goo  fail
          <br/>
          Devcon Clear Epoxy (5 min set)  SUCCESS!
         </p>
         <p>
          Devcon cost about $3.45 and rocked!
         </p>
         <p>
          Well  thank you notmarthaI now have 4 excellent sun jarsand will be making four more soon!
         </p>
         <p>
          Oh  one recommendation, you might want to be sure that the solar lights are not faulty BEFORE you take them apart and start glueing them.  Luckily mine worked

          First, thanks for creating this step-by-step. More helpful than the instructables version. I just made a couple of these this weekend. Spraying the inside definately looked better than the outside. The outside scratched in places and flaked off of the bottom. I used a GE silicone for mounting. It worked well for mounting the panel to the lid but not at all for mounting the battery and board to the panel. I had to go back and remount with super glue that seems to be holding much better.
         </p>
         <p>
          Does anyone know how to find the right light setup without tearing open the box and light unit? The malibu lights that i got at Lowes had only one battery, but everything was mounted to the underside of the light unit. The battery holder was actually molded into the base. (looks like the first picture but with only one battery) I had to hack saw the whole thing apart to get it to fit.

          Zach  My only advice is to stand in Lowes and open box after box of lights to find the kind that dont need to be broken to take apart. That box I have in the picture is one I found at Lowes and of twenty boxes, every third one seemed to have a different set of components. So, I dug until I found the kind I needed.

          Hi  does anyone have suggestions on how to get the glass frosting spray to go on evenly?  My attempt has it looking very splotchy, drippy, runny.
          <br/>
          What I know I did wrong was to spray them in below 50-degree weather, but I had all components inside at room temp before dashing out to the porch to paint.  Didnt want to paint indoors due to gas pilot lights and smelliness.
          <br/>
          Advice, anyone??

          Hi Megan  Thank you for the quick reply!  I was trying to paint the jars insides, with the paint can about a foot away.  The first coat was sort of okay, and I could swirl the wet paint around to make it more even, though still far from perfect.  (it wanted to pool in the jar bottoms.)  I tried two jars.  The second coat was more of a dribbly, uneven mess than the first, but one coat was clearly not going to be frosty enough.  My guess is the jars might have been too cold.  Good thing IKEA is a short drive from home!

          Deb  You need to do lots of very light layers. I suspect that if the paint is running its not setting up the way its supposed to, and probably not creating the right surface to grab the subsequent layers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Or try painting the outsides of the jars? I didnt have too much trouble doing the outsides while standing on my back deck ankle deep in snow the second time I made some jars.

          TRY SANDBLASTING! If you have access to a sandblaster, or talk to a local sign shop,  machine shop, body shop, painter, etc.  They would probably be glad to sand blast them for you for a couple of bucks.  Its permanent, more environmentally friendly and will give better results!
         </p>
         <p>
          You could sandblast either the inside or outside of the jars.

          I made bunches of these for Christmas gifts this last year, based on the Instructables article. They were HUGE hits! Everyone loved them. A few points from my own experiences.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just like any project, dont rush things. Especially when youre dealing with paint/glue setup times.
         </p>
         <p>
          +1 on multiple, light coats of frosting paint. I did mine with two light coats (on the jar interior), and they came out just fine.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also frosted the outsides of the jar lids, because the assembly looked really ugly through the clear glass. Dont worry, the solar cell will get plenty of light through the frosting.
         </p>
         <p>
          The NiCad batteries typically shipped in these solar lights are cheap garbage, with only about 600mAh capacity. Theyll only last about 6 hours when fully charged. I replaced these with AA NiMH 2300mAh batteries that I have around the house for all my battery-powered electronics. I got mine at Frys Electronics, but theyre pretty much available anywhere. Be sure to fully charge the battery before swapping them out. When fully charged, they will power the light for about 4 days continuously.

          I got an Idea in mind!!
         </p>
         <p>
          you can make a SunJar with 4 LEDs colored, Amber, Blue, Green, White(or what so ever you like). So you wouldnt have only 1 color!!! just use 2 switches(its the switch that you can slide 3 times.)or even better?
         </p>
         <p>
          and I think that this idea doesnt need the solar panel. Cmon.. charging takes few minutes/hours(well its up to you)
         </p>
         <p>
          You can even customize!! put a brighter light?, better batteries? MORE LEDs?
         </p>
         <p>
          yep it sounds hard but its not.. buy battery pack, switches, then connect to the LEDs BAAM! home made SunJar with 4 lights!!!   of course by Kristian unless someone has already thought of it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Well anyway.. this site is great that I even for got that I have work at 10am I dunno what to say to my boss
         </p>
         <p>

          These are very beautiful.  It upsets me that there is a blatant disregard for the future of our environment by encouraging unecessary consumption and waste of plastic!  Give our world a chance  spend the extra few dollars  and just buy the components :)

          Okay, this is a fabulous idea and my husband and I got everything we needed (well, almost) and started to try to make one of these bad boys
         </p>
         <p>
          I was the one to go to Home Depot while hubby watched our toddler at home, and after trying to rip open box after box of solar lights without being noticed by employees, I decided it would be easier to buy a bunch, take them home and return the ones that wouldnt work.  I found a box of 4 garden stake lights that were about $20 for 4.  The panels unscrewed easily and everything seemed perfect untilI tried to glue the component inside the jar (Walmart, $8) and I realized that it was too big to fit inside the lid.  I didnt look carefully to see that the photos showed the glue being on the rim of the lid, not inside.  So I decided to trim the panel a bit, after asking my husband his opinion.  I cut the panels down to as small as I could get them without cutting the thin blue strips on the other side.  The funny thing was, that the light kept going on and we couldnt figure out whyuntil my husband remarked that it must be on such a low voltage that it was picking up electricity from our bodies and charging the battery with it!
         </p>
         <p>
          After putting our hands on the lid for a few minutes (my son played with it and LOVED IT), the sun jar stayed lit for more than 2 hours!!! We assembled everything at night so there was no way it was partially charged by the sun while it sat out.
         </p>
         <p>
          Anyone else have this happen?  Was it because I cut the panel or would it happen otherwise?

          Okay, we are officially idiots.  We just realized that there was a sensor on the top and that the battery came partially chargedso we must have been holding our hand over the sensor without knowing it.  We feel ridiculous but at least we made 3 more sunjars without needing to trim the panels :)

          I looked at the solar panel part, which includes the battery, for several different models, and they were priced $4- $6 dollars.

          If the original poster can tell us the exact model # of the kit that came apart easily, we could just buy that specific part :)

          Melanie  This is fantastic, thank you. The part number on mine is 501025-5000, and when you search for that at the site you get a whole bunch of products returned. Im not sure if there is any way to ensure it is the exact one you need. If anybody does order it please report on what you receive.

          Just a quick comment about where to buy the glass frosting spray/etching medium: if you cannot find it at your craft store and you are located in a major city, it could be that you have to go to a suburban craft store to find it. It has to do with certain ordinances that attempt to prevent graffiti and similar vandalism using etching products, spray paint, etc. Just a tip!

          I ordered 4 of these, and they came just like your picture, and were easy to assemble.  The battery and light were not easily glued to the solar panel, but that was resolved with some cardboard strips as a filler.

          Just made one yesterday! It was a nightmare getting the jar back together, will never take it apart ever again!!
          <br/>
          I was pretty disappointed with the light, you can hardly see it. Will leave it charging all day see if it makes a difference, if not, would it be possible to buy just the LEDS and replace them? Any ideas?
          <br/>
          The solar light I bought were the cheapest I found but pretty expensive anyway!

          So I am in the process of making 6 sunjars, I used hampton bay 8 pack solar LED landscape lights(amber) for 25 bucks at Home Depot, and I also bought RUST-OLEUM specialty frosted glass spray as well. The lights I got were glued to a plastic casing, which I eventually cut up through much effort, however I found that when custom fitted to each jar, they did not need to be glued to the lid, and when the lid was fastened, it was secured quite nicely. Basically the square of plastic catches on the mouth of the jar, and the lid closes above it.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also had an idea to make some patterns towards the bottom of the jars, so that when frosted they would have the designs with clear glass.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was thinking of frosting the outside which the instructions say, and I was reading through comments and came up with the following questions:
         </p>
         <p>
          1)when frosting the outside, does the frost chip away? I read that it can and it concerns me :/
         </p>
         <p>
          2)can the spray be sprayed onto some sort of dabber and dabbed onto the inside? this sounds like it will probably end up not working.
         </p>
         <p>
          3)if you decide to spray the inside.. i guess how do you go about doing it? people are talking about drips n stuff
         </p>
         <p>
          anyway hope someone can help, and this is a great guide to making a great gift.

          I love these little things! I, like a whole buncha other people on here, would suggest using etching cream though. And using etching cream would also open up a wide range of design possibilities (or at least make them easier) Little clear or partially transparent polka dots, leaf patterns, grass shapes along the bottom Ive found shapes in the same aisle as the etching supplies that work really well. One problem, though, is that the sticky paper you use to do those designs like to give you a hard time when you use them on round objects

          I made one two days ago and let it charge up all day in the sun yesterday  It started glowing at 6:30 pm last night, and was still glowing at 6:30 am today!  It stayed on until about 7 when the room brightened up enough.  I was amazed at how long it stayed on!

          Ive actually found that with the path lights from Walmart that I didnt have to disassemble anything.  I just took the top part off and glued it into the top of my jar.  I am using a different jar though because I didnt have much time to look for one.  Frosting the glass is my current hang up on getting this baby finished.

          I made these, but did it differently then described. Walmart and Target sell mini lights for $4 that are self-contained and small enough that you dont have to dismantle them, just remove the stake. I got jars at the Container store, filled them with light colored vase filler/glass marbles, and just shoved the light in the jar and closed the lid. If you leave the deflector on, it makes the light brighter. They turned out amazing-looking.

          My artists team is brainstorming about how to light up our vendor booth for a weekend craft show using no electricity.  This is a fun idea.  I could envision these hung from the canopy ceiling.  The booth with the best non electrical lights wins a prize.  Wish us luck.

          Thank you so much for the step by step directions. My boyfriend and I made 4 today for my birthday present and they turned out great. We ran into some minor trouble, but we found our way out and the lamps are now just plastic shards. The perfect amount of light comes out and theyre fantastic! Thanks!

          I love these directions, as a crafter though I plan to adapt them to my own style. I have several small cousins who will be getting these nightlights for Christmas but I will be personalizing them with translucent paint and translucent gems that are used in mosaics so it casts a rainbow of colors. and i will be using plastic recycled jars so they are not breakable. i was considering adding handles to the plain ones to use as camping lanterns.

          I made these last night, but couldnt find frosting spray.  So instead I sprayed the inside w/ spray glue and coated it w/ glitter .They turned out great.

          Out here in the desert of Arizona we use solar lights to help friends and family find the driveway at night!!  I bought 3 sets of 4 each with plastic housings.  Unfortunately they are only good for about a year and then the plastic is rotten from the sun.  With a new battery and these awesome jars, I have had a great time recycling and upgrading.  They have also become my gifts of Arizona sunshine in a jar.

          I went to the dollar store and bought some glass rocks for $1 a bag, then I went to Jo-Anns fabrics and got some sheer fabric remnant with a floral pattern on clearance for less than a buck.  I found a larger jar with the clamp &amp; seal at Wal-mart for about $5 and at the same store, found some Christmas solar lights with the round top on sale for $4.  To put it all together, I removed the clamp/ring from the jar, fit the fabric around the inside and used the glass rocks to hold the fabric down at the bottom and replaced the clamp/ring over the fabric on the jar to keep it in place.  I need only to paint the christmas red solar disc and attach it under the lid (which fits perfectly).
         </p>
         <p>
          Heres a pic of what I put together:

          </a>
         </p>
         <p>
          I considered fire hazard and realized that a. the light is just slightly warm and hardly hot enough to burn even the sheerest of fabric and b. you need air to burn which the jar is sorely lacking.  So, nope, no fire hazard with fabric.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thanks for the awesome idea!

          I finally made a few. I may try some different techniques next time. I didnt want to frost the glass so I used translucent plastic instead. Here are there photos and all my sources:

          Ive just gone and made one of these and I have advice for making them without using a few of the listed materials.  If your light comes with a lens shaft attached(a plastic tube that clicks into place and covers the led, magnifying the light), as mine did, keep it attached and tie
          <a href="http://www.ropeworks.biz/reader/jugknot.pdf" rel="nofollow">
           a bottle knot
          </a>
          around it.  You can then tie the string ends together underneath the jar.  I used good looking yarn to do this, and some simple ropework to make it look great.  This saves on buying any apoxies or glues.  Also, instead of frosting the glass, I used translucent plastic from a very thin, plastic grocery bag.  This saves frosting, allows for colour if you choose a coloured bag, and recycles the grocery bag.

          So, I tried the individual lights that you found at lowes, but the lights are florescent, is there anyway we could experiment with differnt colored lights? OR is there a glass frosting thats colored?

          I just purchased some of the solar lights for $2.50 each from Menards.  The solar part detaches easily.  I didnt have any mason jars, but I did have some plastic Libbys fruit jars.  I simply placed the solar light on top of the jar (without its lid) and it made a lovely flower light pattern on the table.  For fun I colored the relief pattern on the jar and it predictably made the light pattern colored as well!  Great recycling project for scout group or play group, as the plastic jar makes the project kid friendly.

          I am making these now, jars sitting in my garage drying with the frosted glass spray. I bought the mini solar yard lights at Menards for 88 cents each, Large jars about $4.30 and small jars $1.99 at Hobby Lobby. That makes the small homemade sun jars Im making about $3 each for materials and the large jars about $6. I used clear tacky glue to attach the solar lights to the jars.

          Just watched CNN Heroes last night and am thinking I want to start making solar lights for children in Kenya and found your site. I am very thankful for your detailed instructions and hope it can bring enough light for these children to see at night with.  Imagine the beauty of lighting and how it can truly change lives!  I also like the idea of painting something on it too! Thank you.

          Also would like to know if you can directly buy the solar light guts?  No need to waste, and it will be easier and probably less expensive to do so.

          Hello! This is a lovely idea and I am planning to make some of these jars as graduation gifts! Wondering if you could answer some questions. I am looking to make the jar with amber/yellow and blue lighting as seen on instructables.com. Is there any way to switch the lightbulb in the garden lights?
          <br/>
          Or do you suggest any other colored lighting source? (simple and low cost)
          <br/>
          Thank you!

          Janet  I know that you can buy individual garden lights at Target that are labeled with white or amber light. For these I dont think youd be able to break open the light and switch out the bulb (they are made, sadly, to be disposable) but you might be able to cover the LED with a bit of clear colored plastic. Best of luck!

          I am currently making theses lights, and I am using a mix of thrift store found jars and Ikea jars.  I actually opted for the taller jars, as Ikea was out of the midget jars.  I am actually going to go to Home Depot to buy the lights (they have small, stake lights for $2.00 a pieces), and Michaels has the glass spray.

          I saw in your update that you used a  silver circular solar lamp that was all enclosed. What Im wondering; however; is how would you attach that to the inside of the mason jar. I found a few of the lamps you showed for .99 cents at walgreens and Im dying to make some of these for my nephews, however Im having difficulty with this part. Please help! thanks

          Question  I used a craft glue, clear Gorilla Glue I think, or something like e-6000. You could also use a clear silicone glue or clear caulk if you have it. A few dots in the corners work just fine.

          We have two solar lights hanging on a double shepherds hook in our front yard.  When the sky starts getting dark with a bad storm coming, we go out and take the lights from the hook and bring them indoors in case the electric goes off.  It would work with these handmade jar lights, too.

          The parts site no longer works, so in the absence of finding a less wasteful way or being educated in simple circuits(I am not, hubs is), I just bought three of the lights at Target that look just like the last ones pictured for $3.99 a piece:

          Michaels was an awful place to find jars with a terrible assortment-very few choices. The spray frost was just around the corner from the rest of the Krylon products. Krylon also makes colored glass spray that now comes in red, yellow, and blue and is translucent. This would be a great way to color the jar when changing the LED is not possible. Also, tinting jars would work great. Heres the tutorial for that below:
         </p>

          </a>
         </p>
         <p>
          Hobby Lobby really has the best assortment of jars ranging in all sizes and they generally have a printable coupon for 40% off, which would make the frost spray much cheaper than the normal $10 a can!
         </p>
         <p>
          I bought a color changing single battery solar stake from Lowes and hubs took it apart. It wont fit a mason jar, but we have others it will, or we may sand down the lip to make it fit. It was still pricier than the others. If that works out well, I will let you all know.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you for the fantastic gift idea!

          Can you use an ordinary Mason jar with metal lid and mount the light inside on the bottom of the lid?  Or will this not work because the lid is metal?  Thanks, I have a bunch of antique mason jars and would love to do something like this wtih them.  Vicki

          Vicki  You need the top of your container to be clear to let the light hit the solar panel, so a mason jar wouldnt work unless you replaced the inner flat disc lid with something like a plastic or glass piece that fit in there just right or found a way to mount the solar panel so that you could leave out the top of the jar. I hope that helps you out!

          I bought the individual solar lights from Walmarttheyre about $3 each. If you screw off the top and use the Ikea jars, the light fits so perfectly within the lid that you dont need any glue. Ive made about 10 jars this way and theyve held up perfectly. I did swap the batteries for longer life though.

          I just finished making my own sun jar. I couldnt find any colored window frost spray but I did get the last available can of clear frost color at home depot. I sprayed the outside and inside of he jar with about 3 layers, so the color is less transparent. The clear frost doesnt hide the solar light and I kinda wish the battery wasnt so visible. I also had trouble finding the right solar garden light. It was hard to get the top section separated because the one I bought had wires through both ends of the light. :(  But I figured it out. I cant wait to give them to my boyfriend for valentines day. Hes going to love it.

          Bought the lights at Dollar Tree for  a dollar  fit in nicely to the ikea jarsright now just using some clear packing tape around the rim of the light to hold it in.   And if you want it tinted, there is no need to buy colored frosting spray use a little piece of colored cellophane.  Or you can find a transparent colored label from a soda or water bottle and use a tiny piece of that.    Spraying the inside of the jar works just fine  not sure why anyone wouldnt do it that way.    I have these little battery operated tea lights (also from the dollar store) I plan to wire them in  and use them instead of the LED because they flicker like a candle.    :)

          I found solar lights and an apothecary jars (with lids) at the 99 Only Store. The lights needed only to be unscrewed then glued into the lid, and the switch turned on.
          <br/>
          Only problem is . . . not enough light!  Bigger bulb?

          I must try this! Thank you for sharing the idea! These are beautiful and inexpensive! My wife will love the idea. I am thinking of a way to drill a hole in the bottom of the jar so as to mount them on the railing of our deck. They would be beautiful spaced between the post atop our deck railing! Cannot wait to build them!!! Thanks for sharing!

          I purchased my jars for 1.00 each from Family Dollar and the small lawn lights for .99 each from Walmart. The jars are also squared and the light just barely fits in the jars with the plastic still on, could work either way. Still cold in MN so I havent sprayed the jars yet but I think I may attemp etching. When I saw this on Pinterest it said something about painting the inside with tinted Elmers glue. Has anyone tried this yet? Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous idea with all of us!

          so cool! im going to try this. one question: is there an easy way to turn it on/off? do these lights come with a switch, or is there an easy way to interrupt the flow from the battery, which looks like its not super removable in that setup? (i know nothing about electronics, so apologies if this is a silly question.)
