  &lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/four_g10.jpg" alt="Ten Things 20-somethings Should Stop Being Ashamed Of"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People in their twenties dont have it easy. However, no matter how bad it gets, one thing is certain: if youre a 20-something, there are a few aspects of your life you should stop feeling sorry about immediately. Looking for guidance? Check out this article to find out more.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its tough being a 20-something these days: the job market is more competitive than ever; the economy is barely recovering; a college degree doesnt equal a job offer anymore; marriage &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;" rel="nofollow"&gt;happens later than it used to&lt;/a&gt;. You are doing your best to navigate through life, but nothing seems to be as you have expected it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps adulthood is something you dont quite understand yet. It seems confusing and scary, and thats alright  youre in transition. Your twenties are the ideal time to discover yourself, test your limits, and figure out what makes you tick. You will have enough time to act like an adult later on. Thats exactly why you should stop being ashamed of these ten things as soon as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/90932010.jpg" alt="makeup"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Way You Look&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do have control over the way you look, but only to an extent. You can make sure that you are clean, your hair is brushed, and your clothes arent particularly messy. Thats about it. You cant grow taller or wash off your freckles. What you can do, however, is accept your flaws and learn to truly appreciate them  after all, they are what make you unique. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the same note, you should also understand that being a few pounds above your desired weight isnt the end of the world. If you feel uncomfortable, a healthy diet and 30 minutes of exercise each day will do wonders. Consult a nutritionist, hire a personal trainer, and do the work; but keep in mind, your perfect weight wont make you feel any sexier than you do now. &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/confidence-new-sexy-article-1.1483158" rel="nofollow"&gt;Confidence makes you feel sexy&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/46127310.jpg" alt="College graduation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not Going to College&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If youve chosen not to attend college and focus on something else, you shouldnt feel like a lesser human being. After all, there are many bright people who dropped out of college and turned out just fine: Ellen DeGeneres, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, to &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ashleyperez/23-famous-dropouts-who-turned-out-just-fine" rel="nofollow"&gt;name a few&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not attending college, however, shouldnt be an excuse for you to stop learning. Focus on developing the skills you will need to excel in your chosen field. Even if you have a full-time job, you can still work on improving yourself in your spare time. If you have no idea what you want to do yet, learn a new language  it will surely come in handy at some point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/30986510.jpg" alt="watch tv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not Having Plans on Weekend Nights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/21/fighting-fomo-4-questions-that-will-crush-the-fear-of-missing-out/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Fear of missing out&lt;/a&gt;, or FoMo, is real, and its stupid. Stop making plans to go out just because you are afraid that other people will enjoy themselves in your absence. Staying in, cuddling up in your bed, and watching Netflix can be just as enjoyable, as long as thats what you really want to do.  On the same note, doing laundry on Saturday night, especially if youre out of clean clothes, is nothing to be ashamed of.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/57136110.jpg" alt="alone"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not Achieving as Much as Others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing good ever comes from comparing yourself with others. In the age of Facebook, its easier than ever to spy on random people and beat ourselves up because we feel like theyve accomplished more. Its true that some become more ambitious when they see that someone else is ahead of them, but plenty more focus on the negative. This can easily shred your self-confidence and prevent you from doing your best to fulfill your destiny. Keep in mind that you are following your own path. It may take you a while to accomplish your goals, but that doesnt mean that you wont get there. Be patient and give yourself a break.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/being_10.png" alt="single"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Being Single&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should never be ashamed of the fact that youre single, or make excuses for refusing to settle in an unsuccessful relationship. &lt;a href="http://www.upworthy.com/a-beautiful-explanation-of-the-differences-between-the-fantasy-of-love-and-the-reality-of-love?g=3&amp;c=hpstream" rel="nofollow"&gt;You cant rush love&lt;/a&gt;. When the time comes to find the one, youll almost certainly recognize the signs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/keep_c10.jpg" alt="Guilty Pleasures"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Guilty Pleasures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have them, whether its reading erotic romantic novels when nobody is looking, or watching Gossip Girl for the seventh time. As long as the activity makes you feel good and doesnt hurt others, you shouldnt be required to explain yourself to anyone. In fact, the term guilty pleasure &lt;a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/01/21/why-i-never-use-the-phrase-guilty-pleasure-and-you-shouldnt-either" rel="nofollow"&gt;should become obsolete&lt;/a&gt;. After all, we shouldnt be embarrassed by anything we like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/040/b/3/3_girls_with_pacifiers__by_jaburi123-d3978wi.jpg" alt="Toxic Friendships"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abandoning Toxic Friendships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrounding yourself with quality people who support you and encourage you to grow is a crucial part of a happy life. When you feel like a friend is dragging you down or influencing you in a negative way, theres no shame in leaving them behind. You should focus on making yourself happy and give up any friendships that make you feel uncomfortable in any way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/39674510.jpg" alt="diet"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Indulging Yourself Every Now and Then&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking your diet for a delicious piece of birthday cake isnt the end of the world. As long as you eat healthy 80-percent of the time, you can indulge yourself every now and then. Missing the gym for three consecutive days falls into the same category. Buying a really expensive pair of shoes when we cant really afford them  weve all been there. We are all human. We slip up. Stop being so hard on yourself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/52230710.jpg" alt="Therapy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Going to Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going to a therapist can be extremely beneficial, so never be ashamed of it. They can help you move past hardship, open up, and discover more about yourself. Therapy isnt just for people with mental illness. In fact, therapy can help you cope with any kind of grief or stress. Theres nothing shameful in wanting a better life, dont you think? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i55.servimg.com/u/f55/17/96/67/32/76582910.jpg" alt="confused"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not Knowing What You Want to Do With Your Life (Yet!)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dont know what you want to do with yourself yet; if you havent discovered your passion yet, thats alright. Being in your twenties and not knowing what you want to do with your life is fairly common. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a career is a pretty big deal, so theres nothing wrong with taking your time and figuring out your future as you go along. You have to determine which activity makes you happy when you wake up in the morning, and you have to be proud of yourself when you go to bed at night. Thats no easy task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being ashamed of what makes you you. Your 20s will be a success as long as you gain a better understanding of who you are and what you want from life. Stop apologizing for your actions, failures or preferences. Focus on building a strong foundation for your adult life and do your best to truly enjoy these years. They will go by in an instant.   &lt;/p&gt;
