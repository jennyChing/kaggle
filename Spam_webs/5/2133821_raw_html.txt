      Fibromyalgia Almost took Angela's Life and forced her kids to grow up without a mom
     </h3>
     <img alt="" class="angela-photo" src="images/angela-photo.png"/>
     <p>
      Angela worked as a nurse until she had to quit because of the pain and fatigue while working. She eventually had to give up her active lifestyle.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pain started about 8 years before and seemed to move throughout her body. She averaged 15 doctor visits every year for the first couple of years and was hospitalized several times.
     </p>
     <p>
      She was eventually diagnosed with fibromyalgia after being referred to many "experts" and undergoing numerous tests.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       "You'll just have to live with it" was something she grew accustomed to hearing.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      After getting fed up with prescription drugs that caused more problems than they solved, she turned to the internet and found that there were alternatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      She discovered that many people were finding relief through various natural vitamins and herbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The problem is that this disease has five basic areas that need to be addressed. The symptoms that are most prevalent are pain and inflammation, energy, mental clarity, sleep disorders and general biological function of the body. One would have to buy an entire stockpile of supplements to address each of these areas.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Then one day while searching on the internet, she found Fibrolief. There is no other formula on the market like this.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      It contains the most powerful and clinically proven forms of vitamins, Stabilized R Alpha Lipoic Acid, anti-oxidants and herbal extracts. All the ingredients have been clinically proven to reduce fibromyalgia pain and discomfort and address all the areas that affect sufferers.
     </p>
     <p>
      And to Angela's surprise Fibrolief was a lot less expensive than all the supplements she had been taking.
     </p>
     <p>
      She showed the ingredients to her doctor and he recommended that Angela continue using the product, as she was experiencing wonderful results. Plus, he started recommending Fibrolief to his other patients.
     </p>
     <div class="letter">
      <p>
       <strong>
        We received the following letter from Angela:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear Fibromyalgia Treatment Group,
      </p>
      <p>
       After 8 years of suffering, thanks to you, I finally found some relief. Now after a few months on the product, I'm feeling great.
      </p>
      <p>
       My pain levels have gone way down and my energy is back where it used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sleeping through the night and just stopped taking my last pain medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       My husband and I are riding our bikes again, which I never thought would happen. I've been able to return to my active lifestyle and I'm even playing tennis every week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't thank you enough for this life-changing product. I would recommend this amazing product to anyone suffering like I was.
      </p>

         <p>
          I have been quite distressed with all the body pains and constant fatigue.  After working my way through 5 doctors at a major hospital in Reno, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  Many of the medications did not help.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thankfully, I tried Fibrolief.  This has been a major factor in dramatically decreasing the pain that I had.  My energy has returned and I am again doing the things I love.  I am beginning to enjoy my active life again.

          My doctor told me that my symptoms were all in my head.  I had severe chronic fatigue and I could not get out of my mental fog.  The pain I was experiencing was excruciating. I started taking your formula and within the first two weeks I am noticing improvement.  My energy is returning and I am now sleeping through the night and waking up refreshed.  I will need a new supply and hope to feel continued improvement.

         </p>
         <p>
          I have suffered with fibromyalgia for nearly four years.  I was first diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, but after the pain and other symptoms persisted, my doctor finally got the diagnosis right.  Everyone around me thought I was some kind of hypochondriac.  I was just always sick and tired.
         </p>
         <p>
          The pain finally started to ease off after taking your product for about six weeks.  I will continue using this as it is the first time in three years that I have felt so hopeful.  Thank you for helping me.

          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in March of 2010. At that time I was suffering from severe pain and had no energy.  I could not get a good night's sleep.  I fell into depression which lasted a few years.  My doctor prescribed me pain meds and anti-depressants, but they never really helped my condition.
         </p>
         <p>
          So I looked around on the Internet and came across Fibrolief which was a vitamin formula and I wondered what a vitamin can really do. I signed up for the 2 week trial and I did not notice anything during that time.  My doctor said It could take up to three or four months for some vitamins to take effect, so I kept taking them.  I did start to notice a difference in about 2 months.
         </p>
         <p>
          So I would definitely advise anyone with fibromyalgia to give Fibrolief a chance.

           Turmeric/Curcumin
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Curcumin is a potent anti-oxidant with insanely powerful anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties. This marvel of nature has virtually no side-effects and offers vast benefits to fibromyalgia sufferers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, curcumin has long been known to have poor bioavailability, meaning the rate at which it is absorbed is minimal. However, we also include BioPerine(C) in our formula which has been shown to increase the effectiveness by 2000%.

         <p>
          White Willow Bark extract contains the active ingredient salicin which is a Cox-1 and Cox-2 inhibitor, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and also reduces pain by inhibiting prostaglandins.

          Malic acid works with magnesium in the production of ATP, our body's source for energy.  
                                            In a study published in 1992 in the "Journal of Nutritional Medicine", magnesium and malic acid 
                                            are important for ATP production; the authors further postulate that fibromyalgia symptoms are 
                                            mostly caused by a deficiency in magnesium and malate, also known as malic acid.

          Acetly-L-Carnitine is an amino acid and one of several forms of carnitines at work in your body.

         </p>
         <p>
          CoQ10 is a vitamin-like substance that is found naturally in the body. Our bodies' natural production of CoQ10 steadily declines as our age increases.

         <p>
          CoQ10 promotes energy generation in the body in the form of ATP.  Ninety-five percent of the human body's energy is generated this way. CoQ10 helps convert food into energy and aids in metabolism.

         <p>
          It is estimated that 60-80% of Americans are deficient in magnesium. This critical mineral is responsible for over 300 enzyme reactions and is found in all of your tissues - but magnesium is mainly prominent and most important in your muscles, bones, and brain.
         </p>

          Many people can be sensitive to various forms of Magnesium when they are supplied in high quantities. To counteract any gastrointestinal complications, we use a blend of 5 different forms of magnesium to provide maximum absorption.

       Furthermore, it's so much easier to get all of these nutrients in one convenient supplement, rather than taking them separately, and mixing and matching them yourself.  You would have to take over 20 capsules a day, and there is still no guarantee as to potency and absorption.

       To buy all of the ingredients in Fibrolief separately, you would be spending over $221 a month and have to take over 20 capsules per day! Even then, you still wouldn't be able to match our proprietary blend, absorbability, and guaranteed potency.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a limited time, we will send you a free 2 week supply of Fibrolief and enroll you in our "Preferred Customer Program". You pay only $4.97 to cover shipping and handling.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's right.  You will receive a free trial bottle and membership into our preferred customer program, which qualifies you to receive a full $20 off on all of your future bottles of Fibrolief.
      </p>
      <p>
       To ensure you don't have to go a day without Fibrolief, you'll automatically receive a fresh bottle every month and your credit card will be billed the preferred member price of $53, plus S&amp;H - not the $73 non-members have to pay.  There are no minimum amounts of bottles to buy, and you can pause or cancel your account at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your trial bottle will give you a full 2 weeks to determine if the product is right for you.  At the end of the 2 weeks, if you're not completely satisfied, you can cancel without obligation, and the free sample is yours to keep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you can also order a single bottle at our regular price of just $73, or a discounted 3 month supply, without signing up for our Preferred Customer Program with automatic shipments.

        We have gone to great lengths to ensure that all of our ingredients are the most bio-available forms. In clinical studies, some ingredients show results much faster than others so depending on your symptoms and unique biology, results can very greatly.
        <br/>
        Everyone is different and it may take longer for Fibrolief to reach its full potential in your system. We have received reports of noticeable benefits within just a few weeks and for others it can take 4-6 months before they notice major changes. This formula will not work for everyone but we recommend you try it for at least 4 months for the best chance of success.

        That depends. Many doctors are very open to the science behind using vitamins and herbs to help our bodies defend themselves from disease and pain. Other doctors seem very oppposed to trying anything besides prescription medications.

        We have many doctors that recommend Fibrolief and some even sell it directly from their offices.

       What Enables The Ingredients In Fibrolief To Be So Effective At Relieving The Pain And Symptoms?
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Turmeric and Curcumin" src="images/features1.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Turmeric/Curcumin
      </h5>
      <p>
       Turmeric has been used medicinally for over 2500 years!
      </p>
      <p>
       Curcumin is a potent anti-oxidant with insanely powerful anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties.
				This marvel of nature has virtually no side-effects and offers vast benefits to fibromyalgia sufferers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, curcumin has long been known to have poor bioavailability, meaning the rate at which it is absorbed
					is minimal. However, we also include BioPerine(C) in our formula which has been shown to increase the effectiveness
					by 2000%.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Boswellia AKBA" class="fi2" src="images/features2.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Boswellia AKBA (ApresFlex(C))
      </h5>
      <p>
       Boswellia is a popular herb used for its benefits in fighting inflammation. Its anti-inflammatory effects involve many processes that the body
					uses to help heal itself, and could correlate to benefiting many chronic illnesses, such as arthritis and fibromyalgia.				
					It has a long history of use, particularly in India, where it is used in combination with curcumin to relieve arthritis pain. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross
					over study concluded that the care of osteoarthritis with this herbomineral formulation reduced the painful symptoms (Kulkarni, RR, 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Boswellia Serrata extract providing Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (AKBA) has been shown to increase joint mobility and ease stiff joints. We only use Apresflex(C) which offers
					highly concentrated levels of AKBA not found in most supplements.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="White Willow Bark" src="images/features3.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       White Willow Bark Extract
      </h5>
      <p>
       White Willow Bark extract contains the active ingredient salicin which is a Cox-1 and Cox-2 inhibitor, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and also reduces pain 
					by inhibiting prostaglandins. Animal experimentation at Cairo University compared willow bark extract to ASA (aspirin), and found that willow bark was equally
					or more effective as aspirin reducing inflammation; even though the salicin content was lower than an equivalent dose of ASA. It is recommended to take white willow
					bark instead of aspirin because it is less irritating to the stomach lining.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Celery Seed Extract" class="fi2" src="images/features4.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Celery Seed Extract
      </h5>
      <p>
       Celery seed extract has been used as a pain reliever for arthritis, fibromyalgia and gout. It is known to help reduce muscle spasms
					and to alleviate painful gas and bloating. It is also known to aid in improving the painful symptoms of fibromyalgia sufferers by reducing
					inflammation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celery seed contains a number of biologically beneficial substance, including flavonoids high in antioxidants, coumarin with anti-coagulating effects,
					volatile oils ,omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid, and the powerful healing compound 3-n-butylphthlaide (3-n-B). 3-n-B is extremely effective at reducing
					the action of the COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX pain triggers. In one study of patients with long-term joint discomfort, celery seed helped reduce tenderness and improve
					flexibility in a remarkable 68% of patients.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Malic Acid and Malate" src="images/features5.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Malic Acid/Malate
      </h5>
      <p>
       Malic acid works with magnesium in the production of ATP, our body's source for energy. In a study published in 1992 in the "Journal of Nutritional Medicine," magnesium
					and malic acid are important for ATP production; the authors further postulate that fibromyalgia symptoms are mostly caused by a deficiency in magnesium and malate, also 
					known as malic acid.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Acetyl L Carnitine" src="images/features6.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Acetyl-L-Carnitine
      </h5>
      <p>
       Acetyl-L-Carnitine is an amino acid and one of several forms of carnitines at work in your body. Carnitines carry certain fatty foods
					to mitochondria to be burned as fuels, as well as carrying away the processes' resulting waste products. These carnitine amino acids are protein
					building blocks that help the body produce energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       All carnitines are antioxidants, and this particular amino acid has been shown to improve endurance and relieve the fatigue associated with fibromyalgia and celiac disease.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Rhodiola Rosea" src="images/features7.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Rhodiola Rosea
      </h5>
      <p>
       This herb is considered an adaptogen, which is a class of herbs said to help build resistance to stress. In herbal medicine, rhodiola is typically used for fatigue, depression, sleep problems,
					poor attention span and poor memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a 4 week study with 82 participants, rhodiola extracts was able to greatly reduced dysfunction and fatigue associated with stress. Significant improvements were noted in social and work function
					secondary to reduced fatigue and improved mood.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Coenzyme Q10" class="fi8" src="images/features8.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) A powerful Antioxidant
      </h5>
      <p>
       CoQ10 is a vitamin-like substance that is found naturally in the body. Our bodies' natural production of CoQ10 steadily declines as our
					age increases, and this deficiency can be compensated with natural CoQ10 supplements.				
					A recent study by the University of Maryland found that CoQ10 could help reduce damage to the brain caused by stroke, improve energy levels, and increase the body's tolerance
					to and recovery from exercise.				
					CoQ10 promotes energy production in the body in the form of ATP. Ninety-five percent of the human body's energy is generated this way. CoQ10 helps convert food into energy and aids
					in metabolism.				
					Three different studies have found that using 100mg of CoQ10 a day produces statistically significant results, especially in combination with a daily supplement of magnesium citrate 
					and riboflavin.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="bacopa monnieri" src="images/features9.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Bacopa Monnieri
      </h5>
      <p>
       Bacopa is a herb long used for memory enhancement, concentration and mental alertness. Several studies indicate
					that bacopa may help preserve memory and enhance cognitive function.				
					In a 2008 study of older adults, researchers found that 12 weeks of supplementation with bacopa led to significant improvements
					in memory, depression, anxiety, and heart rate. In a 2001 study of healthy adults, participants showed significant improvements in memory,
					learning and anxiety.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="SAM-e image" class="fi10" src="images/features10.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       SAM-e
      </h5>
      <p>
       SAM-e is made from amino acid methionine and ATP. Studies have shown its effective for arthritis pain and shows both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.				
					Europe has had SAM-e available by prescription for many years as an antidepressant, and it has been available over-the-counter in the US since 1996. Dr. Ascanio Polimeni,
					a renowned physician in Rome, Italy, stated that "... doctors in Europe prescribe SAM-e for the therapy of many conditions, including depression, chronic fatigue syndrome,
					and fibromyalgia."				
					The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service commissioned a three-year survey of studies conducted on SAMe. The published report concluded that it is effective for depression
					and osteoarthritis, without the harmful side effects.				
					A deficiency in vitamins B12 or folic acid may reduce levels of SAMe in your body, it works best to take all three supplements together or combined.				
					The University of Maryland Medical Center states, "SAMe can be effective in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia - including pain, fatigue, morning stiffness, and depressed mood."
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Vegetables are rich of magnesium" class="fi2" src="images/features11.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Magnesium
      </h5>
      <p>
       It is estimated that 60%-80% of Americans are deficient in magnesium. This critical mineral is responsible for over 300 enzyme reactions and is found 
					in all of your tissues - but magnesium is mainly prominent and most important in your muscles, bones, and brain.				
					Magnesium can be an effective way to combat stress and studies show it improves your sleep. Your cells need magnesium to produce energy. It is necessary for 
					many different chemical pumps to work, to stabilize membranes, and to help muscles relax.				
					Many people can be sensitive to variou form of Magnesium when they are supplied in high quantities. To counteract any gastrointestinal complications, we use a blend
					of 5 different forms of magnesium to provide maximum absorption.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Vitamin D3" src="images/features13.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Vitamin D3
      </h5>
      <p>
       Vitamin D3 is crucial for the absorption and metabolism of calcium and phosphorous, which both maintain and strengthen bones and teeth and prevent
					bone loss and bone disorders. It is an essential ingredient in reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia.				
					D3 also protects against muscle weakness and immune system issues. It has been shown to reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis in women.				
					Greg Plotnikoff, MD, senior consultant with the Allina Center for Health Care Innovations in Minnesota published a study in 2003 on 150 people who came to a health clinic
					complaining of chronic pain. Virtually all of them - 93% - had extremely low vitamin D levels.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Folic Acid" class="fi2" src="images/features14.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Benfotiamine (B1) | Methylcobalamin (B12) | Folic Acid
      </h5>
      <p>
       Fibrolief is loaded with the most bioavailable forms of B vitamins. Some studies have found low levels of vitamin B1 and reduced activity of some thiamine-dependent enzymes among people with fibromyalgia.
      </p>
      <p>
       B12 deficiency is usually reported with symptoms of fatigue. Vitamin B12 is essential in converting carbs into glucose in the body.
					Sufficient B12 levels are linked to an increase in energy production and a decrease in fatigue and lethargy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Folic acid is believed to play a part in mood regulation. These B vitamins also help increase the level of SAMe in your body.
      </p>
      <p>
       We only use the most bioavailable forms of these ingredients and not the cheaper and more common cyanocobalamin (B12) and thiamine (B1).
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Lipoic Acid" class="fi2" src="images/features15.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Stabilized R-Alpha Lipoic Acid
      </h5>
      <p>
       R-ALA is a potent antioxidant that is both fat and water soluble, which improves the function of cell "transporters" that carry and distribute glucose.
					It is one of the few substances that can cross the blood/brain barrier and pass easily into the brain to go directly where it is needed most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly, R-ALA is the only antioxidant that has the unique ability to self-regenerate and to also regenerate many other antioxidants, such as B vitamins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many studies, doctors, and researches have shown stabilized R-ALA to be up to 12 times more effective than the cheaper S-ALA found in most ALA supplements. B vitamins
					and R-ALA are absolutely essential ingredients in helping to reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia and ease nerve pain.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Zinc" src="images/features16.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Zinc
      </h5>
      <p>
       Zinc is a mineral that has immune boosting properties and is a powerful antioxidant. Zinc is so important because it is found in every
					tissue in the body and is directly involved in cell division and studies have shown that low zinc is common in over half of the US population
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a 2010 study published by the "European Journal of Clinical Nutrition," zinc supplementation may improve mood in women, and may even be effective
					for depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adequate zinc levels are essential for keeping your immune system strong if you suffer from fibromyalgia.
      </p>
     </div>
     <div class="features-box">
      <img alt="Black Pepper Bioperine" src="images/features17.jpg"/>
      <h5>
       Black Pepper Bioperine
      </h5>
      <p>
       Bioperine is an extract derived from black pepper and is found to be bioavailability enhancer of a variety of nutrients.
					It also has immune-suppressing, tumor-inhibiting, and antidepressant effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to an article published in the Journal of Ayruveda and Integrative Medicine in 2010, piperine has been shown to 
					increase the absorption of vitamin C, selenium, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin B-6, and coenzyme Q.
