        An alien survivor from a prehistoric saucer crash? An unfortunate time traveler from the future? A tradesman from a parallel universe? A hitherto undiscovered species? Or a mere freak deformity of a human being? Nobody knows for sure, but no matter the explanation, the Sealand Skull has potential to change the view of the world we live in.
        <p>
         A mysterious skull was discovered at Olstykke on the Danish island of Sealand in July 2007, during the replacement of old sewer pipes .The Sealand Skull is about one and a half times larger than a male Homo sapien cranium. Especially the eye sockets contribute to its size. Its smooth surface reveals that the creature was adapted to cold climate, and its relative eye size that it was either a night creature, lived underground or on a planet orbiting a remote or dim star, probably an orange or red dwarf.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is noted that the star 51 Pegasi in the Pegasus constellation was the first Sun-like star known to have a planet. Planets orbiting the Pegasus star HR 8799 were the first to be directly imaged.
        </p>
        <p>
         The July 2007 discovery of the skull did, however, not make headlines and remained largely ignored by science until 2010. The researchers who in 2008 examined the skull at the Veterinarian High School in Copenhagen, merely concluded that, "although resembling a mammal, certain features make it impossible to fit the animal into Linnaean taxonomy."
        </p>
        <p>
         Dug up during the replacement of old sewer pipes, the finder at first believed that it was some horse bone. The property was the former home of a horse butcher and the garden was full of buried remains. It was not until refilling the trench that he noticed its humanoid shape. Later excavations at the site have not uncovered further remains with connection to the creature. Only identifiable animal bones, stone axes, and other neolithic tools which are common to the area were found.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that the skull was found among Neolithic remains does not reveal its age. Carbon 14 dating at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen has shown that the creature lived between 1200 and 1280 AD. Furthermore, the skull was found above the old pipes, whose age suggests that it wasn't buried until after 1900.
        </p>
        <p>
         The absence of other skeletal parts of the creature, as well as the skulls state of preservation, has led the scientists to suspect that it has not been buried for long, probably only a couple of decades. Perhaps to conceal the secret behind its existence, someone stored it for ages and later deliberately buried it.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to local legend, residents in Olstykke and nearby villages, a member of l'Ordre Lux P'gasos (the Order of Pegasus' Light), lived among them and protected various items, such as a mysterious cranium and several devices made of extraordinary light, unbreakable metal or ceramics.If the story holds true,it is possible that further research may lead to the whereabouts of alien artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is plausible that l'Ordre Lux P'gasos still keeps objects as well as insights into their origin and purpose. Little is known about the order, except that it was established around 1350. Throughout its existence it has counted influential poets and authors among its members. Among the prominent initiated were Giovanni Boccaccio, William Shakespeare, Rne Descartes, Thomas Jefferson, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Ambrose Bierce, Karin Boye, H.G. Wells, Julio Cort'zar, Joseph Heller, Octavia Butler, Aleksandr Solsjenitsyn and Ahmed al-Baghdadi.
        </p>
        <p>
         One can wonder why the task of preserving alien artifacts and knowledge fell upon an order solely consisting of writers, but the very name of the order does hint at one or more guests from the Pegasus constellation, who for some time, were rumored to have lived among us, bringing vast knowledge and inspiration. The secrecy of the order however suggests that humanity is not yet ready to share the Pegasian knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         The skull is said to have originated from the Balkans, but it has also been stored in Paris, France, and in Munich, Germany, before arriving in Denmark.
