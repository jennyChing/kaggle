You need it, you pay for it, but you get no pleasure from it. It is, essentially, a commodity. There are differences in customer service and user experience, but it is a highly regulated service, so the differences between companies cannot be all that substantial.\r\n\r\nThe government regulates auto insurance rates and makes sure that they are transparent. Companies are required to publish their full table of rates periodically, and those rates are in the public domain. But they are really complicated, so transparency is not all that helpful if the latticework of the window is two dense to see through.\r\n\r\nThe web is full of comparison shopping sites of all kinds. When I try to assess such services, I ask myself a series of questions: What are the commercial motivations behind the company that is running the website? Will the answer to the first question affect how comprehensive and unbiased the results of my search will be? Finally, how long will it take to get the information I am looking for?\r\n\r\n&lt;a href='http://www.forbes.com/companies/google/'&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; used to be the standard of impartiality and promised the most relevant, least biased information on anything that you are looking for. Recent &lt;a title=\"How Evil Are Googles New Paid Shopping Search Results?\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/05/31/how-evil-are-googles-new-paid-shopping-search-results/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;changes to its shopping search service&lt;/a&gt; have called this position into question. And as consumers, question we should. It costs money to build and maintain websites, and every startup looks to monetize their investment at some point. Unless you are an expert in any given marketor are a web developer who has had exposure to &lt;a title=\"dark patterns wiki\" href=\"http://wiki.darkpatterns.org/Home\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; of consumer mainipulationyou will not be in a very good position to discern if the comparison results you receive are indeed comprehensive and unbiased.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to car insurance, almost all comparison shopping sites traffic in lead generation. They ask you to fill out a series of forms that usually takes 10-15 minutes to complete. The services then package your personal information and sell it to a bunch of insurance companies as leads. The insurance company then contacts you and asks for more information (and more of your time) before giving you a quote. The amount of time this all takes, both active and waiting, is an impediment to looking at the transaction in purely financial terms. Maybe one company gets back to you quicker. Maybe one of the agents is nicer. Maybe You have a brand loyalty or have been swayed by recent exposure to advertising. Anyone of these factors can be a spur to \"pull the trigger\" before you have assessed all of the options.\r\n\r\nEnter &lt;a title=\"ratekick, insurace comparison site\" href=\"http://ratekick.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RATEKICK.com&lt;/a&gt;. A friend tipped me off to this site recently as a startup to watch, and the first thing I did was to try it out. See the video above for a real-time \"simulation\" of that first jaw-dropping experience. Unlike traditional lead generation sites that are in the business of extracting &lt;em&gt;as much information as possible&lt;/em&gt; before delivering a comparison, RATEKICK does just the opposite. In a great feat of user experience design, this service has figured out the &lt;em&gt;minimum information required&lt;/em&gt; to produce an accurate comparison quote. And unlike theoversharing of the &lt;a href='http://www.forbes.com/companies/facebook/'&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; driven web, RATEKICK allows you to do this &lt;em&gt;anonymously&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out that the required information is the kind of fairly neutral aggregate data that most of us are not uncomfortable about divulging: the make and model of our car(s), our age, gender and marital status (OK, those can be a little sensitive, depending on where you're at in your life), your zip code and the name of your current insurance carrier.\r\n\r\nThat's it. Enter that informationwhich takes less than a minutehit the big orange button and, voila, you get a listing of the applicable rate, apples to apples, for all of the companies offering auto insurance in your zip code. And of all of that initial information, the only typing involved is for your zipcode.\r\n\r\nWhen I ran my own numbers, I was expecting to be able to save some money because I have been with the same insurance carrier for many years and have not compared rates in a very long time. It turns out, the \"legacy\" rates that I have been paying are twice the lowest quote I received, and half again as much as what my existing provider would charge me as a new customer! Many of you reading this are already paying fairly competitive rates, so this exercise may only serve to confirm that you have shopped well.\r\n\r\nBut here is the second great part of the RATEKICK user experience. Let's say you are not ready to make a change, or you have discovered that the rates you are currently paying are pretty good. You can allow RATEKICK to retain your initial information and sign up for email alerts when your rates drop. So the simple act of giving a small amount of non-confidential information once can make you a smart consumer of auto insurance for years to come.\r\n\r\nWait a minute, you say, how does RATEKICK make their money? As you can see above, that was my first question. I have the advantage that as a technology blogger for Forbes, the CEOs of tech companies are usually very happy to answer my questions. So I contacted Brian Hannigan, an insurance industry and lead generation veteran who founded the company in 2008. Hannigan says that RATEKICK makes its money from insurance companies and agents who respond to users' actions. The difference between his company and lead generation sites is that because consumers click on links on the results page of RATEKICK in full knowledge of their options, they are self-qualified leads with a high likelihood of engaging in an actual transaction.\r\n\r\nWhen you go to your results page, each quote has a button you can use to apply directly for that offer. Below the results are a series of branded advertisements for some of the companies placed in an effort to sway users to consider factors beyond the lowest price. To the right of the results is a side rail of Google text ads related to your search request. Click on any of these links, and RATEKICK makes some money. It's very clear, very transparent. And although the additional advertising links do clutter up the results screen a bit, the clear focus of the page is on the full, unbiased search data.\r\n&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;\r\nI asked Hannigan how he arrived at such a clear, user-focused approach in clear contrast to all of the other comparison sites out there. Imagine if shopping online for other products and services required all your personal information?\" Hannigan replied. Imagine browsing for the latest Dan Brown novel on Amazon or shopping for a new golf club on eBay, or browsing flights on Kayak for prices, required you to have to surrender all your personal confidential information before getting your results. Ouch. I would hate that, so I knew consumers would love the transparency of getting real-time side by side comparison rating when they were shopping online for their car insurance as well. Bottom line, I just listened over the years to what consumers wanted and built what I know they would love.\" This is exactly the kind of thinking that &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/\"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;co-founder&lt;a href=\"http://alexisohanian.com/\"&gt;Alexis Ohanian&lt;/a&gt; writes about in his new e-book,&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hyperink.com/Make-Something-People-Love-Lessons-From-A-Startup-Guy-b1478\"&gt;Make Something People Love: Lessons From a Startup Guy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (published by&lt;a href=\"http://www.hyperink.com/\"&gt;hyperink)&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n\r\nI give RATEKICK a high likelihood of success. The second question I asked Hannigan, after how they make their money, was about mobile. He says that \"V1.0 of the RATEKICK , Pocket Rate Analyzer for the iphone and android market\" will launch this fall. Good move as I see that such a simple service that can be completed in such a short period of time is ideal for mobile. Beyond mobile, the company exhibits all of Forbes contributor &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.forbes.com/cherylsnappconner/\"&gt;Cheryl Conner&lt;/a&gt;s \"&lt;a title=\"cheryl conner on signs that a start up will succeed\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2012/07/12/5-sure-signs-a-startup-firm-will-succeed/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;5 Sure Signs A Startup Firm Will Succeed&lt;/a&gt;.\" I ran Conner's article past Hannigan and also, Maineentrepreneur and angel investor &lt;a title=\"kerem durdag bio on tedx dirigo\" href=\"http://tedxdirigo.com/speakers/kerem-durdag/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kerem Durdag&lt;/a&gt; (one of RATEKICK's investors). Both agreed that the company is in line with her principles, but Durdag, who as coached many startups, want on to say that they are \"complex beasts with many simple truths associated with them and all of that needs to be contextualized.\"\r\n\r\nThe main thing that I like about RATEKICK is that it is user-centered from the ground up. It respects my time. It respects my privacy. And, as it turns out, it's going to save me a bunch of money.\r\n\r\nHere is &lt;a title=\"ratekick, insurace comparison site\" href=\"http://ratekick.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RATEKICK&lt;/a&gt;'s introductory video so you can see hoe the company is trying to present itself:\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"xQdmsr4UA7w\"]\r\n\r\n-                   -\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;To keep up with&lt;a href='http://blogs.forbes.com/anthonykosner/'&gt;Quantum of Content&lt;/a&gt;, please subscribe to my updates on&lt;a title=\"anthony kosner on facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/anthony.kosner\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;or follow me on&lt;a title=\"akosner on twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/akosner\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;","text":null,"description":"Car insurance is a necessary evil.

You need it, you pay for it, but you get no pleasure from it. It is, essentially, a commodity. There are differences in customer service and user experience, but it is a highly regulated service, so the differences between companies cannot be all that substantial.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The government regulates auto insurance rates and makes sure that they are transparent. Companies are required to publish their full table of rates periodically, and those rates are in the public domain. But they are really complicated, so transparency is not all that helpful if the latticework of the window is two dense to see through.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The web is full of comparison shopping sites of all kinds. When I try to assess such services, I ask myself a series of questions: What are the commercial motivations behind the company that is running the website? Will the answer to the first question affect how comprehensive and unbiased the results of my search will be? Finally, how long will it take to get the information I am looking for?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/google/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; used to be the standard of impartiality and promised the most relevant, least biased information on anything that you are looking for. Recent &lt;a title=\"How Evil Are Googles New Paid Shopping Search Results?\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/05/31/how-evil-are-googles-new-paid-shopping-search-results/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;changes to its shopping search service&lt;/a&gt; have called this position into question. And as consumers, question we should. It costs money to build and maintain websites, and every startup looks to monetize their investment at some point. Unless you are an expert in any given marketor are a web developer who has had exposure to &lt;a title=\"dark patterns wiki\" href=\"http://wiki.darkpatterns.org/Home\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; of consumer mainipulationyou will not be in a very good position to discern if the comparison results you receive are indeed comprehensive and unbiased.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When it comes to car insurance, almost all comparison shopping sites traffic in lead generation. They ask you to fill out a series of forms that usually takes 10-15 minutes to complete. The services then package your personal information and sell it to a bunch of insurance companies as leads. The insurance company then contacts you and asks for more information (and more of your time) before giving you a quote. The amount of time this all takes, both active and waiting, is an impediment to looking at the transaction in purely financial terms. Maybe one company gets back to you quicker. Maybe one of the agents is nicer. Maybe You have a brand loyalty or have been swayed by recent exposure to advertising. Anyone of these factors can be a spur to pull the trigger before you have assessed all of the options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a title=\"ratekick, insurace comparison site\" href=\"http://ratekick.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RATEKICK.com&lt;/a&gt;. A friend tipped me off to this site recently as a startup to watch, and the first thing I did was to try it out. See the video above for a real-time simulation of that first jaw-dropping experience. Unlike traditional lead generation sites that are in the business of extracting &lt;em&gt;as much information as possible&lt;/em&gt; before delivering a comparison, RATEKICK does just the opposite. In a great feat of user experience design, this service has figured out the &lt;em&gt;minimum information required&lt;/em&gt; to produce an accurate comparison quote. And unlike the&nbsp;oversharing of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/facebook/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; driven web, RATEKICK allows you to do this &lt;em&gt;anonymously&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out that the required information is the kind of fairly neutral aggregate data that most of us are not uncomfortable about divulging: the make and model of our car(s), our age, gender and marital status (OK, those can be a little sensitive, depending on where youre at in your life), your zip code and the name of your current insurance carrier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thats it. Enter that informationwhich takes less than a minutehit the big orange button and, voila, you get a listing of the applicable rate, apples to apples, for all of the companies offering auto insurance in your zip code. And of all of that initial information, the only typing involved is for your zipcode.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When I ran my own numbers, I was expecting to be able to save some money because I have been with the same insurance carrier for many years and have not compared rates in a very long time. It turns out, the legacy rates that I have been paying are twice the lowest quote I received, and half again as much as what my existing provider would&nbsp; charge me as a new customer! Many of you reading this are already paying fairly competitive rates, so this exercise may only serve to confirm that you have shopped well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But here is the second great part of the RATEKICK user experience. Lets say you are not ready to make a change, or you have discovered that the rates you are currently paying are pretty good. You can allow RATEKICK to retain your initial information and sign up for email alerts when your rates drop. So the simple act of giving a small amount of non-confidential information once can make you a smart consumer of auto insurance for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute, you say, how does RATEKICK make their money? As you can see above, that was my first question. I have the advantage that as a technology blogger for Forbes, the CEOs of tech companies are usually very happy to answer my questions. So I contacted Brian Hannigan, an insurance industry and lead generation veteran who founded the company in 2008. Hannigan says that RATEKICK makes its money from insurance companies and agents who respond to users actions. The difference between his company and lead generation sites is that because consumers click on links on the results page of RATEKICK in full knowledge of their options, they are self-qualified leads with a high likelihood of engaging in an actual transaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you go to your results page, each quote has a button you can use to apply directly for that offer. Below the results are a series of branded advertisements for some of the companies placed in an effort to sway users to consider factors beyond the lowest price. To the right of the results is a side rail of Google text ads related to your search request. Click on any of these links, and RATEKICK makes some money. Its very clear, very transparent. And although the additional advertising links do clutter up the results screen a bit, the clear focus of the page is on the full, unbiased search data.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;I asked Hannigan how he arrived at such a clear, user-focused approach in clear contrast to all of the other comparison sites out there. Imagine if shopping online for other products and services required all your personal information? Hannigan replied. Imagine browsing for the latest Dan Brown novel on Amazon or shopping for a new golf club on eBay, or browsing flights on Kayak for prices, required you to have to surrender all your personal confidential information before getting your results. Ouch. I would hate that, so I knew consumers would love the transparency of getting real-time side by side comparison rating when they were shopping online for their car insurance as well. Bottom line, I just listened over the years to what consumers wanted and built what I know they would love. This is exactly the kind of thinking that &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/\"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;co-founder&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://alexisohanian.com/\"&gt;Alexis Ohanian&lt;/a&gt; writes about in his new e-book,&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hyperink.com/Make-Something-People-Love-Lessons-From-A-Startup-Guy-b1478\"&gt;Make Something People Love: Lessons From a Startup Guy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (published by&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hyperink.com/\"&gt;hyperink)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I give RATEKICK a high likelihood of success. The second question I asked Hannigan, after how they make their money, was about mobile. He says that V1.0 of the RATEKICK , Pocket Rate Analyzer for the iphone and android market will launch this fall. Good move as I see that such a simple service that can be completed in such a short period of time is ideal for mobile. Beyond mobile, the company exhibits all of Forbes contributor &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.forbes.com/cherylsnappconner/\"&gt;Cheryl Conner&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a title=\"cheryl conner on signs that a start up will succeed\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/cherylsnappconner/2012/07/12/5-sure-signs-a-startup-firm-will-succeed/\" target=\"_self\"&gt;5 Sure Signs A Startup Firm Will Succeed&lt;/a&gt;. I ran Conners article past Hannigan and also, Maine&nbsp;entrepreneur and angel investor &lt;a title=\"kerem durdag bio on tedx dirigo\" href=\"http://tedxdirigo.com/speakers/kerem-durdag/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kerem Durdag&lt;/a&gt; (one of RATEKICKs investors). Both agreed that the company is in line with her principles, but Durdag, who as coached many startups, want on to say that they are complex beasts with many simple truths associated with them and all of that needs to be contextualized.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing that I like about RATEKICK is that it is user-centered from the ground up. It respects my time. It respects my privacy. And, as it turns out, its going to save me a bunch of money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a title=\"ratekick, insurace comparison site\" href=\"http://ratekick.com\"
