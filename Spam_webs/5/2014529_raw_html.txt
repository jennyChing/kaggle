         </a>
         in protest at the countrys decision to withdraw from the CERN particle physics lab. So far over 1500 people have signed the
         <a href="http://sos.teilchen.at/petition/">
          petition
         </a>
         , which will be sent to Johannes Hahn, the Austrian science minister, who announced on Thursday that the country would cut its funding for
         <a href="http://www.cern.ch">
          CERN
         </a>
         worth around 20m per year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision to pull out from CERN after being a member for exactly 50 years comes only months before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  the worlds biggest particle accelerator  starts up.
        </p>
        <p>
         The decision now has to be approved by Austrias government, parliament and then president. If it is signed by the president then Austria will cancel the membership of CERN by the end of 2010. The decision could affect up to 170 Austrian-based particle physicists.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Budget concerns
        </h3>
        <p>
         Austria currently supplies 2.2% of CERNs budget with the rest coming from the labs other 19 member states. However, the 20m that Austria spends on CERN makes up 70% of Austrias funding for international research.
        </p>
        <p>
         Physicists in Austria are particularly angry as the science budget has been increased by 15% this year, while the cost of membership at CERN currently amounts to around 0.5% of the total science budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am really disturbed that the decision was taken by the ministry without any consultation, says Christian Fabjan, director of the Institute for High Energy Physics at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna.
        </p>

         </script>
        </div>
        <!-- OAS AD 'Middle' end -->
        <p>
         The pullout would be a serious blow for academic research, says Fabjan, and it sends a terrible signal to the international community and to researchers in Austria doing basic research.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fabjan said that his institute has been promised funding for a few more years if the decision is made to pull out, but he admits that Austria would become second-class citizens at CERN if the decision is taken.
        </p>
        <h3>
         A "grotesque" affair
        </h3>
        <p>
         Austria has mostly contributed to building the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of the four big detectors at the LHC, which will search for the Higgs boson and look for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry, or extra dimensions. Here they have designed systems to detect and measure the momentum of individual particles resulting from the high-energy collisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I find the pullout grotesque, says Anton Rebhan, a theorist at the Vienna University of Technology who has previously worked in the CERN theory department as a postdoc. I profited enormously from the possibility to carry out research at CERN, which would no longer be open for young Austrian physicists [if the decision is made].
        </p>
        <p>
         Austria would only be the third country to leave CERN. Yugoslavia, one of the 12 founding members left in 1961 and never rejoined, while Spain joined in 1961, left in 1969 and then rejoined in 1983.

        <blockquote>
         Austria made a good decision. Last year the British were questioning the value of further funding this project. And there are serious signs here in America of the same. The LHC is enormously expensive. But that is not the real problem. The problem is that it is delayed perpetually and with out end in sight. For those who think it will start in September think again. So it is not producing any results or any new science but it is absorbing massive amounts of money. It is time to think about funding other science projects. In France and Switzerland the LHC is a job creation tool not a science experiment. That is why some seriously suspect that the delays are not unintentional but intended to avoid the dreaded point of diminishing returns. Kudos for Austria. Hopefully other nations will follow suit. The LHC is not really science so Idoubt science will suffer.

         Let's be fair now. The LHC was programed to start back in 2002 (yes 2002 - no typo). So the Austrians are not making rush decisions. I think this crisys was brewing for some time for CERN. I would expect other countries will follow suit if there are further delays.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         And the latest problem had nothing to do with complexity. It was a quality control problem - a badly soldered wire.

         AUSTRIAN PHYSICISTS: REJOICE AND RETURN TO BASICS
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
         Austria made the right decision, and others will likely follow.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a gigantic mistake and a PR disaster for science.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         a.) Good science flows upward from experimental observations often made by a single scientist - with or without public funds.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         b.) Poor science flow downwards from bureaucrats who distribute public funds to large groups of scientists who are willing to look for whatever the bureaucrats want discovered.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Austrian physicists forced from group (a) can make a far greater contribution to science by carefully studying and reporting what they independently find in the 3-D plot of potential energy per nucleon, M/A, versus charge density, Z/A, versus atomic mass number, A, for the 3,000 types of atoms that constitute all matter in the visible universe.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The vertical axis is f+1, where f = Aston's nuclear packing fraction = (MA)/A.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The raw data are available from Nuclear Wallet Cards [Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Nuclear Data Center, Upton, NY, USA].
         <br/>
         <br/>
         With kind regards,
         <br/>

         </blockquote>
         The LHC sums up to a very, very small amount of total science funding for the countries that participate on it. It does not make any sense to stop funding the LHC to fund other projects. Other projects already make up ~ 99.5% - 98% of the funding. Your statement just simply do not comply with reality.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The LHC will produce important science for particle physics and cosmology. This is agreed by anyone with expertise in the field.

        <h3>
         Truth vs Interests
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
         Experimental projects, especially on the scale of LHC, have as main goal the scientific search for fundamental, absolute, universal truths. Such as the mechanism responsible for the genesis of mass. Truth as a value almost always stands in direct, immediate conflict with short term human interests. Such interests manifest themselves in the form of supporting or not supporting particular scientists, theories, or experimental projects. Whatever CERN, Austria or other countries and people do, scientific truth will eventually surface. The tragedy of the human race is that the timescale of such discoveries usually exceeds the timescale of human life. Enough for these interests to subside or be irrelevant.

         I absolutely agree with Triantap about the time scale of the discovery. Give LHC a chance once it starts up in late fall.The whole world is watching LHC and they can't just sit there and produce no results. Too many countries are involved with it and noboby wants to see it messed up. LHC is by far the largest project and given time, it will uncover the truths.It is too bad that they got into technical problems even way back in March of 2007 when the magnets built by Fermilab had a flaw within the calculations. I immediately called them up and realized that the mistake was the miscalculations of the asymmetric force in the design of the magnets and as a result, it failed the high pressure test. We corrected it and making progress each time when we face unexpected problems. This is all part of science as we go along. Once LHC fires up in Oct, we'll see and not giving up so soon and be more positive about it since we are all in it together.

         What could be more important than understanding the evolution of all that is?  Is there some underlying unspoken irrational fear or myth that motivates some around the world to attempt to halt the pursuit of knowledge?  If myth and fear are driving these 'escapes' into darkness, then you should know that it's the same thing that propels extremists to limit the boundaries of knowledge from certain areas from certain people (ie women and others as specified by narrow minded ideologies whether religious or otherwise) in certain volatile regions of the world. The pursuit of knowledge helps us understand who and what we are. Knowledge advances the interests of all mankind.  Are the nations who propose withdrawing support from the LHC hoping the contiunued support of other states will still benefit them without their contribution?  Since the results are available to all humanity, maybe that's what they are thinking.

           So it is not producing any results or any new science but it is absorbing massive amounts of money. It is time to think about funding other science projects.
          </blockquote>
          The LHC sums up to a very, very small amount of total science funding for the countries that participate on it. It does not make any sense to stop funding the LHC to fund other projects. Other projects already make up ~ 99.5% - 98% of the funding. Your statement just simply do not comply with reality.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The LHC will produce important science for particle physics and cosmology. This is agreed by anyone with expertise in the field.

         This LHC is a long term project. It is not for just a few years of operations, but at least 10 years down the road. People should not be too shortsighted. It took 20 years to confirm the discovery of the Tau neutrinos for Martin Perl to win the nobel prize at SLAC. Higgs boson is of no difference, but I truly want Peter Higgs to see the discovery of the Boson and win the nobel prize. I hope he lives long enough to see it happen. Many more exotic discoveries will be made at LHC in the long shot. It is exciting to see what will be uncovered in the next decade.

         The Austrians made the right decision. The LHC is a waste of vast sums of taxpayers' money, producing nothing but sinecures for its personnel. The LHC "scientists" have made misleading and false claims for their contraption e.g. manufacture of black micro or mini black holes, reproduction of the initial conditions of their big bang fantasy, detection of the alleged Higgs boson. Black holes and big bangs are nonsense dressed up in meaningless mathematical symbols to give the facade of profundity when in reality they are just plain rot. CERN is a sheltered workshop for fools. Let them get themselves a real job. They must not be allowed to abscond with public money any longer.

         Well you raise an interesting point. If those dudes at CERn are dead set on discovering supersymmetry and the Higgs, eventually they will declare that they did no matter what. I read somewhere that CERN will have a virtual monopoly on the interpretation of the data. If true, This is suspicios. Nothing wrong with protecting intellectual property. But this monopoly seems unscientific.

        <h3>
         the real costs of CERN and the LHC
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
         People be serious. CERN serves nearly the whole world judging from distribution of users, while it is yearly budget is that of a medium size European University (which have regularly much lower budgets alas then US ones). In fact CERN yearly budget is that of Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. Bergen is a city of ca 400 000 inhabitans if you count the suburbs. You do not close hospitals because they failed to find cure for cancer, did not protect you again swine flu and because new diagnostic centre took 10 years to build instead of 5. CERN provides nearly as much education as an University and excellent research . LHC is build largely within the budget, the loans taken are payed within the budget. CERN is one of the most efficient scientific institution worldwide.

          Well you raise an interesting point. If those dudes at CERn are dead set on discovering supersymmetry and the Higgs, eventually they will declare that they did no matter what. I read somewhere that CERN will have a virtual monopoly on the interpretation of the data. If true, This is suspicios. Nothing wrong with protecting intellectual property. But this monopoly seems unscientific.

           Unfortunately the LHC is only one of many large "tops-down" projects guided by the bureaucrats that channel funds to research that will "find" what the bureaucrats want discovered.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In January of 1961, the late U.S. President Eisenhower warned of the danger that public funds might destroy the integrity of science in his Farewell Address to the Nation:
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded" ["Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the Nation", January 17, 1961].

         It is saddening that the largest experiment hitherto in history might become so controversial. Each coin has two sides. The previous comments concentrate only on one, i.e. the vicious circle of public funding creating citation cartels and other scientific abberations (the "bath water"...). It is not too late to change course: To let true scientific discussion triumph, to allow scientists working on theories other than supersymmetry or black holes to do their research and speak freely in scientific conferences, to allow science journalists regain their credibility by reporting also on alternative theories instead of repeating endlessly the same old "supersymmetry or black hole" story. The arrogance with which these two alternatives are exclusively promoted in all fora by some powerful theorists before any experimental results sadly only reinforces some of the arguments appearing in this forum.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         However, this situation should not do injustice to CERN experimentalists: serious, hard working scientists doing their best to produce precious data (the "baby"...) that, when interpreted correctly, will make all humanity richer by revealing some of the most amazing secrets of our world: new elementary particles, new symmetries rendering our understanding of the fundamental structure of the universe more harmonic and maybe more unified. The value of such fundamental, invariant, universal, primordial, unique and rational understanding of our world is immeasurable. But it needs truly visionary leaders who understand these words, how else?, to be revealed.

         "Citation cartel"? What a beautiful way to put it. Only a year ago all the comments on articles re the LHC were positive and supportive.  The opinion wave has turned. The public lay people are speaking out and some physicists too. I think physics is the field where the public has the least confidence. In the past mathematics was a language that could not lie. If a scientist caMe forth with some calculation he was believed because we all knew mathematics cannot lie.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In recent decades we all dicovered that mathematics does lie. There have been massive amounts of theories about fundamental phyhsics. But like in that movie Highlander, there can be only one (true theory). So 99% of the stuff out there is pure unadulterated garbage, garbage paid for with tax money. The media seems to select only the high shock value stuff for publication. Is the Universe a giant membrane colliding with another?  . . . ahem . . . NO!.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The LHC was meant to cut through all the pollution and restore credibility to physics. That is why we all rooted for it. B ut the LHC seems to be failing. One after 20 years it still does not work. And two CERN seems to have jumped on the bandwagon promotiong all sorts of speculative stuff like supersymmetry. So it seems they will do science in reverse. Instead of trying to find out what happens at the TEV scale, they'll say we know it is susy now let's go and find some data supporting it.

         DISSENTING OPINIONS NEEDED

        <blockquote>
         I agree with John.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         What would be the value of a final report from CERN's LHC?  Does anyone honestly believe that all of the scientists employed there would agree on the interpretation of experimental data?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Scientific opinions of large research groups should, like U.S. Supreme Court decisions, include dissenting opinions.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In 2001, one hundred and seventy eight (178) scientists agreed that measurements at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory confirmed that solar neutrinos oscillate, the Standard Solar Model of H-filled stars is valid, and there is no deficiency of solar neutrinos.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Scientists that contributed as much to the same SNO project, but disagreed with these sweeping conclusions, had no publication to show for their efforts.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Without including dissenting opinions, the findings of large research groups are intrinsically weak.

         Time will prove that LHC will uncover new physics and that CERN is of great credibility. It is difficult to convince non -scientists or people who don't have an appreciation of the development of sciences about all the good things that they are doing at CERN. It takes time to produce reliable results about incredible discoveries. Look into the historical development of modern sciences, get a big picture of what is going on before jumping into conclusion. There are no flaws at CERN, only scientists working so dedicately while putting all the petty differences aside and coming together into discovering unknown physics which someday will benefit the society even more. I have the utmost respect for those people working at CERN and we are all in the process of facing new challenges and overcoming obstacles. Success is not a destination, it is a journey to follow.

         FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION OF IMMEASURABLE VALUE ?

         quote=sorinis] The value of such fundamental, invariant, universal, primordial, unique and rational understanding of our world is immeasurable. Really?  The value is immeasurable?

         <br/>
         Suppose the pipe dreams of the bureaucrats who direct research funds to LHC are fundamentally flawed?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         That was what we concluded from the rest mass data of the 3,000 types of atoms that constitute all matter in the visible universe [See: "Nuclear Wallet Cards" (Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Nuclear Data Center, Upton, NY, USA, 2000); "Attraction and repulsion of nucleons: Sources of stellar energy", Journal of Fusion Energy 19, 93-98 (2001); "Nuclear systematics: III. The source of solar luminosity", Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry 252, 3-7 (2002)].
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Fundamental information certainly has great value, but it does not necessarily come at great expense to those who are willing to work.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Anyone interested in "fundamental, invariant, universal, primordial, unique and rational" information about the world would do well to study rest mass data of the 3,000 types of atoms reported in Nuclear Wallet Cards.

         On the contrary. Success is a destination. You don't get a Nobel prize for just beeing in the field. Plus it is not true that it is difficult to convince non scientistsof the value of projects like the LHC. Last year when the LHC was suposedly starting the websites experienced a flood of hits and inquiries. I find this idea that non scientists do not understand the value of science quite hubristic and frankly insulting.

         It is easy to get people on board projects like the LHC.
         <br/>
         All you have to do is actually do science - as opposed to constanly repairing damage. In contrast it is next to impossible to get people on board with failed projects.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I think that if the LHC gets delayed past the October date, it is fair to say it is a failed project - yes despite its size complexity etc.

          Time will prove that LHC will uncover new physics and that CERN is of great credibility. It is difficult to convince non -scientists or people who don't have an appreciation of the development of sciences about all the good things that they are doing at CERN. It takes time to produce reliable results about incredible discoveries. Look into the historical development of modern sciences, get a big picture of what is going on before jumping into conclusion. There are no flaws at CERN, only scientists working so dedicately while putting all the petty differences aside and coming together into discovering unknown physics which someday will benefit the society even more. I have the utmost respect for those people working at CERN and we are all in the process of facing new challenges and overcoming obstacles. Success is not a destination, it is a journey to follow.

         The basic point is that the LHC will generate collisions at about seven times the energy of those reached by the Tevatron.  Regardless of any predictions, nonpredictions, disclaimers, or putative incompetence or ulterior motives, and also regardless of the undeniable fact that there are many other potentially worthwhile projects, it makes sense to investigate these higher levels of energy.

        <blockquote>
         I agree with Brian. LHC is a phenomenal project and the energy level is at the top. I think it is exciting to see what will be discovered next. The fact is that LHC will uncover new physics even if the Higg's Boson is not found. However, as a physicist for so many years and I have dealt with studying all that is going on at the LHC, I firmly believe that the Higg's Boson will be found, thus filling in the missing link within the standard model. There will be a lot more to discover in the many years to come at LHC as well as other space projects out there such as the JDEM, measuring the nature of dark energy. Lots of excitment out there in the world of physics and much to learn and to explore.

         The God Particle
        </h3>
        <blockquote>
         "And God said: Be light made. And light was made."
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Call it fairy tale (and definitely outside the scope of physics), but those awe-inspiring words from Genesis have been with us from time immemorial. Why not reconsider that immortal line, instead of the ever-in-conflict and now fast exiting Big Bang, as the first act of creation... of the light photon - the God particle?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Perfect and eternally indefatigable (worthy of godhead, or divine nature), each per-cycle quantum of the photon (common to all photons) is what I have named the RADIATON in this final perspective on the nature of things. Like the classic perfectly elastic body, the radiaton embodies mass and energy, intrinsically and absolutely, exchanging only momentum - and momentum alone - in any and all interactions.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Man today has no fundamental concept of mass (except the vague definition that the mass of a body is a measure of its inertia, where inertia is that property of matter which manifests itself as a resistance to any change in the motion of a body). So, why not just simply conceive and define here a dimensionless mass, m = 1; and energy, e = 1, for the radiaton - especially when it readily leads to the long-sought unification of physics from the subatomic to the cosmic? Do check out its one-page summary on: www.sittampalam.net/Summary.pdf. A synopsis is on: www.sittampalam.net/Synopsis.htm. If still curious to know where it all stands today, this latest letter might help: www.sittampalam.net/PresidentObama.pdf.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Going after the so-called Higgs boson, a typical fundamental nonentity, in the LHC or elsewhere is not only unscientific but also most unethical in the new light. But the big bucks involved will keep shrouding all that light only to the detriment of science. May sanity prevail for others, too, to pull out without further delay, realizing that CERN is [only] hampering scientific progress, not making it, as John Duffield comments above. Cheers all!

         "Let there be light, and there is light". Yes, I call it a complete fairy tale. Science is all about making progress and improvement, not a standstill like religion. "God particle" is not really a good term for the Higgs, but it's ok, for it shouldn't have any religious implications. I have no objection if people want to pull out from CERN. It is only their loss, but science will continue to flourish with or without them.

         I believe you are confusing the words "destiny" and "destination." I said success is the destination not destiny. But I understand your position. If success was defined as a journey that means you could spend a lifetime getting paid and not producing anything of value. In contrast, if success is defined as the destination, that means you have no success until you actually produced something. A result or a discvery etc. I believe you would want the first definition to apply perhaps because you find it difficult to besuccesful at your job.  I may be wrong.

          I am glad to know that Austria decided to stay with CERN. The Chancellor has made a good decision for he realizes LHC at CERN is long term perspective project. Good job.
         </blockquote>
         Yes, the stakes are higher now.  The Chancellor himself has made the decision.  What will he get for his investment?  See the new story:
