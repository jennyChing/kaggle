       Over forty years ago, researchers in the Soviet Union began an ambitious drilling project whose goal was to penetrate the Earths upper crust and sample the warm, mysterious area where the crust and mantle intermingle the
       <em>
        Mohorovii discontinuity
       </em>
       , or Moho. So deep is this area that the Russian scientists had to invent new ways of drilling, and some of their new methods proved quite inventive. But despite the valiant effort which spanned several decades, the Russians never reached their goal, and many of the Earths secrets were left undiscovered. The work done by the Soviets did, however, provide a plethora of information about what lies just beneath the surface, and it continues to be scientifically useful today. The project is known as the Kola Superdeep Borehole.
      </p>
      <div id="read-more-arrow">
       
      </div>
      <p>
       Beginning in 1962, the drilling effort was led by the USSRs
       <em>
        Interdepartmental Scientific Council for the Study of the Earths Interior and Superdeep Drilling
       </em>
       , which spent years preparing for the historic project. It was started in parallel to the Space Race, a period of intense competition between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. The survey to find a suitable drill site was completed in 1965 when project leaders decided to drill on the Kola Peninsula in the north-west portion of the Soviet Union. After five more years of construction and preparations, the drill began to nudge its way into the ground in 1970.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inside the projects 200-foot-tall enclosure resides a unique drilling apparatus. Most deep-drilling rigs use a rotating shaft to bore through the ground using a series of extensions which are incrementally added as the hole grows deeper but such a method was unworkable with a hole as deep as Kola was planned to be. To overcome this, the Russian researchers devised a solution where only the drill bit at the end of the shaft was rotated. They accomplished this by forcing the pressurized drilling mud the lubricant pumped down the drill shaft through the specially-designed drill bit to cause it to spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the deepest hole ever created by humankind lies beneath the tower enclosing Kolas drill. A number of boreholes split from the central branch, but the deepest is designated SG-3, a hole about nine inches wide which snakes over 12.262 kilometers (7.5 miles) into the Earths crust. The drill spent twenty-four years chewing its way to that depth, until its progress was finally halted in 1994, about 2.7 kilometers (1.7 miles) short of its 15,000-meter goal.
      </p>
      <figure class="align-left entry-image" style="width:280px;">
       <img alt="Core samples from 6 km below the surface" height="210" src="//cdn.damninteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/kola_cores_2.jpg" style="width:280px;max-height:210px;" title="Core samples from 6 km below the surface" width="280"/>
       <figcaption style="width:280px">
        Core samples from 6 km below the surface
       </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
       The Soviets drilling rig was designed such that core samples would be provided along the entire length of the drill shaft, providing researchers on the surface with an intimate look at the composition of the Earth as the drill ventured further downward. Before the superdeep borehole project was undertaken, practitioners of Geology had reached a number of conclusions regarding the Earths deep crust based on observations and seismic data. But as is often the case when humans venture into the unknown, Kola illustrated that certainty from a distance is no certainty at all, and a few scientific theories were left in ruin. One scientist was heard to comment, Every time we drill a hole we find the unexpected. Thats exciting, but disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the surprise of the researchers, they did not find the expected transition from granite to basalt at 3-6 kilometers beneath the surface. Data had long shown that seismic waves travel significantly faster below that depth, and geologists had believed that this was due to a basement of basalt. Instead, the difference was discovered to be a change in the rock brought on by intense heat and pressure, or
       <em>
        metamorphic rock
       </em>
       . Even more surprisingly, this deep rock was found to be saturated in water which filled the cracks. Because free water should not be found at those depths, scientists theorize that the water is comprised of hydrogen and oxygen atoms which were squeezed out of the surrounding rocks due to the incredible pressure. The water was then prevented from rising to the surface because of the layer of impermeable rocks above it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another unexpected find was a menagerie of microscopic fossils as deep as 6.7 kilometers below the surface. Twenty-four distinct species of plankton microfossils were found, and they were discovered to have carbon and nitrogen coverings rather than the typical limestone or silica. Despite the harsh environment of heat and pressure, the microscopic remains were remarkably intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russian researchers were also surprised at how quickly the temperatures rose as the borehole deepened, which is the factor that ultimately halted the projects progress. Despite the scientists efforts to combat the heat by refrigerating the drilling mud before pumping it down, at twelve kilometers the drill began to approach its maximum heat tolerance. At that depth researchers had estimated that they would encounter rocks at 100C (212F), but the actual temperature was about 180C (356F) much higher than anticipated. At that level of heat and pressure, the rocks began to act more like a plastic than a solid, and the hole had a tendency to flow closed whenever the drill bit was pulled out for replacement. Forward progress became impossible without some technological breakthroughs and major renovations of the equipment on hand, so drilling stopped on the SG-3 branch. If the hole had reached the initial goal of 15,000 meters, temperatures would have reached a projected 300C (572F).
      </p>
      <p>
       When drilling stopped in 1994, the hole was over seven miles deep (12,262 meters), making it by far the deepest hole ever drilled by humankind. The last of the cores to be plucked from from the borehole were dated to be about 2.7 billion years old, or roughly 32 million times older than
       <a href="http://www.abevigoda.com/">
        Abe Vigoda
       </a>
       . But even at that depth, the Kola project only penetrated into a fraction of the Earths continental crust, which ranges from twenty to eighty kilometers thick.

       Kola was not the first nor the last attempt at drilling a superdeep borehole, but it has been the most successful so far. In 1957 the United States embarked on a similar project dubbed Project Mohole, but that attempt to drill through the ocean floor was cancelled due to lack of funding. Today, the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Ocean_Drilling_Program">
        Integrated Ocean Drilling Program
       </a>
       seeks to penetrate the much thinner crust of the ocean floor to probe the Earths lower crust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Kola Superdeep Borehole is still a scientifically useful site, and research there is ongoing. The huge repository of core samples are housed at Zapolyarniy, about 10 kilometers south of the borehole. Today the site is managed by the
       <em>
        State Scientific Enterprise on Superdeep Drilling and Complex Investigations in the Earths Interior
       </em>
       as the
       <em>
        Deep Geolaboratory
       </em>

           The Mohorovii discontinuity has fascinated me ever since I first heard about it years ago.  To my knowledge, nobody has as yet really even hazarded a guess as to what it is, so heres my favorite crackpot theory: I think its a layer of ballbearings. I believe that the crust of the earth periodically slips, possibly because the built-up weight of ice on the poles, and dramatically reorients itself. That could explain the geologic records of the periodic flips in the earths magnetic pole (the pole doesnt change at all, just the orientation of all the rocks we study!), help explain why deep sea fossils are found on top of the highest mountains, and maybe even account for a great flood.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hey I said it was a crackpot theory!
          </p>
          <p>
           Next Ill explain why I believe the center of the earth is one gigantic, impure diamond, possibly the size of the moon. :-)

           I wonder if its possible to use the earths core(heat) as an energy source.  It would be great, every country would have access to it. I was hoping the article would talk about that possibility.

           Ya, Iceland is a big user of geothermal energy. The US also has some geothermal plants, but I dont think were at the point (or that desperate, Matrix anyone :P) where we can drill deep holes into the earth and use the heat energy from the core effeciently. It would probably end up permanently damaging the Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
           The problem isnt finding geothermal vents, its finding the big ones that can econimally feasible.
           <br/>
           I did some travel a few years ago in the Himalayas and a Sikh temple there uses a small geothermal vent to cook all the food. Basically the steam is used instead of gas, works great, as long as you dont fall in. There was that distinct mineral smell all over the place though, like the smell you find at big mine sites.

           Highly unlikely.  Geothermal energy is just repackaged solar energy that is concentrated in one place.

           Geothermal energy comes from water coming to contact with magma and being super heated and rising to the surface in geysers. A geothermal plant places generators at the vents and the steam spins the turbines to create electricity.

           I just wonder, if they had dug deep enough, it might have eased the path for a potential Volcano provoking it to erupt and finding no difficulty breaking through the remaining untouched Crust!!! Dont You Think??

           It would be like literally watching a REAL Volcano movie!!!

           I highly doubt President Boris Yeltsin at that time (1994) could have done what Tommy Lee Jones did to save America :)

           Especially after Yeltsins embarrassing situation with the Irish Prime Minister when he overslept in his flight missing out a very important meeting with the Irish party ;) LOL

           No its not. Its leftovers from the collision energies from the early solar system, when the Earth formed and got hit with other small planetesimals. Another cause is radioactive decay, which releases energy.

           A mid 60s movie, Crack in the World, was the story of just such a project, and the disaster that followed. Very shmaltzy, but fun to watch. I show it to my geology class while discussing Project Mohole.

            But as is often the case when humans venture into the unknown, Kola illustrated that certainty from a distance is no certainty at all, and a few scientific theories were left in ruin. One scientist was heard to comment, Every time we drill a hole we find the unexpected. Thats exciting, but disturbing.

            middlenamefrank said: The Mohorovii discontinuity has fascinated me ever since I first heard about it years ago. To my knowledge, nobody has as yet really even hazarded a guess as to what it is, so heres my favorite crackpot theory: I think its a layer of ballbearings. I believe that the crust of the earth periodically slips, possibly because the built-up weight of ice on the poles, and dramatically reorients itself. That could explain the geologic records of the periodic flips in the earths magnetic pole (the pole doesnt change at all, just the orientation of all the rocks we study!), help explain why deep sea fossils are found on top of the highest mountains, and maybe even account for a great flood.

           All that time, all that money  these damn scientists STILL dont know their ass from a hole in the ground!  After all those years of hard work and they ended up getting shafted!  Talk about throwing money into a bottomless pit!

           This is curious  Id never heard of this, and its interesting (DAMNED Interesting!) stuff.  Im rather curious about it myself: by scale, nine and a half miles deep on the Earth seems like the thickness of a sheet of paper, but the temp was expected to be 573 degrees.  Were just floating around on this little sheet of rock, surfing the magma.  Boggling stuff for my puny brain.

           No big surprises about the Mole People, though.  Mean spirited bastards, they are.

           You must be kidding me. China is right below Russia. The opposite side of Russia would be the US. Also, China was a valuable communist ally of the Soviets during the cold war.

           happened because of ideaology and attitude differences between Mao and Kruschev. This continued until the collapse of the Soviet Union, and consequently, the end of the cold war.

           Yup, thats the great thing about science, its not dogma and it knows it.  Scientific hypotheses are continuously tested, and are ultimately kept, modified, or overturned due to objective evidence.  Bad hypotheses are not clung to in the face of facts, because the built-in error checking methods of testing and verifying claims constantly improve the accuracy of science over time by replacing old hypotheses that dont fit the evidence anymore with new ones that do.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember, it took lots of scientific research and tons of work to overturn the old hypotheses mentioned in this article, and that effort produced more accurate hypotheses to replace the old ones and a better understanding of our world.
           <i>
            That
           </i>
           is the triumph of science.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sure, science isnt perfect, but its the best thing weve found so far for figuring out how things really work.

           Of course you can. You just need a really big spoon and a backpack full of poptarts. You just wouldnt go through the center of the earth to do it. You might go through the center of a jail cell however.

           I think the theory of the Mole people can be pushed aside now that we know its 180 degrees celcius at only 12km below the surface.

          <p>
           If rock flows like melted plastic at only 12+km, i dont believe there would be any need to go further, obviously its just going to be flowing rock below.

           Perhaps the mole people themselves also devised inventive new methods for drilling?
          </p>
          <p>
           There is also another theory yet to be advanced.  In Doctor Who, c1970 (Jon Pertwee as the Doctor), there was an attempt to do this exact thing.   The slimy ooze from the drilling turned people into Primords.    This was the first episode that I ever saw.

           I agree with Jack Starr. Why would anyone want to dibble dabble with complicated units like 10? 10mm = 1cm,  10cm = 1dm, 10 dm = 1 meter  my head is just spinning!! I mean cmon, if someone asked you: how far is the bush from the fence?, why would you want to spend hours calculating it in metrics and saying Its 105 centimeters, when you can say its 3.444882 feetor 1.148294 yardor 41.338584 inches?

           As stated by CptPicard this is not true. Geothermal energy is derived in part from the original accretional energy of the earth from the primordial disc and mostly from radioactive decay of elements within the core and mantle (dont worry  you are not about to develop a healthy green glow).  Geothermal energy is a very real possibility for many regions of the earth  even such stable contintents as Australia. There has recently been a drilling campaign in South Australia to drill holes up to 6km depth to tap very high temperatures due to a high geothermal gradient (the crust generally increases in temperature as you go deeper by a roughly constant gradient known as the geothermal gradient, which in some places is higher than others) in that area for power generation.

           This would have too many hazards to mention and would not achieve the aim that the Russians had. They wanted to sample some of the upper mantle or moho. A volcano has mantle or molten crust that has undergone various crystallisation episodes and assimilated other rocks that it lies within which generally eradicate the character of the original rock. However there was recently a drilling campaign in Japan to test the internal workings of Mt Unzen which also aimed at sampling some of the volcanos magma.

          </p>
          <p>
           This information is derived from seismic analysis of the earth.  Seismic waves behave differently in solids and liquids. Solids conduct both pressure and shear waves while liquids only conduct pressure waves. By having a network of seismic stations around the world and observing strong seismic events ( earthquakes) and recording what types of waves arrive at each station you can observe how deep the solid (crust) part of the earth extends. Most oceanic crust is less than 20km thick while some continental crust under large mountain ranges may be more than 100km thick.
          </p>
          <p>
           A very interesting article and enlightening to read now  when I was a secondary school student I was told about this drillhole and was informed that if they had gone one or two km deeper they would have tapped the upper mantle, causing a massive explosion resulting in a huge volcanic eruption. The reality it seems is far from that dramatic story.

           Depends on what you mean by permanently damaging the Earth. In some places you dont have to do much digging, and youre not going to start a volcano or anything. And in geologic time, virtually nothing is permanent.

           actually, it is all quite cool down below, but the mole people dont want you to know that, so they simply heated the drill bit. this fooled the soviet scientists and they withdrew! else, we would be all holidaying there now. ;)

           Perhaps check out the antipodes on Google Earth.  Hey, wasnt there an article here on DI some time ago about the theoretical hole through the Earth transportation system?  Drop a package in the hole and a few hours later it drifts to the surface on the other side of the earth? Air resistance notwithstanding, of course.

           I am proud that the Soviet aspect of my 5th-grade report about Project Mohole (a US venture) has been recognized (unofficially) and that the story evolved into this fine article. (I did not mention the Soviets in my report, except that they were in the race.)

           The space program and Vietnam were too expensive for the US government to continue its digging adventure.

           I saw an article this morning announcing an expedition to study the Earths mantle where it is actually exposed along the mid-Atlantic ridge. This was the first I had ever heard of the mantle being exposed.  They dont know if the crust has somehow been removed from that location or if the crust hasnt formed as it typically would when the tectonic plates diverge.

           I saw that too, David and it seems way cool and a lot more practical as far as observing and obtaining core samples than drilling to china or summoning balrogs or Mole people.. another link to the actual project website is here

           Re: comment #46 by Reader  How do they know ( twenty to eighty kilometers thick ) if they cant even drill that deep

           There is lots of indirect evidence for whats below our feet. A major technique is seismology ie: observing the way sound moves through the earth. The sound is generated either by earthquakes or by human made explosions or vibrator trucks (vibroseis).
          </p>
          <p>
           The sound waves are reflected &amp; refracted where the sound speed in the rocks changes &amp; by setting geophones on the earths surface to record the sound a lot can be deduced about how the sound speed varies in the earth. The Mohorovicic discontinuity is where the sound speed increases abrubutly &amp; is considered to be the base of the crust.
          </p>
          <p>
           For more detail use wikipedia or google to look up seismology &amp; mohorovicic.

           Seismology is based on displacement and movement of material, not sound. Sound is the basis of Sonar and the like. You get P and S-waves depending upon horizontal vs vertical displacement, but that gets into some pretty hairy theoretical seismo.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Moho represents a compositional barrier, considered to be the crust-mantle barrier. The Crust, Mantle, and Core are divided by their compositional make-up, and these boundaries are distinguished by alteration of seismic wave speeds. The Moho is where wave velocity kicks up tremendously, due to increased density of the further-down rocks and minerals.
          </p>
          <p>
           Drilling of these boreholes wouldnt provoke volcanism due to quite a number of factors. Firstly is size. Poking something smaller than a pinhole on the scale of a countryside is hardly going to be the cause of a massive eruption. Second, you need to have the hole positioned over a magma plume, and as far as I know, Russia isnt exactly famous for its volcanoes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Geoscientists know the thickness of crust (both continental and oceanic) thanks once again to seismic readings. The seismic speeds of crust vs mantle are rather different, and there is a very noticeable jump in wave velocity once it punches through the compositional barrier.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also, Geothermal energy relies off of the radiation of the Earths heat. As you get deeper into the planet, the geothermal gradient goes up, meaning that it gets hotter with depth. Many houses nowadays (its catching on within the states) rely on this for efficient heating, as it serves at an exhaust for the Earths heat. It isnt harmful to the environment, and is akin to poking a toothpick into a piping hot baked-potato.

           Re comment 63:

           I think youre getting a bit incorrectly pedantic in saying that seismic waves arent sound. P waves in solids are exactly the same thing as sound in fluids. The additional possibility of S (shear) waves makes seismology more complex than sonar, but still its an elaboration rather than something essentially different.

           Where oil came from  It may have come from decaying organic matter. But there are many problems with this theory. Not the least of which is that theres far too much of it to have come from all the dead lifeforms which have existed on the planet until now.

           Im sure the Russians would much rather have been able to dig a hole to the U.S. into Russia- cant you just see that, the Russians jumping down this hole all the way through the earth to come out on the other side and attack us?

           My darling friends, you could row to Russia from the US in couple of hours!  Geographicaly there is only about 12 miles between the US Eastern border and Russias N.Western border.

            camilos said: I wonder if its possible to use the earths core(heat) as an energy source. It would be great, every country would have access to it. I was hoping the article would talk about that possibility.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           Actually we are already doing that to a great extent, just not QUITE how would be expected. I worked on a geothermal drilling rig for abut a yeardirtiest, most fun, &amp; most physically demanding job Ive ever had. (EVERYTHING is heavy.not 100 lbs heavy, but 500 lbs heavy)
          </p>
          <p>
           We drilled a certain # of holes, to a certain depth (both determined by engineers, comparing soil quality &amp; building size). A typical 3,000 sq. ft. house would usually require about 3 or 4-300 ft holes. In each of these went a PVC loop, permanently entombed in Bentonite, and then all loops were tied together so you just had 2 ends.intake &amp; output.
          </p>
          <p>
           This was hooked to a closed loop water system, which ran through a type of heat pump unit.only the heat pump wasnt the big condenser you see humming like crazy outside in the summer.it was water circulating underground, transferring its heat or cold into the earth.
          </p>
          <p>
           This set-up is initially expensive, maybe $10,000 for the above size, but after that, all you really have to pay for is the electricity to operate the water pump &amp; a fan system in the building..cheap heating &amp; cooling, and it REALLY works.
          </p>
          <p>
           We helpe install these systems on dozens of houses, several large schools, a couple of mansions, &amp; even a swimming pool or two, to keep the water warm. Hard to describe the technical workings, but they really work well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its just a matter of time before some genius figures out how to ue these same SHALLOW wells to generate power, rather than drillng DEEP to tap into actual heat from the Earth.

           What?
          </p>
          <p>
           You say there are Balrogs down here?
          </p>
          <p>
           Well I think I better go to China.  I dont think that it is anywhere near Moria and it seems to be the place that everyone is trying to get to.
          </p>
          <p>
           But, then again, you were talking about Dwarves in Moria and, from what I heard, the Chinese arent very tall.  Its all a bit worrying.
          </p>
          <p>
           It may be that I am in deep trouble from the Balrogs.  Either that or people on the surface should be more TRUTHFUL in what they write in their e-mails so as not to scare us poor mole people.  We dont get the chance to get on the internet that often so when I do I dont think its very nice of you to frighten us like that.
          </p>
          <p>
           P.S. Please stop all the drilling.  Thats the thing that seems to have started all the problems in the first place.

           In order to utilize geothermal sources of energy, you have to pump cold water into the reservoir to get hot water out of it.  You could run pipes through the reservoir and pump cold water through the pipes to suck heat out.  However, this is technologically hard to pull off. (How do you get all those pipes down there?)  If you simply pump water down into the heat reservoir and pump hot water out, the water is often filled with toxic or corrosive contaminants.  Its not as great as it sounds.  Geothermal is too expensive to be considered viable for most countries, otherwise power companies would be using it.  The bottom line is that its too expensive to go after and probably will be for centuries to come.

           Think about it.  The American monetary system is based on the metric system.

           Why? Because its easy to understand!

           Also, considering that the worlds only superpower comprises only about 5% of the worlds population and is alone in rigidly adhering to an outmoded, antiquated system of measures, temperatures, and weights while most other countries have adopted the metric system as being easier, more practical, and more beneficial all round, the idea that its the remaining 95% of the worlds population thats somehow being ridiculous is  well  ridiculous.

           PS.  I think you meant country, not county.  Every Third World country is still a country.

           Would it be possible to use some kind of air pressure rather than a drill to do the drilling considering the rocks deep in the crust resemble plastic? It could possibly be an air cannon that shoots from afar to avoid coming up with material to withstand 572 Fahrenheit. It would have to have a large amount of power of course After makes a hole deep enough it could launch a grappling hook to pull up fossils and other good stuff for scientists to study or reverse the air cannon to make a mega power vacuum (had to add the dreamy fiction at the end)

           Jack Starr does have an extremely valid point.
          </p>
          <p>
           The GDP of the United States (a GDP that is produced utterly within the framework of the non-metric system), is VASTLY ahead of any other nation in the world. That fact alone reflects immeasurable merit for the old system. Im in the UK here, and we lament the changeover. The UK was the richest country in the world up until WWII. Now our economy is behind the US, Japan and even Germany. We began changing over from the imperial system in the 1970s.

           dear intellectual-bonobo hybrid.  i love your name.  are you sexually promiscuous?  im sorry, i got off-topic.  i believe you are correct that not all petroleum is derived from fossil dinosaur remains.  what you refer to is called the abiogenic theory of the origin of petroleum.  it was popular among soviet geologists but has since been discredited.  however a more recent exploration of it can be found in a fascinating book titled the deep hot biosphere by a man named Gold.  it may be that the deeper layers of the earths crust are teeming with extremophile life forms, as you suggested in your post.  you might be interested in the wikipedia article:

           Aloha to you Brother Jebadiah, I dont want to change the cool subject here so I wont BUT I will respond to your statement that you say that, Nowhere in the Bible does it say that Hell is below the Earths surface. I need to let you know that it does. If you are interested let me know.  I just wanted to respond without getting into a whole different discussion and stirring things up. On a different topic we have geothermal here on the Island of Hawaii and I believe it supplies about 10% of our needs, perhaps more?

           Actually, more heat in the earth is made from friction and pressure than from radiation. Hell isnt below the earths surface, and yes Id like to hear where it says that. The measurement system in the US makes more sense than the metric system because it was made for a base-12 number system. Base 12 is far more stable and workable than base 10. This is because instead of just the numbers 2 and 5 that fit into the base, you have 2, 3, 4, and 6. Thats twice as many! Multiplying is easy as pie with base 12. Speaking of which, which do you think Mole People like; apple or pumpkin pie? I need to offer 42 pies as sacrifice to appease them, and I dont want to make them angry.

           Imperial Units use base 12? Lets see
           <br/>
           Length:
           <br/>
           1 foot = 12 inches  OK so far
           <br/>
           1 yard = 3 feet  not exactly twelve but a part thereof
           <br/>
           1 mile = 1.760 yards  1.760/12=146,66 Meep!
          </p>
          <p>
           Lets move on to mass
           <br/>
           1 pound = 16 ounces  Nope, no 12 in there.
           <br/>
           1 stone = 14 pounds  Nope, nor here either.
           <br/>
           1 quarter = 28 pounds  Nope.
           <br/>
           1 ton = 2.240 pounds (2.240/12=186,66) Nope.
          </p>
          <p>
           Maybe volume?
           <br/>
           1 pint = 20 ounces  Nope.
           <br/>
           1 quart = 2 pints or 40 ounces  Nope.
           <br/>
           1 gallon = 8 pints or 160 ounces  Nope.
          </p>
          <p>
           OK, as we can see the only relation in Imperial measurements that uses a factor of twelve is that between inches and feet. All others are more or less arbitrary. Now to the claim, that it is easy as pie to multiply numbers in base 12. Lets see you work out the solution to the following little problem without use of pen and paper (A=10, B=11):
           <br/>
           10A X 26
           <br/>
           If you can do that, you understand enough about mathematics that you wouldnt make such a claim. It is not simple to calculate in base 12, because we are all accustomed to use base ten and for everything else we need to adjust. Im not saying its impossible to become quite good at it with practice  many people can read binary pretty easily. But base12 is something I guess few people ever use.

           Ok, just wanted to clear a lot of things up.
           <br/>
           The Bible (which when referred to is capitalized regardless of your religion but because it is a book) does state that hell is down. Of course from an American perspective this can be quite confusing because what we consider up  the Chinese consider down.so maybe it is symbolic? However, the conditions found when going down far enough might be another symbolism for what Hell might be like?
           <br/>
           Another religious fact that someone mentioned early on in these posts was The Flood. It has been questioned where the wellsprings of the deep are that could have helped flood the world that the Bible mentioned. I found it interesting to see that water (or equivalent volumes of hydrogen/oxygen) were found in the rocks when they dug deep  just food for thought
           <br/>
           There was a scientist who put out the theory that oil is regenerated from something within the crust of the earth and therefore there was a perpetual supply. (maybe one of the links someone listed pointed to this theory  Im both too lazy and limiting my Internet traversing because Im not at home). An interesting theory that might coincide with the micro-organisms found deep in the crust.
           <br/>
           Metric vs Imperial measuring system  I blame the British!
           <br/>
           As far as damaging the earth by drilling a hole  thats pretty audacious to think that we as humans have that much control. We dont! We cant stop volcanoes, we cant stop the movement of techtonic plates, whatever hole we dig, will eventually be filled back in by acts of nature. God made it that way and he is in control, and if you look at the long history of the earth  you will know this  because God set up the laws that cause the acts of nature. Whoever said, digging a hole would damage the earth has watched way too much TV and suscribed to the media propaganda way too much.

           Oh I cannot wait for the day when MANKIND will drop the useless PC nonsense and go back to proper terminologies. Great article though. I had a feeling that it would get hotter as it drilled down but that would only make sense since it is believed that there is a molten core here on Earth.

           As far as damaging the earth by drilling a hole  thats pretty audacious to think that we as humans have that much control. We dont! We cant stop volcanoes, we cant stop the movement of techtonic plates, whatever hole we dig, will eventually be filled back in by acts of nature. God made it that way and he is in control, and if you look at the long history of the earth  you will know this  because God set up the laws that cause the acts of nature. Whoever said, digging a hole would damage the earth has watched way too much TV and suscribed to the media propaganda way too much.

           Actually we caused an earth quake when water was pumped into a fault meeting magma created steam pressure. As far as God goes we he left us the will to destroy ourselves if we choose. I Love God! Dont you?

           Hi I am a geologist just wanted to comment on a very common misconception: that the Earths mantle is molten.  In fact it is solid crystalline rock all the way down to the core-mantle boundary, the rock is hot and deformable due to the extreme pressure(hence it will flow) but it is not a liquid.  Magma only occurs at places where there is an influx of water such as subduction zones which lowers the melting temperature of rocks, or in places where upward motion causes decompression melting such as mantle plumes.  Anyway the crust as a whole is not underlain by magma.  we know this because both P and S-waves will propagate through the mantle, and S-waves will not pass through liquid.  so there is no danger of magma coming up the borehole because there is no magma down there.

           to all you people who go lol or lmao about this alternative energy sources are messed up nuts go check your selfs in to the physc ward. there is many energy  sources other then oil and yes as long as we did not drill to the core of the earth [the earth would go super nova] we could use geothermal heat and many other sources.

           Ive worked as a land surveyor here in the U.S.  Basically, theyre the people who drive stakes in the ground to show constructions crews where to build things.  In order to show distances/etc smaller than a foot, they break the foot down into tenths and hundredths of a foot.  There are no inches.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thats right, in our steadfast avoidance of all things metric, we ironically break feet down to base 10.  I could show you what a tenth looks like between two fingers much more easily than I could show you a centimeter.  Yeah, I know.  Yep.

           Has anyone done the math on how much heat is being released into the atmosphere.  Volcanoes are pimples compared to these.  These are more on a par with impact craters.  Perhaps impact craters do not release volcanic mayhem as is usually described as dinosaur killers.  Perhaps they just dig deep holes in the crust and let heat out steadily but surely.  In total BTUs, how does this giant hole (holes?) we dug compare to the temperatures needed to start a big green house problem?  Does the timing of these deep man made holes line up with the global warming record in the ice core studies.  Easy questions to make up, I know.  But did someone at least demonstrate that these holes could not possibly contribute to, much less cause, the global warming of the last several decades?  100 degree plastic rock sounds significant to me.

           Im surprised at the temperatures.  The geothermal gradient in this area would need to be pretty low to only have 180C at 12.75 km.  And believe me, it would need to be much hotter than this to have drilling problems due to plasticity of the rock.  The Icelanders just drilled into magma (liquid rock) and they had very little trouble until that happened.  The temperature was over 450C. They drilled into magma at the Puna geothermal project as well and again they had no drilling problems until just before they hit it.  We are working on a geothermal project in a well that has over 325C at the bottom and there was no problem with plasticity of the rock.  We run mud motors as was described in this well at temperatures over 250C.

           Over 44 TW of heat energy escapes from the earths surface into the atmosphere annually.  The planet wide energy consumption is about 11 TW.  This energy is not from the sun nor does it come from pressure. It comes from heat given off by radioactive decay of elements in the rocks making up the planet.  There are hot spots, of course, where the crust is thin. The mid-ocean ridges and rift zones as well as the Basin and Range have this thin crust.  Some extra heat is given off by friction between moving pieces of the crust but this isnt a big piece of the heat budget of the planet.

           Geothermal power in the Hawaiian Islands comes from one project at Puna on the Big Island which supplies about 25 MW.  Thats about 20% of the Big Island power consumption but only about 2% of the state consumption.
