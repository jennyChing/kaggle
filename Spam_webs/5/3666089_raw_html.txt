    Although we love the Alaskan Malamute, not everyone is suited to the breed. We hope to provide sufficient information about Alaskan Malamutes throughout our website (or to refer you to other sites containing information) that will enable you to make an informed decision whether to adopt an Alaskan Malamute as a member of your family. It is imperative that the puppy you select SHARES your happiness about the commitment you've made in selecting an Alaskan Malamute as your lifelong companion and grows to become a healthy and well-behaved member of your family.

                  The Alaskan Malamute was recognized for AKC registration in 1935 andis one of the oldest Arctic sled dogs -named after the native Innuit tribe called Mahlemuts, who settled along the shores of Kotzebue Sound in the upper western part of Alaska. The Mahlemuts are believed to have developed the breed to pull sleds and as a pack animal.

                  Alaskan Malamutes are athletic dogs who love the outdoors, but,also thrive as house pets. Alaskan Malamutes are patient with children,however, theyshould always be supervised during play with small children. The Alaskan Malamute is an affectionate, friendly dog - not a "one man" dog, but a lovingcompanion who LOVES to play.

                  The Alaskan Malamute requires regular exercise to maintain optimum health. We recommend a large, fenced yard (

                   minimum
                  </u>

If you are the athletic type, your Alaskan Malamute will make a great running partner. If you are the woodsy-type, your Alaskan Malamute may be trained to carry a back pack and will love wandering the woods and countryside with you!

           While a puppy is playful and adorable, a puppy represents agreater responsibility in terms of housebreaking and training. Only you can determine whether your lifestyle and/or homeenvironment is best suited for a puppy or an adult dog. If you are the least bit hesitant about your ability (or degree of patience) to properly train apuppy, please check our website for the availability of an older Alaskan Malamute. We've been asked on only a few occasions tofind a replacement home for a puppy purchased from us and, then only because the family'scircumstances had changed dramatically and they could no longer keep the pup. Sometime back, we were able to place three (3)adult Alaskan Malamutes whose owner had closed his kennel. In each instance, we wereable to locatenew homes nearby relatively quickly.

          If we don't have an adult Alaskan Malamute available for adoption, contact an Alaskan Malamute rescue organization about adopting an older Alaskan Malamute. Often, older Malsareplaced for adoption merely because, for one reason or another,their owner(s) can no longer care for them. There will likely be an "adoption fee," however, a reputable rescue organization will have had the dog spayed/neutered (if not already spayed/neuteredupon placement with the organization) andits shots will be current. In most instances,those persons within the organization will have had an opportunity tointeractwiththe dogandwill be able toplace the rightadult dog in your home (once your interests and home environment are known, i.e., whether you have small children, other pets, etc.).

         subtitle under "Kennel Operation." It has been our experience that the Alaskan Malamute learns very quickly, however,possesses a short attention span (bores easily). I regard the Alaskan Malamute as a perpetual teenager - the Mal KNOWS what you want him to do, he just sometimes doesn't want to heed your instruction! We have found that training is best kept to 15-20 minute intervals, but, that training "sessions" may take place as often as you have time. Commands should be kept simple, i.e., "sit", "down", "walk", or "stay," and
         <b>
          must be consistent
         </b>
         . The use of hand signals together with verbal commands is recommended as well.

      </p>
      <p align="justify">
       <font face="times new roman,times" size="3">
        The Alaskan Malamute is extremely eager to please and, therefore, it is important that your puppy/dog is praised vigorously when he/she obeys your commands. Personally, weuse treats as a training tool only occasionally andonly in the beginning. We prefer the praise method (to ensure compliance with commands inthose instances when treats are unavailable).

         A majority of our adult dogs were purchased as puppies and became accustomed to other pets (particularly, cats)at a young agewhile housedin our home. Since they now reside in outside pens, we have noted that, while inside the house, thedogs pay little attention tothe house cats and make no move to harm the cats. Nevertheless,when the dogs are permitted to run our fenced yard, they areclosely supervised - a small animal of any kind running across the yard becomes fair game when 2 or more Malsare running loose. We tend to make certain that our outdoorcats are on the exteriorof the fence before releasing the dogs from their pens into the yard.

          ther pets are not a problem with the Alaskan Malamute PROVIDED he/she is introduced and socialized at an early age.

          Canine Companions.
         </i>
        </b>
        When considering a canine companion for your Alaskan Malamute, such companionsshould be non-aggressive by nature and it is preferable that such companions be comparable in size,temperament and level of energy. Additionally, because the Alaskan Malamute tends to be same-sex aggressive, future canine companions should be the opposite sex of your Alaskan Malamute and it is best to introduce "companions" within the first year of age ("visitors" generally don't share living space, attention, etc.). Also, canine companions must not be food-aggressive ... Alaskan Malamutes are not adverse to eating from another's bowl!

          Introductions to feline companions must be done at an early age! This is especially true if your cats have not been declawed! Most of our Alaskan Malamutes were acquired as puppies and were introduced to cats immediately ... we've neverhad an problem with ourMals' interaction with cats. However, a couple of our Mals were acquired as adults and had not been socialized with cats previously. When they come upon one of our barn cats,they will stand and wait for thecat to run, then, give chase.So, their interaction with the cats is closely supervised. We don't encourage our "barn cats" to become too comfortable with our Mals only because the cats must maintain their sense of self-preservation - living in the country as we do, our outdoor cats often find themselves confronting coyotes, bobcats, and other wild animals that will feed on domesticated pets with ease.

          Alaskan Malamutes are fine with children, but, because of the Mal'ssize, interaction with small children should be closely supervised. Again, introduction to children should be done at an early age. It is equally important that children be taught to be kind and respectful ... a "bad experience" is traumatic for both the child and the Mal - and neither may recover fully from the experience!

           Shedding.

         </b>
         While our dogs were housed indoors, we found that the shedding was easily controlled by a daily brushing. Since our dogs have taken up residence in outdoorpens, they tend to shed profusely - especially in SpringAND late-summer (during the Spring, the loose undercoat is recycled - a small pile left in the pen soon becomes the material of which birds' and squirrels' nests are made)! I use a "rake" to reach the undercoat and comb the dogs thoroughly. We have found that the addition of a liquid supplement "Dyne"atopthe dogs' food once daily, aids in preventing excessive shedding and, together with a daily Doc Roy's Derma CoatCare tablet,keeps the coat full and glossy. Thankfully,most of our dogs relishthe individual attention given during a brushing!

        Because our dogs' pens are located in the woods (and because our dogs love to catch squirrels), it is necessary that we spray our pens every 6 weeks (depending upon the amount of rain we've had) with

        is an EXCELLENT flea/tick repellent. As for bathing, our vet shared his secret ... Dawn dishwashing liquid. It cleans thoroughly without drying the coat, leaves a clean, fresh scent and, although it is NOT a flea/tick repellant, itKILLS fleas and ticks. So, we use Dawn when bathing our puppies and our adult dogs. Thankfully, all of our dogs LOVE baths, except Apollo - he opines that water is for drinking, nothing else!

                  Canine hip dysplasia is a developmental orthopedic disease. When a dog has hip dysplasia, it has an abnormal development of the ball-in-socket joint that makes up the hip. In a dysplatic hip, the ball (the head of the femur, or thighbone) and the socket (the acetabulum, a portion of the pelvis) do not fit together snugly.

                PennHIP is a multifaceted radiographic technology (x-ray) for hip evaluation.It consists of 3 separate radiographs: the distraction view, the compression view and the hip-extended view. More importantly, for breeders striving to enhance their breed and eliminate hereditary defects, the PennHIP method is proven capable of estimating the susceptibility for CHD in dogs as young as

                I cannot stress enough that "ordinary" x-rays are inadequate in diagnosinghip dysplasia, especially in young dogs under one (1) year of age. In the younger dog, bones and muscles are still developing and growing ... the younger dog is more active and, thus, more prone to an injury that is sometimes neithereasily observable or incapacitating. Care should be exercised during the first 18 months of your Alaskan Malamute's growth to ensure that his/her "infrastructure" fully matures and can support both his/her weight and level of activity.

                Hip dysplasia is a genetic disease and, thus, it would seem that the solution to alleviating the disease would be to, first, refrain from breeding two dysplastic dogs. However, the difficulty in preventing hip dysplasia is that not all dogs with hip dysplasia will show signs of the disease. Thus, many seemingly normal dogs are bred together and hip dysplasia is kept within the gene pool.

                There is good news, however! The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFFA) has recently published its findings following several years of evaluating the Alaskan Malamute for hip dysplasia, among other orthopedic ailments. Of 12,720 evaluations, the OFFA has determined 87.5% of those evaluated were "normal".

                Environmental and nutritional factors also play a role in hip dysplasia among those progeny from breeding pairs OFFA-certified clear of hip dysplasia. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of both arthritis and hip dysplasia. Dog food that has been over-supplemented with extra proteins, vitamins and minerals to make puppies grow faster can create orthopedic problems in large breed dogs that may lead to hip dysplasia and arthritis. Dogs fed a calorie-limited diet will reach the same adult size as their overfed counterparts more slowly, but, with a considerably reduced likelihood of developing arthritis or hip dysplasia. Large breed puppies should be fed a pet food especially formulated for large breed puppies.
