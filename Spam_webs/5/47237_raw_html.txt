     arenting through divorce will require each parent to relate in a different way with the other parent. 
Developing a new sense of objectivity about your ex-spouse as a parent can be difficult.  This is especially true in cases where there was a lot of bad or difficult feelings 
prior to the divorce. It is helpful to remember that what you have in common now is your interests in the health and well-being of your children.

     he issues that were alive in your marriage must seep into the background when dealing in the here and now about your children. If you find yourself overwhelmed with 
feelings of bitterness, hurt, anger, or jealously, you will probably want to deal with these on your own with your support system or a good therapist. Instead you want to 
cultivate a desire and ability to concern yourself with the health and well-being of your children. If you are able to put difficult feelings aside and deal with them 
appropriately on your own, you are more likely to focus on the strengths of the other parent and what positive attributes they bring to their relationship with your children.
