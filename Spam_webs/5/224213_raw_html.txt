        The use of texts has made it easier for guys to get what they want from girls without having to work very hard. While some guys are experts when it comes to the use of texts to impress girls, some really suck. Girls are all about feelings and this is what should be exploited if you want to win her heart just by texting. You should not waste your time texting her about things she is not interested in. Figure out what she really likes and use it to get her to like you. Here are the 7 quality tips on how to text a girl you like;
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         1. Choose the right time to text her
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        To get the most out of your texts, you should always text at the right time. Texting her when she is busy will make her feel like she is being bugged. Since your goal is to make her feel excited when she receives your texts, text her when she is not occupied. Know her routine so that you can text her when you know she will be able to text you back. If she is comfortable with night time texting, take advantage. There is usually something romantic when texting her as she slips into the bed. After figuring out the right time to text her, do it every day. If you make her anticipate for you texts, then you are just a few steps away from making her fall for you.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         2. Use short and simple texts
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Keeping the texts short will help keep the conversation going for a long time. You do not have to tell her everything in one text. Since you just met her for the first time keep the texts simple and casual. Short texts help you to keep her attention for long as she strives to know more about you. With her phone beeping all the time, she will not get bored. Avoid drafting a long text message because it takes time and she might be bored as she waits for you to respond.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         3. Ensure that you start the conversations with warm and simple lines
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The way you start your conversations with the girl you like determines how the conversations will go. A warm simple line will make her want to respond, and if she is busy she will definitely continue with the conversation some other time. If she does not like the way you started a conversation, she might ignore your texts. Therefore the first text you send her should make her want to continue with the conversation. If she has nothing against the use of emoticons, you can as well use them to start conversations. You must also not overuse the emoticons.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         4. Flirting is good, but do not flirt with her all the time
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Flirt with her when you get the opportunity. But you must keep in mind that flirting all the time is boring. She needs to know that you are interested in knowing more about her. Talk about your daily activities and ask her about things that she is interested in.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         5. Show interest in her daily life
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        As you text each other, ask her what she is doing and how se is fairing on. This makes her know that you are really interested in her. This may also help in making her trust you and open up.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         6. Get naughty when you can
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Text her naughty things but be vague unless you know what she would love to hear. Wait to see how she responds. If she goes along the dirty talk route, use it to turn her on. Making her feel sexually excited will eventually make her feel romantically attracted to you.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         7. Give here a unique and lovely pet name
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that you have been texting for a while, giving her a pet name will be a very smart move if you want to take the relationship to the next level. It helps to create a bond between you. She must like the pet name you give her. If she doesnt, choose another one.
       </p>
       <p>
        With these 7 quality tips on how to text a girl you like, you will never go wrong. Start texting her and see how well it goes!

        Dating for men  A lot of people out there who have just started dating or are about to plunge in the dating world have no idea on the dos and donts of dating. This article seeks to offer dating advice for men and how they should carry themselves while dating.
        <br/>
        Top on the list for men on the dating scene is to have some confidence. This applies mostly on the first date. Women will need to feel they are with a bold man who will not shy away from stating his desires and have the nerve to chase after what he wants. Confidence is derived mainly from a firm eye contact, which further fosters the understanding between a man and his date.
        <br/>
        As a man, you owe it yourself to remain casual and be as yourself as possible. It is very disheartening to see a man try to force a character they do not have or try to hold a conversation on topics of no interest to a woman.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before approaching a lady for dating or even a relationship, it is very important to ask yourself what you want in that relationship. This will give you a rough idea of the kind of person you want to date and thus make the dating process a bit simpler.
        <br/>
        Another priceless dating advice for men is to have places you are familiar with as dating venues. It does not augur well for a man to get lost with his date in tow. Avoid the embarrassment and frequent joints that you are conversant with.
        <br/>
        Preparation is key. Make sure that shirt is well ironed, the wallet is loaded and the gas tank is full. Talk yourself silly on that mirror and practice the things you plan to tell her. This boosts your confidence and shows your date that you have a clue on what you are doing. Ensure that first impression is a lasting one.
        <br/>
        Communication is essential when it comes to dating. Make sure you converse with your date on areas of common interest just to keep them interested in the date and avoid the unnecessary creeping in of boredom.
        <br/>
        Discard the notion that men are liars and adopt the policy of honesty. This means you will not need to lie to cover up on your other lies. However, you should be cautious so as not to be too revealing since some areas are no-go zones. After all, telling little truths is better than lying.
        <br/>
        <iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJBuVtGSAvA" width="560">
        </iframe>
       </p>
       <p>
        Being a man, it would help immensely to obtain a second opinion on your date, what to wear, which restaurants to go to etc. preferably from a female friend. This boosts a mans confidence or kills his interest on the date depending on the counsel one gets.
        <br/>
        As you continue dating or being in a relationship, you should carry out random checks to test the chemistry levels in your relationship. You can try to kiss your date in public and see how they react. If they step away or are receptive, you can make a conclusion from there yourself.
        <br/>
        Lastly, it is up to you as a man to remain a gentleman. Get to the date venue early, offer to foot the bill, pull her chair for goodness sake. A little courtesy surely goes a long way in making that impression.
