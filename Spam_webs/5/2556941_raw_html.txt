              Cells, whether cancerous or
normal can only live and reproduce (undergo mitosis) in a Ph range of between
6.5 and 7.5. A healthy cell has a Ph of 7.35 while a cancer cell is more
acidic. Cesium when taken orally will raise the Ph of cancer
cells, but not that of normal cells. When the Ph of a cancer cell goes above 7.5
it dies and if it goes above 8.0 it will die in a matter of hours.

             Every cell in the body is like a little battery. To successfully bring
nourishment in, and take poisons out, it has to be fully charged. In
a cancerous cell, the charge (called cell voltage) drops from 90 - 70 
millivolts to less than 40 millivolts. When the cell voltage gets to
the very bottom, only 5 substances can pass in or out of the cell. They 
are water, sugar, potassium, cesium and rubidium. Oxygen cannot enter into
a cancer cell. So you see, even if there is a lot of oxygen in the blood,
it won't get into the cell. Cesium, because of its electrical properties 
can still enter the cancerous cell. When it does so, because of it's
 extreme alkalinity, the cell dies. Luckily, healthy cells are not affected
 by cesium because their cell voltage allows them to balance themselves.
The only side effect is a loss of potassium which can be easily supplemented with additional potassium.

             It is interesting to note that
cancer is virtually unknown among the Hopi Indians of Arizona and the Hunza of
Northern Pakistan, so long as they stay in the same environment. This
strongly suggests that something they are consuming is protecting them from
cancer. The Hopi water is rich in Rubidium and potassium. The Hunza
water is rich in Cesium and potassium, making both of the water supplies rich 
with very caustically (alkaline) active minerals.

             In his publication, Cesium therapy in
cancer patients, Dr. Sartori describes the 2 week treatment of 50 last stage, metastasized,
terminal cancer patients (13 comatose), with Cesium salts.
All were expected to die within weeks, with the survival rate being less than
 one in ten million. After 2 weeks, 13 died with autopsies showing no
presence of cancer. After 12 months, 12 more had died, but 25, an
astounding 50% survived.

Cesium Chloride and Cesium Carbonate work by raising the cancer cell's Ph to a highly alkaline state.
Although many anti-cancer diets also produce an alkaline state, they simply
 cannot do so as quickly or as fully as Cesium can.

                Certain foods contain biologically active
compounds and/or ingredients, i.e., vitamins, inorganic salts, organic compounds,
essential fatty acids, minerals, and chelating agents which may either
precipitate or prevent cancer development. The relationship between
dietary consumption and cancer development is not clear and further
investigation continues. Noteworthy is the report on the presence of high
levels of cesium [Cs] and rubidium [Rb] in food along with availability of
various supportive compounds as vitamins A and C, along with zinc and selenium
in diet of populations residing in areas with low incidence of cancer e.g., the
Hopi Indian territory in Arizona, the Hunza area in North Pakistan, and the
volcanic regions of Brazil. The diet of these populations is similar to
the nutritive requirements for the high Ph cancer therapy developed by Brewer's 
subsequent series of physical experiments with cancer cells. In these
tests the presence of Cs+ or Rb+ in the adjacent fluids of the tumor cell is
believed to raise the Ph of the cancer cell where mitosis will cease resulting
in reduction of life span of the cancer cell. The introduction of such
alkaline Ph by these alkali salts may also neutralize the acidic and toxic
material within the cancer cell. This report combines the use of CsCl with
various supportive agents. which have been hypothesized both to enhance the
entry of Cs+ into the cancer cell and to stimulate the immune response, in the
treatment of various cancers.

According to individual cases CsCl was given at daily dosages of 6 to 9 grams in
3 equally divided doses, with vitamin A-emulsion (100,000 to 300,000 U), vitamin
C (4 to 30 grams), zinc (80 to 100 mg) selenium (600 to 1,200 mcg) and amygdalin
(1,500 mg) in addition to other supplementations according to the specific needs
of the patient. The diet consisted mainly of whole grains, vegetables,
linolenic acid rich oils (linseed, walnut, soy, wheat germ) and other
supplemental food. To increase efficiency of the treatment and improve the
circulation and oxygenation, the patients received the chelating agent EDTA,
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and also a combination of vitamins, K and Mg salts.

                Table 1 summarizes the results of the
Cs-treatment of 50 cancer patients studied over 3 years. They had
generalized metastatic disease, except for 3 patients. Initial death occurrences
for the initial 2 week treatment was in the same order and magnitude of these
recorded for the 12 month period. The percent of survival of breast,
colon, prostate, pancreas, and lung cancer accounted to approximately, 50%
recovery which was higher than that noted for liver cancer and the lymphoma
patients treated. An overall 50% recovery from cancer by the Cs-therapy
was determined in the 50 patients treated. Data from the autopsy made
indicated the absence of tumors in patient dying within 14 days of the
Cs-treatment. One of the most striking effects of the treatment was the
disappearance of pain in all patients within 1 to 3 days after initiation
of the Cs-therapy.

                These studies were performed under my
direction, initiated in April, 1981. Twenty-eight patients were initially
treated with CsCl between April, 1981 to October, 1982. They were
subjected to various cancer therapies, e.g., surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy, and were considered terminal cases with metastatic disease except
for 3 patients who were not previously treated. Three patients were
comatose at the time of the Cs treatment. Thirteen patients died within
less than 2 weeks of treatment. Each patient showed a reduction in tumor
mass by the Cs-treatment. Of the breast cancer patients, the most
impressive effect was seen in a female patient who was comatose at the beginning
of the Cs-treatment and was considered a terminal case. The Cs-therapy,
with other ingredients used, was immediately instituted by nasogastric route
because there was no cooperation from the patient. The daily CsCl
dose given amounted to 30 grams, 10 grams given 3 times daily. The patient
was able to leave after 5 days of treatment. However the patient's fall on
the floor resulted in complications, i.e., fracture of the neck, and
death. The autopsy revealed that the cancer metastasis had essentially
eaten away her hip bone causing this tragic accident. The autopsy
performed also showed the presence of very little cancer tissue.

treated was of unknown primary. Treatment of 8 cases showed a death rate
of 2 within 14 days of treatment and an additional 2 deaths within 12 months
while 4 of the patients are still living. In one case, an autopsy was made
in a patient after one week of Cs-treatment and showed a complete disappearance
of the cancer. There were 7 cases of colon cancer patients who were
treated with CsCl. Two of these patients died within 14 days, one of the
patients had previous massive chemotherapy, and little time was available to
restore her metabolic condition. The previous existing infiltration of the
abdominal wall disappeared. However, no consent was given for an autopsy.

                The results presented
demonstrate the rate of efficacy of CsCl in cancer therapy. The total 50
cancer cases studied show an impressive 50% survival rate. This confirms
the work of Messiha reported in these proceedings showing that the higher the
dose it is, the more effective it seems to be. The autopsy obtained
from the patient whose death was attributed to traumatic fracture of the
neck, indicated that cancer had been initially further advanced resulting in
bone destruction. However, the absence of cancer after the massive CsCl
dose used in this case is demonstrable of the Cs-therapy. It appears that
both dosage, i.e., as much as 30 grams/day and route of drug administration,
i.e., nasogastric pathway, might have contributed to the patients
rapid recovery. It should be noted, however, that CsCl dose regimens
should not exceed 20 to 40 grams due to side effects, mainly nausea, and
diarrhea. The authors personal experience with CsCl after an acute dose of
40 grams CsCl indicate that extensive nausea and parethesia around the mouth are
the major side effects. This is probably due to K depletion. The
usual dose used in the clinic ranges from 2 to 3 grams given by mouth 3 times
daily. At a later time, at which time there is no indication of cancer
presence, the CsCl dosage will be reduced to a preventative dose between .5 and
1 gram a day.

                The lymphoma case presented shows
that CsCl efficiently reduced massive enlargements of spleen and liver as well
as maximal ascites, causing an abdominal configuration of a tight, hard
hemisphere, to almost normalize after 3 months of therapy. This period of
time was required to eliminate such a massive volume resulting in the reduction
of the body weight noted.

                The clinical efficacy of CsCl high
 pH metabolic therapy is best demonstrated by a recent case of primary liver 
cancer (not included in the 50 cases reported in this study). The patient 
was a 39 year old female teacher who was terminal. She was brought on a
 stretcher on April 25, 1984 with a large liver tumor extending approximately 3
cm below the umbilical level. The treatment was then immediately 
instituted. This consisted of administration of CsCl, Beta-carotene,
Vitamin C, Zn, Se, Mn, Cr, and K salts by the oral route in addition to a 
concomitant massive IV doses of ascorbate, K, Mg, Zn, Cn, Mn, Cr salts, B
complex vitamins, folic acid, DMSO and heparin. After 5 consecutive
treatment regimens EDTA was introduced to the therapy and the minerals present
in the solution were discontinued. On May 10, 1984, the patient was 
discharged, returned home walking without assistance and displaying a smile on
her face. The liver tumor had shrunk to 5 cm above the 
umbilicus. The determination of alphafeto protein (AFP), a specific 
marker for liver cancer, rare embronal cancer and teratomas, decreased from the 
unusually high value of 39,000 units, compared to normal levels of 13 units,
measured before initiation of Cs-therapy, to 5000 units obtained on the last day
of treatment.

                The mechanism of action of Cs in cancer
has been little studied. Both Cs+ and Rb+ can specifically enter the
cancer cells and embryonic cells, but not normal adult cells has been
 demonstrated by Brewer. The cancer cells contain high amounts of hydrogen
ions rendering them acidic and they also contain high Na+ levels than found in
 normal cells. If Cs+ or Rb+ can enter the cancer cells then the pH 
increases from as low as 5.5 to over pH 7.0. At a pH of 7.6 the cancer 
cell division will stop, at a pH of 8.0 to 8.5 the lifespan of it is
considerably shortened (only hours). In one case, the author has observed 
the shrinkage of metastases of breast cancer after one hour of
Cs-treatment. Two days later wrinkles of the skin appeared where the tumor 
was present. In another case of a colon cancer with massive metastasis, of 
massive infiltration of the abdominal wall, liver and other tissues, seemed to 
have been reduced within 24 hours and continuing rapidly until the 
demise of the patient on the 14th day of the Cs-treatment.

                The uric acid levels measured at the 
onset of treatment was approximately 3.5 units which was increased to over 20
units, suggesting massive breakdowns of DNA, which produces the uric acid

               <b>
                Therefore, destruction of nuclear acids, as reflected by a
significant rise in the uric acid, may be used as a predictive measurement for 
treatment outcome. The failure of uric acid elevation may be indicative of
 lack of destruction of cancer cells. This has proven to be a very consistent 
finding in our clinic.

                There are certain factors which may
enhance the Cs-therapy. The Cs-penetration into the cancer cells can be
increased by the following three methods: The first approach resides in 
broadening the electron donor capacity of the cancer cell membrane by the 
application of cyanide, an electron donor radical as found in nitriles
(amygdalin, Laetrile, mandelonitrite, prunasin, ficin, cassivin), by selenium
oxide, an electron donor radical, or by the use of DMSO. The second
 approach enhances the potential gradient across the cancer cell membrane by the 
utilization of weak acids like ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and retinoic acid
(Vitamin A). The third method attempts to improve the circulation to the 
tumor and facilitate the destruction of cross-linkages in the mucoid and 
fibrinous substances around the cancer cell. This can be achieved by 
chelation therapy, i.e., the use of EDTA as has been shown by Blumer who 
reported on the reduction of cancer incidence by 90% by chelating patients
(an average of 15 chelations in 8 years). This approach also reduced
 cardiovascular disease by 50%. Other chelating agents can also be
used. Moreover, the use of beta-carotene will lead to decomposition of
blocking mucoid proteins mediated by electrical charges; Also, heparin,
which acts through electrical charges, will inactivate the immune repelling and
immune binding capacities of the blocking mucoid proteins. These
approaches will hinder cancer growth and they are virtually atoxic.

                It should be noted that certain behavioral
characteristics "the cancer personality" of the cancer patient may
interfere in any projected treatment modality. This has been reported by
Lawrence LeShan in his book entitled "You can fight for your
life." His studies suggested that cancer patients seeking treatment,
e.g., chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, are probably motivated by a covert
desire for death. For example, statements such as, "rather than
undergoing any of those treatments, I would rather die in peace," or
"I would never undergo any of those treatments or let anyone of my family
undergo them because the effectiveness is unproven and the damage that is done
with any of those treatments is higher than the effects." are often
expressed. Thus, both chemotherapy and lifestyle changes may also
contribute to an effective therapy.

  age, the pancreas is less and less able to make this important
  substance. By taking pancreatin orally, it is possible to increase the

              Mass spectrographic and isotope studies have shown that potassium, rubidium, and especially cesium are most efficiently taken up by cancer cells. This uptake was enhanced by Vitamins A and C as well as salts of zinc and selenium. The quantity of cesium taken up was sufficient to raise the cell to the 8 pH range. Where cell mitosis ceases and the life of the cell is short. Tests on mice fed cesium and rubidium showed marked shrinkage in the tumor masses within 2 weeks. In addition, the mice showed none of the side effects of cancer. Tests have been carried out on over 30 humans. In each case the tumor masses disappeared. Also all pains and effects associated with cancer disappeared within 12 to 36 hr; the more chemotherapy and morphine the patient had taken, the longer the withdrawal period. Studies of the food intake in areas where the incidences of cancer are very low showed that it met the requirements for the high pH therapy.
