         Ever since that episode aired on Friday night and the Final 3 on
         <em>
          Big Brother
         </em>
         2014 took some time to look back at
         <em>
          Big Brother
         </em>
         16 and some of their favorite moments of the season, I have been trying to think of my own. Our wonderful
         <strong>
          Cat
         </strong>
         came up with the idea of us all sharing our own favorite moments, but how am I supposed to come up with a moment when they all run together for me? Ill try, which can be seen in my

        <p>
         To be honest, if
         <b>
          Donny
         </b>
         was involved then it was one of my favorite moments on
         <em>
          Big Brother
         </em>
         16. In a season that brought us predicability and unanimous votes and
         <strong>
          Derrick
         </strong>
         running the show, Donny was that bright spot that brought us some giggles and tears every episode. There was a reason he was voted onto Team America (and hopefully why he wins Americas Favorite HouseGuest during the finale on Wednesday night).
        </p>
        <p>
         <span id="more-16779">
         </span>
         <br/>
         While there are many moments with Donny that were great, I am going to go back to Week 6 and that
         <a href="http://bigbigbrother.com/big-brother-2014-live-recap-week-6-double-eviction/" target="_blank">
          <strong>
           Double Eviction episode
          </strong>
         </a>
         . We saw
         <strong>
          Caleb
         </strong>
         win HoH and then nominate Donny and
         <strong>
          Hayden
         </strong>
         . Power of Veto was up next and it was a physical competition of running into the pit of balls and find three rubber duckies (yes, I just said duckies)! This was a very physical competition and Donny was going up against Hayden, Caleb and
         <strong>
          Zach
         </strong>
         (
         <strong>
          Christine
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          Victoria
         </strong>
         also), so no one thought he would beat them.
        </p>
        <p>
         He turns around and shows these youngins who the real comp beast was! Seeing him win and collapsing afterwards brought tears to me eyes yet again. There were many moments that Donny made me cry, but these were tears of joy and tears of being proud of him. He showed he was a true competitor and he wasnt going to lie down and let them run over him.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, what was your favorite moment from

              Although its difficult for me to choose a favorite moment, heres mine:    Week 8, Frankie and Derrick HOHs.   Frankie noms Caleb and Cody.   Derrick noms Donny and Christine.   The plan was for Christine to throw the BoTB.    But Donny remains victorious over 3 to 1 odds!!    All by himself!!    There are 2 reasons this moment stands out to me.   1.  Donny shows he may be down-but not out!   Just when they think their best laid plans will go accordingly, along comes karma.    And #2 reason..It chapped Christines butt to be bested by someone she hated.    She threw the word hate around like a frisbee.   And doing that is sure to bring negative energy into your life.   Maybe karma was working overtime that day.

                I loved the bone comp as well.  Also when he lied in the room crying because the kids liked him.  He is so humble and you can see they dont show much affection at home.  I know allot of homes that dont show the love to each other.  That is why he was in tears because the kids liked him.

                  Have to admit i had trouble choosing between the 2 moments.   His crying because he felt loved was my #2.   Feeling you are loved is one of the greatest feelings in the world.   And to have someone feel it, when little often they do, shows what power love can hold.   I truly hope he wins AFP.   Because once again that wonderful feeling will be brought back to life for him.   And not just from a small group of kids.   But from most of America.

                      Still one of my favorites Todd.  He is so humble has a heart of gold and his girl friend is lucky to have him.  Some guys like this I have one, never show emotions and when they do it goes straight to your heart.

                    Cat, your post brought back so many memories of Donnyand also brought tears to my eyes and they continued to fall as I remembered so many things about that great man.  Everything that man touched or everyone that Donny touched made them much better.  It is so sad that the only thing that came out of Christines mouth when she talked about Donny was how much she hated him.  What is there to hate about Donny?  NOTHING!!.  Was she jealous?  or just a mean person?  She is supposed to be a Christianshe said it herself and what did she preach about?  HATE for Donny.  I will never forget about Donny and all the kindnesses that he gave to all of the houseguests.  He always made my day when i either saw him on TV or read something about him in a post.  I also expect him to be crying when he gets AFP.  I cannot see anyone else getting it.  But, if he by chance does not get it, I bet his email, mailbox or however we can get in touch with him will be overflowing with an outpouring of love to this special man.  I voted for himwith many email addresses, everyday that I could.   :&lt;)

                      That makes me recall another Donny memory.  Wasnt he the only person who stayed out in the yard the whole time Brittany was trying to kick her 2000 soccer goals?  He may have left some of the time, but there were many times when he was the only person sitting there, encouraging her.  Just a genuinely kind man.

                      Exactly he sure was. I bet she voted for him and Devin because he was so nice to them.  I hope he wins AFP because he deserves it.

              My memory fails me even trying to recall all the times that endeared me to Donny as a genuine person.  But one standout was the night on BBAD (it was just before it went off the air, because the convo was cut off) when Zach was listening to Donny describe all the ways his brother overcomes his physical disabilities.  Driving, throwing a ball, etc, with only one small nub of an arm.
             </p>
             <p>
              What struck me was not only Donnys deep love for his brother, but his ADMIRATION of him.  You couldnt help but admire his brother too.
             </p>
             <p>
              And Zach was eating it up.  He became a Donny fan at that moment, Im quite sure (if he wasnt already).
             </p>

              Just 22 minutes left to vote for AFP!!!!!!!!!!!

                That was my favorite moment, too, Lilly!  For both of the reasons you stated.  My feelings about Zach really changed during that conversation.
                <br/>
                I also loved when Donny found out about the invite to be on The Bold and the Beautiful.

              One of my favorite moment follows that comment you mentionned Todd, when Donny actually gave the Necklace to Jocasta as she was up for eviction! That is the BIGGEST quality this man has; his heart on his hands!!! Only for that one action he should get the AFP prize!!!

                You are right there Jean. That was also a special moment.  Donny has made us smile and touched  more than all the other HG put together.

                That reminds me of another nice Donny moment.  Wasnt he the only person who voted to keep Paola?  He knew she was going, but he let it be known that he just couldnt vote to evict her.  I realize that it wasnt game-critical because it wasnt going to change the outcome, but I admired his willingness to possibly upset the house by voting against them  because even though it did NOT change the result, the egos in that house could have (and probably did) held it against him.

                  That is so true! That was another one during her exit interview with Julie and how she said he was her best friend in the house and she never could see that happening!

             </p>
             <p>
              Greetings:)
             </p>
             <p>
              As a longtime and devoted BB watcher, I have a few opinions Id like to share. I hope you can find a moment to read this as I believe it represents the views of many. I began watching BB season 6 and have since seen every season, even going back to watch 1-5. Every. Single. Episode. I have had the live feeds since season 6, as well. I watch your show, helping to build your ratings, I buy the live feeds, I even buy merchandise from the Big Brother store! I am a superfan in every sense of the word. As such, I am starting to notice the lack of reciprocity in terms of CBS love for the fans. I give you my all and I am met with the most unfair twists and slants favored at specific houseguests. I understand there will be Diamond Vetos and Rewinds and other tricks to throw everyone off and hopefully keep the show fresh and interesting and yes, sometimes to keep productions faves around just a little bit longer because they make good Television. What I do not understand is when there is so much cross-promotion which favors specific HGs in outside votes like Americas Favorite Houseguest or Team America. It happened last season with Elissa (even though I grew to love Elissa), we could all see she had an enormous edge with Rachels fan base voting for her and this year, you really went over the top casting Ariana Grandes brother whos fan base far exceeds the total number of viewers of Big Brothertimes three! If youre going to have a Frankie or even an Elissa, wouldnt it be more fair to discontinue the AFP vote? Frankie gets votes from people that dont even watch the show. 12 year old Arianators are voting who dont even know what Big Brother is. Ariana posts a link, and they lovingly and obediently oblige. There is literally no rationale that makes this fair. Believe me, Ive tried to twist it every which way but this is completely ridiculous!
             </p>
             <p>
              I understand there is a new CBS show, Scorpion, which is produced by Scooter Braun; who happens to be Ariana &amp; Justin Biebers manager. Youd have to be an idiot not to put the pieces together, but since that is the reality, having contests like Team America and Americas Favorite Player takes other deserving houseguests totally out of contention. I wonder, if Scooter Braun had a child or a niece or nephew, wouldnt they be ineligible to be on a CBS Reality Show with prize money involved? How is this different? It truly feels like one, big, incestuous, marketing ploy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you care about the fans at all? Its starting to feel as if you dont. I hate to be snarky but when Arnold Shapiro was around, things just felt a little more balanced. He seemed to genuinely care about the fans and the quality of the game. There has been such a noticeable change in recent years and its upsetting when millions of people give up our time and money to support this show, (some have practically no life at all during the summer as such avid fans), and yet you treat us with no respect. It hurts, I can not lie.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope someone reads this. I know it probably wont make a difference but you need to know, this is not a single voice. Many, many fans feel this way. I know its a game, its not that serious, but at the end of the day without the fans, you do not have a show. Weve given you our respect by giving you the ratings you so richly enjoy. It would be fantastic if you gave us a little back.

                Very good letter.   Although i doubt they read it.   But if by chance they did, they probably dont care.   They get written some every year by angry fans.   And not much has changed.

                  This statement is so true. some have practically no life at all during the summer as such avid fans), and yet you treat us with no respect  The past two years have been a disappointment, next year I hope there are just folks like us fans in the BB house without famous people.  It does hurt the show and the way the game is played out.  I hope for one it is read, because it is a good letter and the truth.

                Yep, that was a good one.  Talking about general fav moments that do NOT involve Donny  I liked the first time Zach caused a ruckus by outing everyone in the house and, miraculously (and for the ONLY time this season), caused the house to flip back and keep him when we all thought he was a goner.  I really liked Zach in the end.  Its a shame he slept the season away.  Maybe if hed been awake more, he could have taken the spotlight from the seasons spotlight hog!

              I loved the moment Donny brought the POV to Jocasta. The emotion of that was so intense.  He has the biggest heart and he makes me want to be a better person.

              Magic moments,   Oh, I remember them well, such wonderful memories.  Donny is a wonderful, sweet, kind, thoughtful, gentle man.  He made us laugh. He made us cry. He made us happy, He made us sad. And. He made us think. Thanks for the memories, I will cherish them forever, But most of all, thank you Donny, for restoring our faith in mankind.

              Thanks buddied, Those were some of my favorite moments in the house as well.  I would to add some of my favorite Donny quotes In his audition video he said  Im probably smarter than they think Im, but Im probably not as smart as I think Im   When Devin made the DD alliance with him he was so surprised and happy in the DR he said   I felt like I just won the best beard contest at the county fair   In one of his alone time with Nicole he said  If I become HOH, Im going to tell them, the first two people to come up to the room is going to be nominated.because it will give me time to think  Yes he was/is smart, funny and wise. A truly unforgettable  man.

              Good morning and happy hump day.  Here is your funny for the day. Have a great one all my BB buds.  Tonight is the night.  YES YES YES

              American, Japanese, and a Indian were sitting in the sauna.
             </p>
             <p>
              Suddenly there was a beeping sound. The American pressed his forearm and the beeping stopped. The others looked at him questioningly. That is my pager, he said, I have a microchip under the skin of my arm.
              <br/>
              A few minutes later a phone rang. The Japanese lifted his palm to his ear. When he finished he explained, That is my mobile phone. I have a microchip in my hand.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Indian felt low-tech and inferior. He did not know what to do to be as impressive as the American &amp; the Japanese. He decided to take a break in the toilet.
              <br/>
              When he returned, he did not realize that there was a piece of toilet paper got stuck and hanging from his backside. The others raised their eyebrows and said, Wow! What is that? Instead of being embarrassed, inspiration struck his mind. The Indian guy explained, I am getting a FAX.
             </p>
             <p>
              The other two fainted.
