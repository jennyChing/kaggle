         Gunther Link, 45, was stuck in an elevator. As soon as he was rescued he ran to church to thank his God. His
         <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/09/10/devout_catholic/">
          God then crushed him
         </a>
         under an 860 pound stone altar. That God dude is
         <em>
          such
         </em>
         a practical joker. An atheist would have thanked his rescuers instead.

        <p>
         God also sent 117 people to the hospital via

         Allah is has the same sense of humor. When one of his followers, who was obviously not an atheist, insisted on wearing a head covering at a go-cart track, he rewarded her by

          strangling her

         It looks like Pakistan is going to be calling for the execution of Facebook operator Mark Zuckerberg. He allowed the draw a picture of Mohamed day page to stay up, so the Religion of Peace

         A month after the earthquake a Haitian couple tried to get married. Christian evangelicals, not atheists, helpfully

          attacked them with rocks

         An African mob

          burned down a home

         John Smith has more imagination than the parents who named him. He

         because her
         <em>
          fetus
         </em>
         was hostile toward him, and was projecting negative energy. His psychic confirmed his suspicions. He did try to resolve it by going to a chiropractor/energy worker, but that didnt work out, so he canned her.

         Christians and Muslims in Nigeria enjoyed a

          three day riot
         </a>
         that left dozens dead. Perhaps they were arguing about whose god was more loving. The last atheist riot was. . . um. . .never.

         The Pope warned Africans that

          use of condoms

         Hasidic Jews, not atheists,

          staged a riot
         </a>
         outside an Intel factory in Israel, because it operated on the Sabbath. They attacked cars, yelled insults, and spit. And if youve ever listened to them pronounce words like chutzpah and Hasidim you know they can generate
         <em>
          serious
         </em>
         amounts of phlegm.

          asking for nearly a half million dollars of taxpayer money

         The Catholic Church, still refusing to admit their blame in aiding and abetting child rape, once again
         <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/10/01/catholic-church-sex-abuse-caused-by-homosexuals-not-paedophiles/">
          claimed
         </a>
         that it was the fault of homosexuals, not pedophiles. (Note: Every week there are literally dozens of new stories about catholic priests raping children and the church making increasingly lame excuses for it. Ive opted to bypass most of them, because theres only so much space on my web hosts hard drives.)

         Every Friday afternoon Muslims

          mob several streets in Paris
         </a>
         , shutting down businesses. Theyve even got their own faux security guards to keep anyone else out of the area.

         If youre broken someone jaw in the UK, simply find a ditzy judge who will

         If youre Muslim, better avoid watching soccer. If your

         </a>
         might. Atheists can watch soccer if they want to, but most American atheists dont, because its lame.

         If your six week old baby, who youve named Faith Lovemore, is crying, just

         until she stops breathing. That will calm her right down. Daddy was a religious whack job too. (Once again, seriously funny eyes.) Poor kid. If she only had been born to atheist parents. . .

          As an atheist, I have to say, this article is why so many religious people have such a venomous reaction to atheism.  You make it seem like many or all of the worlds ills are attributable to religion, and I sincerely hope you know thats not true.  Shit happens to atheists proportionally as much as it happens to people who do believe in a higher power.  You should realize that there is nothing inherently good or bad about religion, just as there is nothing inherently good or bad about atheism.  Get over yourself and learn some tolerance.

          Many of the worlds ills ARE directly attributable to religion.  Everything on this list, for instance. No where did I say or even imply that all, or even most, of our problems are due to religion.  Just the problems on this list, and a few thousand other incidents every day.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is not about shit happening to people.  This is about people shitting on other people in the name of religion.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do think there is something inherently bad about a lot of religions. Again, not all of them, but a significant percentage.  Even when theyre not directly harmful, making decisions based on fantasy is never a good idea.

          You should realize that your statement is not a fact; its an opinion. IMO, religion that involves faith is indeed inherently bad. Faith = believing something without, or in the face of contrary, evidence. Thats not just bad; its dangerous.

          Dont think these people were atheists either.
         </p>

          Lust for wealth drove a poverty-stricken couple to sacrifice their own four-year-old daughter at a village in Uttar Pradeshs backward Sitapur district, about 90 km from here [Lucknow].
         </p>
         <p>
          The couple, identified as Srikrishna and Ramdevi, were told by a tantrik (exorcist)that they would become rich if they sacrificed their daughter, according to police sources here.
         </p>
         <p>
          Acting on the advice of a tantrik, a havana kund (a pit in which the fire is lit and yajna is performed), was prepared in the courtyard of the couple for the rituals late on Monday night.
         </p>
         <p>
          The parents then put their daughter Kanni into the pit amid chanting of mantra and lit the fire. The girl, who was also mercillessely beaten, was half buried in the pit.
         </p>
         <p>
          The parents had stuffed a piece of cloth in the mouth of the little girl so that her cries could not be heard by any one in the village, sources said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The badly burnt body of the girl was later buried on the same spot by digging a deep pit, sources said. The grandmother of the girl was also present during the rituals, sources said.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ghastly incident came to light on Tuesday when neighbours found vermillion, flowers, incense sticks and other items used in the rituals and suspected that some exorcism rituals might have been performed there.

          Heres an interesting bit of news from the online version of Utne Reader:
         </p>
         <p>
          The worlds happiest countries have been announced, and three of the top five are among the least religious countries in the world, reports Alfredo Garcia at Religion News Service. Garcia acknowledges that this might be like comparing apples to bookshelves and that measures of happiness or religiosity can often be so vague and difficult to quantify that they lose their meaning but its a notable finding all the same. Heres more:
         </p>
         <p>
          The nations taking the top spots include: Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. This might not come as a surprise to many who have been to these nations. What is surprising, however, is that three of these five nations are among the top 10 least religious nations in the world (also from Gallup).
         </p>
         <p>
          Indeed, Sweden, Denmark and Norway came in at second, third, and fourth, respectively.  Only Estonia was less religious than these nations.

          Right, because no one would do anything bad without religion. *roll eyes*

          Joke or not, youre an idiot. Bat-shit crazy people will ALWAYS kill children. Pedophiles will ALWAYS rape children. Period. End of story. God or not. Do you understand that absolute fact? Its not an opinion, its fact.
         </p>
         <p>
          And to those of you who judge an entire group of people based on the actions of a few, you sicken me. THIS is the reason *every* religious groups hates Atheists. See what I did there? I said every single religious person on this earth hates Atheists. That is NOT true. Its an over-generalization.

          Well at least he/she warns us what the post will be about with the statement Yet another thoughtless post. Though, he/she should be aware that the author of the article (Dave Hitt) cannot be a troll, that would be the commenter who calls the author or other posters names or refutes their arguments without a shred of proof (him/her).

          You know, I was thinking that, too. How is Dave supposed to be trolling his own blog? LOL.

          For the benefit of the actual troll, no, batshit crazy people do not always kill children. There are plenty of people who are objectively, legally insane, who have not killed anyone, children or otherwise.

          Dave, you should read the articles you cite more closely.  The one about the guy slitting his mothers throat in particular.  You make a crack about funny eyes, I assume because of the picture on that page.  Look closer.  The picture is not of the suspect, Mokwunye.  That is, if you read the caption under the picture, Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Marvel Akpoyibo.   Try to pay a little more attention next time, please :)

          Heidi, heres an idea. Religionists should should treat their faith like they do their genitalia. Dont take it out in public and dont shove it down your childrens throats.
         </p>
         <p>
          Im a writer. Its what I do. That, and piss off the superstitious. Its one of my callings.
         </p>
         <p>
          So Bobby, I gotta call you out on that one.  Dunno if you writing your second comment was you claiming to have made up your first comment or not but it sure sounded like it.  But, that sounds alot like that poster Ive seen around the internet saying RELIGION IS LIKE A PENIS. Its ok to have one, its ok to be proud of it.  But dont go waving it around in public, and please dont shove it down my childrens throats.
          <br/>
          I dunno if youre paraphrasing that, or if by chance you had the same funny idea that that whoever wrote that passage did, and you wrote your own without ever seeing that. If so, good work!  If not, dont claim others peoples work.  I have no idea who the original author is though maybe it was you.  But I dont think you would have paraphrased it quite so much

          Theres nothing new under the sun Bryan, every artist knows that. It wouldnt surprise me if variations on what I said have been around  longer than you or I have. Im sure its been said by many people in many ways. I simply stated something Ive thought in the past and I stated it in my own words. Im an original. I have written over 500 stories that I call my own, that came from my imagination but Im under no illusion that I wasnt influenced by a great many things I was exposed to before. Its only plagiarism if you quote something verbatim and assert that you are the original author or dont acknowledge it as a quote. Why are you focusing on the possible origin of the idea rather than thinking about what it says?

          Remember, I said that too.  I get that all the time, Ill have a great idea and thinks its totally awesome an original, then go to look into it and find out someone else already did it.  So, like I said, good work for thinking up a funny quote, even if someone wrote it first.
         </p>
         <p>
          Why was I focusing on origin, rather then meaning?  It was because I was thinking of meaning, that made me think that Ive thought of this meaning before, so I went to investigate and share my findings.
         </p>
         <p>
          And I hope you didnt take offense, I wasnt blaming you of plagarism, just pointing it out if it was.  I have no doubt that you have written many great stories.  Any links to any of them so I can read?

          Spitefully attacking people who follow religion isnt a way to promote atheism.  Yes, there are some nutjobs who do horrific things in the name of religion, but its not like atheism automatically makes you a pure being.  Im sure there are plenty of criminals who dont believe in God or some other religion.  People who abuse religion and use it as an excuse to control and attack are in the wrong, but religion can still provide a lot of solace to a lot of people.  If you want to be atheist, thats your choice but trying to discredit religion as much as possible is just silly.  Its like a politician trying to win an election by bringing down all the other candidates.

          Bobby, you may be writer and if that is the case then youre plagiarizing. That quote, shove it down kids throats is nearly as old as religion itself. Quit claiming things as your own. Youre not impressing anyone except those that are too stupid to think for themselves and buy into every line of bullshit they read on the internet.

          You need to read better. Bobby acknowledged he was not the creator of the original quote he simply put it into his own words, he also pointed out that Its only plagiarism if you quote something verbatim and assert that you are the original author or dont acknowledge it as a quote which he did not. And he was referring to the entire quote Religionists should should treat their faith like they do their genitalia. Dont take it out in public and dont shove it down your childrens throats not just the last part. Finally here is my quote It is better to keep ones mouth closed and be thought a fool than to open it and remove all doubt and thats not plagiarism either.

          This is such a biased post its really sad, the way youre making it seem like religions making the world this totally crazy place. I agree with some of the people above  bad/crazy people will ALWAYS be bad/crazy, whether theyre religious or not and people DO insane stuff in the name of religion but you cant blame religion, right  thats the peoples faults I think Im not a Christian but NOWHERE in the Bible does it say that you should put Bible-pages in the  mouth of a crying baby, for instance. Just an example! The main point is  evil exists in the world. With or without religion.
          <br/>
          It seems to me that youre trying to show people that Atheists are better human beings, if I understood it correctly. In which case I feel very, very saddened and disappointed that people can be so intolerant and narrow-minded and that the lack of knowledge can be so big.

         </p>
         <p>
          I think, in general, atheists are much much better human beings than the extremely religious.  As proof, look up the beliefs, or lack of belief, in the US prison population.  While atheists make up 10-15% of the general population they only make up .2% of the prison population.  .2%!

          you put things in there that werent even related to religion, like witchcraft, and in case of the gun sights, that really isnt even an issue, but Athiests made a huge deal of it when they found out, i mean, thats like say sleeping in a hotel room with a bible in it should be against the law, just stupid.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now, before you all go all crazy about what I said, let me also say, to hell with the church, most of them are corrupt and money hungry, I have a deep burning hatred for them, but that doesnt change me any.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some good stuff to read there, but again, violence is everywhere, just because athiests dont mass together and do crazy stuff doesnt mean they are immune to being violent, its just human nature.

          Quick look suggests you like to attack the non-atheists just all the while condemning their attacking one another. I take it you wouldnt look kindly at an attack on atheism, or is that how you got-off on this kick in the first place?

          Did you ever look at Christ and His resurrection, by the way? Who do you say He is/was?

          I say, based on one whole hell of lot of research, that hes as real as Santa. There is not shred of credible evidence that he ever existed. There is, however, a mountain of circumstantial evidence that hes a myth.

          Christ is a literary character who was plagiarized from pre-existing accounts of various gods and demi-gods. Thanks for asking.

          Attack whatever you want. Feel free to attack all the other things I dont believe in, too. I am also an a-unicornist, an a-leprechaunist, and an a-aliens-among-us-ist.

          Wow that is extremely rude do you know what Catholics dont do? They dont post extremely rude websites with facts whose only source is some website. Yes I know it is fun to laugh at some of the silly things other people do, but can you honestly look at me and tell me atheists dont do anything stupid? Fine believe what you want, but I know what I believe and you cant change that.

          Atheists, being human, do plenty of stupid things.  But one thing theyve never done, that Catholics have (and probably still do) is run a world-wide pedophile ring for *decades* and then insult the victims who come forward.
         </p>

          I know what I believe too, but you
          <i>

          change that.  All you have to do is show me some good solid evidence that what I believe is wrong, and Ill change my mind.  Reluctantly and probably slowly, but my mind can be changed by facts.
         </p>
         <p>
          Do you consider it a virtue that no one can change your mind?

          Actually, that is EXACTLY what Catholics do. Except their only source is a 2000+ year old book written by goat herders in the desert. Unless youre saying its polite to say that all humans are doomed from birth to spend eternity being tortured in fire if we dont believe what that book says?

          There will always be stupid people, if you take religion away, theyll find another excuse for their craziness. Religion isnt violent, people are.

          Atheism is fine, until it gets just as annoying as any other overly religious person trying to impose their beliefs and view on others.

          To each their own, I dont care what people believe, as long as they practice peace and tolerance.

          Well now Sarah, atheism isnt a religious person let alone a religion. It also isnt a belief system. Nor do atheists try to shove things down the throats of others, unlike religion.

          Very few atheists are obnoxious about it, but sometimes we have no choice.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ive said this many times in many venues  I dont care what your religion is, but more importantly, I dont
          <i>
           want
          </i>
          to care.  If youre doing your thing based on some beleif I consider silly, so what?
         </p>
         <p>
          But there are things I have to care about, because they involve me or friends or innocent people or my money.  And when the religious cross the line and start demanding legislation to appease them or that superstition be taught in science class or a dozen other nasty things they do, then I
          <i>
           have
          </i>
          to care.  And because I dont want to care, but now have to, youve pissed me off. Thats when, and why, I get nasty.
