More recently new technology in the form of tiny cameras and social media has begun to play a role. And she&rsquo;s embraced those changes. Today, when the problem calls for it, she uses drones to do her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gives me a few examples. If two people are meeting in a public place, a drone can be a helpful way to discreetly watch them. &ldquo;We stay at about 50-75 feet [15-23 metres] above so nothing can be heard.&rdquo; Drones are also helpful for aerial surveillance of locations that are hard to access on foot. And if a school or church is worried someone might be stealing or vandalising property, drones or small off-road vehicles (&ldquo;Roombas on steroids&rdquo; as she calls them) can film the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yhk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Wright was asked to figure out whether or not a soda salesperson was crossing county lines and cheating on his contract. California is one of many states in which salespeople have regional contracts &ndash; for instance, Bob sells Pepsi in Los Angeles County and Nancy sells Pepsi in Orange County. If Nancy arrives at her usual businesses to sell her Pepsi and finds the soda supply has already been topped up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that someone (perhaps Bob) has crossed county lines and sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-tech toys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright was asked to figure out whether this was happening. To do so meant visiting every major soda wholesaler from San Luis Obispo to San Diego &ndash; about 300 miles (480km) of California coast &ndash; and checking whether any were selling soda from the wrong salesperson. When there was illegal soda on sale, she would use a drone to follow the soda delivery trucks back to their depots. In one case, the warehouse the truck led her back to was out in the desert and would have been impossible to approach by car or foot without being noticed. But the drone was able to spy on the trucks covertly. &ldquo;We could see between the warehouse door and the truck loading.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright gets her drones from high-end toy stores, for about $200 each. They&rsquo;re an expensive investment: not only do you have to buy the device, you also have to pay one or two people to pilot and spot the thing. And if you lose one during a mission, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of your budget. But it can be worth it, because for the cases in which they&rsquo;re useful, they can be very useful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yh4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright doesn&rsquo;t pilot the drones herself. &ldquo;I try to hire gamers. I go to the colleges and high schools and I find out who the geeks are, and then I hire them.&rdquo; She said that her pilots are more skilled than she would ever be &ndash; and they like the challenge. Some of them are working towards their own private investigator licences, and their hours piloting the little devices can count as hours towards their certification. (None of Wright&rsquo;s gamer pilots were willing to talk for this article. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re introverts,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Not shy, but introverts.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the idea of using drones to spy on people isn&rsquo;t something everybody is comfortable with. &lt;a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/05/chs-x-files-capitol-hill-drone-pilot-spotted-glowing-orbs-phone-thief-on-wheels/\"&gt;In a case in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a woman reported that someone was using a drone to spy on her. &ldquo;This afternoon, a stranger set an aerial drone into flight over my yard and beside my house near Miller Playfield,&rdquo; she told the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog. &ldquo;I initially mistook its noisy buzzing for a weed-whacker on this warm spring day. After several minutes, I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away.&rdquo; Her husband asked the drone operator, who was standing nearby, to move along &ndash; but the operator claimed to be acting within his legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening regulations&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t always clear. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx\"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 35 states considered adding drone bills to the books last year, and 10 states actually did add new laws. In Iowa, for example, it&rsquo;s now illegal for the state to use drones to enforce traffic laws. In North Carolina, no one can use a drone for surveillance of a person or private property. And Tennessee now specifies that it&rsquo;s a misdemeanour to use drones for surveillance of people who are hunting or fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&rsquo;s drone operations might soon become legally questionable too. Earlier this month, a California senator &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/calif-lawmakers-consider-drone-privacy-bill/31326004\"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would extend property rights into airspace, meaning that drones flying over private property would be considered trespassers. Just a few days before that, President Obama and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/15/a-brief-summary-of-the-faas-new-drone-regulations/\"&gt;announced new drone regulations&lt;/a&gt; as well, requiring &ndash; among other things &ndash; that drones must be under 55lb (25kg) and that operators must keep the flying vehicles in sight at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7xlr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the laws are murky, many private investigators steer clear of drones. &ldquo;The use of drones for surveillance is highly restricted by law,&rdquo; said Kelly Riddle, a private investigator in Texas. &ldquo;There are air space regulations as well as privacy laws that can easily be violated. Obtaining video using a drone has thus far been something that we have been advised is illegal.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because drones are often used to observe activities that can&rsquo;t be seen via a direct line of sight at ground level. Going out of your way to spy on such activities is considered an invasion of privacy, says Riddle. A lot of Wright&rsquo;s work sidesteps this privacy question, because it involves helping schools and churches monitor their own property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the use of drones will be restricted under a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations in the United States sooner than later. But in the meantime Wright will continue to use them when they can help with her work. But she also says that regardless of the legality, if someone thinks their privacy is being compromised, they&rsquo;re going to do something about it. That can mean shooting down drones &ndash; another activity that &lt;a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/man-shoots-down-drone-lawyers-scratch-their-heads\"&gt;may or may not be legal&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;I think a lot of my colleagues have lost them and realised that it is a tool, and if you invade someone&rsquo;s privacy, well, if they can hit it they will.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-18T11:27:45Z","HeadlineLong":"The private investigator who spies using drones","HeadlineShort":"I use a drone to spy on people","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Aerial vehicles are the latest tool for private detectives  but for how long?

The pair have been friends since childhood. Within the first year of their friendship, nerve damage inflicted by an inherited genetic condition robbed Haug of his sight and hearing. He was nine. But children are natural innovators. &ldquo;We started to invent languages and forms of communication just because we were kids and we wanted to play,&rdquo; says Schwengber. &ldquo;It was annoying that he couldn't hear me, and I couldn't write something down,&rdquo; she says. So the two invented their own tactile language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Haug and Schwengber grew older, they replaced their private language with one that is more widely understood: Lorm, a tactile alphabet spelled out with strokes to the hand. It was invented in the nineteenth century by Hieronymus Lorm &ndash; an anonymous pseudonym, for Austrian-born poet, journalist, and novelist &lt;a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12762.html\"&gt;Heinrich Landesmann&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; and is still used today by the deaf-blind community in German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv0k9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the importance of Lorm to Haug and Schwengber. But Lorm, and other forms of tactile signing, have their limits. A reliance on physical contact between communicators has historically constrained the social circles of the deaf-blind to those they can meet face-to-face (or more accurately hand-to-hand) on a regular basis &ndash; and even within this relatively small group of people, only those who take the time to learn and practice Lorm can really become part of a deaf-blind individual&rsquo;s social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Haug&rsquo;s social circle currently consists of about five people: his mother, Schwengber, teachers, and therapists. Once a year he spends about 10 days visiting relatives in Stuttgart in Southern Germany. &ldquo;The first five days they need to practice Lorming, so they can remember the letters, and by the tenth day when they are quite fast, it's time to go back home,&rdquo; explains Schwengber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these drawbacks might soon disappear, if a new invention by Tom Bieling is commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactile translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling, a researcher at the Design Lab in Berlin, has developed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.design-research-lab.org/projects/mobile-lorm-glove/\"&gt;glove kitted out with fabric pressure-sensors&lt;/a&gt;. By translating a tactile hand touch alphabet into digital text, the mobile glove could eliminate the necessity of hand-to-hand physical contact for deaf-blind communication. Even better, because a great deal of online communication is text-based, the glove could act as a translating device that allows people who are deaf-blind to communicate freely with anyone &ndash; and for anyone to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an invention reminiscent of the outlandish gadgets seen in James Bond movies, and it won Bieling first prize in the 2014 Falling Walls Lab competition &ndash; a kind of TED Talks meets Dragon&rsquo;s Den &ndash; held annually in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1kq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first prototype was made from Gore-Tex fabric and felt much like an ordinary glove, Bieling explains. It&rsquo;s embedded with small vibrating motors, and &ldquo;as soon as you receive an incoming message, it starts vibrating on those dots where the letters are positioned&rdquo;, he says. In the current version, users can adjust the intensity and speed of the incoming tactile messages according to their reading skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the whole hand area of the glove is now wired for sensory input, &ldquo;just like a tablet [computer]&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The system recognises both the position and pattern of the finger movement.&rdquo; So users can also spell out their own messages.If a sign isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;typed&rdquo; quite correctly, the Lorm glove system recognises the closest symbol &ndash; just like a spell checker on your smart phone. For example, a circle in the hand would be an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, explains Bieling, and even if you type a triangle or a square, the system is clever enough to recognise the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; as the closest correct symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enhancing independence&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking through Schwengber&rsquo;s translation, Haug describes the glove prototype as a bit slower than what he is used to in terms of receiving messages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his teacher or his mother Lorming,&rdquo; says Schwengber, compared with her own speedy pace. &ldquo;But he really likes it,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the glove, &ldquo;I can send and receive &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; says Haug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling&rsquo;s project is part of his doctoral studies exploring links between design and ability. He argues that feeling disabled is a question of design &ndash; a ramp, for instance, is easy for anyone to ascend, even if they are in a wheelchair. He hopes that his design will enable deaf-blind people to engage with a broader spectrum of their community and &ldquo;gain access to a broader range of information, thus enhancing their independence&rdquo;. But he also hopes that gaining knowledge about alternative communication systems can profit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1wv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haug, now 22, currently lives with his mother in Spreewald, about 100km south of Berlin. He is studying massage therapy in the hopes of pursuing it as a profession. He would like to move to Berlin, explains Schwengber, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that has thus far eluded him because of the lack of assistance available. The glove could expand Haug&rsquo;s ability to stay in close touch with those closest to him while living at a distance. But it could do more than that: it could allow him to expand his currently small social circle dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Haug, with help from Schwengber, has been having fun on Twitter, a medium enabling him to converse with people who need never know that he is deaf-blind. On social media, Haug is &ldquo;just a person behind the Twitter account saying something&rdquo;, explains Schwengber. Haug describes it as a bit like playing carnival, because &ldquo;you just mask up and say anything you want&rdquo;, translates Schwengber. &ldquo;Content matters, not the person,&rdquo; she explains. So Haug gets a kick out of the reaction from followers when he Tweets amusing things, something he&rsquo;d be able to do more easily and independently with his own Lorm glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the first thing he would say with a Lorm glove of his own, Haug says he would talk to his cousin in Stuttgart and ask him if he can remember the name of an interesting film they recently spoke about. (Schwengber and Haug often go to the cinema &ndash; where Schwengber simultaneously translates the movie for Haug via Lorm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted the digital revolution and the amazing new connections it has offered. For those constrained by a barrier of unseen sights and unheard sounds, it was once unexplored territory &ndash; but with the Lorm glove, they might just have that world in the palm of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-13T09:29:01Z","HeadlineLong":"The glove that transmits touch over the internet","HeadlineShort":"The glove turning touch into talk","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Blind-deaf people are often forced to live in a small and isolated world.

If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

It ends with a final &ldquo;salute&rdquo; from the pilot to indicate that the aircraft is ready to be catapulted off the deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the X-47B, the US Navy&rsquo;s newest prototype combat aircraft, prepares for its first carrier launch early next year, there will be no salute.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because there will also be no pilot. Instead, the X-47B will blink its wingtip navigation lights, a robotic nod to the human salute (and mimicking what the Navy does for night launches), before the catapult officer presses the launch button, and the robotic aircraft is flung off the front of the ship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of development, and recent land-based tests, the highly anticipated carrier flight for this stealthy, tailless, unmanned drone is imminent. &ldquo;It should be in early in 2013,&rdquo; says Carl Johnson, vice president and program manager at defence firm Northrop Grumman, which builds the X-47B. &ldquo;We have to coordinate ship schedules as well as all the other airspace issues.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X-47B is a strike fighter-sized prototype drone developed as part of the United States Navy's UCAS-D (Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration) programme, which aims to develop technologies necessary to field a combat drone on carriers. As a result, it has folding wings and is built for the rigors of sea life, including salt water, deck handling and of course take-off and landing from an aircraft carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the X-47B is a prototype, the Navy hopes to actually field operational unmanned combat aircraft on carriers by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unmanned &ldquo;flying wing&rdquo; aircraft, which takes some of its design cues from Northrop Grumman&rsquo;s B-2 stealth bomber, is supposed to demonstrate reconnaissance and strike capabilities&mdash;it has a full-sized weapons bay, although the prototype will not fly with weapons.&nbsp; And, unlike existing drones, which are usually remotely &ldquo;flown&rdquo; by pilots once in the air, the X-47B is designed to fly autonomously, with just the occasional click of a mouse from an operator to send it instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big deal, but it&rsquo;s an extension of something that was already happening,&rdquo; says Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Brooking Institution in Washington, DC, and the author of Wired for War, a book on the military&rsquo;s robotics revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craft was revealed in 2008 but is only now undergoing sea tests aboard the USS Harry S. Truman, including moving around on the carrier. Whilst this kind of trial may not sound remarkable, in some ways it&rsquo;s one of the more challenging steps toward proving that the X-47B, which weighs in at 20,000 kg (44,000 lb) and has a 20m (62 ft) wing span, is ready for flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting around on a crowded flight deck is difficult, says Johnson, because the aircraft must maneuver very close the edge of the carrier, sometimes pivoting so that it appears that half the airplane is hanging off the ship. &ldquo;The precision involved in doing that is very difficult with a pilot following directions from a person on the deck,&rdquo; says Johnson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult to do that as well with an unmanned system.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the engineers have built a wireless remote control device that can be used to move the aircraft around the deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X-47B has already been tested on land in conditions meant to mimic operations on a carrier deck, including a catapult launch, but operating on a real carrier crowded with people and equipment presents fresh challenges. &nbsp;For example, the X-47B must be tested for electromagnetic interference, in other words, making sure that the aircraft&rsquo;s electronic systems don&rsquo;t clash with the myriad radar and emitters that are on a ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;While we go through a rigorous test program, you really learn a lot when you&rsquo;re at sea and you&rsquo;re validating your system against the true environment of the carrier,&rdquo; says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well with these tests, the Navy will then be ready for its first at-sea flight. This will likely be a short affair, according to Johnson, and will start with a catapult launch and end with the aircraft landing not on the carrier, but on firm ground. Later that year, the X-47B will also perform an &ldquo;arrested landing,&rdquo; meaning it will land back on the aircraft carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key flight test will take place in 2014, when the X-47 demonstrates that it can perform autonomous aerial refueling. Currently, the craft has a range of around 3,200km (2,000 miles) and can stay aloft for six hours. But for effective operations, the Navy would like it to stay aloft for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head-to-head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if all those tests go smoothly, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the X-47B will actually be deployed. The stealthy, aircraft is still merely a prototype. The Navy soon plans to launch a new program to develop an operational unmanned combat aircraft, which will involve fielding up to half a dozen armed drones on carriers by the end of the decade as part of what&rsquo;s called the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early next year, the Navy will hold a competition to build the new drone. That means Northrop, the incumbent, will have to compete against other companies, including Lockheed Martin, which built the stealthy RQ-170 (famously captured by Iran), and General Atomics, which makes the familiar Reaper and Predator drones, and Boeing, which developed the X-45, a one-time competitor to Northrop&rsquo;s drone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as a prototype, however, the X-47B&rsquo;s upcoming launch from an aircraft carrier, the &ldquo;heart of US naval aviation&rdquo;, marks a significant watershed for drones, says Singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the places where we haven&rsquo;t seen them yet.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the X-47B&rsquo;s upcoming flight is not about proving that drones can work&mdash;that&rsquo;s already been done&mdash;but expanding how and where they are used. &ldquo;The Wright Brothers moment already happened,&rdquo; says Singer. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in the equivalent of 1920s and 1930s.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Where science, security and secrets collide.

Perhaps more crucially, the Boeing-designed plane is operated by the US Air Force and its mission is a closely held secret, prompting a slew of speculation about its true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the first X-37B was launched in 2010, amateur satellite spotters have carefully followed the robotic spacecraft&rsquo;s orbit, while those unconnected with the program have speculated that the plane could be anything from an anti-satellite weapon to so-called &ldquo;on demand reconnaissance,&rdquo; shorthand for a spy satellite that can be placed over any country in the world. Compounding the mystery was the launch of a second vehicle in 2011, which stayed in orbit for 469 days, long exceeding the Air Force&rsquo;s stated maximum requirement of 270 days for the spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a third launch is slated for 11 December, according to an Air Force spokesperson, once again ramping up the rumour mill. So, what do we actually know about the plane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports focused on the X-37B&rsquo;s seeming resemblance, at least in size and weight, to &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar\"&gt;the X-20 Dynasoar&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dynamic Soarer), a 1950s-era hypersonic vehicle that was envisioned for a variety of military missions, including bombing and sabotaging enemy satellites. However, experts familiar with the X-37B programme emphasized that its technology is actually closer to the recently retired space shuttle (a &lt;a href=\"http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2011/CDReadymspace11_2426/PV2011_7315.pdf\"&gt;fact reinforced by Boeings&rsquo; proposal for a crewed version of the vehicle&lt;/a&gt; known as the X-37C). The Air Force blandly described the role of the X-37B in &lt;a href=\"http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16639\"&gt;a factsheet given to media&lt;/a&gt; as a \"reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Air Force also says the mini-shuttle has two objectives: testing &ldquo;reusable spacecraft technologies&rdquo; and conducting &ldquo;experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth&rdquo;. Again, this is similar to the stated aims of the space shuttle. But many forget that earlier craft also had a secret military role. Although ostensibly a civilian program, it conducted a series of missions from 1982-1992 on behalf of the National Reconnaissance Office, carrying a series of classified spy satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most outside experts now agree that it&rsquo;s likely the robotic space plane is being used for some sort of secret reconnaissance. &ldquo;I think the guess that makes most sense is quick-response tactical imaging, meaning hours to a couple of days from request to delivery,&rdquo; says Allen Thomson, a former CIA analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson says it is also possible that it could have a more mundane but useful task, such as &ldquo;maintaining up-to-date general purpose mapping imagery.&rdquo; However, if that is the case, Thomson says that it could be a waste of money. &ldquo;I think that the commercial satellites could and should do that cheaper and better than X-37B,&rdquo; he says. It is a view &lt;a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/the-x-37b-space-plane.html\"&gt;backed by parts of the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the X-37B launches comes in the middle of a larger debate about the role of government-operated spy satellites, which have proven enormously costly but can provide some of the most advanced imagery, versus commercial satellite imagery. The US intelligence community recently slashed its budget for commercial imagery, indicating that it was going back to greater reliance on its own classified satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view that the X-37B is a reconnaissance platform is strengthened by observations from amateur satellite watchers, who track the vehicles&rsquo; orbits, and noticed that it has similar orbits to spy satellites and scientific remote sensing craft. In addition, they noticed the craft changing its orbital path several times during its test flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected, says Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport. &ldquo;The upcoming launch will continue just to see what the vehicle can do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;One of the things they are testing is maneuverability. The problem with satellites in orbit is they are very predictably in certain orbits at certain times, and thus vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons (ASAT).&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson-Freese says the military has long been interested in the ability of a spacecraft that has &ldquo;the ability to evade, to maneuver, to not be in a predicable place at a predicable time.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects the Air Force will be &ldquo;pressing the envelope for manoeuvrability and duration&rdquo; during the X-37B&rsquo;s next flight. &ldquo;That will give them the idea of potential missions where avoidance of ASATs comes into play.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;No weapons&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although its orbits may be difficult to predict in advance, its tracks show where the X-37B has been and its likely purpose, says Brian Weeden, a technical advisor at the Secure World Foundation, a Washington-based foundation that focuses on space issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he says, the X-37B flew at inclination of 42.79 degrees, which tells you how far north and south in latitude the spacecraft can see. &ldquo;The tradeoff is that something at a 90 degree polar orbit covers the whole world, but its frequency is less; it may arrive only every couple of days,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If something is 40 or 45 degrees, it would be covering a smaller portion [of the earth], but more often. &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a 42.79 degree inclination, the X-37B would be useful for looking at a geographic region such as the Middle East, says Weeden, pouring cold water on one theory that that it was used to spy on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16423881\"&gt;China&rsquo;s spacelab, Tiangong-1&lt;/a&gt;. And given the current political context, he says, the Middle East &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeden also suggests the X-37B&rsquo;s orbit may indicate that the military is trying out a new sensor system, such as radar imaging or &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging\"&gt;hyperspectral sensors&lt;/a&gt;, which collect information across different wavelengths. He suggests this could be the case, because unlike satellites collecting light in the visible wavelength, the X-37B&rsquo;s orbits are not synchronized with the sun, a trick used to maintain a predictable angle between the sun, satellite and ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, like with many of the theories surrounding the X-37B, he warns, &ldquo;it is just speculation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Air Force itself is silent about the plane&rsquo;s use, only speaking to allay fears that it was a weapon. \"I don't know how this could be called weaponisation of space. It's just an updated version of the space shuttle type of activities in space,\" said Gary Payton, the Air Force's deputy undersecretary for space programmes, in 2010.&nbsp; \"We, the Air Force, have a suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever its purpose; the X-37B is perhaps one of the few bright spots among the Pentagon&rsquo;s hypersonic test vehicle programs.&nbsp; The Air Force&rsquo;s X-51A Waverider, a scramjet powered hypersonic missile, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120815-hypersonic-ambitions-fall-short\"&gt;suffered a fatal mishap earlier this year on a test flight&lt;/a&gt;, and never reached hypersonic speeds.&nbsp; Separately, another hypersonic prototype, known as the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14497641\"&gt;suffered mishaps in both flight tests&lt;/a&gt;, plunging into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those other efforts, which are focused on creating missiles, are still in early testing phase, while the X-37B is clearly further along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think the one interesting question is whether this is just test and evaluation, or is it being used to be support real world operations,&rdquo; says Weeden. But like most questions about the plane, it is one that is currently impossible to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"X-37B: Secrets of the US military spaceplane","HeadlineShort":"Secrets of US military spaceplane","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"As the US Air Force prepares for the third launch of its mysterious X-37B vehicle, BBC Future looks at what is known about the classified project.

What, though, does this say about the increasing delegation not only of daily tasks to machines, but of potentially life-changing decisions themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a life and death dilemma that could soon be science fact rather than fiction. As psychology professor Gary Marcus pointed out in a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/11/google-driverless-car-morality.html\"&gt;piece for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, driverless cars are now street-legal in three American states and could soon be cruising into a garage near you. But if your driverless car were hypothetically to encounter a bus full of schoolchildren on the wrong side of the road, how should it react: should it make a decision to swerve, preventing a collision but putting your life at risk; or should it collide with the bus if there&rsquo;s a greater chance of you surviving? &ldquo;If the decision must be made in milliseconds,&rdquo; Marcus reasons, &ldquo;the computer will have to make the call.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cars are an interesting case study because they already represent one of the most hazardous technological environments most of us enter on a regular basis &ndash; and because the belief that technology should make this environment as safe as possible has been accepted, and been saving lives, for decades. As a famous adage of product design puts it, once you&rsquo;ve built the car, your task is not simply to hope that you can prevent all accidents, but to design a better car crash &ndash; that is, to make those inevitable occasions on which things go wrong as unlikely as possible to cause fatal harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimising harm is a clear enough good. What happens, though, to ethical issues in design when the product you&rsquo;re creating is itself going to be making decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus&rsquo; driverless car scenario riffs off the famous &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\"&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;: a thought experiment that asks subjects to decide between pushing one man off a bridge in order to save the lives of several others trapped in the path of a runaway railway trolley, or allowing that one man to survive while the others meet their doom. Most respondents are unwilling physically to push another human being to their death even if it would save multiple lives &ndash; one of the factors the test is designed to measure. A machine&rsquo;s response, though, would depend entirely upon the decision-making model encoded by its creators. One robot might refuse to act; one might save the many; one might not even recognize a choice exists. It&rsquo;s up to us to decide which program to write. But once we&rsquo;ve done it and set things in motion, it&rsquo;s up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programming this into cars is one thing. Weapons are quite another &ndash; and represent perhaps the most urgent testing-ground for machine ethics today. Early this December, Iran boasted that it had &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20594431\"&gt;captured a US ScanEagle drone&lt;/a&gt; over its airspace; one of the most basic models of the thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles that have become the standard stuff of warfare over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Paul Wallich&rsquo;s child-minding quadcopter, most drones are more like sophisticated remote-controlled aircraft than autonomous decision-makers. Late November, though, saw some of the first tests of what &lt;a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/news/us-drone-launch-autonomous-986/\"&gt;some news outlets colourfully labelled a &ldquo;killer robot&rdquo;:&lt;/a&gt; a US Navy stealth drone piloted by artificial intelligence. Snappily named the X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System, the 19m- (62ft-) wide aircraft is designed to take split-second decisions on its own initiative &ndash; and even land itself on an aircraft carrier &ndash; while remaining under the overall control of human operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as anything, it&rsquo;s the relationship between these human operators and their subject that&rsquo;s most disturbing. Thought experiments like the trolley problem demonstrate something self-evident but extremely significant in moral thinking: how our sense of obligation is modified by distance and immediacy. We feel differently about pushing someone off a bridge with our own hands than we do about pushing a button to achieve the same result. Weapons are real-world examples of this: the arrow differs from the fist, the rifle from the arrow, the bomb from the gun. And by the time you reach autonomous systems, many of the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; setting them in motion will have taken place months or even years ago: as part of a process of programming and design whose eventual consequences may be entirely unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all this sounds rather removed from real life, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the cutting edge of today&rsquo;s battlefield will represent little more than the state-of-the-art in domestic appliances a decade from now. Such is the speed of technological change, and the steady migration of its moral conundrums towards the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s a field in which the ghostly outlines of future controversy are already clearly visible. If a drone can oversee your child&rsquo;s journey to school today, will it be driving you both to work tomorrow &ndash; and should you insist on this, if the machine is demonstrably a safer driver than you? If robot soldiers can fight for your country without risking your sons&rsquo; and daughters&rsquo; lives, should you gratefully embrace automated warfare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are new questions, but answering them means grappling with ancient ethical issues about responsibility. What does it mean to hold someone responsible not only for their actions, but for the chains of consequence they set snaking through the world? And what does it mean to exercise human ingenuity responsibly, given the ever-expanding scope of our powers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the best contemporary answer may mean giving up some of that power &ndash; and asking what it means to create machines that can take responsibility for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

Then and now, most airliners have two wings, a cigar-shaped fuselage and a trio of vertical and horizontal stabilizers at the tail. If it isn&rsquo;t broke, the mantra has been, why fix it, particularly when your design needs to travel through the air at several hundred miles an hour packed with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that conservative view could soon change. Rising fuel prices, increasingly stringent pollution limits, as well as a surge in demand for air travel, mean plane designers are going back to their drawing boards. And, now, radical new shapes and engine technologies are beginning to emerge, promising the biggest shake-up in air travel since de Haviland introduced the first commercial jet airliner in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would be wrong to say nothing has changed in the last few decades, says Rich Wahls, an aerodynamicist at Nasa&rsquo;s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. &nbsp;&ldquo;New model airliners don&rsquo;t come out every year like cars, but it&rsquo;s not as if they haven&rsquo;t been evolving under the skin the whole time. There&rsquo;s so much more technology in there nowadays.&rdquo; &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier improvements went mostly unnoticed because they focused on building better and quieter turbine engines with higher performance and improved fuel consumption. There have also been huge strides in computer controls and fly-by-wire systems, which make a big difference to the pilot, but not to the passengers. And in recent years, the biggest development has been the use of strong, but lightweight plastics and composite materials rather than metals, reducing the weight of planes and the amount of fuel they need to burn. This has also allowed the development of &ldquo;radical&rdquo; new planes like the giant Airbus A380 and the Boeing Dreamliner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite these advances, aviation engineers know there is still much to be done. Take fuel prices, for instance, which have soared in recent years. Despite modern planes being 60% to 70% more efficient than those built 60 years ago, aviation fuel expenditures now account for a quarter of an airlines operating expenses, placing them on a par with labor costs. In 2011, large US air carriers paid half again as much for fuel as what they paid in 2000. Add the fact that global airline travel is expected to grow to 3.3 billion annually by 2014 (up one third from 2009), and it&rsquo;s clear why engineers are searching for new ways to boost performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest efforts to rethink the airplane is being conducted by Nasa&rsquo;s Subsonic Fixed-Wing program, a collaboration between the US aerospace agency and industrial partners including Boeing, GE, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Pratt &amp; Whitney, as well as academic institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking to see if we can develop technologies that can get us yet another 60 to 70% improvement in fuel efficiency,&rdquo; says Wahls. In addition, the project wants to engineer new designs with a 71-decibel decrease in noise emissions and a four-fifths fall in nitrogen oxide pollutants from current standards. And, if these kinds of goals weren&rsquo;t already aggressive enough, the team wants any new technology to enter service between 2030 and 2035 - a mere blink of an eye in an industry in which commercial aircraft can have multi-decade life spans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We are trying to determine which technologies are worth pursuing; those that might get us anywhere near our goals,&rdquo; says Wahls&rsquo; boss, Ruben Del Rosario, subsonic fixed-wing program manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planes under investigation by Nasa range from the extreme to the slightly more conventional. For example, Boeing&rsquo;s Sugar Volt is a design that came about as part of the manufacturers Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (Sugar) project. The design &ndash; like many new concepts - is based around the idea of maximizing the plane&rsquo;s lift. This reduces the amount of power needed to keep the plane in the air, as well as the amount of fuel it must burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugar Volt does this by using very long, narrow, flexible wings. They are so long that engineers needed to brace them with under-wing truss support struts, making the aircraft resemble the Piper Cub and other light, high-winged planes. The SugarVolt&rsquo;s wings are extended in order to increase lift, allowing shorter take-off distances and requiring less power in flight. They are so long, in fact, that the Boeing designers may have to fit them with hinges so that they could fit in existing airports and boarding gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burning up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, are other ways to improve performance than just making longer wings. A team from MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for example, put forward the D8 for consideration by Nasa. This &ldquo;double-bubble&rdquo; aircraft design, features a double-wide fuselage composed of two standard body cylinders melded together side-by-side, as well as low-swept wings that cut drag and weight. The idea of the wider body shape is to increase lift generated by the fuselage, rather than it being mostly dead weight slung between two wings. The extra lift and reduced drag cuts back on the quantity of fuel that the engines must burn. If the jet were built today from standard aluminum alloys it could provide a 50% reduction in fuel use, according to the MIT designers; a low-mass polymer-composite version could give 70% efficiency gains. In addition, because the D8&rsquo;s turbine engines sit on top of the fuselage in a box-shaped tail, they would cut the amount of engine noise broadcast to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The D8&rsquo;s idea for generating greater lift is taken to an extreme in another design called the N3-X hybrid wing-body airplane, which Nasa developed in-house. At first glance, the N3-X looks a lot like a so-called flying wing design, used by planes such as the US Air Force&rsquo;s B-2 stealth bomber. These comprise a single, thick triangular wing that enclose all of the plane&rsquo;s contents - cockpit, stores, engines, fuel tanks and flight surfaces. But, unlike the B-2 flying wing, the N3-X hybrid wing-body also features two thin, rather conventional wings attached to the sides of its ultra-wide fuselage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary advantage of the hybrid, or blended, wing-body design is better fuel efficiency, Del Rosario says. Like a flying wing, the hybrid aircraft produces lift with its entire aerodynamic airframe, thus ridding itself of the drag associated with the cylindrical fuselage and the tail surfaces of a conventional plane. As with the D8, the more lift that can be produced overall, the less effort is needed from the engines, which in turn means less fuel must be burned. Fuel efficiency could be raised further by building the airframe from lightweight polymer composite materials instead of metals, Del Rosario says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool running&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers are aware, however, that new airframe shapes will only get them part of the way to their goals. To really make a difference, particularly to fuel consumption and engine noise, planes will also need radically new propulsion systems mounted or integrated into the airframe in novel ways. And, like car designers, aircraft manufacturers makers are beginning to explore the possibilities of electric and hybrid engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing&rsquo;s Sugar Volt concept, for example, would use a hybrid-electric propulsion system that combines fuel-burning (turbine) engines, electric motors and electrochemical storage batteries&mdash;a propulsion concept not totally unlike that inside a Toyota Prius. The hybrid system would let the operators choose to draw engine power from the turbines or the batteries, whichever provides the most benefit for the specific segment of the flight&mdash;takeoff, landing, cruise, and so forth. &ldquo;You can envision a 737-class airliner using the combination of turbine and electric power for take off and then, depending on the situation, switching over to cruise on one or the other,&rdquo; says Marty Bradley, principal investigator for subsonic ultra-green aircraft research at Boeing Research and Technology in Bellevue, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasa&rsquo;s N3-X is also designed around a completely new engine concept, called turboelectric distributed propulsion. It splits the main functions of a standard turbine engine in two - generating power by burning fuel and creating thrust by blowing air rearward with a large fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to use two large turbine engines to drive electric generators that would produce electricity to power 15 electric motor-driven, thrust-producing fans that would be embedded across the top rear of the broad fuselage. Such a configuration could be very efficient, Del Rosario says. The array of small electric propulsion fans at the stern of N3-X enables the designers to cut drag significantly by accelerating the flow of drag-causing air moving over the upper surface of the fuselage, keeping efficiency-sapping air friction at a minimum. Like the D8, the top-mounted propulsor fans would also effectively lower noise emissions because the body would come between them and the ground below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airliner concept may have an Achilles&rsquo; heel, though. For such a system to reach maximum fuel-efficiency targets, the electronics, generators and motors may need to be built from superconducting (zero-resistance) materials, meaning the jet&rsquo;s electrics would have to be super-cooled by liquid hydrogen at &minus;253C (&minus;423F) or liquid nitrogen at -196C (321F) to make them work. This cryogenic technology is not yet fully practical and could take decades to prove out. Recent studies indicate, however, that substantial fuel-consumption gains could still be obtained by using existing electrical technology running at ambient temperatures, according to Del Rosario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that scheme sounds far out, other manufacturers are looking at developing fully electric systems for the 2050 time-frame. Aircraft engineers and designers at Eads, the parent firm of Airbus, for instance, have proposed a rather extreme concept called the Voltaire. The bulbous, 50-seat fuselage with two, long slender wings and a giant propeller on the tail, make it resemble a submarine. The concept, first put forward in 2011, would use next-generation batteries to power high-efficiency superconducting electric motors that would in turn drive the giant counter-rotating propellers mounted in a cylindrical shroud at the tail. Unlike any of the Nasa concepts, it is designed to be zero-emission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sling shot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, anyone thinking that the electric Voltaire airliner may fly any time soon, needs to think again, says Johannes Stuhlberger, head of the global innovation network, power and flight propulsion at Eads. &ldquo;The development of electric aircraft not only depends on the speed at which battery technology improves, but also how fast electrical equipment - the motors - get better.&rdquo; Electric motors would need efficiencies of around 95%, he adds, noting that for any new system to become a reality will require &ldquo;tremendous improvements in the power-to-mass ratio of the entire propulsion system, while still keeping it affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shorter term, engineers at the Airbus group are trying to reduce fuel-consumption emissions by developing novel launch systems, similar to those found on naval aircraft carriers. In one radical concept, a low-slung carriage vehicle with an airliner mounted on its back would accelerate down the tarmac and loft the plane into the air. Such a device would substantially reduce the initial power required for a passenger plane to take off. Airbus envisages the eco-climb system moving into position automatically and assisting airliners to climb steeper and reach cruising altitude faster and from shorter runways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of these developments will undoubtedly lead to changes in the passengers&rsquo; in-flight experience. Catapult take-offs will likely mean passengers will be thrust back into their seats more firmly than happens now. Ultra-wide bodied planes will likely mean fewer window per seat for the occupants and their larger seat capacities could also lead to slower passenger-deplaning procedures both at the airport and in emergency landing situations. But there will also be benefits from these new wider spaces, which could, for example, accommodate large communal social spaces for kids more commonly found on cruise ships, whilst quiet electric engines could mean a good night&rsquo;s sleep for travelers normally disturbed by the drone of turbine engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Are the extra carrots in the new designs worth the extra effort and costs they entail?&rdquo; asks Nasa&rsquo;s Wahls. Only time will tell. Many of these concepts are just that: concepts that are destined never to become a reality. However, like concept cars that push what is technologically possible on the road, these craft will probably inform the design of future airliners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when you gaze up at the skies in twenty years time, perhaps the airplane passing by will look different from those you grew up with after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:17:05Z","HeadlineLong":"Radical planes take shape","HeadlineShort":"Radical planes take shape","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Engineers and designers are giving commercial aircraft a makeover, in a bid to make them faster, greener and more efficient.

My informants, whose authentic statements I have never had reason to question before, have conveyed to me the startling news that each of these nations hopes someday to build robots 1,000 feet high!\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The piece went on to describe how these machines &ldquo;could crush the largest and most powerful war tank ever built by merely stamping on it&rdquo;. And, in case readers were stills struggling to imagine the size and power of these mechanical beasts, the newspaper ran a clarifying picture of two of them fighting &ndash; one raising a mace over its head ready to deliver a final blow to another automaton, which is lying on the ground amidst the wreck of buildings and tanks. The caption reads: &ldquo;In the event that the two 1,000-foot-tall enemy robots ever come face-to-face they will pound each other with their might, square iron fists, kick with their great steel legs and struggle to destroy each other while skyscrapers all around them fall to the ground&rdquo;. Quite how these machines were to be built with the technology of the day was a minor detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Droid fleet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, whilst it is easy to look back and smirk at articles like this, it should be seen in the context of the day. World War I &ndash; and the destruction it wrought - was still fresh in the minds of the &ldquo;Lost Generation&rdquo;. More than 9 million soldiers were killed, largely because technological advances such as machine guns, tanks and mustard gas. At the same time, the clouds of war were once again building over Europe. People were clinging on to any hope that the &ldquo;madness of 1914&rdquo; could be averted or &ndash; if another war was likely &ndash; that it could be fought without another terrible loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, at least to some people&rsquo;s minds, was the robot. These word &ldquo;robot&rdquo; was only invented in 1920 but the concept had started to gather steam in the preceding war years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take an October, 1918 issue of Electrical Experimenter - published just a month before the end of WWI. The magazine was the brainchild of It showcased one of Hugo Gernsback, the &ldquo;father of science fiction&rdquo;, and it featured one of his most radical and yet most prescient ideas for the future of war: the &ldquo;Automatic Soldier.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;As science advances, and as all sorts of infernal machines are thrown into a modern war, the men in the front line trenches become less and less anxious to bear the full brunt of high explosive shells, gas attacks, liquid fire and what not,&rdquo; the article reads. &ldquo;No matter how courageous a body of soldiers, their morale is bound to deteriorate considerably under a murderous mustard gas attack, or under a modern barrage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gernsback&rsquo;s &nbsp;design was inspired by a Danish engineer who had obtained patents on such an invention. Pictures show a fleet of these red droids proceeding along the trenches laying waste to a fragile &ndash; and obviously German &ndash; enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years &ndash; and with the approach of another war - terrible visions like these increased. For example, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt; 28, 1935 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antonio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.paleofuture.com/blog/2009/9/28/when-wars-are-fought-with-robot-soldiers-1935.html\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(San Antonio, TX) features illustrations from artist &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Nitsche\"&gt;Erik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Nitsche\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Nitsche\"&gt;Nitsche&lt;/a&gt;. These robots had machine guns for heads, robot scouts with movie camera faces, a twenty-five tube robot military band, and even a robot hospital for the repair of robot soldiers. &ldquo;When a human soldier gets a bullet in his heart, or in his liver or has himself partly blown to pieces, that is the end of that soldier,&rdquo; it reads. &ldquo;Not so with the robot. A new heart can be put in him as easily, almost, as changing a tire.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality, as is often the case, was less sensational. The term &ldquo;robot&rdquo; came to life in newspapers to describe the navigation units used by precision bombers that dropped their cargoes on cities across Europe, whilst the German Goliath tracked mine - a remote-controlled demolition vehicle known as the beetle tank to Allies - is regarded as one of the first &ldquo;robotic&rdquo; machines on the battlefield. The caterpillar-tracked vehicle was packed with explosives, operated by remote control and designed to drive under &ndash; and destroy &ndash; tanks. And with that, the robot was no longer an abstraction of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost generations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time there was a shift in how the machines of war were portrayed in popular culture.&nbsp; Prior to the war, the ideas for these fantastic robotic fighting machines often came from amateur inventors and&nbsp; were depicted in lurid colour in hobby magazines and news papers. These perhaps reflected the public view of warfare but were often a world away from reality.&nbsp; But, according to Joseph Corn and Brian Horrigan in their 1984 book Yesterday&rsquo;s Tomorrows, after WWII as the world entered the Cold War era &ldquo;members of the armed services, in league with scientists and engineers in universities and the defence industry, come to monopolize the crystal ball through which tomorrow&rsquo;s weapons are glimpsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this view took hold and accelerated, glimpses of the world we live in today become common place, even cropping up in children&rsquo;s books. &ldquo;A robot army spearheading an attack could be far more destructive than any human force,&rdquo; reads a piece in the 1981 kid&rsquo;s&rsquo; book World of Tomorrow: Future War and Weapons. &ldquo;Its leaders would still be human though. Safely situated far behind the fighting, they would order their robot battalions into action.&rdquo; The article goes on to detail a future where &ldquo;small pilotless aircraft packed with sensors and detectors of all kinds to plot enemy positions, measure forces and eavesdrop on their communications.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) commonly fly missions in the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. These drones are controlled by human beings in Nevada and for the first time in history the ability to attack an enemy in real time from the other side of the world is a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robot warriors, envisaged as a response to the horrors of World War I are now a reality. Today, the US military trains more people each year in the operation of unmanned drones than they do fighter pilots. There are currently over 7,000 unmanned aerial drones and over 12,000 robotic ground vehicles on the ground being used by the United State military. A mandate passed by the US Congress in 2002 has even dictated that a third of the US military be comprised of unmanned forces by 2015. It remains to be seen if they&rsquo;ll meet that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question, of course, is precisely where the new realities of robot warfare will take us. Just as the first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 forever changed the reality and scope of war, so too might autonomous robot soldiers shift our understanding of what it means to fight and to wage war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some way, it seems my generation - the Millennials - are part of our own lost generation. These technologies mean we have lost any connection to war and the real world destruction that it brings. By wrapping ourselves in pixels and coaxial cable we seem to be insulating ourselves from the horrors of the battlefield. At what cost, only future generations will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-04-04T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Robot history: The rise of the drone","HeadlineShort":"Robots go to war","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Lurid pictures from the last 100 years show the idea of military drones  and removing humans from the battlefield - has a long history.

For example, the US contains 6.5 million km (4 million miles) of roads &ndash; the most paved country in the world. At the other end of the scale is the tiny Pacific island of &lt;a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tv.html\"&gt;Tuvalu&lt;/a&gt; with just 8km (5 miles) &nbsp;&ndash; probably not the place to go for a driving holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;But it is not always big countries that have lots of roads and vice versa. Look at countries in Africa, for example.&nbsp; Algeria, Congo and Chad &ndash; some of the largest countries on the continent &ndash; still have relatively small numbers of arteries, meaning large parts remain inaccessible and cut off from the wider world.&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;In these places, delivering food, drugs or any necessity is a time-consuming, arduous process.&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;But a concept called &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://matternet.net/\"&gt;the Matternet&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; hopes to change that. The idea seems straightforward: build the &ldquo;roads&rdquo; of the future. But there&rsquo;s a big difference. These roads will be in the sky.&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The Matternet concept grew out of lengthy brainstorming sessions last summer at &lt;a href=\"http://singularityu.org/\"&gt;Singularity University&lt;/a&gt;, which is located at the NASA Research Park campus in Silicon Valley. The University was founded by Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.xprize.org/\"&gt;X-Prize Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and Dr. Ray Kurzweil, who is known for &lt;a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/\"&gt;his work in artificial intelligence and transhumanism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those involved in those sessions was Andreas Raptopoulos, an engineer with a life-long love of flying vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In the course, they asked us to come up with solutions to some of the globe's grand challenges,\" says Raptopoulos. \"And one of those was alleviating poverty.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quadcopter swarm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more the group thought about the problem of poverty, the more they felt it was, in large part, caused by the fact that millions of people are cut off, literally, from the global economy because of a lack of delivery infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The concept of using roads to move stuff around is a very, very old concept,\" Raptopoulos tells me. \"The US has now more than &nbsp;miles of roads. But should Africa try to replicate that? It is expensive, and it destroys the environment.\"&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the group considered the merits of an unconventional delivery system. Why not, they thought, use a network of unmanned aerial drones to move physical objects the way the internet carries small packets of information through various routes, and then puts all those pieces together again at the end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when the idea clicked for me,&rdquo; says Mint Wongviriyawong, who was also a member of the group. &ldquo;If you could use these UAVs to transport things from point-to-point, you could transport a lot of loads, autonomously, within a shorter time frame, and it could be done cheaply.&rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The group&rsquo;s hope was to one day allow developing countries to leapfrog expensive road networks in much that &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15659983\"&gt;same way that mobile phones have allowed them to leapfrog copper wires and landlines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;They decided, in a sense, to hack the road transportation system, and they decided to do it by looking up. In particular, they focused on quadcopters, which are small, hovering aircraft with four rotors. They can take off and land vertically, are light, and run on batteries. And they can be programmed to do what you want them to. If you want to see what you can do with quadcopters, for relatively little money, check out &lt;a href=\"http://diydrones.com/\"&gt;the DIY Drones website&lt;/a&gt;. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our intent is to use them for delivery,\" says Caitlin Sparks, who also worked on the Matternet project last summer. \"What's really interesting is how they can be networked and routed. If you put a whole fleet of them together, it becomes a really interesting prospect.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can imagine a very \"Jetsons-esque\" kind of future, right? With hundreds, maybe thousands of copters flying back and forth between, say, a farm in Africa and a market in a larger town. The copters would carry perhaps one or two pieces of fruit or vegetables at a time, for hours on end. It sounds inefficient compared to one big truck delivery, but Raptopoulos maintains that because the vehicles would be networked, and would function autonomously. \"You can move a lot of stuff around eventually.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, he says, it scales. \"You would start small, with point-to-point connections,\" Raptopoulos says. \"But as the system grows, it's like nodes in a computer network. Eventually, all the small nodes could be connected into a larger scale network of UAVs, and then some day a whole logistics system.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds great, but the obvious question remains: how do you even begin to build out such a system? And it is in answering that question that the original Matternet brainstorming group seems to have split along philosophical and practical lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raptopoulos and Sparks have now founded a company called &lt;a href=\"http://www.matternet.us/\"&gt;Matternet&lt;/a&gt;, after the name of the original concept. They are working on creating a fleet of vehicles that can carry various weights. For now, the focus is on quadcopters because they are the cheapest and easiest to modify. But, the size of the quadcopters limits the amount that can be carried to a couple of kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We'll start by emphasising high value payloads over volume or weight,\" says Raptopoulos. In the developing world, that would mean using the Matternet to help NGOs delivered much needed medicines, vaccines or food supplies to remote locations. In the developed world, it could mean using quadcopters in highly populated areas to carry precision electronic equipment, textiles, or pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Eventually,\" says Sparks, \"we would have a specialized fleet of different UAVs, of various sizes and different carrying capacities, that are suited to different tasks.\" They are thinking of various sizes and configurations of aircraft that could carry between five and 100kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First flight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also working on how to build a network of ground stations where these vehicles can pick up and deliver goods, receive their instructions, and swap batteries when needed. They are also writing their own operating system to control the machines. They envision it as a cloud-based operating system that would run the whole network, and would be responsible for routing goods in the most efficient ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others in the original group have a different vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If the idea of the Matternet is the same as the internet, we want everyone to be able to use it and see it,&rdquo; says Arturo Pelayo. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think it belongs to any one company.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelayo was a member of the original brainstorming team behind the Matternet at Singularity University. He and three others, including Mint Wongviriyawong, have formed a competing company called &lt;a href=\"http://aria-logistics.com/\"&gt;aria&lt;/a&gt;, short for &ldquo;autonomous roadless intelligent array.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aria is focused on creating the base stations for the network. Make a great platform for the network, the thinking goes, and let others create the open source applications and vehicles which they need and want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We see ourselves as the logistics part of it,&rdquo; says Wongviriyawong. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not focused on making things ourselves, but pulling it all together.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pelayo says he has already been contacted by many in the open source community who want to help with coding and development. Once that is done, it is over to local people to dictate how it is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;A village cooperative in Ghana, for example, could buy a base station,&rdquo; says Pelayo. &ldquo;The community would own that node, and figure out how best to use it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our passion,&rdquo; Wongviriyawong affirms. &ldquo;Let the local people figure out how best to use it, instead of us delivering a solution to them.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the subtleties of the different approaches are difficult to tease apart. For example, Sparks says that Matternet's solution is \"application agnostic\" as well. \"Both Matternet's design and business model are deeply bottom up,\" she says. \"We allow any customer to determine what they would like to do with our technology.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it won't be until both are able to demonstrate the technology, that the differences will be clear. And we may not have to wait long.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies, aria and Matternet, are pushing forward quickly, trying to get field tests up and running in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matternet has negotiated a contract with their first client, a global consultancy with a large presence in Turkey. They are moving forward with designs for their prototype quadcopter, and plan to run a pilot project with a UAV expert in Brazil in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, aria says it is talking with partners in the Middle East. By mid-year, the company hopes to be on the ground in various locations, conducting analysis of local customer needs. The group is also evaluating whether it the idea could work with water-based autonomous vehicles as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;No one approach is the best, or the only one,&rdquo; Arturo Pelayo says. &ldquo;And I think different ideas will help jump-start and inspire the entire ecosystem.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or have an idea that you would like Clark to investigate, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was updated on 27 February to include&nbsp;details&nbsp;about aria.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-02-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Matternet: Swapping roads for flying drones","HeadlineShort":"I hover dream: An end to roads","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Two start-ups want to replace road transport with swarms of tiny autonomous helicopters.

And, perhaps the most unintuitive part of it is that it is designed to make the roads more secure for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The biggest way augmented reality can be useful is in supporting safe driving,&rdquo; says Professor Anind Dey, of the&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/\"&gt;Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\"&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;The ability to enhance information around us that might otherwise be opaque to us is invaluable.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality\"&gt;AR&lt;/a&gt; is usually considered to be a live view of the real world, onto which extra data &ndash; usually pulled from the internet - is layered or superimposed. It is similar to the view of the world that Arnold Schwarzenegger had in the Terminator movies. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology is already well established elsewhere. For example, there are numerous smartphone apps that allow users to overlay the view from their camera with everything from directions and transport options to restaurant reviews and house prices. Point your phone at something of interest, power up your app and you are away.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like Google are taking it one step further. Earlier this &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17618495\"&gt;year the search giant unveiled its Google Glass project&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of minimal glasses that overlay a person&rsquo;s vision with everything from weather data, location and diary appointments. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is an idea that has been seized upon by other firms, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20462840\"&gt;such as Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now AR is making its way into cars. It builds on so-called &ldquo;heads up display&rdquo; (HUD) technology that is commonly used in fighter planes and began to make its way into high-end cars in the late 1990s. These HUDs are frequently used to project directions or speed onto the windscreen in the driver&rsquo;s line of sight to minimize the amount of time the driver takes their eyes off the road. But augmented reality could allow these displays to go much further than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking glass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Car manufacturers such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and GM have shown off various prototypes in recent years. For example, a Mercedes concept unveiled earlier this year and known as Dice allowed drivers to conjure up information about passing places of interest by merely pointing at them while friends driving past the car show up as an icon on the windscreen, alongside their social network status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another concept from GM, known as the enhanced vision system, uses an array of sensors and cameras mounted inside and outside the vehicle to monitor the environment around the car and the driver&rsquo;s eye and head movements. This information is then used to overlay the view from the windscreen with relevant information about driving conditions &ndash; such as the location of the building you are trying to find or dangers that you may not be aware of, such as an animal or child at the side of the road. Another mode marks the edges of the road when fog obscures the drivers view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other concepts take AR even further. Japanese car maker Toyota has shown off a prototype of &lt;a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20081402-48/toyota-demos-augmented-reality-enhanced-car-windows/\"&gt;&ldquo;enhanced car windows&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that would allow passengers to zoom in on places and objects of interest that they are passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the most extreme concept comes from designers at &lt;a href=\"http://tachilab.org/modules/projects/rpt.html\"&gt;Keio University in Japan&lt;/a&gt;, who are working on technology that will make the back seat of a car appear transparent, so that when drivers are reversing they can see everything around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experimental setup uses cameras mounted outside the car &lt;a href=\"http://tachilab.org/modules/projects/transparentcockpit.html\"&gt;to project an image inside the car in the driver&rsquo;s field of view&lt;/a&gt;. Using similar technology to a heads-up display, the image is shown on a reflective screen mounted behind and between the two front seats. When a driver looks back over his shoulder, he sees the &ldquo;real&rdquo; image out of the rear view window continued, through augmented reality, right down the seats to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovations like this may be a long way from going into production. But other uses of AR could appear much sooner. For example, the most common use of AR is to overlay the world with directions that are overlayed on the road in front of you. Almost all concepts show some variant of this and, earlier this year, electronics firm Pioneer claimed to introduce the &lt;a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/09/pioneer-touts-worlds-first-car-gps-with-augmented-reality/\"&gt;world&rsquo;s first GPS with AR&lt;/a&gt;, that can be installed in any vehicle.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of innovation would be helpful to any driver. But Professor Dey and his team believe it could be especially useful for &lt;a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Esjunikim/download/SJKimCHI09.pdf\"&gt;older people&lt;/a&gt;, whose sense of spatial awareness may be reduced. This is especially problematic when they must look down at a navigation system, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The amount of time being spent not looking out the windshield, and the number of times that occurs on a short drive, can get pretty high,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Particularly when you are talking about elder drivers who may have diminished facilities for driving, you want to reduce the amount of time they are looking away.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, he devised a simulator that projects the navigation system across the full width of the screen. The driver sees the real world, but with a map superimposed on top. As turns or streets come up, the map updates like a panning computerised window that is locked to the real world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the system is a prototype, it has given Prof Dey and his team clues about how a real system should work. For example, to ensure that one set of distractions is not replaced by another, he believes that drivers should be allowed to personalize a system so that they can receive notifications from the system in ways that feel intuitive to them, such as audio tones, or even by touch, using haptic feedback through the steering wheel and seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&ldquo;We should be using technologies like augmented reality to personalise the driving experience much more so that we are currently.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials have also flagged potential problems. For example, many of the subjects who have tried the system out in Professor Dey&rsquo;s simulator have reported that it feels like playing a computer game &ndash; this &nbsp;detachment from reality is an issue that the engineers know needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to lessen the impact of making a mistake,&rdquo; Professor Dey explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, and perhaps most importantly, more work needs to be done to work out what is the optimum amount of the windscreen that can be covered with AR graphics, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, augmented reality is only useful if the driver is in touch with the reality behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"The future of transport.

In the same way as the smartphone was changed forever by the arrival of the app, car manufacturers are now betting on these small pieces of software to drive the future of the automobile. Soon, customising your wheels could be as simple as tapping your dashboard touchscreen to download the latest must-have app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We already see many cars that have Google onboard, and Facebook and Bloomberg updates,&rdquo; says Sven Beiker, the executive director for the center for automotive research at Stanford University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he adds, apps could soon go a lot further than just letting you find your favourite music or communicating with your friends. By tapping into the mass of data your car produces, combined with the huge computing resources available on the web, apps could help save you &ndash; and everyone around you &ndash; fuel, time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is not a distant dream, he says. The groundwork for the fully connected car is being laid down now and could be with us sooner than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Some people say that 2012 is the year when we will see a breakthrough in the connected car,&rdquo; says Bieker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Car talk&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several manufacturers including Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi and &lt;a href=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-cloud-based-hondalinktm-connected-car-system-helps-drivers-put-away-their-phones-while-maintaining-intuitive-access-to-their-favorite-media-2012-07-18\"&gt;most recently Honda&lt;/a&gt; already offer basic connected car systems that allow a vehicle to hook up to the web through mobile phone networks. They act as a portal to the net, but also provide practical benefits such as alerting the driver to collisions, or delays on the road ahead, and automatically finding new routes to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, these tend to be the preserve of top-end vehicles. But that too is changing. According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.abiresearch.com/press/3934\"&gt;research firm ABI Research&lt;/a&gt;, 60.1% of cars will be connected to the web by 2017, whilst in Europe and North America, the figure will be closer to 80%. Soon, cars without connectivity will be a rarity rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the pioneering systems for in-car tech is Ford&rsquo;s Sync, which connects your smartphone and MP3 player to the car's dashboard. It allows drivers to make telephone calls and control the car&rsquo;s radio using their voice, amongst other things. It was developed with software giant Microsoft and was first released in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most of today&rsquo;s systems, the software is essentially a way of connecting the car to your smartphone. But, &lt;a href=\"http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=31712\"&gt;in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, Ford made the first steps towards blurring the boundaries between the mobile and the automobile when it released the Ford Sync API (application programming interface). This piece of code allowed trusted third-party developers to tap into Sync so that they could write apps that could work with &ndash; and be controlled by &ndash; the system. One of the first was the internet radio app Pandora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a model that is now used by several other manufacturers. For example, German car maker BMW &lt;a href=\"http://www.bmwblog.com/2012/07/10/bmw-ready-sdk-for-third-party-apps-android-apps-coming/\"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would allow vetted third-party apps developed for Google&rsquo;s Android phone software to work with its Connected Drive system (it already allowed the system to tap into some iPhone apps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But developments like this are just the start, according to Beiker. Modern cars are incredibly sophisticated, he says, with up to 80 different computer control units that monitor everything from engine performance and braking, to direction of travel, velocity and road conditions. At the moment cars tend to keep this information to themselves. Sharing it could open up a whole new world of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We are talking about changing the car&rsquo;s character from being introverted to being extroverted. So the car is just more talkative,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this a reality requires at least two important things to happen. First, car manufacturers need to make the data from their cars available, ideally in a standard format. And secondly, the data needs to be easily shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of these problems is again being tackled by manufacturers like Ford. Working with New York City-based developers &lt;a href=\"http://www.buglabs.net/\"&gt;Bug Labs&lt;/a&gt;, the car manufacturer has released a prototype system called &lt;a href=\"http://openxcplatform.com/\"&gt;OpenXC&lt;/a&gt;. Drivers install a small piece of hardware in their car which taps into the vehicles sensors and control units and spits them out in a format that can be read by compatible apps on Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;OpenXC allows us to investigate what developers can do when we present the car in the same way as they see a smartphone software platform,&rdquo; said Venkatesh Prasad, senior technical leader for Ford Research and Innovation, when the system debuted earlier this year. The system has since been distributed to firms and universities and has already spawned its first &ldquo;vehicle-aware&rdquo; applications.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first was created by India's HCL Technologies and allows a driver to automatically update select contacts with his or her location. The idea is that by monitoring location and speed data from the vehicle, the app can determine if the driver will be late for a meeting and can then send an email or text message without any driver intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last bit is important. Car manufacturers are all too aware that they need to minimise distractions from these systems while driving, hence the common use of voice recognition. They maintain that many drivers already use web, communication and entertainment services in their cars, so these systems actually reduce the risk of distractions and increase safety. However, it is unlikely that it will be left to car makers to decide what is and isn&rsquo;t appropriate. Already, regulators are beginning to scrutinise these systems and earlier this year, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2012/U.S.+Department+of+Transportation+Proposes+%27Distraction%27+Guidelines+for+Automakers\"&gt;launched a report&lt;/a&gt; that recommended voluntary guidelines for car manufacturers to reduce the risk of distraction.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Always on&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming that an acceptable solution can be found, the second part of the puzzle that needs to fall into place is how data is shared. At the moment, most manufacturers use proprietary computer systems, meaning that data produced by one car manufacturer is basically of little use to another. This becomes problematic for third-party app developers who would need to rewrite their code for each and every producer. But Beiker says that could soon change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I am expecting to see more and more applications that communicate with the vehicle directly, through a standardised interface,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I can very well imagine that over the next couple of years car companies might open up their firewall a little more, and say &lsquo;here is our app store&rsquo;.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One project attempting to solve the problem is the EU-sponsored &lt;a href=\"http://www.cvisproject.org/en/about_cooperative_systems/technologies/\"&gt;Cooperatives Vehicle Infrastructure Systems project&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to develop a &ldquo;universal communications module&rdquo; that can read data from any vehicle. The project has already published &lt;a href=\"http://www.cvisproject.org/en/news/EuropeanStandardforITSCommunicationsArchitecture.htm\"&gt;the architecture&lt;/a&gt; of the system it hopes to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It envisages that data would be channelled in two ways: to other cars and over mobile connections and DSRC (dedicated short-range communications) networks &ndash; a wi-fi like technology that is currently used for electronic road toll connection, for example. Car-to-car communication could be useful in safety systems, for example, allowing a car to prevent a driver pulling out of a blind junction if another vehicle is approaching or forming the basis of a peer-to-peer collision warning system to spot and advise about hazards on the road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the intention of the mobile and DSRC network is to build an &ldquo;always-connected&rdquo; communications channel between the car and the net. This opens up the possibility of each car sharing and consuming unique cuts of information. Obvious applications include streaming entertainment apps and software that can tap into the speed and direction of travel of a car to &ldquo;crowdsource&rdquo; traffic updates. This would benefit the driver by giving them personalised driving information, but would also allow the road network as a whole to become more intelligent, allowing traffic control systems to route cars around accidents, or divert traffic around congested areas. Further down the line, these systems could tap into a cars emissions data to allow pollution credit trading in real time, or automatically reserve parking spaces by calculating when you will arrive at your location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hack attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An always-on connection &ndash; coupled with a standardised, machine-readable data format &ndash; also raises other intriguing possibilities, such as allowing vehicles to tap into the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; &ndash; the vast amount of computing power available on the web. This could create a host of powerful, smarter apps. For example, in 2011, Ford announced a deal with the search giant Google to use the firm&rsquo;s prediction algorithms to spot trends in large data sets.&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gamITudh6DI\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ford's idea&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp; would send a car&rsquo;s information to Google's data centres. Over time, the algorithms would begin to predict where you are driving to every time you sit in the driver&rsquo;s seat, depending on the time of day and your usual driving habits. This would allow it to determine the most fuel-efficient journey, with the best driving conditions and the least traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as more and more cars begin to stream their telemetry, mobile networks could become overloaded. Fourth-generation cellphone systems will help, and there are already various initiatives, such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.ngconnect.org/index.htm\"&gt;the NG Connected car programme&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/verizon-joins-with-leading-global-auto-companies-to-establish-4g-venture-forum-for-connected-cars-157456585.html\"&gt;4G Venture Forum for Connected Cars&lt;/a&gt;, that aim to accelerate this technology. But the rise of the cloud-based app will could also spur the development of other clever connections with plenty of bandwidth.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea is to use wi-fi. A &lt;a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/sharing-wifi-among-cars-0705.html\"&gt;system proposed recently&lt;/a&gt; by researchers from MIT, Georgetown University and the National University of Singapore showed how a fleet of wi-fi enabled cars could share limited wi-fi connections by shuffling data between them all, and using a select few cars to collect everyone&rsquo;s data and upload it when it finds a hotspot. The system is theoretical at the moment, but it gives an indication of the kind of technology that could begin to hit cars in the future.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem that will need to be solved is security. Researchers have already demonstrated that control systems in cars &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10119492\"&gt;are vulnerable to attack&lt;/a&gt;. But once data from those critical systems &ndash; like brakes and engines &ndash; is being streamed, read and processed on the net for real, it will be even more crucial to ensure it cannot be subverted by hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if the history of smartphone apps is anything to go by, this kind of obstacle will not hold the technology back. Just four years ago smartphone app stores barely existed. Today, they serve up millions of apps and billions of downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time will tell whether adding the &lt;a href=\"http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/press-release-press-conference-20120307.pdf\"&gt;80 or so million cars that are produced every year&lt;/a&gt; into the mix will shift it up a gear or stall on the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:16:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Connected cars open up to apps and the cloud","HeadlineShort":"Road opens for connected cars","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The automobile of the future will not just have internet access; it will depend on it, says Jon Stewart. \n","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"The car of the future will not just have internet access; it will depend on it.","SummaryShort":"Future automobiles will not just have net access... they will depend on it","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:00Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"779dc8ba-f7b4-4878-892e-65ea3a3de337","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120719-road-opens-for-connected-cars","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:00Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120719-road-opens-for-connected-cars"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120719-road-opens-for-connected-cars","_id":"559a5de7157e584f77e2019b"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;Ask the owner of an electric car which feature they would like to eliminate and chances are they will say the charging cord: no one likes having to remember to plug-in their vehicle every evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, several companies including Delphi, Nissan, Qualcomm, and Rolls-Royce have either developed or tested wireless charging technology that requires drivers of electric vehicles to merely park above a device embedded in a garage floor or parking space that enables them to power up with little to no effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other ideas &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120312-wireless-highway-to-charge-cars\"&gt;such as roads fitted with charging devices&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; have also been proposed, but, to date, most systems rely on a well-known technique called electromagnetic induction. It is the same technology used to charge electric toothbrushes. At its most basic, a varying electric current passes through a coil of wire in the transmitter which produces a similarly varying current in a receiver coil sitting just above. The transmitted electrical power then feeds into the battery and recharges it. In a toothbrush, the transmitter sits in the base, while the receiver sits in the brush. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But electromagnetic induction technology across an air gap &ndash; say from a recharging pad to a car - is not considered the perfect solution by everyone. Critics point out it could possibly emit stray radio waves or heat up nearby metal objects unless it is engineered just right - two issues that the wireless electric vehicle industry knows could sink the technology if the public perceive them to be dangerous. &ldquo;Perceive&rdquo; is the key word here, as the industry strongly affirms that their power transfer technology has been fully tested and shown to be completely safe. &ldquo;We crossed that threshold two years ago,&rdquo; says David Schatz, vice president of sales &amp; business development at WiTricity, a top maker of automotive recharging equipment. &ldquo;The codes and standards are being written now.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poles apart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver working on how to recharge medical devices such as heart pacemakers, may have developed an alternative that avoids radio emissions altogether. They have produced a safe, high-efficiency method that employs what applied physicist and inventor Lorne Whitehead describes as &ldquo;remote magnetic gears&rdquo;. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new non-contact power-transfer approach, Whitehead says, uses &ldquo;magneto-dynamic coupling,&rdquo; a simple magnetic field interaction between two pivoting permanent magnets that are separated by 10 to 15cm (4 to 6in) of air. &lt;a href=\"http://ow.ly/eLNxJ\"&gt;The system&lt;/a&gt; uses a transmitter magnet below and a receiver magnet up in the car. When a small electric motor turns the lower magnet, the magnetic field causes the upper one to turn, &ldquo;much as a compass follows a changing magnetic field,&rdquo; he says. The top magnet then drives a small generator that charges the car battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This magnetic field between them essentially acts as a mechanical coupling - an invisible magnetic pulley/belt system, but it requires no direct contact and is almost perfectly energy efficient,&rdquo; Whitehead explains. In production the two magnets could be integrated, respectively, into the motor and the generator, making for a reliable and compact power-transfer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Tests show the system is more than 90% efficient compared to a cable charge,&rdquo; he says and the car does not even need to be perfectly aligned with the device. As a result, it could be built into low street curbs over which the car-borne magnet (which is installed under the bonnet) would hang, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A demonstration system consisting of four rechargers has operated successfully on the UBC campus for about a year or so, where they wirelessly charge electric vehicles that have been retrofitted with receiver magnets. &ldquo;Since we began testing the system, the feedback from drivers has been overwhelmingly positive - all they have to do is park the car and the charging begins automatically,&rdquo; &lt;a href=\"http://science.ubc.ca/news/662\"&gt;said David Woodson&lt;/a&gt;, managing director of UBC building operations, recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone is convinced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really nothing new,&rdquo; says John M Miller, center director in the power electronics and electric machinery research group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. &ldquo;Too many moving parts; it all comes down to the number of energy conversions that are involved.\" Here, the energy goes from electrical to mechanical and back to mechanical and then to electrical, the electrical engineer explained. And each step entails a loss in energy efficiency that adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WiTricity&rsquo;s Schatz was similarly skeptical, pointing out that leading automakers have already settled on designs that will be introduced &ldquo;around 2015 to 2017&rdquo;. The biggest interest is to place them in so-called plug-less hybrids, he says. In addition, the industry expects forthcoming devices to &ldquo;be approaching the size and shape of a sheet of paper and lightweight to boot,&rdquo; something that is perhaps at odds with the UBC magnetic system.&nbsp; WiTricity&rsquo;s power-transfer technology &ndash; sometimes known as wireless electricity - has no moving parts and exploits a high-efficiency coupling between transmitter and receiver&mdash;a one-step energy transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the UBC team is undeterred. A patent is now in the works and Whitehead expects that the technology will be licensed to other manufacturers, most likely through a spin-off company. &nbsp;&ldquo;At this point we see no technological barriers to bringing this system to market and know no reason why it will not become the preferred mechanism for wireless charging of [electric vehicles].&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","HeadlineLong":"Wireless recharging: Pulling the plug on electric cars","HeadlineShort":"Pulling the plug on electric cars","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The novel technology that aims to solve battery powered cars biggest problem.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"The novel technology that aims to solve battery powered cars biggest problem.","SummaryShort":"A novel idea for wireless charging","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"555eece8-d4a2-42b4-aa8d-7ffc0a48c8f4","Id":"wwfuture/story/20121120-pulling-the-plug-on-electric-cars","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20121120-pulling-the-plug-on-electric-cars"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20121120-pulling-the-plug-on-electric-cars","_id":"559a5df2157e584f77e202e3"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":null,"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;If you want to find the smartest drivers in the world, you need to head for the home of the US car industry. Just outside Detroit, lies the town of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The drivers there are not any more intelligent than other parts of the world, despite it being a famed college town. However, their cars are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s because the roads of Ann Arbor are now home to a fleet of several thousand cars that constantly &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to one another. The scheme, known as the &lt;a href=\"http://safetypilot.umtri.umich.edu/\"&gt;Safety Pilot Model Deployment project&lt;/a&gt;, offers a potential blueprint for the future of road transport. Like many projects it aims to cut congestion and make the road network more efficient. But this vision of the future is missing one thing: crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The idea behind it is to improve safety by an order of magnitude,&rdquo; says Dr Peter Sweatman, director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fatalities and serious injuries from road crashes have levelled off in the US, they still account for more than 32,000 deaths each year, according to the US department of Transportation. Worldwide, the World Health Organization estimates more than one million people are killed in road accidents every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This is an attempt to categorically avoid crashes, by having very robust communication between vehicles,&rdquo; says Dr Sweatman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $22m project started in late 2011, but is on course to reach a major milestone in the coming days, when the project&rsquo;s 3,000th connected car will pull out on to the streets of Ann Arbor. Each is fitted with wireless devices to allow them to talk to each other and to other parts of the road infrastructure, such as traffic lights. The technology is known as &lsquo;Vehicle to Vehicle&rsquo; (V2V) and &lsquo;Vehicle to Infrastructure&rsquo; (V2I) communication and allows the driver to send and receive information to and from the environment around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Real world experiment&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the V2V allows the car to communicate with all other vehicles within a range of about 200m to 300m. They all share data such as their location, speed and direction, that is then assessed for safety risks, and if appropriate the driver is warned of any danger. For example, drivers will get an audible warning if they try to change lane with a car in their blind spot, or if the car in front of them brakes hard and the driver doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice. The car can also give warnings at blind corners and junctions that another vehicle is about to pull out. Because the communications are done by radio signals, they do not need direct line of sight, unlike a driver&rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The V2I system can also communicate with other parts of the road and traffic infrastructure. For example, there are 29 intersections in Ann Arbor that have been instrumented, so that researchers can direct the lights in order to make the traffic move more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re collecting data from these intersections, and that is being back-hauled to the city of Ann Arbor through their fibre optic network so we can collect data, and make sure the signals are all being received and processed correctly,&rdquo; Dr Sweatman explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, the technology fitted to the vehicles does not turn them into &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120424-robot-cars-ready-to-roll\"&gt;autonomous, self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;, championed by the likes of Google, but they do represent an important step towards them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to see how you could have automatic vehicles without them being connected,&rdquo; says Dr Sweatman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s technically possible, but in terms of a realistic deployment autonomous vehicles will need to be connected.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-road-opens-for-connected-cars\"&gt;vehicle interaction systems are in development&lt;/a&gt;, and what is learnt in this huge, real world, experiment will help inform the direction they take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;This is fundamentally aimed at safety, but clearly with a platform like this you can create many other applications,&rdquo; says Dr Sweatman. &ldquo;There are many other potential benefits in mobility, environment, emissions, energy efficiency.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the team envisages a system that monitors the brakes of all of the cars. If the traffic management system detects that all of the cars are braking at the same spot, it could indicate a problem with the road that needs to be fixed by a maintenance crew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if for some reason there was an accident, the system could be used to immediately alert the emergency services, divert other drivers to alternative routes and ensure that the roads are clear for emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the majority of the cars fitted with the technology are owned by residents of Ann Arbor, who have volunteered to &lt;a href=\"http://safetypilot.umtri.umich.edu/index.php?content=participate\"&gt;join the programme&lt;/a&gt;. People take their cars in, just like a service visit at a dealership. It takes less than an hour to install the two antennas for GPS, one antenna for communications, the driver interface, and a black-box computer to link it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, about two thirds of the drivers selected to take part in the trial are parents from Ann Arbor schools. They were deliberately chosen to ensure there are as many vehicle &ldquo;interactions&rdquo; as possible, because they tend to drive their kids around a lot, and tend to congregate in the same places. More than 60 vehicles, including buses and trucks, have also been donated by various car manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We believe that at any given time there will be 5 to 10% of these vehicles in the traffic stream,&rdquo; says Dr Sweatman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this number could rise dramatically if the trial &ndash; which is currently due to run until 2013 &ndash; is successful. Then, the technology could be rolled out globally. With the ability to save thousands &ndash; perhaps millions - of lives, and reduce congestion and pollution at the same time, Ann Arbor could be the blueprint for the future.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:32Z","HeadlineLong":"Building the crash-proof car","HeadlineShort":"Building the crash-proof car","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Thousands of smart vehicles are already being tested on our roads as part of an ambitious  and little known - effort to eradicate car crashes.

Our global extractions are environmentally damaging and &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120418-no-silver-bullet\"&gt;depleting some resources&lt;/a&gt; to the extent that they are in danger of &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120308-touch-and-go-screens\"&gt;running out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those resources find their way into the goods, gadgets and machines that we find indispensable in our everyday lives. But do we really need so much stuff, or are we simply addicted to the new? There's no doubt that our consumption of resources from food to gadgets has risen dramatically over the past 60 years, and much of the world seems to be in the grip of a &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120712-beating-our-consumption-habit\"&gt;shopping epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. But is there a conscious effort driving it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been many times during my travels when I've needed something repaired, from rips in my backpack, to holes in my clothes, zippers that have broken or memory cards that have lost data. From India to Ethiopia, I have had no trouble in finding someone who can sort the problem out, repair what is broken or find an ingenious way of side-stepping the issue. In rich countries, such items often would be thrown away and replaced with new ones without a second thought. But the developing world is still full of menders, make-doers and inspired users of others&rsquo; scrap. I&rsquo;ve seen a bicycle in Nairobi made from bits of car, a colander and a leather belt; aerials made from all manner of implements; and houses constructed out of old boat sails, rice sacks and plastic drinks bottles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then there are those items that seemingly can&rsquo;t be repaired. My camera shutter, battered by the dust and grime of travel, no longer works. I'm told I should throw away my camera, even though it works fine, apart from the shutter mechanism. Like the majority of consumer electronics, my camera has not been designed to be easily reparable. Thirty years ago, I could have found service manuals and spare parts for all camera models, as well as a thriving repair industry. But things have changed. Camera models have got far more numerous and complicated, and manufacturers no longer release repair manuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the mobile phone handset market reached saturation in Europe and the United States about a decade ago, we have chosen not to wait for our devices to fail. Almost all new phones purchased are &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo;, replacing functioning phones simply for reasons of fashion or for technological additions that many of us rarely use, and which could otherwise easily be achieved through software upgrades to existing handsets. Indeed, most phone companies compete for business by automatically upgrading customers&rsquo; phones every year. And these smart phones use mined resources from some of the most ecologically sensitive areas of the world, as a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9KYQfctNk\"&gt;Friends of the Earth campaign&lt;/a&gt; points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made to fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that something that works fine should be replaced is now so ingrained in our culture that few people question it. But it is a fairly recent concept, brought about by a revolution in the advertising and manufacturing industries, which thrived on various 20th century changes, including the mass movement of large populations to cities, the development of mass production, globalisation, improved transport, international trade and public broadcast media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest example of manufacturers convincing people to frequently replace a product may be the so-called &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://documentaryheaven.com/the-lightbulb-conspiracy/\"&gt;lightbulb conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, in which a group of companies is supposed to have orchestrated the Phoebus Cartel to prevent companies from selling lightbulbs with a longer than 1,000-hour lifespan (most settled on 750 hours), even though bulbs lasting more than 100,000 hours existed. The cartel said its intent was to develop international standards, but the net result was that households needed to replace their bulbs regularly, providing a far larger consumer market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way of selling more products by designing products that deliberately fail, cannot be repaired, or have a set lifespan imposed in some other way is known as planned obsolescence. However, it is not just a cynical plot dreamed up by manufacturers to boost profits, many politicians and economists believe it to be a societal necessity. The idea was born in the US during the 1930s depression as a way to get the economy moving again by compelling people to buy more stuff. There were plenty of factories and masses of unemployed looking for gainful work, the trouble was the people who could afford to buy things already had them. What was needed, strategists proposed, was a reason for shoppers to buy things they already had, or didn&rsquo;t know they &ldquo;needed&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1950s, planned obsolescence had become the dominant paradigm in mass production with things no longer built to last. A sophisticated advertising industry persuaded people to shop. Mechanisms flourished to make this easier, from department stores to credit. Consumerism was born. Some industries, such as fashion are predicated on planned obsolescence, with items being made to last a single season or less. Other industries are following fashion&rsquo;s high-turnover model and bringing out products that have cosmetic gimmicks or seasonal appeal but which will soon appear dated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer says no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder whether electronic products are being designed to fail, from television sets, which have heat-sensitive condensers deliberately fitted onto the circuit board next to a heat sink connected to the transistors, to washing machines with ball-bearings fitted inaccessibly into the drums so they cannot be replaced. Specific lifespans are programmed by the manufacturers into chips in some equipment, so that printers will stop working after a preset number of pages (sending a message: &ldquo;internal error&rdquo;), coffee makers will cease functioning after a preset quota of brews, and memory cards will stop uploading after a preset number of photo uploads. The user is then forced to buy a replacement. Some computers are difficult to upgrade &ndash; new versions of software are upwardly compatible so files won&rsquo;t work on older models or, as in the new Apple MacBook Pro, the RAM is &lt;a href=\"http://ifixit.org/2763/the-new-macbook-pro-unfixable-unhackable-untenable/\"&gt;soldered to the motherboard&lt;/a&gt;, making it difficult or costly to upgrade or replace the hard drive and &lt;a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405921,00.asp\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, users can find themselves buying a new computer every couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another trick is to make parts and accessories incompatible between brands or even models of the same brand. Thus, not only do consumers need to buy a different memory card or battery or charger for each device or brand of electronic equipment they buy, from phones to laptops to toothbrushes, but they must also &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/09/iphone_5_dock_connector_the_one_incredibly_irksome_feature_that_will_leave_you_cursing_apple_.html\"&gt;buy a new charger or adaptor&lt;/a&gt; when they upgrade from an iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some consumers are starting to hit back, though, advising people on the internet how to find and remove the printer chip or over-write the memory card software. But this is technically challenging and time-consuming, and most people aren&rsquo;t even aware of the reason for their device no longer working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Californian Kyle Wiens is the type of sophisticated electronics tinkerer that emperors of the IT industry like Microsoft and Apple dream of employing. But Kyle is a guerilla geek &ndash; he slipped through their net and crossed over to the consumer side. Instead of dreaming up intricate ways of fitting more and more components into ever-slimmer gadgets, Kyle is taking them apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It started a decade ago, when he was a student and his iBook stopped working, Kyle explains. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get find a service manual for it, so as my friend [fellow student Luke Soules] and I took it apart to fix it, we created our own manual.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle and Luke began taking apart computers and other equipment, getting around the copyright protection by creating their own service manuals from scratch, and posting them online for free. The pair called their site &lt;a href=\"http://ifixit.com/\"&gt;iFixit.com&lt;/a&gt; and over the past decade, they have expanded to hundreds more manuals, encouraging home hackers to create their own manuals for the site &ndash; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re a Wikipedia of service manuals&rdquo; &ndash; and they also sell the tools and spare parts users need to fix their own electrical devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are contributing to a cultural shift in perception, Kyle says. &ldquo;When someone has repaired their broken iPad or whatever, it&rsquo;s a life-changing experience. That person will become a different consumer. They will choose new products based on how long-lasting they are and how easy they are to take apart and repair.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there is little onus on manufacturers to improve, and indeed things may be getting worse. As Apple&rsquo;s beautiful-looking and increasingly thin gadgets take an ever-larger share of the market, other manufacturers are following suit. &lt;a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_maxx-review-800.php\"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/nokia-lumia-900-review-this-ones-a-no-brainer/\"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were known for their durable phones with easily replaced long-lasting batteries, have now both released thin phones with glued-in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some companies have been bucking the trend. HP and Dell release service manuals and make computers that are easily upgradable and repairable &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://ifixit.com/\"&gt;iFixit.com&lt;/a&gt; recently gave HPs Z1 model a score of 10 out of 10 for repairability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And other companies are joining the move towards a circular economy, in which economic growth is uncoupled from finite-resource-use. Instead of the linear manufacturing route: mining materials, fabricating, selling, throwing them away; a circular economy is based around making products that are more easily disassembled, so that the resources can be recovered and used to make new products, &lt;a href=\"http://www.rreuse.org/t3/\"&gt;keeping them in circulation&lt;/a&gt;. British yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur is a strong advocate of the concept and &lt;a href=\"http://www.thecirculareconomy.org/\"&gt;commissioned a report into the idea&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the benefits to Europe&rsquo;s economy alone could be $630 billion, based on cycling just 15% of materials in 48% of manufacturing and just being recycled once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-end outdoors clothing company &lt;a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/email/11/112811.html\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;, for example, issues a guarantee that it will repair any of its products for free over their lifetime, and employs a team of seamstresses to do just that. And in 2011, it actually ran an advertising campaign asking consumers to buy less of the stuff they don&rsquo;t need, to curb waste and environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mines become depleted, it could soon force the market to change its recent ways. During the course of the 20th century there was a steady fall in the price of commodities, but that price has been climbing since 2000. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving towards a resource-limited economy, which means manufacturers are going to have to move their business model towards remanufacturing and repairs, as the cost of rare earth metals and other resources slash profits,&rdquo; Kyle says. Perhaps, then, planned obsolescence will begin to reach its own expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Gaia?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Choices for the future of the human planet.

Yet, only about 10% of that is properly recycled, according to the agency. A good proportion of the rest, according the UK-based Electronic Investigation Agency (EIA), ends up being \"illegally exported and dumped in developing countries.\" These countries, &lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt; 2011 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.eia-international.org.php5-20.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/wp-content/uploads/System-Failure-FINAL.pdf\"&gt;EIA&lt;/a&gt;, simply don't have the capacity to properly recycle this kind of waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't stop people from trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s because the waste contains tiny, yet valuable, amounts of gold and copper. In fact, in a country such as Ghana, burning computer wires to reclaim the copper is, unfortunately, one of the better-paying jobs a teenager or 20-something can land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A local businessman hands over the wires to the kids, who take the material to a place like the Agbogbloshie dump near Accra. They set it alight, wait for the plastic coatings to burn off, and then take the copper back to the businessman. Most of that copper is eventually sold to manufacturers in Western Europe, completing a grim kind of recycling.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes at great cost to the young kids, and to the environment. As EIA says: \"Copper wires are bundled and set alight to remove flame-resistant coatings, emitting toxic dioxins&hellip;The potential health consequences for those involved in this kind of work are dire - reproductive and developmental problems, damaged immune, nervous and blood systems, kidney damage and impaired brain development in children.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic reality of the situation is that most of the teams of recyclers are going to carry on what they are doing, no matter what the potential consequences. So, what is needed is a cleaner, healthier way to mine the waste for its valuable elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold mine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that is precisely what &lt;a href=\"http://halwatts.co.uk/\"&gt;Hal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://halwatts.co.uk/\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://halwatts.co.uk/\"&gt;Watts&lt;/a&gt; decided to do as part of his design degree at London's Royal College of Art. He has spent the last year designing and building a device he hopes will not only offer a viable alternative to burning the wires, but may even net the youngsters who do the dirty work more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watts calls his invention Esource, and it is &lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt;wonder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/44233461\"&gt;simplicity&lt;/a&gt; that he dreamed up after witnessing first-hand the dire working conditions at the Agbogbloshie dump for himself. Watts tells me that he knew he had to create \"a system that's as cheap as possible, and that didn't require much infrastructure&rdquo;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first challenge was finding a cheap and reliable power source. He knew no one would want to pay the ongoing costs of running, say, a generator that powered some wire-stripping machine. He looked around, and then it hit him. \"Everyone out there has a bicycle.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bike powers two different machines that help separate the copper from the plastic coating. First, you use a shredder that Watts specifically designed using materials available in local workshops. You feed the plastic-coated copper wires into the shredder, and the bits get ground up, smaller and smaller, until they fall through a sieve at the bottom. \"That,\" says Watts, \"guarantees that the copper and plastic are no longer stuck together.\"&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you use a second machine, which Watts says was inspired by gold-panning technologies. \"It has a rotating wheel with water being pumped around it,\" says Watts. As you pedal, water is pumped into the spinning wheel. Then you put the small bits of copper and plastic into it. The different weights of the particles, driven by the spiral, mean that \"the plastic washes out, and you're left with a pile of copper.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue, Watts admits, is throughput. The kids normally get through about 65 lbs (30kg) pounds of wire a day through burning. And, as it stands, it would be hard for them to get through that amount as quickly with Esource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The process is limited by the shredder,\" says Watts. \"It takes a lot of energy to shred. In testing, I got to where you could do about 11 pounds (5kg) of wire in an hour.\" Watts says that's not bad considering that &ldquo;an industrial machine that could handle 220 pounds (100kg) in an hour would cost more than $50,000.\" In contrast, Watts says he can put together his bicycle powered system for around $120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the low cost of the device isn't the only selling point. When you burn the wires, Watts says, you end up with bits of plastic melted onto the valuable copper. But with Esource, the copper comes out much cleaner. And clean copper, Watts notes, is worth about 20% more on the market. For exporters in Ghana, who can go through up to 110 tonnes (250,000Lbs) of copper a week, that's a lot of money. And so moving forward, Watts hopes he can make a strong economic argument to exporters to invest in the Esource system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also hopes to convince the young people doing the work, many of whom can make up to $15 a day, that Esource is worth it. These kids, he notes, often work in groups to burn the wires. He's hoping that instead they will pool their money, buy into an Esource set-up that they can share, and then recoup their initial expenditure through the increased value of the cleaner copper they give back to the exporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watts will soon get the chance to make his case. His Esource idea recently won a grant from &lt;a href=\"http://www.watesfoundation.org.uk/\"&gt;The&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.watesfoundation.org.uk/\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.watesfoundation.org.uk/\"&gt;Wates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.watesfoundation.org.uk/\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.watesfoundation.org.uk/\"&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to further develop his designs over the next six months. He'll be returning to Ghana in October. He has also released a freely available manual for building an Esource system, complete with ideas for different materials that might be substituted in the original design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I don't think there will ever be a business for me personally in making and selling the machines,\" Watts admits. \"For me, the incentive was to make it open source, and have it produced locally where it's needed. I designed it so that it could be made entirely in country.\"&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:15:15Z","HeadlineLong":"Esource: Cycling solution to gadget recycling","HeadlineShort":"Cycle to recycle old gadgets ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Our desire to buy the latest must-have gadget comes at huge cost to the countries and people who deal with our electronic waste.

The Great Acceleration can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/owengaffney/great-acceleration\"&gt;rise in everything&lt;/a&gt; from carbon dioxide release, to water use, to number of cars, to ozone depletion, to deforestation, to GDP, to consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century ago, life expectancy in Europe and the US was less than 50 years, now it's around 80 years. I've been fortunate enough to live in an age in which I&rsquo;ve been vaccinated against killers from polio to tuberculosis to measles; I've had an inside toilet and bathroom with hot and cold running water; a refrigerator; central heating; a free education and health service; and hunger has been a pleasant and soon-relieved sensation rather than a chronic debilitating experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, like the average person living in the developed world at the end of the 20th century, my life is comfortable and far removed from that experienced by the average person a century earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rapid transformation was a filthy undertaking: pea-souper smogs shrouded cities like London killing thousands; acid rain poisoned rivers, lakes and soils, eroded buildings and monuments; refrigerant chemicals ate away at the protective ozone layer; and carbon emissions caused a change in the global climate and acidified the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, our voracious appetite for manufactured products has led to massive deforestation and created a mining boom for minerals, oil and coal that is destroying ecosystems and producing a deluge of &lt;a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/9253665/Great-Pacific-Garbage-Patch-has-increased-100-fold-since-the-1970s.html\"&gt;toxin and plastics waste&lt;/a&gt; that will take centuries to degrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesser-developed nations will strive to follow the Great Acceleration trajectory set by industrialised nations. Peasants scraping for subsistence in the dirt of India do not toil under romanticised notions about their labours. They too would like to experience the same acceleration in life expectancy, as well as basic requirements like clean water provision, toilets, electricity, internet access, and creature comforts like cars, air conditioning, refrigerators, washing machines&hellip; the list is endless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening belts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as global citizens sharing this planet, we cannot afford for billions more people to eat and live as &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/12/arts/television/12foot.html?_r=1\"&gt;the average American&lt;/a&gt; now does at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.famousbloggers.net/consumerism-stats-infographic.html\"&gt;expense of the environment&lt;/a&gt;. Climate change, ecosystem services degradation and limitations on natural resources threaten the lives of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the answer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many poor countries have argued that they must be allowed to develop their economies, with however much pollution that entails, and then clean up when they are rich. It seems like a reasonable argument, after all, that's what rich countries did. Except that rich cities still suffer from smog, much of our biodiversity has been irrevocably lost, and we're still pumping out greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others point out that there is more than enough environmental space on this planet for everyone to live sustainably, but the developed world needs to scale back its consumption and allow for a more equitable sharing of resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ve seen both sides of the argument first hand. I spent over two years travelling around the developing world and living on the contents of a backpack. In several destinations, I washed, like the local people, with a bucket of cold water and a pouring scoop &ndash; usually river water, but in some places skin-itching seawater. In other, more touristic places, I would have access to a shower &ndash; sometimes with warm water &ndash; even though the local people rarely had such facilities. (Actually, this is part of a wider issue, highlighted in a &lt;a href=\"http://www.tourismconcern.org.uk/wet-recommendations.html\"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; about how developed-world people bring their resource use on holiday with them to poor countries &ndash; something I may return to in a later column.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I returned to London, of all the luxuries now at my disposal, I was most pleased to have drinking water on tap and a dependable hot shower. As I brought home my many boxes out of storage, I was bewildered by just how much stuff I owned. When was I going to wear so many clothes; read so many books; what was I going to do with all these accumulated items?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone living in the West is going to experience such an epiphany on excessive consumption. And, a year on, I catch myself perusing shops, wondering whether I need a new t-shirt... (I don't). But there are encouraging signs that our runaway appetite for new stuff is beginning to wane, &lt;a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2011/nov/01/peak-stuff-consumption-data\"&gt;in the UK&lt;/a&gt; at least, that people are eating less &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2012/01/americans-are-eating-less-meat/47295/\"&gt;environmentally costly meat&lt;/a&gt;, and that Americans are copying their European counterparts in adopting &lt;a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5im5tlpNdAuQrAihjPR0TqYOiXZtQ?docId=46c30492445943c9917b243ec72860a7\"&gt;more fuel-efficient cars&lt;/a&gt;. Some of this is down to people having smaller disposable incomes in the recession, and some due to policy-led changes that encourage a less polluting lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polluter pays&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these are small steps in economies based around consumerism. Citizens are encouraged to desire items from childhood onwards, and consumerism is the main economic strategy for governments trying to climb out of recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the excessive consumption habit has spread throughout the world, and is particularly obvious in China, as I noticed on my visit earlier this year. Barely a decade ago, streams of bicyclists pedaled down alleys in Beijing. Now Chinese buy &lt;a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/02/world/la-fg-china-luxury-20120103\"&gt;more Lamborghinis and Rolls-Royces&lt;/a&gt; than anybody else in the world. Shanghai&rsquo;s per capita energy use is already higher than London's, and the city has become a shoppers paradise for China&rsquo;s nouveaux rich . The four busiest Apple stores in the world are &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/technology/apple-sales-in-china-zoom-ahead-of-competitors.html\"&gt;in Shanghai and Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. And cities including Paris, London and New York are falling over themselves to attract this new breed of &lt;a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2901\"&gt;label-obsessed consumer addicts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way of prompting people to be more thoughtful about their purchases &ndash; and whether such a purchase is even needed &ndash; would be to levy an environmental services fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/02/polluter-pays-climate-change\"&gt;'polluter pays' principle&lt;/a&gt; already covers dirty factories in the UK and other countries, for example, who must pay to clean up their damage to soil, water or air, and to safely dispose of toxic waste. But many people think it should be extended to include carbon dioxide pollution, freshwater and energy use by manufacturers, so that the price of a product more accurately reflects its environmental cost. The charge would encourage more sustainable production and also help pay for remedial efforts from carbon capture and storage to waste water clean-up to recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socially educating people not to seek happiness through excessive consumption will be a huge and possibly doomed undertaking, however many times it is shown that &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18187399\"&gt;it can&rsquo;t buy you happiness&lt;/a&gt;. So perhaps the answer is in trying to restore the natural balance of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In nature, 'resources' are cycled &ndash; for example, water taken up by plants is eaten by animals that breathe out water vapour, returning the water to the soil for the plants by way of rain. Nothing is lost. But the scale with which we humans are using resources is too rapid for natural systems to manage. Microorganisms, for example, can degrade our waste, but not at a rate that matches our production. Likewise, trees and plants can take in our carbon dioxide, but not fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the answer lies in a synthetic version of this natural cycling, so-called &lt;a href=\"http://www.kk.org/outofcontrol/ch10-e.html\"&gt;closed-loop manufacture&lt;/a&gt;, in which products are created &lt;a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/15/58/43423689.pdf\"&gt;using renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;, all the materials used in the process are re-used and the final product is also fully recycled to minimise original resource-use. It means no waste, no pollution, and far greater efficiencies, as &lt;a href=\"http://www.interface.com/?r=0\"&gt;closed-loop pioneers&lt;/a&gt; are already discovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilt-free consumption could one day be possible. Whether it will make us happy is another question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-07-12T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Beating our consumption habit","HeadlineShort":"Beating our consumption habit","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We have always consumed our planet's resources but recently, our appetite has grown bigger and, with it, our impact on the planet.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Our appetite for consumerism is escalating at an uncontrollable rate.

What, though, does this say about the increasing delegation not only of daily tasks to machines, but of potentially life-changing decisions themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a life and death dilemma that could soon be science fact rather than fiction. As psychology professor Gary Marcus pointed out in a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/11/google-driverless-car-morality.html\"&gt;piece for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, driverless cars are now street-legal in three American states and could soon be cruising into a garage near you. But if your driverless car were hypothetically to encounter a bus full of schoolchildren on the wrong side of the road, how should it react: should it make a decision to swerve, preventing a collision but putting your life at risk; or should it collide with the bus if there&rsquo;s a greater chance of you surviving? &ldquo;If the decision must be made in milliseconds,&rdquo; Marcus reasons, &ldquo;the computer will have to make the call.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cars are an interesting case study because they already represent one of the most hazardous technological environments most of us enter on a regular basis &ndash; and because the belief that technology should make this environment as safe as possible has been accepted, and been saving lives, for decades. As a famous adage of product design puts it, once you&rsquo;ve built the car, your task is not simply to hope that you can prevent all accidents, but to design a better car crash &ndash; that is, to make those inevitable occasions on which things go wrong as unlikely as possible to cause fatal harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimising harm is a clear enough good. What happens, though, to ethical issues in design when the product you&rsquo;re creating is itself going to be making decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus&rsquo; driverless car scenario riffs off the famous &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\"&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;: a thought experiment that asks subjects to decide between pushing one man off a bridge in order to save the lives of several others trapped in the path of a runaway railway trolley, or allowing that one man to survive while the others meet their doom. Most respondents are unwilling physically to push another human being to their death even if it would save multiple lives &ndash; one of the factors the test is designed to measure. A machine&rsquo;s response, though, would depend entirely upon the decision-making model encoded by its creators. One robot might refuse to act; one might save the many; one might not even recognize a choice exists. It&rsquo;s up to us to decide which program to write. But once we&rsquo;ve done it and set things in motion, it&rsquo;s up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programming this into cars is one thing. Weapons are quite another &ndash; and represent perhaps the most urgent testing-ground for machine ethics today. Early this December, Iran boasted that it had &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20594431\"&gt;captured a US ScanEagle drone&lt;/a&gt; over its airspace; one of the most basic models of the thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles that have become the standard stuff of warfare over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Paul Wallich&rsquo;s child-minding quadcopter, most drones are more like sophisticated remote-controlled aircraft than autonomous decision-makers. Late November, though, saw some of the first tests of what &lt;a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/news/us-drone-launch-autonomous-986/\"&gt;some news outlets colourfully labelled a &ldquo;killer robot&rdquo;:&lt;/a&gt; a US Navy stealth drone piloted by artificial intelligence. Snappily named the X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System, the 19m- (62ft-) wide aircraft is designed to take split-second decisions on its own initiative &ndash; and even land itself on an aircraft carrier &ndash; while remaining under the overall control of human operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as anything, it&rsquo;s the relationship between these human operators and their subject that&rsquo;s most disturbing. Thought experiments like the trolley problem demonstrate something self-evident but extremely significant in moral thinking: how our sense of obligation is modified by distance and immediacy. We feel differently about pushing someone off a bridge with our own hands than we do about pushing a button to achieve the same result. Weapons are real-world examples of this: the arrow differs from the fist, the rifle from the arrow, the bomb from the gun. And by the time you reach autonomous systems, many of the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; setting them in motion will have taken place months or even years ago: as part of a process of programming and design whose eventual consequences may be entirely unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all this sounds rather removed from real life, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the cutting edge of today&rsquo;s battlefield will represent little more than the state-of-the-art in domestic appliances a decade from now. Such is the speed of technological change, and the steady migration of its moral conundrums towards the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s a field in which the ghostly outlines of future controversy are already clearly visible. If a drone can oversee your child&rsquo;s journey to school today, will it be driving you both to work tomorrow &ndash; and should you insist on this, if the machine is demonstrably a safer driver than you? If robot soldiers can fight for your country without risking your sons&rsquo; and daughters&rsquo; lives, should you gratefully embrace automated warfare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are new questions, but answering them means grappling with ancient ethical issues about responsibility. What does it mean to hold someone responsible not only for their actions, but for the chains of consequence they set snaking through the world? And what does it mean to exercise human ingenuity responsibly, given the ever-expanding scope of our powers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the best contemporary answer may mean giving up some of that power &ndash; and asking what it means to create machines that can take responsibility for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

To those unfamiliar with the vehicle, it might have looked roughly similar to the US space shuttle, the manned spacecraft that shuttled astronauts into space for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this spaceplane, called the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, is very different. While it looks like a plane, is launched on a rocket, has a cargo bay and uses some of the same technology as the shuttle, such as thermal shielding to protect it during reentry, it is smaller and unmanned. It is designed to stay in orbit for months on end and can automatically land back on Earth. Perhaps more crucially, the Boeing-designed plane is operated by the US Air Force and its mission is a closely held secret, prompting a slew of speculation about its true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the first X-37B was launched in 2010, amateur satellite spotters have carefully followed the robotic spacecraft&rsquo;s orbit, while those unconnected with the program have speculated that the plane could be anything from an anti-satellite weapon to so-called &ldquo;on demand reconnaissance,&rdquo; shorthand for a spy satellite that can be placed over any country in the world. Compounding the mystery was the launch of a second vehicle in 2011, which stayed in orbit for 469 days, long exceeding the Air Force&rsquo;s stated maximum requirement of 270 days for the spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a third launch is slated for 11 December, according to an Air Force spokesperson, once again ramping up the rumour mill. So, what do we actually know about the plane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports focused on the X-37B&rsquo;s seeming resemblance, at least in size and weight, to &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar\"&gt;the X-20 Dynasoar&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dynamic Soarer), a 1950s-era hypersonic vehicle that was envisioned for a variety of military missions, including bombing and sabotaging enemy satellites. However, experts familiar with the X-37B programme emphasized that its technology is actually closer to the recently retired space shuttle (a &lt;a href=\"http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2011/CDReadymspace11_2426/PV2011_7315.pdf\"&gt;fact reinforced by Boeings&rsquo; proposal for a crewed version of the vehicle&lt;/a&gt; known as the X-37C). The Air Force blandly described the role of the X-37B in &lt;a href=\"http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16639\"&gt;a factsheet given to media&lt;/a&gt; as a \"reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Air Force also says the mini-shuttle has two objectives: testing &ldquo;reusable spacecraft technologies&rdquo; and conducting &ldquo;experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth&rdquo;. Again, this is similar to the stated aims of the space shuttle. But many forget that earlier craft also had a secret military role. Although ostensibly a civilian program, it conducted a series of missions from 1982-1992 on behalf of the National Reconnaissance Office, carrying a series of classified spy satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most outside experts now agree that it&rsquo;s likely the robotic space plane is being used for some sort of secret reconnaissance. &ldquo;I think the guess that makes most sense is quick-response tactical imaging, meaning hours to a couple of days from request to delivery,&rdquo; says Allen Thomson, a former CIA analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson says it is also possible that it could have a more mundane but useful task, such as &ldquo;maintaining up-to-date general purpose mapping imagery.&rdquo; However, if that is the case, Thomson says that it could be a waste of money. &ldquo;I think that the commercial satellites could and should do that cheaper and better than X-37B,&rdquo; he says. It is a view &lt;a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/the-x-37b-space-plane.html\"&gt;backed by parts of the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the X-37B launches comes in the middle of a larger debate about the role of government-operated spy satellites, which have proven enormously costly but can provide some of the most advanced imagery, versus commercial satellite imagery. The US intelligence community recently slashed its budget for commercial imagery, indicating that it was going back to greater reliance on its own classified satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view that the X-37B is a reconnaissance platform is strengthened by observations from amateur satellite watchers, who track the vehicles&rsquo; orbits, and noticed that it has similar orbits to spy satellites and scientific remote sensing craft. In addition, they noticed the craft changing its orbital path several times during its test flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected, says Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport. &ldquo;The upcoming launch will continue just to see what the vehicle can do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;One of the things they are testing is maneuverability. The problem with satellites in orbit is they are very predictably in certain orbits at certain times, and thus vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons (ASAT).&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson-Freese says the military has long been interested in the ability of a spacecraft that has &ldquo;the ability to evade, to maneuver, to not be in a predicable place at a predicable time.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects the Air Force will be &ldquo;pressing the envelope for manoeuvrability and duration&rdquo; during the X-37B&rsquo;s next flight. &ldquo;That will give them the idea of potential missions where avoidance of ASATs comes into play.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;No weapons&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although its orbits may be difficult to predict in advance, its tracks show where the X-37B has been and its likely purpose, says Brian Weeden, a technical advisor at the Secure World Foundation, a Washington-based foundation that focuses on space issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he says, the X-37B flew at inclination of 42.79 degrees, which tells you how far north and south in latitude the spacecraft can see. &ldquo;The tradeoff is that something at a 90 degree polar orbit covers the whole world, but its frequency is less; it may arrive only every couple of days,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If something is 40 or 45 degrees, it would be covering a smaller portion [of the earth], but more often. &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a 42.79 degree inclination, the X-37B would be useful for looking at a geographic region such as the Middle East, says Weeden, pouring cold water on one theory that that it was used to spy on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16423881\"&gt;China&rsquo;s spacelab, Tiangong-1&lt;/a&gt;. And given the current political context, he says, the Middle East &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeden also suggests the X-37B&rsquo;s orbit may indicate that the military is trying out a new sensor system, such as radar imaging or &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging\"&gt;hyperspectral sensors&lt;/a&gt;, which collect information across different wavelengths. He suggests this could be the case, because unlike satellites collecting light in the visible wavelength, the X-37B&rsquo;s orbits are not synchronized with the sun, a trick used to maintain a predictable angle between the sun, satellite and ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, like with many of the theories surrounding the X-37B, he warns, &ldquo;it is just speculation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Air Force itself is silent about the plane&rsquo;s use, only speaking to allay fears that it was a weapon. \"I don't know how this could be called weaponisation of space. It's just an updated version of the space shuttle type of activities in space,\" said Gary Payton, the Air Force's deputy undersecretary for space programmes, in 2010.&nbsp; \"We, the Air Force, have a suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever its purpose; the X-37B is perhaps one of the few bright spots among the Pentagon&rsquo;s hypersonic test vehicle programs.&nbsp; The Air Force&rsquo;s X-51A Waverider, a scramjet powered hypersonic missile, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120815-hypersonic-ambitions-fall-short\"&gt;suffered a fatal mishap earlier this year on a test flight&lt;/a&gt;, and never reached hypersonic speeds.&nbsp; Separately, another hypersonic prototype, known as the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14497641\"&gt;suffered mishaps in both flight tests&lt;/a&gt;, plunging into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those other efforts, which are focused on creating missiles, are still in early testing phase, while the X-37B is clearly further along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think the one interesting question is whether this is just test and evaluation, or is it being used to be support real world operations,&rdquo; says Weeden. But like most questions about the plane, it is one that is currently impossible to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"X-37B: Secrets of the US military spaceplane","HeadlineShort":"Secrets of US military spaceplane","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"As the US Air Force prepares for the third launch of its mysterious X-37B vehicle, BBC Future looks at what is known about the classified project.

In fact, almost all unmanned systems involve humans in almost every aspect of their operations&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that instead of sitting in a cockpit or behind the wheel of a vehicle, humans are operating the systems from a joystick or computer often at a remote base far from the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that is slowly beginning to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next week, one of the Pentagon&rsquo;s most commonly used robots will finally make baby steps toward greater autonomy. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.irobot.com/us/robots/defense/packbot.aspx\"&gt;PackBot&lt;/a&gt;, a tracked robot used by US troops to help clear bombs in Afghanistan, will get a number of upgrades that will allows it to operate autonomously in some situations, according to Tim Trainer, a vice president for product management at iRobot, which makes the pint-sized bots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the autonomous capabilities will actually be fairly limited. In cases where the PackBot loses contact with its human operator, it will retrace its steps back to where it was when it last had communications.&nbsp; While seemingly simple, this small step toward autonomy is a critical improvement: in the past, if the robot lost communications while on its way to defuse a bomb, an explosive ordnance disposal technician would have go and retrieve it, potentially exposing the person to risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upgrade includes other basic elements of autonomy, such as the ability to right itself if it falls over&mdash;a big problem in Afghanistan&rsquo;s rough terrain&mdash;and the ability to navigate between specific waypoints, using satellite navigation and overlaid imagery, without constant communications with an operator. &ldquo;Those are first steps to autonomy,&rdquo; says Trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to take these slow steps toward autonomous robot operations so that the military&rsquo;s confidence grows, explains Trainer. Eventually, he says, the PackBot will be able to perform more complex tasks without human intervention, such as clearing an entire building of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these improvements are a far cry from the notion of robotic foot soldiers, it represents the reality of where military technology is today. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll see autonomy as the breakthrough leap,&rdquo; says Trainer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;ll have the one autonomous solution.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Skinless Terminator&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the Pentagon&rsquo;s progress toward fielding autonomous robotic systems has been agonizingly slow, concluded a recently released &lt;a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/dsb/autonomy.pdf\"&gt;report by the Defense Science Board&lt;/a&gt;, a panel of defence experts that advises senior Pentagon leaders. They placed a large part of the blame for a lack of autonomous robots on misperceptions about what autonomy means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&ldquo;Unfortunately, the word &lsquo;autonomy&rsquo; often conjures images in the press and the minds of some military leaders of computers making independent decisions and taking uncontrolled action,&rdquo; the report notes. And even though the reality is often much more prosaic&mdash;such as having a robot flip over on its own&mdash;those concerns have still served to limit the military&rsquo;s willingness to embrace autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&ldquo;It should be made clear,&rdquo; the panel says, &ldquo;that all autonomous systems are supervised by human operators at some level, and autonomous systems&rsquo; software embodies the designed limits on the actions and decisions delegated to the computer.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, statements like this do not reassure everyone. Some forward-looking robotic expert have already &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm\"&gt;called for more debate&lt;/a&gt; about the subject of autonomy. They point towards developments such as the SGR-A1, a gun-toting sentry robot, developed five years ago by Samsung Techwin Co for the South Korean government as a way to patrol the border between North and South Korea. The fixed robot uses pattern recognition software to spot humans and a machine gun if needed. Although the robot is designed to operate with human intervention, it is its autonomous mode that has caught ethicists&rsquo; attention as a possible precursor of future developments. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some defense officials may downplay concerns about autonomy, Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, is urging policymakers to think now about the implications of unmanned systems, which is already having profound implications. &ldquo;From a geostrategic standpoint, it widens the scope of the battlefield - now it extends from the United States to Afghanistan and Pakistan,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That is really new. &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for the majority of those working in the field, &ldquo;killer robots&rdquo; are not on their radar. Instead, they say, military robots are likely to be used initially for jobs that are dangerous, but not involved in actually fighting enemy forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already under development, for example, is a military humanoid robot that will fight fires on ships. The innocuously named &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2012/nrl-designs-robot-for-shipboard-firefighting\"&gt;Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot&lt;/a&gt;, or Saffir, actually looks suspiciously much like a skinless version of the Terminator, though its mission is much more peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saffir, which is being developed by university researchers in cooperation with US navy scientists, is designed to fight fires on naval ships. &nbsp;But even these firefighting robots are being developed specifically to work with human counterparts, so a major focus of the work is on getting the robots to respond to human gestures and speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human touch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another robot being designed to help human soldiers is &lt;a href=\"http://www.vecnarobotics.com/solutions/bear/index.shtml\"&gt;the Bear&lt;/a&gt; (Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot), a humanoid robot with tracked legs. The Bear, built by Vecna Technologies, was initially funded by the US Army and designed to scoop up injured soldiers from the battlefield, transporting them to a safe area where they could receive medical assistance. The idea was that in the middle of a firefight it would be better to send in a robot to rescue a person, rather than another soldier who might get injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Vecna Technologies's chief technology officer, Daniel Theobald says that the company now is focusing on other missions for its robotics work. &ldquo;We quickly realized if we could build a robot that could rescue a wounded soldier, it would also be capable of a lot of other high value activities,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the missions the company has focused in on is logistics, or the idea of having robots move things from one place to another, or loading and unloading supplies. While not as glamorous perhaps as battlefield rescues, this sort of work is still critical to keeping human soldiers out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;A lot of time when soldiers get wounded, it&rsquo;s because they are doing some other activity, and couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands on their weapons,&rdquo; says Theobald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving supplies is also a mission envisaged for &lt;a href=\"http://www.bostondynamics.com/robot_bigdog.html\"&gt;Boston Dynamic&rsquo;s Big Dog&lt;/a&gt;, which has captured public attention for its eerily mammal-like movements.&nbsp; But like other robotic efforts, Big Dog&rsquo;s road to autonomy is slow - its designers would like it to be able to sense objects or barriers on its own, for example, but it would ultimately be supervised by a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in Afghanistan, for example, just moving things around has become a dangerous job, because it exposes troops on the ground to roadside bombs, which continues to be the leading cause of battlefield deaths there. Put robots in the place of the humans, and, at least in theory, lives would be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theobald says that when it comes to the battlefield, the first autonomous robots are likely going to be essentially deliverymen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the soldiers do the fighting,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Moving things around, that&rsquo;s something that the robots can do.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:13:32Z","HeadlineLong":"Next generation military robots have minds of their own","HeadlineShort":"Battle bots think for themselves","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A number of robots in development for the military are being given increasing amounts of autonomy.

They&rsquo;re just a few of my favourite film robots, and that&rsquo;s without bringing in androids, replicants, cyborgs or semi-sentient computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list rushed through my head this week when I &lt;a href=\"http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1674133&amp;highlight=\"&gt;read the news&lt;/a&gt; that the online bookstore-turned Aladdin&rsquo;s cave Amazon had bought a robotics firm called Kiva. Could the firm do for robotics what its Kindle has done electronic books? Would we all soon have sophisticated personal robots at our side... or at least to tuck us up in bed with an electronic story? In short, the answer seems to be a disappointing no. &lt;a href=\"http://www.kivasystems.com/\"&gt;Kiva builds &ldquo;order fulfilment solutions&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; hi-tech, and no doubt sophisticated, orange wagons for retrieving orders in warehouses. But orange wagons nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people, I find it hard to separate robots that exist from their all pervasive fantasy-world counterparts. In part, that&rsquo;s because ever since George Melies&rsquo; The Clown and the Automaton in 1897 we have been fed a slow drip diet of walking, talking mechanoids. And there&rsquo;s always something new along to reinforce it: like the recent Simpsons episode where Mr Burns replaces all the power plant workers with Asimo-style robots, all voiced by Brent Spiner, best known as Star Trek&rsquo;s android Data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real ones have walked or, far more often, not walked among us for over half a century.&nbsp; They are in every part of the world in ever increasing numbers &ndash; an estimated 150,000 new ones took up their places last year (according to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ifr.org/\"&gt;International Federation of Robotics&lt;/a&gt;).&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet the mental profile many of us have of them is so inaccurate we would struggle to identify a robot if it appeared in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Centurion army&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unimate, the first industrial robot began working at a General Motors factory in New Jersey in 1961, lifting and stacking chunks of hot metal straight from a die-stamping machine.&nbsp; Its inventor, who had the wonderfully futuristic name of George Devol, only died last year. Although Unimate was an impressive bit of design, robots have taken huge strides since then &ndash; not literally, that&rsquo;s The Iron Giant you&rsquo;re probably thinking of &ndash; with major advances in every aspect of how they look and see, react and interact, compute and cogitate.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And nowhere is that more apparent than in Japan &ndash; one of the few societies that has embraced robots &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo;. There, robots are considered one of the country&rsquo;s best hopes of meeting the challenge of its ageing population - there are now more than five million people in the country born before the word &ldquo;robot&rdquo; was even introduced by Karel Capek in his 1920 play R.U.R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Japanese researchers recently unveiled a whole mechanised army developed specifically to tend to the elderly, from the Hospi-Rimo robot to keep them linked to doctors and others, to a 24 fingered hair-washing robot, to a robot bed that morphs into an electric wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a seniors version of Transformers, then there&rsquo;s definite shades of Iron Man to another of their advances - a robotic suit designed to give the infirm extra strength and mobility.&nbsp; I have visions of Tokyo at the mercy of a new kind of armoured centurion, 100+ year olds stomping around in all all-powerful exo-skeletons like wrinkly Mechagodzillas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the reality of most robots is that they are designed to do all sorts of repetitive, difficult and dangerous tasks - including, perhaps most famously, the kind of bomb disposal shown in 2009&rsquo;s The Hurt Locker. The trailer-towing machine in the film&rsquo;s opening scenes is an HD-1 made by Tennessee company Remotec, and it&rsquo;s almost unique in cinema history in being a reasonably faithful representation of a robot.&nbsp; Particularly because the HD-1 isn&rsquo;t made to look slickly hi-tech: it requires delicate handling and struggles with the conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It features in one of the tensest sequences in a recent best picture Oscar-winner....and yet I doubt anyone would nominate HD-1 &ndash; even if they knew its name &ndash; as a favourite fictional robot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dominance of the real by the imaginary is so great I used to wonder what would happen if you went out on the street with a mime artist dressed in something that looks vaguely futuristic and with their face painted silver, and got them to slowly and &ldquo;robotically&rdquo; respond to commands.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspected quite a few passers-by would be likely to believe this was the latest robot out of the labs in Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp; More likely than if you showed them a bed that transformed into a wheelchair or something with 24 fingers that gave you a cut and blow dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say used to wonder, because earlier this week I was talking to one of the UK&rsquo;s best known roboticists, Noel Sharkey,&nbsp;Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sheffield University, and I told him about my robo-mime idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Already been done&rdquo;, he told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know a couple of &lsquo;people robots&rsquo; who act it out all the time&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; And is anyone fooled?&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Really fooled&rdquo;, he laughed, &ldquo;one of them was pretending to be R2D2 in Dublin and she got kicked down the stairs... by boys who thought she was a machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; So she was pretty convincing even when she screamed&rdquo;. &nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe that&rsquo;s a job for a real robot instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Quentin?

To those unfamiliar with the vehicle, it might have looked roughly similar to the US space shuttle, the manned spacecraft that shuttled astronauts into space for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this spaceplane, called the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, is very different. While it looks like a plane, is launched on a rocket, has a cargo bay and uses some of the same technology as the shuttle, such as thermal shielding to protect it during reentry, it is smaller and unmanned. It is designed to stay in orbit for months on end and can automatically land back on Earth. Perhaps more crucially, the Boeing-designed plane is operated by the US Air Force and its mission is a closely held secret, prompting a slew of speculation about its true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the first X-37B was launched in 2010, amateur satellite spotters have carefully followed the robotic spacecraft&rsquo;s orbit, while those unconnected with the program have speculated that the plane could be anything from an anti-satellite weapon to so-called &ldquo;on demand reconnaissance,&rdquo; shorthand for a spy satellite that can be placed over any country in the world. Compounding the mystery was the launch of a second vehicle in 2011, which stayed in orbit for 469 days, long exceeding the Air Force&rsquo;s stated maximum requirement of 270 days for the spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a third launch is slated for 11 December, according to an Air Force spokesperson, once again ramping up the rumour mill. So, what do we actually know about the plane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports focused on the X-37B&rsquo;s seeming resemblance, at least in size and weight, to &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar\"&gt;the X-20 Dynasoar&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dynamic Soarer), a 1950s-era hypersonic vehicle that was envisioned for a variety of military missions, including bombing and sabotaging enemy satellites. However, experts familiar with the X-37B programme emphasized that its technology is actually closer to the recently retired space shuttle (a &lt;a href=\"http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2011/CDReadymspace11_2426/PV2011_7315.pdf\"&gt;fact reinforced by Boeings&rsquo; proposal for a crewed version of the vehicle&lt;/a&gt; known as the X-37C). The Air Force blandly described the role of the X-37B in &lt;a href=\"http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16639\"&gt;a factsheet given to media&lt;/a&gt; as a \"reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Air Force also says the mini-shuttle has two objectives: testing &ldquo;reusable spacecraft technologies&rdquo; and conducting &ldquo;experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth&rdquo;. Again, this is similar to the stated aims of the space shuttle. But many forget that earlier craft also had a secret military role. Although ostensibly a civilian program, it conducted a series of missions from 1982-1992 on behalf of the National Reconnaissance Office, carrying a series of classified spy satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most outside experts now agree that it&rsquo;s likely the robotic space plane is being used for some sort of secret reconnaissance. &ldquo;I think the guess that makes most sense is quick-response tactical imaging, meaning hours to a couple of days from request to delivery,&rdquo; says Allen Thomson, a former CIA analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson says it is also possible that it could have a more mundane but useful task, such as &ldquo;maintaining up-to-date general purpose mapping imagery.&rdquo; However, if that is the case, Thomson says that it could be a waste of money. &ldquo;I think that the commercial satellites could and should do that cheaper and better than X-37B,&rdquo; he says. It is a view &lt;a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/the-x-37b-space-plane.html\"&gt;backed by parts of the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the X-37B launches comes in the middle of a larger debate about the role of government-operated spy satellites, which have proven enormously costly but can provide some of the most advanced imagery, versus commercial satellite imagery. The US intelligence community recently slashed its budget for commercial imagery, indicating that it was going back to greater reliance on its own classified satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view that the X-37B is a reconnaissance platform is strengthened by observations from amateur satellite watchers, who track the vehicles&rsquo; orbits, and noticed that it has similar orbits to spy satellites and scientific remote sensing craft. In addition, they noticed the craft changing its orbital path several times during its test flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected, says Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport. &ldquo;The upcoming launch will continue just to see what the vehicle can do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;One of the things they are testing is maneuverability. The problem with satellites in orbit is they are very predictably in certain orbits at certain times, and thus vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons (ASAT).&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson-Freese says the military has long been interested in the ability of a spacecraft that has &ldquo;the ability to evade, to maneuver, to not be in a predicable place at a predicable time.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects the Air Force will be &ldquo;pressing the envelope for manoeuvrability and duration&rdquo; during the X-37B&rsquo;s next flight. &ldquo;That will give them the idea of potential missions where avoidance of ASATs comes into play.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;No weapons&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although its orbits may be difficult to predict in advance, its tracks show where the X-37B has been and its likely purpose, says Brian Weeden, a technical advisor at the Secure World Foundation, a Washington-based foundation that focuses on space issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he says, the X-37B flew at inclination of 42.79 degrees, which tells you how far north and south in latitude the spacecraft can see. &ldquo;The tradeoff is that something at a 90 degree polar orbit covers the whole world, but its frequency is less; it may arrive only every couple of days,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If something is 40 or 45 degrees, it would be covering a smaller portion [of the earth], but more often. &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a 42.79 degree inclination, the X-37B would be useful for looking at a geographic region such as the Middle East, says Weeden, pouring cold water on one theory that that it was used to spy on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16423881\"&gt;China&rsquo;s spacelab, Tiangong-1&lt;/a&gt;. And given the current political context, he says, the Middle East &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeden also suggests the X-37B&rsquo;s orbit may indicate that the military is trying out a new sensor system, such as radar imaging or &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging\"&gt;hyperspectral sensors&lt;/a&gt;, which collect information across different wavelengths. He suggests this could be the case, because unlike satellites collecting light in the visible wavelength, the X-37B&rsquo;s orbits are not synchronized with the sun, a trick used to maintain a predictable angle between the sun, satellite and ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, like with many of the theories surrounding the X-37B, he warns, &ldquo;it is just speculation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Air Force itself is silent about the plane&rsquo;s use, only speaking to allay fears that it was a weapon. \"I don't know how this could be called weaponisation of space. It's just an updated version of the space shuttle type of activities in space,\" said Gary Payton, the Air Force's deputy undersecretary for space programmes, in 2010.&nbsp; \"We, the Air Force, have a suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever its purpose; the X-37B is perhaps one of the few bright spots among the Pentagon&rsquo;s hypersonic test vehicle programs.&nbsp; The Air Force&rsquo;s X-51A Waverider, a scramjet powered hypersonic missile, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120815-hypersonic-ambitions-fall-short\"&gt;suffered a fatal mishap earlier this year on a test flight&lt;/a&gt;, and never reached hypersonic speeds.&nbsp; Separately, another hypersonic prototype, known as the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14497641\"&gt;suffered mishaps in both flight tests&lt;/a&gt;, plunging into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those other efforts, which are focused on creating missiles, are still in early testing phase, while the X-37B is clearly further along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think the one interesting question is whether this is just test and evaluation, or is it being used to be support real world operations,&rdquo; says Weeden. But like most questions about the plane, it is one that is currently impossible to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Where science, security and secrets collide.

Then and now, most airliners have two wings, a cigar-shaped fuselage and a trio of vertical and horizontal stabilizers at the tail. If it isn&rsquo;t broke, the mantra has been, why fix it, particularly when your design needs to travel through the air at several hundred miles an hour packed with people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that conservative view could soon change. Rising fuel prices, increasingly stringent pollution limits, as well as a surge in demand for air travel, mean plane designers are going back to their drawing boards. And, now, radical new shapes and engine technologies are beginning to emerge, promising the biggest shake-up in air travel since de Haviland introduced the first commercial jet airliner in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would be wrong to say nothing has changed in the last few decades, says Rich Wahls, an aerodynamicist at Nasa&rsquo;s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. &nbsp;&ldquo;New model airliners don&rsquo;t come out every year like cars, but it&rsquo;s not as if they haven&rsquo;t been evolving under the skin the whole time. There&rsquo;s so much more technology in there nowadays.&rdquo; &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier improvements went mostly unnoticed because they focused on building better and quieter turbine engines with higher performance and improved fuel consumption. There have also been huge strides in computer controls and fly-by-wire systems, which make a big difference to the pilot, but not to the passengers. And in recent years, the biggest development has been the use of strong, but lightweight plastics and composite materials rather than metals, reducing the weight of planes and the amount of fuel they need to burn. This has also allowed the development of &ldquo;radical&rdquo; new planes like the giant Airbus A380 and the Boeing Dreamliner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite these advances, aviation engineers know there is still much to be done. Take fuel prices, for instance, which have soared in recent years. Despite modern planes being 60% to 70% more efficient than those built 60 years ago, aviation fuel expenditures now account for a quarter of an airlines operating expenses, placing them on a par with labor costs. In 2011, large US air carriers paid half again as much for fuel as what they paid in 2000. Add the fact that global airline travel is expected to grow to 3.3 billion annually by 2014 (up one third from 2009), and it&rsquo;s clear why engineers are searching for new ways to boost performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest efforts to rethink the airplane is being conducted by Nasa&rsquo;s Subsonic Fixed-Wing program, a collaboration between the US aerospace agency and industrial partners including Boeing, GE, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Pratt &amp; Whitney, as well as academic institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking to see if we can develop technologies that can get us yet another 60 to 70% improvement in fuel efficiency,&rdquo; says Wahls. In addition, the project wants to engineer new designs with a 71-decibel decrease in noise emissions and a four-fifths fall in nitrogen oxide pollutants from current standards. And, if these kinds of goals weren&rsquo;t already aggressive enough, the team wants any new technology to enter service between 2030 and 2035 - a mere blink of an eye in an industry in which commercial aircraft can have multi-decade life spans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We are trying to determine which technologies are worth pursuing; those that might get us anywhere near our goals,&rdquo; says Wahls&rsquo; boss, Ruben Del Rosario, subsonic fixed-wing program manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planes under investigation by Nasa range from the extreme to the slightly more conventional. For example, Boeing&rsquo;s Sugar Volt is a design that came about as part of the manufacturers Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (Sugar) project. The design &ndash; like many new concepts - is based around the idea of maximizing the plane&rsquo;s lift. This reduces the amount of power needed to keep the plane in the air, as well as the amount of fuel it must burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sugar Volt does this by using very long, narrow, flexible wings. They are so long that engineers needed to brace them with under-wing truss support struts, making the aircraft resemble the Piper Cub and other light, high-winged planes. The SugarVolt&rsquo;s wings are extended in order to increase lift, allowing shorter take-off distances and requiring less power in flight. They are so long, in fact, that the Boeing designers may have to fit them with hinges so that they could fit in existing airports and boarding gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burning up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, are other ways to improve performance than just making longer wings. A team from MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for example, put forward the D8 for consideration by Nasa. This &ldquo;double-bubble&rdquo; aircraft design, features a double-wide fuselage composed of two standard body cylinders melded together side-by-side, as well as low-swept wings that cut drag and weight. The idea of the wider body shape is to increase lift generated by the fuselage, rather than it being mostly dead weight slung between two wings. The extra lift and reduced drag cuts back on the quantity of fuel that the engines must burn. If the jet were built today from standard aluminum alloys it could provide a 50% reduction in fuel use, according to the MIT designers; a low-mass polymer-composite version could give 70% efficiency gains. In addition, because the D8&rsquo;s turbine engines sit on top of the fuselage in a box-shaped tail, they would cut the amount of engine noise broadcast to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The D8&rsquo;s idea for generating greater lift is taken to an extreme in another design called the N3-X hybrid wing-body airplane, which Nasa developed in-house. At first glance, the N3-X looks a lot like a so-called flying wing design, used by planes such as the US Air Force&rsquo;s B-2 stealth bomber. These comprise a single, thick triangular wing that enclose all of the plane&rsquo;s contents - cockpit, stores, engines, fuel tanks and flight surfaces. But, unlike the B-2 flying wing, the N3-X hybrid wing-body also features two thin, rather conventional wings attached to the sides of its ultra-wide fuselage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary advantage of the hybrid, or blended, wing-body design is better fuel efficiency, Del Rosario says. Like a flying wing, the hybrid aircraft produces lift with its entire aerodynamic airframe, thus ridding itself of the drag associated with the cylindrical fuselage and the tail surfaces of a conventional plane. As with the D8, the more lift that can be produced overall, the less effort is needed from the engines, which in turn means less fuel must be burned. Fuel efficiency could be raised further by building the airframe from lightweight polymer composite materials instead of metals, Del Rosario says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool running&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers are aware, however, that new airframe shapes will only get them part of the way to their goals. To really make a difference, particularly to fuel consumption and engine noise, planes will also need radically new propulsion systems mounted or integrated into the airframe in novel ways. And, like car designers, aircraft manufacturers makers are beginning to explore the possibilities of electric and hybrid engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing&rsquo;s Sugar Volt concept, for example, would use a hybrid-electric propulsion system that combines fuel-burning (turbine) engines, electric motors and electrochemical storage batteries&mdash;a propulsion concept not totally unlike that inside a Toyota Prius. The hybrid system would let the operators choose to draw engine power from the turbines or the batteries, whichever provides the most benefit for the specific segment of the flight&mdash;takeoff, landing, cruise, and so forth. &ldquo;You can envision a 737-class airliner using the combination of turbine and electric power for take off and then, depending on the situation, switching over to cruise on one or the other,&rdquo; says Marty Bradley, principal investigator for subsonic ultra-green aircraft research at Boeing Research and Technology in Bellevue, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasa&rsquo;s N3-X is also designed around a completely new engine concept, called turboelectric distributed propulsion. It splits the main functions of a standard turbine engine in two - generating power by burning fuel and creating thrust by blowing air rearward with a large fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to use two large turbine engines to drive electric generators that would produce electricity to power 15 electric motor-driven, thrust-producing fans that would be embedded across the top rear of the broad fuselage. Such a configuration could be very efficient, Del Rosario says. The array of small electric propulsion fans at the stern of N3-X enables the designers to cut drag significantly by accelerating the flow of drag-causing air moving over the upper surface of the fuselage, keeping efficiency-sapping air friction at a minimum. Like the D8, the top-mounted propulsor fans would also effectively lower noise emissions because the body would come between them and the ground below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airliner concept may have an Achilles&rsquo; heel, though. For such a system to reach maximum fuel-efficiency targets, the electronics, generators and motors may need to be built from superconducting (zero-resistance) materials, meaning the jet&rsquo;s electrics would have to be super-cooled by liquid hydrogen at &minus;253C (&minus;423F) or liquid nitrogen at -196C (321F) to make them work. This cryogenic technology is not yet fully practical and could take decades to prove out. Recent studies indicate, however, that substantial fuel-consumption gains could still be obtained by using existing electrical technology running at ambient temperatures, according to Del Rosario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that scheme sounds far out, other manufacturers are looking at developing fully electric systems for the 2050 time-frame. Aircraft engineers and designers at Eads, the parent firm of Airbus, for instance, have proposed a rather extreme concept called the Voltaire. The bulbous, 50-seat fuselage with two, long slender wings and a giant propeller on the tail, make it resemble a submarine. The concept, first put forward in 2011, would use next-generation batteries to power high-efficiency superconducting electric motors that would in turn drive the giant counter-rotating propellers mounted in a cylindrical shroud at the tail. Unlike any of the Nasa concepts, it is designed to be zero-emission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sling shot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, anyone thinking that the electric Voltaire airliner may fly any time soon, needs to think again, says Johannes Stuhlberger, head of the global innovation network, power and flight propulsion at Eads. &ldquo;The development of electric aircraft not only depends on the speed at which battery technology improves, but also how fast electrical equipment - the motors - get better.&rdquo; Electric motors would need efficiencies of around 95%, he adds, noting that for any new system to become a reality will require &ldquo;tremendous improvements in the power-to-mass ratio of the entire propulsion system, while still keeping it affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shorter term, engineers at the Airbus group are trying to reduce fuel-consumption emissions by developing novel launch systems, similar to those found on naval aircraft carriers. In one radical concept, a low-slung carriage vehicle with an airliner mounted on its back would accelerate down the tarmac and loft the plane into the air. Such a device would substantially reduce the initial power required for a passenger plane to take off. Airbus envisages the eco-climb system moving into position automatically and assisting airliners to climb steeper and reach cruising altitude faster and from shorter runways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of these developments will undoubtedly lead to changes in the passengers&rsquo; in-flight experience. Catapult take-offs will likely mean passengers will be thrust back into their seats more firmly than happens now. Ultra-wide bodied planes will likely mean fewer window per seat for the occupants and their larger seat capacities could also lead to slower passenger-deplaning procedures both at the airport and in emergency landing situations. But there will also be benefits from these new wider spaces, which could, for example, accommodate large communal social spaces for kids more commonly found on cruise ships, whilst quiet electric engines could mean a good night&rsquo;s sleep for travelers normally disturbed by the drone of turbine engines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Are the extra carrots in the new designs worth the extra effort and costs they entail?&rdquo; asks Nasa&rsquo;s Wahls. Only time will tell. Many of these concepts are just that: concepts that are destined never to become a reality. However, like concept cars that push what is technologically possible on the road, these craft will probably inform the design of future airliners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when you gaze up at the skies in twenty years time, perhaps the airplane passing by will look different from those you grew up with after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:17:05Z","HeadlineLong":"Radical planes take shape","HeadlineShort":"Radical planes take shape","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Engineers and designers are giving commercial aircraft a makeover, in a bid to make them faster, greener and more efficient.

Now, engineers are trying to make the next leap to craft that can fly more than five times the speed of sound. But it is proving difficult. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent test flight &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19277620\"&gt;ended in failure&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday when a faulty control fin caused the US Air Force &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-51\"&gt;X-51 Waverider &lt;/a&gt;jet to lose control and crash into the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missile-like vehicle -&nbsp; powered by a supersonic combustion engine known as a scramjet - was dropped from a B-52 bomber off the coast of southern California&nbsp; It was supposed to be propelled by a solid-rocket booster, then ignite its scramjet engine to reach speeds of up to Mach 6. In the end, the test flight lasted just 31 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&nbsp; was the last of three planned tests of the X-51, designed to demonstrate the feasibility of a hypersonic missile. It now joins a long list of failed hypersonic flights that show just how difficult it is to reach these so-called hypersonic speeds, usually defined as Mach 5 or above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Rush to failure&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeal of hypersonics is simple: imagine an aircraft that can travel from New York to London in under an hour, or a missile that can reach anywhere in the world in less than two hours. But military experts have long cautioned that missiles, rather than reusable aircraft, are likely to be what will be developed first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An air-to-air missile or an even an air-to-ground missile is the most likely near-term application for hypersonics, says Werner Dahm, director of Security and Defense Systems Initiative at Arizona State University, and a former US Air Force chief scientist. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s technologically much more achievable in the near to midterm,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers have taken a variety of approaches to hypersonic aircraft over the years: the X-51 is called a WaveRider because it literally rides its own shock waves, and is powered by a scramjet, a variation of the traditional ramjet engine, where the exhaust from fuel combustion is compressed as it goes through the engine. But the Pentagon has also looked at a number of rocket-boosted gliders, and more complicated reusable aircraft powered by combination turbine and ramjet engines, among other designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even building a test vehicle has proved difficult: the first X-51 flight test was cut short due to a flight anomaly, and the second test failed after the vehicle didn&rsquo;t separate from its rocket, as planned. Yesterday&rsquo;s failure is likely to raise even more questions about the future of hypersonic efforts. &ldquo;Hypersonics test and evaluation is extremely unforgiving of miscalculation and error,&rdquo; says Richard Hallion, a former senior advisor to the Air Force, and a leading expert on hypersonics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, hypersonics has a mixed history, littered with the bodies of cancelled test vehicles, particularly those that have proved too ambitious. Hallion says many hypersonic research programs have suffered from a &ldquo;rush to failure&rdquo;, where flight vehicles have been flown too early, and then failed not because of an inherent problem in the vehicle, but because of a simple engineering mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most memorable, perhaps, was the 1980s-era &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_X-30\"&gt;National Aero-Space Plane&lt;/a&gt;, which was touted by President Ronald Reagan as a new Orient Express that could travel from Washington, DC to Tokyo in two hours, reaching speeds of up to 25 times the speed of sound. But the test aircraft, dubbed the X-30, proved too costly and vastly too complicated for the technology at the time. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), the research and development arm of the Pentagon, tried to revive the idea of a reusable hypersonic aircraft through a program called &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Falcon_Project#Blackswift\"&gt;Blackswift&lt;/a&gt;, though it was soon canceled, after Congress questioned the ability to engineer such an aircraft, given previous failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that has not put them off the idea of hypersonic flight. The Pentagon also recently started work on the High Speed Strike Weapon, a hypersonic missile that will be launched from an aircraft. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the next step,&rdquo; says Mark Lewis, a former Air Force chief scientist, who was involved in the X-51 effort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s looking at making hypersonics more operational and practical.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another programme is also underway: Darpa, which has also funded the X-51, held an open meeting this week for those interested in bidding on a new hypersonic program, which according to the agency announcement, is expected to lead to a hypersonic &ldquo;X-plane&rdquo; in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Monumental challenge&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme, however, is based on the design of the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Falcon_Project\"&gt;Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2&lt;/a&gt;, or HTV-2, an unmanned glider that can travel at speeds of up to Mach 20, but suffered two previous catastrophic failures. The HTV-2 was designed to be launched off a rocket, and then glide, unpowered. But in its first flight, the vehicle began to spin like a football eventually crashing; the second flight also failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTV-2 was once considered as a candidate for a mission known as &ldquo;Prompt Global Strike,&rdquo; a weapon that could travel anywhere in the world within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For critics of the HTV-2, Darpa&rsquo;s decision to continue with a vehicle that already failed twice in flight for apparent design failures is a repeat of mistakes made in previous hypersonic programmes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad design. It flew twice, it was lost twice,&rdquo; says Hallion. &ldquo;No matter how much lipstick you put on this pig, it&rsquo;s still a pig.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advocates of hypersonics, however, believe that the real problem with the government and military programmes is that they try to do much, and then simply cut off support when things go wrong. &ldquo;You cannot achieve this until you commit yourself to doing it,&rdquo; says Preston Carter, who previously managed hypersonics programs at Nasa, Darpa, and the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carter is now in the private sector trying to find funding for a commercial aircraft designed to travel at speeds of around Mach 5, which would make the trip from New York to London in about half the time that it took the Concorde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypersonics is challenging, Carter acknowledges, but it&rsquo;s not impossible. He points to previous aircraft, like the SR-71 Blackbird, a supersonic spy plane, and the civilian Concorde that, though not hypersonic, pushed the envelope of what was technically possible. Those aircraft also had seemingly monumental engineering challenges at the start, but they eventually succeeded, Carter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same approach needs to be taken to hypersonic aircraft. &ldquo;The reason why they were able to do it because they started,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The reason we won&rsquo;t do it is because we haven&rsquo;t started.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was updated at 2010GMT on 15 August to state that a faulty control fin caused the failure of the X-51. &lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-08-15T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"X-51 Waverider: Hypersonic jet ambitions fall short","HeadlineShort":"Hypersonic ambitions fall short","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The dreams of being able to fly from New York to London in under an hour are once again put on hold, as the latest effort to fly at over five times the speed of sound ends in failure. \n","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"slideshow","SummaryLong":"The latest attempt to fly at over five times the speed of sound joins the long list of efforts that have ended in failure.

As the sleek, rocket approached its target altitude of 350km (218 miles), it began to arc back to earth, gradually accelerating to so-called hypersonic speeds of up to Mach 8 &ndash; about 9,800km/h (6,100 mph).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test was the fifth of nine planned launches for the Hifire vehicle, which its &lt;a href=\"http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/news/6947/\"&gt;backers claim &lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&ldquo;could be a major step forward in the quest for hypersonic flight&rdquo;, generally regarded as Mach 5 and above. At these speeds, headline writers like to say, we could soon be zipping from London to New York in just one hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a promise that is often repeated about Hifire and other vehicles, such as the experimental US Air Force X-51A WaveRider, that had its latest (unsuccessful) test in August. Yet, delve back in history, you find similar promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pages of popular books, magazines and newspaper comics, the hyperfast world of airline travel was predicted to be just over the horizon. There was seemingly no limit to humanity&rsquo;s capability to zip about the globe with increasing speed. In his 1965 book &lt;a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Supersonic_Transport.html?id=PoDSYgEACAAJ\"&gt;Supersonic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Supersonic_Transport.html?id=PoDSYgEACAAJ\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Supersonic_Transport.html?id=PoDSYgEACAAJ\"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;, Irwin Stambler charts the progression of time it took to cross the Atlantic in history: from 350 hours on wooden ships to 120 hours on steam ships to 60 hours in dirigibles to 12 hours prop planes to 6 hours in planes of the very near future. The graph continues and projects forward to when the one hour barrier would be passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was written at a time when air travel was emerging as a reasonably affordable option for many middle class people and there was reason to be optimistic that not only would prices continue to fall, but jets would continue to get faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needle point nose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period of optimism started on 14 October 1947, when Air Force pilot Charles &ldquo;Chuck&rdquo; Yeager dropped from the bomb bay of a B-29 bomber in the experimental X-1, a rocket-powered airplane that was the first to break the sound barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following years, the prospect of supersonic &ndash; and faster - air travel was always just around the corner. On 22 January 1953, for example, the Gleaner, a paper based in Kingston, Jamaica, carried a story from the Associated Press with the headline &ldquo;London to N.Y in one hour seen&rdquo;. The story quoted a talk given by the then chief executive of British Overseas Airways to the Aircraft Recognition Society. \"In the next 50 years our grandchildren will probably be looking at supersonic commercial aircraft carrying up to 500 passengers at fares cheaper than third class travel today,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first vehicles to begin to test these claims &ndash; as with today&rsquo;s hypersonic craft &ndash; were built and operated by the military. This was in part out of necessity and precedent. But, as Stambler notes in his book, building a military plane and a commercial &ldquo;supersonic transport&rdquo; for passengers are two completely different challenges. Providing an acceptable experience for paying customers (taking into account high temperatures, appropriate cabin pressurization, and so on) is one of the obvious and yet daunting challenges of non-military high-speed aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that didn&rsquo;t stop people trying. In Europe, the UK and French governments subsidised designs that would eventually become Concorde, while in Russia, plans were revealed form the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-144\"&gt;Tupolev Tu-144&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed Concordski for its similarity to the European craft.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the US, various firms hawked competing designs. In a &lt;a href=\"http://books.google.com.au/books?id=99sDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=true&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true\"&gt;1960&rsquo;s Popular Mechanics article&lt;/a&gt; titled &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a peek at tomorrow&rsquo;s huge planes&rdquo;, the writer describes two different designs from North American Aviation and Lockheed. The North American Aviation was designed primarily for military use, but Lockheed focused on the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Lockheed officials, arguing that there is now no technical , operational or economic reason why a supersonic transport could not be developed in the US, suggest that its shape could be needed-pointed fore and aft, and that it have a swept back stabilizer near the front end of the fuselage,&rdquo; it reads. &ldquo;Passengers would sit forward of the delta wing.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The steel plane would cost $160m to develop, it says, but the firm believed it could sell up to 200 of them at $9,240,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 1960s, Concorde was given the go ahead. However, its high cost meant that the French Aerospatiale and the British Aircraft Corporation had to combine forces. Their final design was revealed in March 1969, when the sleek-nosed aircraft climbed into the sky for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Speeding bird&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run up to this 27 minute maiden flight, supersonic transport was a recurring theme in popular culture. For example, the July 11, 1965 edition of the Sunday comic strip Our New Age, written by &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/paleofuture/2012/01/sunday-funnies-blast-off-into-the-space-age/\"&gt;Athelstan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/paleofuture/2012/01/sunday-funnies-blast-off-into-the-space-age/\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/paleofuture/2012/01/sunday-funnies-blast-off-into-the-space-age/\"&gt;Spilhaus&lt;/a&gt;, promised readers that supersonic commercial aircraft would become a reality by 1972. The comic strip, taking its cues from Concorde, explained that these high-speed vehicles will look &ldquo;just like paper darts - just one triangular wing and a vertical tail - but built of titanium alloys to withstand the heat.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strip explained that while the 200 passenger supersonic planes of tomorrow would travel supersonically above (45,000 feet), they would have to take off and descend slowly in order to not disturb people on the ground, and even break windows in areas around the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last frame of the strip paints a glorious picture for the wide-eyed airline passenger of tomorrow: &ldquo;cruising at altitudes over 70,000 feet, you may see aurora, a dark blue sky and the curvature of the earth - while going three times the speed of sound.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, it wasn&rsquo;t meant to be; at least not for long. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde\"&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt; began commercial flights in 1976, becoming one of only two supersonic passenger planes to ever fly. But in perhaps the most blatant affront to the theory of exponential technological growth (at least that the market will sustain), ceased flights 27 years later following a deadly crash and ongoing concerns about safety and cost. No commercial supersonic transport has so far replaced it, despite &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120405-supersonic-jets-ready-to-take-off\"&gt;various designs being put forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Concorde set many records, it did not come close to the mythical one hour crossing between New York and London. Its fastest crossing occurred on 7 February 1996 when Captain Leslie Scott flew from the US to the UK in two hours 2 hours 52 minutes and 59 seconds. The Press Association reported that the Concorde &ldquo;breezed into the record books - thanks to 175mph tail winds across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The aircraft averaged more than 1,250 miles an hour all the way from take-off to landing - travelling a mile every three seconds,&rdquo; the report read. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other craft have admittedly come closer. In 1974 two American Air Force officers flew their SR-71A &ldquo;Blackbird&rdquo; from New York to London in one hour 54 minutes 56.4 seconds. But, it seems that despite the promises of yesteryear, a one hour flight still remains firmly in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:14:24Z","HeadlineLong":"The quest to fly from New York to London in one hour","HeadlineShort":"'New York to London in one hour'","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A trans-Atlantic journey of just sixty minutes has been promised since the dawn of supersonic flight, but is it now closer to reality?
