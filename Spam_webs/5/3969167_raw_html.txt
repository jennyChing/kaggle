             <p>
              When people first see my work, a good portion of them ask me one simple question: how long did that take
              <em>
               ?
              </em>
              To which there is a simple answer: I have no idea.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reaction to this, most of the time, is poor. Ive seen confusion, and even suspicion cloud peoples faces. Gears churn, judgements are rendered.
              <em>
               Why doesnt he pay attention, set a timer, do some basic book keeping here?
              </em>
              But the truth is, my total disregard for time keeping is actually
              <em>
               worse
              </em>
              than it appears: I dont ever bother to date anything Ive done, (or sign anything for that matter), so I dont even know when I started a particular piece, much less the specific hourly total it took to finish it. Clearly, the time spent is a detail I just dont think about. In fact, I would be hard pressed to think of a detail that matters less.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand, I sure can think of one that matters a whole lot more:
              <em>
               total awesomeness
              </em>
              . But how long does awesome take? Yeah, I dont know either. What I do know is that the total time spent is moot when all that matters is the end product  Im sure as hell not getting paid by the hour.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we can all agree that awesome takes awhile, (assuming that its achieved at all) then a better question might be, why strive for such a lofty goal in the first place? Answering that means first acknowledging that there are plenty of other things for people to look at besides my sculptures. Like things from the Renaissance for example. Or Egyptian ruins, or Gothic cathedrals, or Mayan pyramids, and so on and so on. To expect people to look at what Ive done for any length of time, much less deeply or contemplatively, a pretty high bar has to be cleared. With that in mind, awesome doesnt seem crazy, it just seems reasonable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seen from that wide angle view, the onus is on me to get really really good at what I do. And it goes without saying: having an onus on you is pretty motivating.
             </p>
             <p>
              So pretty early on in my career I spent a lot of time getting better at making things, settling in to a role as a perpetual student, taking the discipline of it seriously. And as I did so, things took a surprising turn: getting better increased my technical skills, true enough, but more importantly, I gained a kind of fluidity with my creative thinking, as well as increased confidence in trying new and dificult things. In other words, working with my hands had a
              <em>
               mental
              </em>
              , and
              <em>
               emotional
              </em>
              pay off, not just a technical one.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I noticed something else: merging ability, confidence and creativity sets in motion a proccess that begets something Id never really understood before -
              <em>
               ownership
              </em>
              . Notice I didnt say
              <em>
               mastery
              </em>
              , which is perhaps a synonym, because mastery sounds like a rank, and Im not trying to earn a black belt at this. Ownership is my preferred discription, which to me simply means the co-mingling of knowledge and ability. The result is alchemical. The better I get, the greater the ownership I have. The greater the ownership I have, the greater the agency.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ownership, knowledge, ability, agencythe jargon mounts. But really all of it leads to that last one: agency. Agency relates to options, choices, avenuesmy dictionary defines it as Active force; action; power. That by which something is done Gaining agency therefore operates in a different way than
              <em>
               buying
              </em>
              something, which is really the more orthodox path to ownership. Buying, (usually with the swipe of a card), gives said swiper the right to use, and then store, that something in perpetuity. Ownership, as Im defining it via agency, is more about
              <em>
               expanding on ones powers
              </em>
              , rather than simply paying a usage fee.
             </p>
             <p>
              At this point I should interject that I understand the sheer utility of paying for stuff  buying things is great. Thank you capitalism! (Though I prefer the part before the oppressive plutocracy takes hold.) But the convenience of the one method doesnt erase the truth of the other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Expanding on ones powers, or even having any power at all, is an essential human need. Thats how money takes on such a mystical aura  most of the time money is the replacement part for power  we usually see it as one and the same in fact. It is certainly hard to argue that
              <em>
               buying
              </em>
              other peoples knowledge and labor is an easy and addictive short cut to
              <em>
               knowing
              </em>
              much of anything at all. On the other hand, one could argue (and I would), that true poverty is ignorance, and no matter how much money you have, you cant pay cash for knowledge. Thats why its completely possible to be rich, and ignorant, and powerless.
             </p>
             <p>
              Buying information is possible of course. So is downloading it for free on the Internets. But I now understand that there is an important distinction between knowledge and information - information might spark knowledge, but then again it might not - its neutral, inert. Heres an example: Imagine a bunch of sticks lying on the ground - An architect draws up plans to build a house with them. The plans are information.
              <em>
               Knowledge
              </em>
              is the thing needed to actually build the house, (or to artfully conceive the design, and draw up the plans for that matter). Knowledge can be gleaned from the assembly process,
              <em>
               if
              </em>
              those involved actually follow through, (because its a lot easier to not follow through on plans after all) and
              <em>
               if
              </em>
              those involved pay attention. The really compelling point out of all this is that knowledge comes out of
              <em>
               actions
              </em>
              , not just words, and results in a physical artifact. After awhile, if a bunch of houses get built, and all the attendant hassles and challenges are overcome, that now familiar alchemical process of merging ability, confidence, and creativity is set in motion to form well like I said above, to me it equals ownership.
             </p>
             <p>
              We live in a time when we are removed from the world, physically, and creatively. The cycle of buying things, as opposed to knowing how to do things, means that we are more and more dependent on the ability of others for the necessities of our lives. Our creative interaction withers as a result, because we cant tinker with systems we dont understand. I like the idea of understanding a system, of really being on the inside of something. Knowing something,
              <em>
               really
              </em>
              knowing it, in any sphere (it sure doesnt have to be carving), becomes a transferable skill - it might not mean that you can become an expert at everything, but it does mean that you can confidently attempt pretty much anything.
             </p>
             <p>
              So how long did it take? No idea. Im still working on it.

              It wasnt that long ago that I ran across an image of something made by Marcel Duchamp that I was completely unfamiliar with: a chess set. He had made it in 1918, during a nine-month sojourn in Buenos Aires, Argentina. That I was unfamiliar with it surprised me; I was pretty sure Id seen every single thing hed ever made.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not like thats a real feat of scholarship by the way. His output, compared to pretty much any other artist out there, could charitably be described as sporadic, and sparse. It meant that when I
              <em>
               did
              </em>
              actually see his chess set, designed and made by his own hand, it felt like finding something in King Tuts tomb that had been overlooked somehow; a forgotten artifact in one of the most picked over spots in the world.

              A couple of things struck me about it immediately: the first was that he was a woodworker, like me. This was such an improbable realization I laughed out loud. The image I saw in my head of Duchamp surrounded by sawdust, with cuts and calluses on his hands, seemed to upend everything I thought I knew about him. True, he probably had help with it, and true, most of the pieces looked like they were turned on a lathe, but the knights and the rooks were definitely carved, something that Duchamp was known to do in his past. The second thing though was that it was free of any kind of oppositional posturing, which is a quality that permeates virtually all of his art. The feeling I got from it instead was one of comfort, utility, and beauty, three words that I would have a hard time attaching to anything else he ever did.
             </p>
             <p>
              It could be said, of course, that he wasnt trying to make
              <em>
               art
              </em>
              with the chess set, which is why it reads so differently. But it could also be said that he didnt really want
              <em>
               anything
              </em>
              he ever made to look like art - he bridled constantly at what he considered traditional art making, without ever being able to fully free himself of it. Thats because, while he might have made
              <em>
               non-art
              </em>
              instead of art, the negation of something is only possible if the original something exists clearly in the mind of the negator. But all of that gamesmanship (no pun intended) falls away with his handsome, carved wooden chess set, free of any kind of obfuscation, humor, or oppositional critique. Its justa chess set.
             </p>
             <p>
              Something nagged at me about it though - there seemed to be a set of contradictions bundled up in there that begged to be untangled. It had always struck me as ironic that Duchamp was (and is) exhibit A when it comes to defining iconoclastic, rule-breaking artists, yet at the same time, he was slavishly devoted to a game whose rules he happily accepted, played on a mere 64 squares. The irony of that extends even further with this chess set, because it intersects with aesthetic decision-making, and actual
              <em>
               hand
              </em>
              -making for that matter the stuff of traditional art. It makes clear that he had a certain posture in the art world, a certain stylistic and conceptual starting point, that simply fell away as soon as he was outside of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              That realization quickly lead to another: if one has separate aesthetics for art and for life, then how do you make art about life? To which the answer might be  you dont. As Duchamp himself once said: There are two kinds of artists: the artist who deals with society; and the other artist, the completely freelance artist, who has nothing to do with it  no bonds. Its pretty clear which one he saw in himself. And while Duchamp was original in most things art related, his no-bonds thing was very much a product of his time. The image most of us have of the unshackled, rule-breaking bohemian artist is very much a modernist invention, and defines how we view artists even now. Its such a clich that we forget why it was so important for artists to be unshackled in the first place. And it was because
              <em>
               freedom
              </em>
              was important.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pushing the boundaries of art defined progress, because artists saw the freedom of art as analogous to human freedom in general, and they very consciously saw themselves as being the ones tasked with enlarging its sphere. As Gordon Matta-Clark said in one of his letters: The value of art as it services and sometimes flourishes in our system is so closely related to occidental beliefs in individual rights of free expression that one can accurately speak of the state of art as a measure of the state of freedom in our society. The idea of artists getting into the weeds about feelings and desires, or human foibles, or just making something beautiful, wasnt nearly as grand a vision as enlarging the human capacity to be free. Art was a noble struggle. For that reason, art wasnt about
              <em>
               showing
              </em>
              life, as much as it was about
              <em>
               being
              </em>
              life - this the crux of the work by Jackson Pollock for example, or Mark Rothko, two artists whose work attempted a spiritual realism, while being mislabeled abstract expressionism. And while they and others like them might seem laughably romantic to us now, viewed through our suspicious postmodern haze, understanding this fundamental impulse during the modernist era is key.
             </p>
             <p>
              Into this project stepped Duchamp. Or should I say, he stepped in for a minute, and then he stepped back out. His patience with the art world could at best be described as limited, which explains why he was in Buenos Aires in the first place; he was trying like hell to run away from it. That also explains why he was in New York, (the place he left to get to Buenos Aires) he was trying like hell to get out of Paris. Here he is sharing some of his observations about the art world to his friend Katherine Dreier: The more I live among artists, the more I am convinced that they are fakes from the minute they get to be successful in the smallest way. This means also that all the dogs around artists are crooks. If you see the combination fakes and crooks how have you been able to keep some kind of faith (and in what?) Dont name a few exceptions to justify a milder opinion about the whole art game. In the end, a painting is declared good only if it is worth so much. It may even be accepted by the holy museums. So much for posterity. And here he is, writing to his friend Alfred Stieglitz, who asked him if a photograph can have the significance of a Work Of Art: You know exactly how I feel about photography, I would like to see it make people despise painting until something else will make photography unbearable. And here is one more, in a letter to his sometimes-patron Jacques Doucet:  All expositions of painting or sculpture make me ill. And so on.
             </p>
             <p>
              He may have been running away from art, but in Buenos Aires he found something he could run towards: chess. He had always liked the game, but his time in Buenos Aires made him into what he later described as a Chess Maniac. He joined a chess club, he hired a coach, he played so often, and for so long, that his girl friend left him. He made the aforementioned killer chess set. And he basically embarked on a new career.
             </p>
             <p>
              When he came back, he said in a letter to his good friend Man Ray, My ambition is to become a professional chess player, which he did. At this point its important to note that those who think Duchamps incessant chess playing was some kind of performance piece, and that he was really an artist the whole time, tend to ignore not only his words, (lots and lots of words), but his actions. As Calvin Tompkins notes in his biography on Duchamp, For about 15 years, from 1918 to 1933, Duchamps activities had very little to do with art. but everything to do with chess. In time he achieved his goal and became a touring professional, he wrote a book about chess endings, (woah) and even represented France in the Chess Olympiad. Here he is describing the difference between artists and chess players: From my close contact with artists and chess players, I have come to the personal conclusion that while all artists are not chess players, all chess players are artists. Even when he wasnt really in the art world, he still took the time to flog artists now and again.
             </p>
             <p>
              For decades afterwards, its difficult not to get the sense that Duchamp was a chess player first and foremost, who occasionally, on a strictly part time basis, and with very limited conviction, made art. That phase lasted until well into his sixties, when people like John Cage coaxed him back into the art world. Even then, as a new found fame was settling on him, he said: Art is only one occupation among others. Its not all my life, far from it. To which he added this capper: Art is a habit forming drug. Thats all it is for the artist, for the collector, for anybody connected with it. Art has absolutely no existence as veracity, as truth. People speak of it with great religious reverence, but I dont see why it is to be so much revered. Im afraid Im agnostic when it comes to art. I dont believe in it with all the mystical trimmings. And so on and so on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Spending a lot of time outside of the art world really allowed him to identify the invisible membrane that separates the
              <em>
               art
              </em>
              world, from the
              <em>
               world
              </em>
              world, and
              <em>
               artists
              </em>
              from regular civilians. He was able to see an insular aspect to the art world that simply did not occur to his peers, subsumed as they were within it, and dependent as they were upon it. His readymades in particular seem to demonstrate that anything within that membrane can plausibly be seen as art, while those same things seen outside of it, not so much. Thats how a urinal flipped on its back could be art  it was dependent on the context to make it so. The same could be said of a cheap postcard of the Mona Lisa, with a mustache and goatee hastily drawn on it. Inside the membrane, its a comment about authorship, appropriation, gender roles, and so on. The commentary and scholarship on that piece alone is vast. Yet outside of that membrane, its just visual detritus, graffiti, or a prank. And to Duchamp it actually
              <em>
               was
              </em>
              a prank of course; if the whole alchemical process of the art world seemed suspect, and worthy of his mistrust, well it was - in his era, and in ours.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is an inherent irony to this observation of course. (The word just cant be avoided with him). If art is a thing separated from life by context, and that separation seemed like it was worth pointing out, then he failed to notice that he was guilty of doing the same thing - thats how a chess set and a readymade dont operate in the same way. Not like Duchamp thought they should  he was into the no-bonds thing after all. But if art was about
              <em>
               being
              </em>
              life, and not simply
              <em>
               showing
              </em>
              it, then his chess set is a whole lot more convincing than a snow shovel, or a bottle rack  things he deliberately chose because he had no connection to them, aesthetically or otherwise.
             </p>
             <p>
              Be that as it may, his shots across the bow of the art establishment, on those rare occasions when he actually made art, were exactly what it wanted, and exactly what it needed. Which isironic. And so is the idea that his very mistrust of the art world ended up setting the stage for his chief artistic contribution to it, which was to understand that art was a thing dependent on
              <em>
               context
              </em>
              rather than on aesthetic choices, much less on the vagaries of taste. The ability to understand that required having a clear view of the big picture, and seeing the big picture required distance. Duchamp did distance better than anybody.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today, its very hard to resist accepting as gospel what Thierry De Duve calls the Duchamp Syllogism; that is, Duchamp is generally assumed to have said that if a urinal can be art, than anything can be art, and therefore, anyone can be an artist. Duchamp managed, in other words, to single handedly liberate art from any conceivably objective definition. That didnt happen of course. First of all, its necessary to note that Fountain wasnt really seen by anyone until Duchamps retrospective in 1963. The original object was lost not long after it was created, 46 years beforehand, and had never been shown. Secondly, Duchamp wasnt really positing artistic liberation, as De Duve further points out. He was more concerned with poking the eye of the Society Of Independent Artists. They were the group that held the show that Fountain was submitted to, a group that Duchamp was also member of. They wanted to have a juried show based on the idea that everyone who entered it would have their work accepted. This was pure hypocrisy of course, as Duchamp made perfectly clear, by submitting something that was summarily rejected. But as weve seen, his concentration on critiquing art meant that art was the context that defined him - he was never fully free of it, despite repeated attempts.
             </p>
             <p>
              While other artists in the 60s may have garbled Duchamps message that anything could be art, the fact of the matter is that the membrane that separated art from life was finally breached for good, making the Duchamp Syllogism essentially true. That this happened at all was a lesson in how misreading historical precedent is every bit as effective a driver of change than actually understanding it. What people like Beuys, Kaprow, Judd, Warhol, Matta-clark (Duchamps godson), Smithson, Rauschenberg and Cage took from Duchamp may or may not have been what he intended, but it was definitely what they
              <em>
               needed
              </em>
              . Their subsequent efforts made Duchamp one of the 20
              <sup>
               th
              </sup>
              centuries most important artists, and prompted the walls separating art from life to all come tumbling down.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today, we live in an environment that has made the idea of defining what art is, or who exactly artists are, essentially moot. There are not many people left who would say that there is a narrative structure that defines art, or a training regimen required to become an artist. (That would eliminate Duchamp by the way). So while we are generally able to agree that art is an environment free of limits, there seems to be latency in understanding what that actually means. What happens if you demand freedom and you actually get it?
             </p>
             <p>
              The first thing to realize is that expecting artists to figure it out what happens next is to miss pretty much entirely what just happened. And what just happened (really over the last century or so), was an incredible effort designed to make the word Art functionally meaningless. That in turn has meant that the people who describe themselves as artists are essentially out of a job  who exactly are artists without art, and what exactly do they do? At this point though, we are pinned on the horns of dilemma  there may be no more art as we formally understood it, but there is definitely a need to digest the experiences of our lives, and the need to share those experiences with others. We are beings who are
              <em>
               aware that we are aware
              </em>
              after all, able to contemplate the past and the future, along with the consequences of each. It turns out that the existential questions that awareness entails dont go away even as we tinker with the semantics related to describing it. Which is why, as the dust clears, we become aware that art hasnt completely disappeared; it just has gotten subsumed by something bigger  life.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1912, Guillaume Apollinaire wrote this about Duchamp:  Perhaps it will be the task of an artist as detached from aesthetic preoccupations, and as intent on the energetic as Marcel Duchamp, to reconcile art and the people. To which Duchamp himself responded later, What a joke! Forcing art and people to become friends seemed as silly to him then as it probably does to most of us now. If anything, we are more comfortable than ever with the idea that art is
              <em>
               not
              </em>
              suited for a general audience, a stance that Duchamp himself would have undoubtedly approved. In fact, within this vast new territory we find ourselves, its not surprising that a whole lot of people would prefer that the walls separating art and life were
              <em>
               still there
              </em>
              . Call it Basel Syndrome. Into this latency comes what I now think of as the Neo-New - a genre of activity that retains the words art and artist, and casts both in the familiar roles of Modernist Freedom Fighter.
             </p>
             <p>
              And yet, Appolinaires wish that art and the people reconcile in some ways sounds more prescient than goofy, mostly because thats exactly what happened. Not like people in general are suddenly endorsing contemporary art right now  they arent. Contemporary art is a niche experience at best. But they are endorsing the need to digest the experiences of their lives through visual information, the same as they have done for what increasingly looks like
              <em>
               millions
              </em>
              of years. This end run around the established art world can be seen in the rise of things like the Pop Surrealist movement, glass art, the interest in websites like Etsy, Instagram, and basically the entire Internet. Feel free to scoff at the philistines who are responsible for this stuff (art people scoff the loudest), but visual culture has moved on, with or without artists approval, much less control.
             </p>
             <p>
              That lack of control is in some ways the fulfillment of the modernist mission to morph art into life, though somehow that conclusion has the feel of an unintended consequence. The shock of what that actually looks like is probably analogous to what rich landowners felt like when they allowed everyone to vote. Modernism essentially allowed everyone to vote. Spurred on by Duchamp, and re-assessed, re-cast, and re considered by others, it knocked down every wall, hurdle, or barrier designed to limit what art could be. No limits means no edge, no edge means no more membrane separating art from life, and no more membrane means art dissipates like a puffy little cloud into a clear blue sky, falling as life-giving rain now and again when its needed. Part of a larger eco-system, rather than creating its own.
             </p>
             <p>
              Today, we could see someone like Sam Maloof, the MacArthur award winning furniture maker, being an equally important figure in this conversation, as well as someone like the carver and craftsman Wharton Esherick. Neither of them was ever concerned with art as an end point. Here is a picture of a chess set Esherick made in the thirties:
             </p>
             <p>
              <span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable">
               <span>
                <img alt="" src="/storage/Wharton Esherick Chess set.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1427387327648"/>
               </span>
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              The difference between Duchamps chess set and Eshericks of course is that the rest of Eshericks
              <em>
               house
              </em>
              looks like it, all of it designed and made by his own hand. The idea of having separate aesthetics for anything wouldnt have occurred to him. And as for Maloof, his own 22-room house, also made by him, is now a museum. The way he lived his life is every bit as important as any piece of furniture he ever made.
             </p>
             <p>
              These are people for whom life was the subject, and the artifact was art, rather than the other way around. In fact, maybe the word artifact can be thought of as describing a welcome byproduct to something, almost by accident, and 'art is just shorthand for whatever that is. For example: if one wanted to facilitate thinking, and daydreaming, and reading, and having long conversations, it might be logical to make a chair. The artifact would be the result of that original intent. A crap chair wouldnt do the job efficiently of course, so making a good one would be key. Artists wouldnt call the results
              <em>
               Art
              </em>
              (too crafty!), and neither would Sam Maloof, but what exactly is art again? And what is it supposed to do? The repercussions of deliberately eliminating art as a description of anything specific means that trying to achieve it as a goal is functionally impossible. And as the old saying goes: if you dont know where youre going, all roads lead there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe the new conversation that we have, the one that starts when we have fully digested the repercussions of no longer having an art world, involves talking about living life as a full expression of ones values, and then seeing what comes from that. This represents a fundamental flip in approach  the modernists made art, and the outcome defined their lives. The new approach sees making a life  and the outcome defines art. Seen through this lens, we might start talking about the time that Marcel Duchamp, the famous chess player, made a lovely chess set. He would be so relieved.

              Innovative, original, fresh, new, cutting edge, formative, groundbreaking, exciting, evocative, daringthese are all words Ive heard curators use to describe the kind of art theyre looking for today. But words like these also show up in ad copy for things like cars, or computer gadgets. Just like any other facet of the commercial world, which art is so very much a part of,
              <em>
               newness
              </em>
              has become a matter of course, an unspoken demand that has had the ironic effect of making newness into orthodoxy. Along the way, a million separate rebellions have somehow managed to make
              <em>
               newness
              </em>
              rhyme with
              <em>
               consensus
              </em>
              ; art fairs fill up with deer heads one year, stripe paintings the next, knitted things after that, day-glo abstract paintings after that, crystal shapes after that, and clumsy ceramics after
              <em>
               that
              </em>
              . All seem to show up by previous unspoken agreement in amazing numbers. And while its not clear that relentlessly ping ponging from one thing to the next has necessarily been good for art, it has been good for business  interest in contemporary art, as well as the prices people pay for it, continues to climb.
             </p>
             <p>
              Things might not feel brand new anymore, but they have somehow managed to feel
              <em>
               Neo-New
              </em>
              , as our search for the new thing has become the old thing. Back in the 80s, when sticking the prefix Neo on things began, (think
              <em>
               NeoGeo
              </em>
              , or
              <em>
               Neo-Expressionism
              </em>
              , or
              <em>
               NeoDada
              </em>
              ), it all seemed to point to the fact that the search for the truly new, in a modernist sense, was over. As the parade of Neos came to the fore, producing what the French baker Lionel Poilane calls Retro-Innovation, it was pretty much understood that the idea of pure originality  that is, something completely free of precedent - probably ended with the big bang.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not like that seemed to matter much at the time. I was in school then, and we were taught that art could be anything an artist wanted it to be. Which made it clear we had plenty of options. But truly digesting the reality of postmodernism had a curious outcome: If a bunch of people tell you that art can be anything for long enough, than it starts to seem like its
              <em>
               everything
              </em>
              , and then pretty quickly after that, it becomes nothing at all. Thats because if art is anything, and therefore everything, the word Art fails spectacularly to provide any kind of specific information. And rather than being a satisfying riddle that rewards deep pondering, like a Zen koan might, it stands to reason that if art can be
              <em>
               anything
              </em>
              , then it is, full stop, and we no longer need the word.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its important to note here that jettisoning one smallish word doesnt mean we are also jettisoning the importance of digesting the experiences of our lives into imagery, words, actions, or objects - far from it. What modernism began, and postmodernism finished, was in essence a discussion about definitions, and semantics. That might sound dry and academic, but it had huge real world consequences: as the borders of art were pushed outward, and then fell away, we stumbled into the search for compelling
              <em>
               lives
              </em>
              instead. As Tristan Tzara wrote in 1922 Art has not the celestial and universal value people like to attribute to it. Life is far more interesting. And in the wake of that realization, its also important to note that a clear disconnect begins to appear between the art world, which constantly trolls for the next new thing, and a whole lot of artists, who are surprised that that even matters.
             </p>
             <p>
              As we move away from asking the question is it art? to simply asking Is it awesome? we leave the confines of a place that carried on a rather specific and centuries old investigation, into one where
              <em>
               countless
              </em>
              investigations are happening at the same time. All of the new non-traditional approaches to making art, therefore, invariably intersect with something else, and usually that something else comes with a very developed history. If you are using technology in your art for example, its worth noting that NASA, (your new colleagues), have a rover on Mars right now. That Tetris exists. That there are millions of apps for your phone. That your
              <em>
               phone
              </em>
              exists. And so on. You begin to realize that its impossible not to step into something that lots of other people havent thought about, researched, tinkered with, and sweated over.
             </p>
             <p>
              But hold on! Art has to be something definable still, right? Isnt there something that it alone does especially well? Its very possible that art hasnt really gone away, but that a new definition is necessary. Say for example that art is something made by
              <em>
               artists
              </em>
              . Ive heard that definition used more than a few times. That theory, by default, ascribes special abilities to artists that non-artists dont have, sort of like a starting point guard in the NBA say, or a chess grandmaster. But if only some people can make art, and not others, then we might as well pretend that the last 150 years of art history never happened  when Marcel Duchamp said he was Anti-retinal, and that he -unlearned to draw. I had to forget with my hand, he was speaking as one of the most famous and influential artists of the 20
              <sup>
               th
              </sup>
              century. And when Joseph Beuys said that Everyone is an artist, he similarly echoed a sentiment that specialization in a field called art was a thing of the past. Tearing down the myth of the artist was talked about from the minute I got to art school, and that myth entailed certain people ciphering the cosmos in a way that other people couldnt. Artistic training by that time had long ago jettisoned teaching traditional skills and calling the results art - it was all about ideas, not objects, and it very much remains so today.
             </p>
             <p>
              One more try: art is something
              <em>
               intentional
              </em>
              . That is, if I have chickens in my back yard, and I say that they are art, that makes them art. My neighbors chickens, on the other hand, are just chickens. Intention in this definition magically conveys my chickens into the art world, where that particular context allows them to transform. Andy Warhols Brillo box is an example of this in action; a nearly exact replica of a mass-produced item, transformed into art when put into a gallery context. But whats interesting about Warhols piece is that it sees the distance between art and life as an artificial one, a distance that has, in the minds of many, summarily collapsed. Warhol, maybe more than any other artist, was able to illuminate the invisible membrane that separated the World from the Art world, and deftly point towards the door. Duchamps urinal from 1917 pokes holes in the same imagined barrier. Everything has the potential to be art these pieces say,
              <em>
               in the art world
              </em>
              , though outside of it, not so much. But pretty quickly the inside/outside dichotomy really becomes untenable: can we reasonably say that things outside that membrane are
              <em>
               not
              </em>
              art? And if theres no distinction between the two, no walled-off, specific preserve where art lives, then were back where we started from; everything essentially is art. Or, um, nothing is. And yes, Potential is different than an actual piece (rocks in a quarry arent St. Peters cathedral), but its now understood that those rocks
              <em>
               could
              </em>
              be St. Peters cathedral, and spending time convincing people that this is so is time wasted - a hundred or so years into this, we get to skip that part.
             </p>
             <p>
              By now of course, most of us accept that absolutely
              <em>
               everyone
              </em>
              , just by breathing air, has the ability to be an artist. In fact, the word ability here really becomes a meaningless distraction  every single person, by whatever means they so choose, can call whatever they do art. The only bar to entry in becoming an artist is simply to say you are one, and bam, the thing is done. Trying doing that to become an astronaut, or an air traffic controller. The slightly tragic irony of this is the fact that so many young people spend so much money on a brand name art education  The Neo-New sure loves those Yale kids and UCLA kids and Columbia kids, and Bard kids  apparently the lack of any clear definition of good has meant that the pedigree itself has become in some ways a replacement part.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, operating within an environment free of any kind of discernable limits, at least from an artists perspective, yields some pretty obvious conclusions: looking for something like the Cutting-Edge, or Originality, are pointless tasks. What is the cutting edge of the universe? Better questions by far revolve around what is meaningful, what is useful, what matters, whats good. And by lucky circumstance, artists today (that is everyone), gets to ask these questions and pursue their answers however they see fit. For my money, that puts us in an era of unprecedented potential for fantastic things to be made and written and experienced. Except that not many of us take that opportunity seriously. Instead, we remain stuck in an endless loop related to specifically pleasing a niche market  the art world. And it definitely is a niche. If the word art has exhausted itself as a way to describe anything, than what exactly does a world devoted to it mean?
             </p>
             <p>
              Other than
              <em>
               gold rush
              </em>
              , of course. Though like the actual gold rush, only a few people are getting rich in it. The art world is filled with plenty of murky attributes, but one thing is crystal clear: there is a shit-ton of money there. And those willing to spend it need some sort of direction to wend their way through its mind-boggling array of choices. Luckily, there are a whole slew of consultants, dealers, museum directors, curators and critics, and websites, all available to help. Which is why the Neo-New is primarily driven by people who are not artists  its driven by a very layered bureaucracy, interleaved within a very successful business model. Oh, artists play a role in perpetuating it course, and certainly the most visible one. But artists are really only a small part of the art world, which at this point is a vast eco-system.
             </p>
             <p>
              How powerful are these non-artists? In 2013, the magazine Art Review listed their Power 100, the annual list of the art worlds most powerful figures. And most of them are collectors. Thats because, in the art world, money makes the engine run. And if you are the person making the engine run, then that means most of the time you end up in the drivers seat as well. And by the way, congratulations Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani! In 2013 you were the number 1 most important person in contemporary art, due to the fact you spent a cool billion dollars on it Damn, girl!
             </p>
             <p>
              That is just how we do it in the West  for centuries we have tied art to money in a way that very few other cultures have done. (Though the factoid above means we are exporting that idea pretty successfully to other places). Our marriage of money and culture at least partially explains why we have been able to monetize every twist and turn artists have taken through modernism and beyond. Around the time that Jackson Pollock was written about in Life magazine, in 1949, a new kind of collector became involved, a new kind of art critic, and a new kind of art dealer, and finally a new kind of person to connect all of the dots: a curator. In 1967, a program to train them appeared at the Whitney museum in New York. But it really wasnt until the late 80s, with the appearance of a formalized degree program at the cole du Magasin in Grenoble, France, that having a degree to put on a show really seemed necessary. A few years later, (1992!) a master course in curating appeared at the Royal College of Art in London. Now of course, we cant think of a time
              <em>
               before
              </em>
              curators, with a thicket of degrees, just getting off a plane from somewhere. Or collectors doing the same. But this world we take for granted is maybe 30 years old, as is the speculative contemporary art market as we know it today. Pollock himself wouldnt recognize any of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But artists sure have adjusted! The increased emphasis artists place on talking about their practice, of mentioning their research, or hiring assistants rather than making stuff themselves like regular working stiffs, these are all nods towards the particular audience that runs the art world, an audience that is overwhelmingly academic, writerly, theory-centric, white collar, and often wealthy. Artists have naturally learned to talk like them, rather than the other way around, for the simple reason that these people are the gatekeepers to their careers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Having a whole cadre of professional art lookers (which Arthur Danto called the Curitoriat) has meant the art world is in a perpetual state of discovery. New blood is constantly required as more and more people have shows in more and more places. In the midst of this ferment is the growing realization that curating
              <em>
               itself
              </em>
              is an art form (surprise!), and the true marker of accomplishment within that sphere, the brass ring as it were, is the uncovering of actual genius in its nascent form.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its worth following the rational for this, because the unintentional blowback of finding genius in real time, noble as it might sound, ended up becoming one of the founding principals of the Neo-New. First the noble part: curators saw themselves then, (and still today), disrupting a familiar modernist fable which goes something like this - artist X does something incredibly forward thinking and brilliant, but hardly anyone gets it during artist Xs lifetime - the implicit promise of the curator is that
              <em>
               we
              </em>
              <em>
               will
              </em>
              <em>
               get it
              </em>
              (and have it explained to us) as it happens. Of course, if you plan on finding a genius you also better plan on having lots of shows, because geniuses are really rare. But lets say, after lots of high-concept, thematically tight shows involving artists from all over the world, our intrepid curator manages to uncover real talent. That segues into the not-so-noble part: implicit in this origin story is that now Artist Xs art is worth lots of money. So much like the origin stories in Silicon Valley, there is at root an entrepreneurial subtext to the Neo-New. Understanding the new thing is interesting, and getting there first is exciting, but the impetus towards doing both is intricately tangled with striking it rich.
             </p>
             <p>
              If youve read this far, you most likely have concluded that I find the Neo-New to be driven by a fast maturing bureaucracy, smoothly running a solid business model. And that description would mostly be correct but not totally. Like any good idea, the Neo-New is actually based on something with unimpeachable validity, which is that being current has value. For that reason I dont want all of this stuff to leave the impression that there is no utility in the art world itself, to which lots of talented people owe their living. But I do want to point out that being Neo-New, as opposed to new, are two different things. One has to do with a hybrid form of entertainment, via an endlessly percolating now, and the other has to do with something thats a whole lot like entertainments antonym.
             </p>
             <p>
              First though, it needs to be said that the sheer utility of being in the moment really cant be denied  doing so is in fact one of the primary tasks of art (though far from the only one). Being current might sound like a straightforward thing to do, but it is far from it; the ability to see the unadorned now requires real genius to overcome some very ingrained inhibitors towards seeing it at all. Thats because we can really only know with certainty what weve left behind. In a state such as this, a rational person would experience a permanent state of loss for what has already passed, as well as a sense of trepidation (ramping up to an unbridled terror) for events that havent happened yet. This rear-view-mirror experience of time results is a sense of cultural latency as we hurtle ever forward, accepting with difficulty the now that
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              rather than the now that
              <em>
               was
              </em>
              . For that reason, the artists that are best able to show us the present are very often taking an unsuspecting audience beyond what they know, into places that they dont. Ironically, that place is directly where they are standing.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not really a news flash then that someone who accurately depicts the now, would struggle to find a sympathetic audience. Lets look at one artist who was an excellent example of someone who saw the present with astounding accuracy, and got almost no love from his fellows, artist or otherwise. And that artist is Eduard Manet. In the image below he paints a very unusual picture of a mother and child, in the streets of Paris. The background is dominated by a cast iron fence, which in fact looks like a jail cell, from which the child looks out as if she is trying to escape. By posing the child in this way, Manet denies us a view of her (probably) adorable face, the bread and butter of the mother and child portrait genre. Instead of looking at us, the child is gazing at the marvel of that era, the train. Except that this particular train isnt really much more than a smudge of smoke, which the child just might choke on. The mother herself looks exhausted, distracted. She appears unaware of her child. Finally, its worth noting the way the paint is handled- flat colors, low contrast seems informed by photography as much if not more than the standard painterly techniques employed at the time.

             <p>
              Manet depicts the dawn of the industrial age with a postmodern touch  borrowed sources (photography, art history), a sly reference to other work (the model is the same one he used in Olympia, a painting of a prostitute. In this one, she is a frumpy mother). Finally, he clearly is ambivalent about progress, choosing not to make something heroic out of his depiction of modern living.
             </p>
             <p>
              Manet did not want to be original- he just wanted to impress the painters in the French Academy, from whom he desperately wanted acceptance. But his observations about the way the world was, and his uncanny ability to capture it accurately ironically kept that prize from him. In our modernist daydream, we would like to believe that artists are all brave trailblazers, able grasp the importance of Manets vision quickly. But that assumption would be wrong. His vision of the world was jarring, less than beautiful,
              <em>
               not entertaining
              </em>
              . Its no surprise that his ultimate goal  to be a member of the Academy- was denied him. By the time Manet died, at the age of 51, (of syphilis, natch) he was unsure about his success as an artist.

              Of course, Manet ultimately did find success, though he was dead and gone by the time it happened. Its largely in response to this kind of story, that today there is an incredibly large and sophisticated industry devoted to finding our
              <em>
               current
              </em>
              Manets, a vast academy bigger than anything thats come before it. Pretty much all of the members of this academy see their jobs first and foremost as championing the new  a very modernist endeavor in a postmodern world. But championing the new is a whole lot different than championing the good, much less the meaningful. Conflating that which is new with that which is culturally relevant is not exactly connecting two dots by their shortest distance  its a leap of faith. Especially in an era where artists realize that thats exactly what curators are looking for, and are more than willing to give them what they want. Meanwhile, there has been latency in squaring to the fact that there really
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              no new, and that novelty in the arts, whenever it happens, may or may not be that significant.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bear in mind- Manet was significant not because he made unusual art. He was significant because his unusual art underscored similar changes in the culture. Cultural changes happen for a myriad of reasons of course, and understanding why they come about can take decades or even centuries to unravel. In the meantime it should be understood that artist are never the authors of those changes - ascribing them that power is like ascribing a bend in a river to a single stone  yet the important roll they play in identifying them cant be overstated. Modernism, or Postmodernism, are very large abstract terms used after the fact to describe paradigms that span entire cultures. Artists are able to be very specific about what those terms actually mean by showing them. In order to do that accurately means connecting to that culture  not separating from it. But thats exactly what creating a World called Art has done.

              Other academies in other times have gotten things wrong as well of course. The French version, despite its members wisdom and experience, failed to grasp important changes in their own culture. Our own version of the Academy, far larger and far more credentialed, has had a similarly spotty record. And on this point we only waste time fooling ourselves that this isnt so; The French Salon, despite its demonstrable myopia, frequently attracted more than 20,000 people a day, for much of the 19
              <sup>
               th
              </sup>
              century. Today, a truly epic blockbuster attracts about 6,000, and there are very few of those. Visual art intersecting with the public consciousness today at all is usually in a spirit of abuse, or of sheer financial incredulity (He paid how much for a shark?); a curiosity far from real life. This is in opposition to what Duchamp saw, or Warhol, or Matta-Clark, where the distance between art and life had collapsed. The Neo-New has made it a field for specialists instead, exclusive, and even intimidating to those outside it.
             </p>
             <p>
              And it hasnt been an accident. An important aspect of the Neo-New is that a general audience
              <em>
               isnt
              </em>
              the goal anymore. Make it tough, dont sell out, dont pander, these were all-important criteria when I was in school. Broad acceptance was a sign of failure, not success. It never occurred to us that what we were actually doing was learning to make things for a particular audience, with very specific parameters. In fact the idea of a general audience for anything seems antiquated; like the Burning Man festival say, or a Star Trek convention, the goal now is to attract a core group of highly motivated, highly informed people who together create a culture. Think of Harley riders going to Sturgis North Dakota, or world leaders going to Davos Switzerland, or Insane Clown Posse fans at the Juggalo festival in Michigan. Brand identification, and loyalty to that brand, is far more important than sheer numbers, and often times emphasizing the marginalized status of a smaller group can make brand identification that much easier. We no longer live in a homogenized world, where people look all the same, or believe in the same things, so it stands to reason that we would find other ways to create a tribal identity, and through it, a shared culture.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Basel fairs, the Biennials, Documenta, these are all the art worlds version of their own tribal gathering spots. Along the way, the maturation of the art world into a series of high-end bazaars spanning the globe, has cemented the notion of art being
              <em>
               the
              </em>
              luxury brand for the rich. Not that this is a completely new concept of course  the Medicis and the Hapsburgs would recognize it as such and undoubtedly approve. But there are a couple of glaring differences that separate today from back then. The first is that the basis for what collectors and curators are looking for is still rooted in a modernist version of originality, and disruption. Thats actually been great for business, because by endlessly promoting the Neo-New, we are effectively selling a luxury brand based on the idea of freedom, and rebellion, which has a track record of working really well. Rock music tried something similar in the 50s and rap music did as well in the 90s. Seeing that methodology recycled once again at an art fair, where freedom and rebellion are once again for sale, is to experience the pure screech of cognitive dissonance. Institutions rush to support it, awards are given to those we think embody it. Freedom and rebellion become a pretty solid career move. So the question really becomes inevitable: If rebellion has this kind of broad institutional and monetary approval, how free and rebellious can it be?
             </p>
             <p>
              Being able to buy a contact dose of freedom is now very much embedded into the contemporary art brand. The convergence of an anything-goes aesthetic, courtesy of postmodernism, and now the Neo-New, coupled with the creation of lots of really rich people globally, has made a very vibrant market possible. But the niche that art now inhabits really illuminates the second key difference between now and other, pre-modernist eras. Art is no longer public, but private. Its no longer commissioned, but speculative. Its no longer shared, but personal. As Ross King says in his book The Judgment Of Paris, In nineteenth-century France, murals were still what they had been during the Italian Renaissance, the most exalted form of painting. And he goes on to quotes Ingres, saying Its the decoration of churches, of public palaces, of halls of justice, that art must dedicate itself to. Artists from Michelangelo to Gericault were essentially public artists, with a sideline in easel painting. That has almost completely flipped around now, with many artists never doing public commissions at all. Artists werent selling freedom as much as they were selling a communal voice.
             </p>
             <p>
              The communal voice that is being sold today is really for the art world, and pretty much the art world alone. And as Im trying to make clear, there is a certain understandable rational for that. If one goes to an art fair today, its hard not to notice that all of those people wandering around have certain similarities in common, a subtle consensus in terms of dress, and behavior. The tribal association extends beyond just to the art, to include
              <em>
               each other
              </em>
              . It stands to reason then that this art fair tribe would share a frame of reference, an aesthetic, and even a lexicon, which over time becomes like a regional accent. (Try explaining what a Gallerist is to a civilian, or how Basel is a place in Florida). The same could be said about people at a football game, or a NASCAR race; the tribal gathering aspect in some ways trumps the event itself. Of course, right on the heels of that realization comes the crushing sense of a world
              <em>
               reduced
              </em>
              , made simpler, safer, and more predictable, rather than what it actually is: big, scary, and complex. Filled with people who may not agree with you. Like I said, its understandable why people do this.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the case of the art world though, shrinking the world comes with a heaping dose of irony. If showing the unadorned now is one of the main jobs for art, then facing big scary and complex things should be embraced, whereas a World for Art talking to Itself can, and does, become solipsistic pretty quickly. A whole bunch of artists can, (and do), make art about art, or even just the art world itself, and have perfectly viable careers. Meanwhile, its difficult for me to discount different eras and cultures that saw artists as integral to civic architecture, to the public square, to church on Sunday (or Saturday, depending on the faith). In other words, art was an inescapable presence in peoples lives.

              Today, the only thing that comes close to accepting the idea of a general audience is probably television. The idea of a general audience for
              <em>
               anything
              </em>
              now seems foreign to most of us, and even slightly suspicious. And while it is true that most of us would rather be spectators than doers anyway - which is why the movies and television are the 20
              <sup>
               th
              </sup>
              centurys most important artistic innovation  a select few t.v. shows manage to ask something of us, to challenge us without losing the that inclusive starting point.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its a tough assignment to be gracious and inviting on the one hand, and challenging on the other. And most t.v. shows dont do it of course. Its far easier (and more profitable), to allow us watchers to sit in the dark, slack jawed, while shit blows up. But meaning and engagement happen only when its not just the artists that are exercising their creativity, but the
              <em>
               art-lookers
              </em>
              as well. Its the basis for realizing that a story isnt just the words that are written on a page, but a whole lot of other things that those words imply. Its understanding that seeing a Manet painting, a few square feet of canvas, requires us to consider the whole
              <em>
               world
              </em>
              based on seeing this tiny bit of it. Doing that work makes art (whatever the hell that might be) come alive  not doing the work, or not being asked to, means that we are simply distracted for a moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Neo-New can be, and quite often is, a distraction. If art can be anything, and can be anywhere, then finding it beyond the borders of the reservation it has been put on seems not only logical, but necessary. Which is not to say that a contemporary art fair excludes things of meaning  meaning is everywhere, including there. Its also not to say that everything in the art world is Neo-New  that phenomenon is culture wide, and illustrating it via the art world doesnt mean that it alone is guilty. But the Neo-New shines in stark relief there. Thats because, as a place supposedly devoted to ideas and meaning, the art world demonstrates better than anywhere the barriers we put in place to make those things harder to find.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason Im an artist is not because of all of the galleries I went to as a kid, or because of all the contemporary art I saw. There was no contemporary art where I lived, much less anyone who looked at it. The reason Im an artist is due pretty much entirely to looking at things that had no aspirations towards even
              <em>
               being
              </em>
              art: comic books, airplanes, models, bridges, trees, architecture, tools, clouds, the national geographic. I made forts in the woods, I built things, I dug snow caves. I read lots of books. Channeling that wonder into a set of possibilities (some might call it playing) is really the job of childhood. The job of adulthood is to assemble those parts, and anything else one can find along the way, into a meaningful life. Some, but not all, of the artifacts related to fulfilling that task might fit comfortably inside an art fair. But probably not many. Meanwhile, the Neo-New rolls on. Innovative, original, fresh, new, cutting edge, formative, groundbreaking, exciting, evocative, daring repeat.

               I make things  out of many different materials, which doesnt make me particularly  unusual. What does make me unusual is that I have chosen to carve some  of them, a method that virtually none of my contemporary colleagues seem  to share. The result is that I am asked to explain the carving aspect  of my work more often than almost anything else. And the funny thing is  that the more Im asked about it, the lousier I am at coming up with an  answer. Not that I havent thought about it. Quite the opposite. It  turns out that Ive thought on it so much that the answer just keeps  getting longer and more complicated, so long and unwieldy at this point  that my answer goes mostly unsaid.
              </span>

              <span style="color: black;">
               I could try  sound bites of course. Mention that I think better with my hands in  motion. Or that the serendipity of responding to the material in real  time allows me to follow the work rather than lead it to a predetermined  conclusion. Both of these responses are part of the answer anyway, and  both are true enough. But thats not the whole answer. Mostly because  thats not the whole question. Why do you carve? has an invariable  follow-up: How can carving be conceptual when everyone knows that  object making is about craft? And then: What is contemporary about  this?" and then: Couldnt you just find fabricators? And Isnt there a  machine that does that? And so on. The complexity of this  ever-metastasizing question seems to require an equally complex answer.  Its not made any easier by the fact that what I have to say about it  challenges many assumptions that lots of smart people still have about  the way art should look, how it should be made, and what it should do.

               Still, the  question deserves a response. What follows is the reason, or more  accurately, the reasons, that I carve. The whole answer, length be  damned. So I hope you are in a comfortable chair.

               Before art,  there was carving. For twenty-five millennia at the very least, we have  practiced it in every corner of the globe, in virtually every culture.  The best of it seems to make the impossible not only possible, but  credible, a previously unimagined reality sharing space in a room with  us. Carving is to 2-D art like live theater is to CGI effects in movies:  the real thing versus pleasant illusion. How can one really explain  Berninis carving of Daphne turning into a tree for example? Antonio  Corradinis veiled girl? The wooden flowers of Grinling Gibbons? The  floating angels of Tilman Riemenschneider?
              </span>

             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="color: black;">
               In short,  carving seemed badass, and I wanted to learn how to do it. I had my  suspicions that it would be difficult, sure, but how hard could it be? I  realize now that my high level of confidence can be explained in two  short words (young, dumb), and that what was actually involved in  learning such a thing had completely escaped me. Undaunted (the  remarkably powerful byproduct of being young and dumb), I slowly  progressed anyway due to my own sheer bumbling effort. I remember  telling myself that it would start out hard, and get easier as I  improved. It never did. And so today my bumbling continues, marginally  more efficiently, making me the slightly tragic embodiment of the bumper  sticker that says I may be lost, but Im making good time! To  everyone who has ever asked me what my tricks or shortcuts are, I have a  most unsatisfying reply: There are none. Carving is hard. Thats all.

             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="color: black;">
               Another thing  my young self hadnt counted on is that expending all that effort might  have been pointless anyway. There was (and is) a good dose of  ambivalence about carving in the art world, which meant thatassuming I  learned to carve at allwho would care? Ask any Native American carver,  Eskimo carver, African carver, chainsaw carver. As a group, they are  almost invisible in a contemporary gallery context.

             <p>
              <span style="color: black;">
               To most people,  carving seems retrograde historically, it intersects with craft, with  skill, with brute labor, all with a whiff of romanticism attached. I  certainly didnt get a lot of encouragement to pursue it in school, and  apparently nobody else did either. I can count about three carvers  working in a western tradition that are of any note in the vast sea of  contemporary artists today. But being so fantastically wrong about how  long this was going to take to learn, as well as how it would be  received by my peers, has not managed to sway me away from my choice. If  anything I find myself more committed to it now than ever before.  Thats because the more I carved, the more I began to notice certain  traits inherent in the medium that had a depth, and even a subversive  quality that kept me interested in it. I started to catalog them. And  after a while I got to six.

               I know, I know,  six might not seem like a lot, and maybe it isnt, but my list doesnt  pretend to be scholarly, or even comprehensive. I might find more soon.  These are merely the things that have intersected with my thinking and  deepened and informed my work, both the carving and the non-carving part  of it, and have made me more of a fan of it than I was in the  beginning.

               Still,  explaining these six things turns out to be a more complicated affair  then it might appear at first. The six things started off kind of simple  and then built on each other until they became not very simple at all.

              <span style="color: red;">
               carving  is solidly thought of as a genre of fine art, but it seems to stretch  the boundaries of what a genre is in the first place.

               The second thing is equally simple.
              </span>
              <span style="color: red;">
               Whether  or not it is intended to be in a gallery or a museum, and whether or  not it actually resides in one of those receptacles of culture, it  always seems to maintain its status as sculpture.

               the  momentous year of 1964. It was then, as crazy as it sounds, that the  Art World was invented. Before then it didnt exist. Sure Art  existed, and lots of it, but the idea that a World was necessary to  contextualize Art was new. So totally does the Art World subsume us  now that the idea of somebody inventing the term has an air of  implausibility around it, like fish finally identifying water, or birds  first noticing air. But somebody did invent it, and it should comes as  absolutely no surprise that it took somebody outside of the art worlds  all-encompassing confines to do it.

              <span style="color: black;">
               That person was  a philosopher named Arthur Danto, who coined the term in a lucid essay  simply called The Artworld, published in the
               <em>
                Journal of Philosophy
               </em>
               in October of that year.
               <a href="http://danwebb.squarespace.com/display/admin/CreateOrModifyJournalEntry?moduleId=18127690&amp;entryId=17293854&amp;SSScrollPosition=27342#_edn1">

               That he was moved to write this essay was because his painter wife just  so happened to take him to see a show of very unusual objects by an  artist named Andy Warhol. And by Unusual, what I mean is that their very  Usualness made them so Unusual as to become something extraordinary.  What he saw of course were a series of extremely faithful reproductions  of everyday objects, and Danto got snagged into trying to figure out why  these near-replicas of Brillo boxes and such were art, while their  doppelgangers in the grocery store were not. He was a clever enough guy  to realize that there had to be a theory tied to this work that  connected it to some larger conversation. He was also clever enough to  know that the theory was probably modernism. He knew this from his study  of Descartes, who with his famous dictum I think, therefore I am,  started a conversation about how we view the world not according to any  kind of bedrock truth but through the filter of our thoughts and  perceptions of it. This shifted a very long philosophical conversation  away from gathering objective information about the world and toward a  conversation about how we know what we know in the first place.
              </span>
             </p>

             <p>
              <span style="color: black;">
               Artists had  followed a very similar path, spurred on by technological advances such  as photography, which challenged profoundly the goal of pure  verisimilitude in painting and sculpture. Suddenly mimesis was  redundant, and artists found themselves instead asking questions about  the nature of representation itself. Artist began to create and debate  representations of representations, which meant that art had chiefly  become its own subject. Danto (still standing in front of the Brillo  box) further surmised that this new discussion of art talking about  itself had moved at such a rapid and complex pace as to leave the  general populace pretty much completely out of the picture (no pun  intended), and there too he was correct. Artists had sprouted Ism after  Ism, completely outstripping the understanding, or even acceptance of  most people. For an artist to make work that added on to and expanded  that conversation required an increasingly specialized audience and an  infrastructure that could receive it. In short, it required an Art  World.
              </span>
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="color: black;">
               Danto was on  fire. And he wasnt done. His final insight was to realize that he was  staring at the end of the conversation. The Brillo box had collapsed the  distance between representation of a thing and the thing itself. This  one simple object had made the space between art and reality essentially  nothing, thus proving that artists had total freedom to do or make  anything of their choosing. In Dantos opinion, that made the Brillo Box  the final definitive act of modernist art.

             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="color: black;">
               Its worth  taking a little time to follow Dantos line of thought here and clarify  why a simulacra of a Brillo box had such power, so I will briefly quote  him: Conceptual art demonstrated that there need not even be a palpable  visual object for something to be a work of visual art. That meant that  you could no longer teach the meaning of art by example. It meant that  as far as appearances were concerned, anything could be a work of art,  and it meant that if you were going to find out what art was, you had to  turn from sense experience to thought. You had, in brief, to turn to  philosophy.

               Post  historical. Most people are more comfortable with the term postmodern  perhaps, but whatever you call it, the Art World has changed drastically  from the time of modernism. Now I realize that its debatable whether a  singular work by Andy Warhol is the thing that brought us to this  point. Perhaps it was Duchamps ready-mades created in the late teens,  or maybe it was Mike Bidlos paintings, or Sherrie Levines photographs  created in the mid 1980s, or a long list of other potential candidates  in between. What is not debatable is that the thing was done, and today  we find ourselves in an era where we all agree that the barriers to what  is acceptable within the confines of the Art World have been  systematically erased. Joseph Beuys declared that everyone is an artist.  (Danto points out that Beuys didnt say that everyone
               <em>
                could
               </em>
               be an artist, everyone
               <em>
                is
               </em>
               .)  Modernist artists determined that anything could be art. The borders  between art and life became blurry, and then disappeared. And a place  without borders is a very interesting place to be indeed.

              <span style="color: black;">
               It turns out  that you can erase a narrative, but what cant be fully erased is the  need to have a narrative in the first place. In the midst of a very  fractured and fundamentally directionless endeavor, art had to find some  semblance of order in all of the art that people were producing (which  continues to come at us like a runaway train), and the way that was  found to do that was to simply decide which was the most Contemporary.  The problem with that is that if the goal is to make the most  Contemporary art possible, and if Contemporary defines Right Now, than  it must be understood that Right Now disappears in an instant. In a  state such as this, conflating art with stylistic invention is not only  possible, but inevitable. Stylistic invention can be described in many  ways (fashions, fads, trends), but art is quite reasonably defined in  opposition to that. Its News that stays news, to quote Ezra Pound,  and as much as an artwork might owe to its particular moment, it cant  be anchored to it. Indeed it must translate to beyond it in order to  succeed. In order to translate, it must draw on other things that have  also succeeded, a progression forward using templates from the past,  with what the mathematician and architect Christopher Alexander calls A  pattern language, because nothing is made in a vacuum. The unique  human ability to see the past as well as the future means that we not  only draw on history to inform us of the present, but that we also are  allowed to dream up things that havent happened yet. Thats what makes  good art strange and familiar at the same time.

               issues of craft and tradition versus stylistic invention are inevitably  raised. Carving in particular, which has been so universally practiced,  and for so long, negates any discussion about style or originality. It  has none. It must invariably be seen through the lens of familiar  carvings from the past, some of which might have been in a gallery or  museum context and some not, putting it well outside the realm of  Contemporary ideals. Which leads me, finally, to
              </span>
              <span style="color: red;">
               the fourth thing that carving does, which is to

              <span style="color: black;">
              </span>
              <span style="color: red;">
               leapfrog over a discussion about style by accepting carving, and therefore

              </span>
              <span style="color: red;">
               art, as an expression of a tradition.

                revolution
               </em>
               because there is nothing left to overthrow. The use of tradition really  becomes the ultimate form of sampling in a postmodern sense. It uses  the heretical notion (also employed by the progenitors of the  Renaissance), that its okay to look backward to see a clear way  forward, which, to the Curitoriat, trained to look for Right Now, is a  very difficult proposition to swallow. As Nabokov said, The future is  obsolescence in reverse.

              <span style="color: black;">
               This segues into the fifth thing pretty easily, which is that
              </span>
              <span style="color: red;">
               carving,  as an obvious outsider to contemporary practice, seems to remind us  that the parameters of how we judge art today remain attuned to  modernism.
              </span>
              <span style="color: black;">
               That this is so seems somewhat surprising given the fact modernism has  been dead for so long, fifty years at least. There is no question that  our current era is far more easily described as postmodern rather than  modern, but there is also no question that there has been a return to  modernist aesthetics in art and architecture, and even literature, in  the last ten years or so. Or maybe more accurately, a certain thread of  it never went away, and that thread is gathering steam due to a mixture  of familiarity and nostalgia. That this interest exists I think is due  in no small part to a weariness induced by postmodernisms relativism  and murky uncertainty. The academic Barbara Epstein describes quite well  the cautionary tale that is postmodernism, and the desire to have  something else to hold onto when she says: It is difficult to debate  postmodernism because it is not a set of claims. It is a set of  attitudes, the central one being the suspicion of all claimsand the  concomitant effort never to make any claims, or at least, never to  acknowledge them.
               <a href="http://danwebb.squarespace.com/display/admin/CreateOrModifyJournalEntry?moduleId=18127690&amp;entryId=17293854&amp;SSScrollPosition=27342#_edn5">

               In comparison, the appeal of modernisms pure ocular pleasure and  unshakable moral and intellectual clarity seems quite understandable.  Even the goals are more understandable; art must innovate, it must  transgress, it must have stylistic originality. All of these ideas are  modernist inventions of course, and didnt exist in the same way before  or after the modernist era. But we happily and unquestioningly endorse  them all. And so today it seems that most of us would still rather be  Picasso (lothario, stylistic innovator, badass), than Robert  Rauschenberg (collage guy).

               As the historians Best and Kellner make clear in their excellent book
               <em>
                The Postmodern Turn
               </em>
               ,  postmodernism is not a monolithic idea that everyone all over the world  subscribes to. We live with modern, and even premodern ideas that  mingle with the postmodern. If we can pick and choose through everything  that has ever happened, then it stands to reason that we would at least  try to use a modernist yardstick to assess artistic practice, because  modernism
               <em>
                had
               </em>
               a yardstick. But we do ourselves a disservice when  we fail to recognize that we are measuring is no longer modern, even if  many of our approaches to making art remain rooted there. Carving seems  to defuse any kind of stock modernist critique (Is it original? Does it  transgress? Is it on the cutting edge?) by making the point that all  those criteria have either been undermined or eliminated in a postmodern  world. Everything is fair game if anything can be considered art.  Furthermore, if its true that art talking about art has exhausted  itself, and that such a conversation existed only within a context  called the Art World, then today it stands to reason that moving forward  requires artists to step outside that world and change the subject.  Carving seems to take that position seriously by doing both.

              <span style="color: black;">
               In our era,  painting, carving, weaving, all of these traditional forms, are as valid  a choice for artists to pursue as any other, because there are no  invalid ones. In fact, the more traditional they are, the more they seem  to make the point that this is so. Conceptual art, social practice,  performance art, technology based art, or any other iteration that  downplays making an object are
               <em>
                also
               </em>
               stylistic choices, as much as  curators and critics of our day would like to see them as orthodoxy.  They are newer, and more fashionable perhaps, but there is no longer one  way that art looks or acts. The narrative about what defines art is  over.

              <span style="color: black;">
               Postmodernism  introduced the idea that not only are all things valid, but that no one  thing is more valid than anything else. The question that is raised  almost by default in a state such as this is simple: If everything is  indeed valid, then what actually matters? We live in a world described  quite eloquently and convincingly by Baudrillard, Debord, and others, as  a simulacra, removed from anything real. Art making has become  pastiche, full of pop culture references, full of irony, full of  cleverness as opposed to intelligence. As Baudrillard said, Generally  speaking, the play on quotations is boring for me. The infinite nesting  of box within box, the play of second and third degree quotes, I think  that is a pathological form of the end of art, a sentimental form.
               <a href="http://danwebb.squarespace.com/display/admin/CreateOrModifyJournalEntry?moduleId=18127690&amp;entryId=17293854&amp;SSScrollPosition=27342#_edn6">

              The  basic premise is that everything has already been done, and we are just  sampling this and that and putting them back together in an endless  series of mash-ups. Where contemporary theorists and artists see this  state of things as cultural exhaustion, and therefore a problem, a  carver realizes that there is
              <em>
               no such thing
              </em>
              as working without a  tradition, because everything has a history, a provenance, and it is a  relief. As noted above, revolution was the preeminent modernist  endeavor, while evolution is the postmodern one. To see postmodernism as  an endless play of mash-ups and pastiche is to lose sight of how this  process is itself traditional. Building upon what has come before
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              the building blocks of art, while originality (as a means of defining  the limits of art itself) is merely the building blocks of modernism. In  this sense, the angst that Baudrillard, Debord, and others felt was the  result of expecting modernist goals to be met in a postmodern world.  The disappointment that resulted is understandable, but preordained.  Holding on to the idea of paradigm shifting disruption is not especially  tenable for a postmodernist, not just because its unlikely, but also  because its not even that useful. Arts long foray into self-definition  and reflection is over.

             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              Modernists wanted to define the outer limits of what art could be, but postmodernists realize that there
              <em>
               are
              </em>
              no limits. It is an amazing mis-read of our moment to storm the  battlements as an artist when there are no battlements left, no hurdles  to clear, no walls to breach. What we have before us is a far more  interesting assignment than that however: reaccessing agency, redefining  effectiveness, rediscovering relevance.

              <span style="color: red;">
               This leads to the  final thing that carving does (at least, until I notice another one),  which is to demonstrate the machinations of agency itself.
              </span>
              <span style="color: black;">
               We think of art as something powerless, maybe even useless. But what  kind of nihilist nutcase would spend their lives pursuing something  devoid of use, and, maybe even more confounding, why would anyone care?  The question raised above about what matters forms the backdrop to what  many artists are grappling with right now. Certainly they arent  grappling with technical issues, or trying to redefine art. The  modernists did us the favor of tabling that discussion. Now that we know  what art is (anything an artist says it is), we get to ask what art can
               <em>
                do
               </em>
               in a way that no other era has been able to. The angst of self-definition has fallen away.

               Carving engages  these very basic concerns about agency because agency permeates it; how  can we manipulate a material that will strongly resist such  manipulation? Offshoots of the various answers we have come up with have  become architecture, furniture, weaponry, art. As we drift away from a  tangible relationship to the world around us, its useful to remember  how long-standing that connection has been, and how it continues to be  necessary.

              <span style="color: black;">
               Its an  exciting time to be an artist. Responding to the world, rather than the  Art World, seems expansive and freeing, and for my money the six traits  Ive described above about carving make it an excellent vehicle for  doing so. Changing the subject, and critiquing the conversation that got  us here, is accomplished by carving with remarkable directness.
              </span>
              The more I do it, the more convinced of that I become.
              <span style="color: black;">
               Some  might say that in times such as these, some grand gesture is needed  perhaps, something quick and theatrical, not something slow and plodding  like carving. But there is something that a carving does by  demonstrating competence at an understandable level that seems exactly  right, the opposite of theater in a world built on artifice. Its not  the shattered view of modernism, with its puffed-up intellectual and  moral superiority, or the wry ambivalence of postmodernism, with its  ability to make all choices and its inability to say which ones are  good. Its a response, created with effort and skill, with a kind of  credulity that seems like the antidote to all that.

               The great  furniture maker George Nakashima faced his own version of a dystopian  world most profoundly when he was interned by his own government during  World War II. His response to this indefensible indignity was not what  one might expect, but was equal parts grace and pragmatism nonetheless.  He learned to be a wood worker. At that time, he had been all over the  world, living in Paris, Japan, and India. He had thought that he wanted  to be an artist, but Paris in the 20s had disabused him of that notion.  He said then, It was time to move on, and I would leave the whole  modern art movement with its egotism and lack of beauty

               In the camps he  met a Japanese carpenter, who taught him skills in a traditional way.  He describes this man simply, but powerfully: He had the discipline  resulting from long years of experience in which each step was learned  with consummate perfection (p. 23). Nakashima himself learned those  skills, and with them he connected himself to wood, to trees, to the  landscape, and to the beauty of the world. In so doing, he triumphed  over the ugliness that had put him there in the first place.

               I will never be  George Nakashima, but I too want to learn each step with consummate  perfection, and I too want to find a way of making something beautiful.  The steps I have taken so far are few, with a babys wobbling  determination, but I will keep going, egged onward by the firmly footed  examples of those that came before me.

              Like probably every artist out there, my intention is simply to make the stuff that I would most like to see. For me that means making objects most of the time, because making objects strikes me as badass. Furthermore, it means carving a lot of those objects, because carving strikes me as being
              <em>
               extra
              </em>
              badass.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that really about does it for any kind of artist statement. This is where I scroll down to
              <em>
               Save File As
              </em>
               and get up to do other things. Except I cant quite. My own impulse to make work seems clear enough, but talking about it always makes me wonder:
              <em>
               Where are the other carvers?
              </em>
              Try counting up carvers in a contemporary context- after about five it gets tough. Heroic googling will get you to around ten. This, despite the fact that there are an incredible amount of artists out there, making an incredible amount of stuff. It was never my intention to get out of the way of pretty much everything else happening in the art world, but the practical result of being a carver does exactly that. So it was with a mixture of curiosity, and trepidation, that I began asking myself more specifically why I have made the choices that I have made. And why (maybe), other people havent. Which leads me to what follows below, the addendum, the footnote, the epilogue, or something or other.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before I go further I should probably define my terms here. Carving itself is very much a living thing, in almost every cultural tradition, except for the one that I primarily draw from. That would be the one that started in Greece thousands of years ago, and came to define Western civilization. To be sure, no form of carving is especially well represented in the contemporary art world, (sorry Native American carvers, Asian carvers, African carvers, chainsaw carvers, Aboriginal carvers, Eskimo carvers, etc. you are all awesome) but the style that Im talking about, the one that included practitioners like Praxiteles, Michelangelo, Riemenshneider, and others in an unbroken chain that lasted for centuries, is especially and conspicuously dead. It died, swiftly and totally, at the end of the Beaux Arts movement. How swift, and how total? Look at the tops of the four columns at the entrance to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Raw blocks of stone lay in piles atop the carved columns. The four carvings that Robert Morris Hunt had intended Karl Bitters to do sit unfinished- he was run over by a car and killed in 1915. No one was found to replace him, and to this day the stone remains untouched.

              The Beaux-Arts movement limped on from there, alive but slowly losing steam. The Lincoln Memorial was built in 1922, Riverside church was dedicated in 1930, and Mount Rushmore in 1941. But in 1945, the Piccarelli brothers, carvers of not only Lincolns Memorial, (from 28 pieces of white Georgia marble, weighing 159 tons), as well as the lions in front of the New York Public Library, the frieze on the New York Stock Exchange, the figures on the arch in Union square, quietly closed their doors for good. Really at that point, it was all over.
             </p>
             <p>
              That didnt exactly kill off sculpture, much less art in general. In fact the rise of the modernist era cranked up virtually every other artistic activity imaginable. The art world today is inclusive of everything, everywhere, all at once, a profusion of art coming at us from every corner of the globe. How curious then that there are a few traits that link so many of these disparate activities together- that in an incredible defiance of the odds and the numbers, most artists have signed on to just a few starting points for their work that are nearly universal. How curious also that carving in one way or another undermines or even defies them.
             </p>
             <p>
              How exactly does all the art of today relate to each other? The first link is that it is overwhelmingly conceptually based. That is, driven by ideas, over any particular medium or method. This point logically leads to the next; if a medium or method is not really primary to an art object, then most artists will understandably reject the idea of becoming technically proficient in any one of them. In other words- an art object (or experience) should be just facile enough to get the idea across, and no more. It should never ever be confused with craft.

              The description above has become the default way to think of contemporary art, essentially moving past fetishizing mute handsome objects. Meanwhile, the modernist creed to Make It New envelops us totally, so totally that rarely do we notice that it is, well, old. For a century at least, we have been acclimated to look for, and indeed are most comfortable with, art that raise doubts about whether or not it even
              <em>
               is
              </em>
              art. Along the way a particular philosophical framework- that the idea comes first, and the hand is removed- has become the foundation of a new tradition. Conversely, artists making things at a high level of tactile mastery (minus the army of fabricators), and following the work in a way that is unconcerned with self-expression or even particular ideas, represents an older one. But no matter how you slice it, in the postmodern world it has become impossible for artists today to work
              <em>
               without
              </em>
              a tradition.

              Most of what I see in galleries and museums exhibits a nod towards both an idea, and a studied lack of craft, as well as a third trait Ill get to in a minute. So much so that now the overwhelming majority of things I see have come to define what I would call Traditional Contemporary Art. In this definition, people like Elliot Hundley, or Rachel Harrison, or Urs Fisher, or Harrell Fletcher, or Jeff Koons are really representing the norm, rather than the fringe. A quick peek at their long resumes, blue chip gallery affiliations, and high auction prices will attest to that. Furthermore, they and many artists like them, are doing their particular gig so well that any desire I might have to try add to that genre is pointless. Kudos to them! I love a lot of that work. But Im interested in making the things Im
              <em>
               not
              </em>
              seeing, not adding to the things I am. And Im seeing an awful lot of what they are doing.

              Despite the above description, its a highly ironic fact that the definition of orthodoxy within the art world still stubbornly sticks to something like carving. But the reality is that carved things havent come close to being in the mainstream of contemporary art for at least a century, especially if they are technically proficient. The definition of orthodoxy has flipped.

              In the meantime, tradition has become inescapable. Finding a creative act that is without precedent is not only impossible, but searching for it in the first place seems retrograde, a modernist task in a postmodern world. Congratulations and all that in the unlikely event that you find it, (a creative act without precedent), but its not like its the main task of art to look for it anymore. Art has no main task. Precedent for everything means Tradition is something that is impossible to operate apart from. And thats good. But Tradition is used as a pejorative in the contemporary art world so often that its easy to lose sight of the fact that it simply refers to something that is readable in a communal way. In order for traditions to have any meaning at all, they must rely on the context of community. In fact, traditions are one of the ways communities show their contextual boundaries; they are a display of the very binds that tie them together.
             </p>
             <p>
              The opposite of tradition is Freedom, which is the unraveling of those communal bonds in order to gain autonomy. Taken to its logical conclusion, there is a relationship between freedom and alienation, due to the fact that fully unraveling those bonds means being unreadable by anyone at all. Being totally bound is no more preferable than being totally free of course, so it would seem logical to chart a course that moves in a nuanced way between both poles. Which is why art at its best it seems to be both strange and strangely familiar, allowing for discovery, and connection simultaneously. The ability for art to operate in this way might at first seem like a paradox, but only if one discounts the fact that new things come out of old things rearranged and reconfigured. This is why traditions are therefore alive: they reflect their moment, while acknowledging the steps taken to get there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Acknowledging tradition is to acknowledge that for many centuries, people made things with a high level of skill. Despite that fact, craft and skill in any pre-modernist form didnt come up much when I was in school, other than as a historical artifact. And while I really didnt think about it much at the time, its very absence was instructive. It was really only after I left school that an observation about my experience within it began to creep up on me, which is simply this: crafting an object takes the attention away from the artist, and puts it on the object.
              <em>
               Conceptualizing
              </em>
              an object (or a performance, video, intervention, social practice, soundscape, etc.), on the other hand takes the attention away from the object, and puts it on the artist. The first was deemed bad. The second was deemed good.
             </p>
             <p>
              How can conceptualizing an object put the attention on the artist rather than the idea? Because a conceptual artist at some point needs to be present to explicate what the idea is in the first place. Thus, even though the Concept of the art supposedly shines through more clearly minus the hand of the artist, their face and voice and personality appear instead, due to the fact that some form of salesmanship is required for that particular thing to be understood. Which leads to the third major trait I see in work today- the way that the concept can be elastic enough to encompass merely the flavor of a personality. This is Conceptual 2.0, where it is enough that the concept is a compelling story or entertaining explanation. This is why ours is the era of the Art Opening, and the Artist Talk  how many artist talks do you suppose Picasso did, or Manet, or even Duchamp? This is how weve come to focus our attention on artists talking about ideas rather than simply on objects that embody them. Objects have receded to the background, as artists have come to the fore, and that flip has come to define most art in a contemporary context.
             </p>
             <p>
              This reality elides over a very important question though: are artists and ideas really the most important elements of art? If so, then art has moved into an area that seems to be a hybrid of philosophy and show business. Which actually sounds kind of interesting. But to accept this state of affairs means assuming that the intellect is the most valuable part of us, the most reliable part, the part that we should elevate above anything else. The best art (in this calculation) will always be the smartest art, which leaves out art made with joy, or sadness, or anger, or boredom. It leaves out intuitive art, or beautiful art, or ugly art, or process art, or tactile art, or interactive art, or crafted art, or outsider art, and so on. In other words, all the stuff that starts
              <em>
               without
              </em>
              a heaping dose of the intellect.
             </p>
             <p>
              Starting without it doesnt mean that it doesnt pick some of it up along the way of course. In fact, it invariably takes on a more unpredictable side of it. So rather than illustrating ideas that are already conceived in the mind of the artist, starting without them allows room for discovery, for challenging assumptions, for serendipity and surprise. It allows for following a path that isnt really clear. It allows in other words, for exploration.
             </p>
             <p>
              Starting without fixed ideas means starting without the mind isolated from the rest of us- it accepts the body, the hands, and the senses, as equal partners. Including them brings back the possibility of making things. In fact, it almost demands it. And as the artist begins the process of making something, a human activity with at least a two million year history, a further observation is easy to make: if the body and the hands act as the guide, then they better be capable. The sheer discipline of making something becomes an avenue of discovery, a way of creating something the mind cant exactly plan, or explain. That comes in after, the explanations, the questions, the criticism. And when it does, the physical and mental work together again to refine whatever was made, iteration after iteration, creating something greater than each one alone would be capable of.
             </p>
             <p>
              The argument against working like that of course is that the hands can take over. And it is true that becoming highly skilled at something and leaving it at that
              <em>
               does
              </em>
              have some real problems attached, problems that require some understanding on the part of the artist to avoid. Simply put, its that craft in and of itself isnt really much of anything. Learning it, like a writer learning the rules of grammar, is a good thing. But learning it and then thinking youre a great writer is a creepily misguided thing. Many of us have met artists who cant tell the difference, and have understandably decided to run in the other direction.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem is exacerbated when its noted, with perfect historical accuracy, that we are now able to pick and chose our influences and call whatever we do art. I noted as much two paragraphs ago. But while we are all subsumed in a postmodern world, there are clearly cracks in its description of reality. For example: we can borrow all we want, but we only get to describe our own experience, and really no other. Arthur Danto described this conundrum quite well when he talked about how artists in the postmodern era are able to pick and choose styles from other eras, true enough, but are forever
              <em>
               unable
              </em>
              to live the contexts that gave rise to them in the first place. This means that artists who try like hell to paint like John Singer Sergeant, or sculpt like Rodin, are not making art, they are making eerie monuments to the dead. Being influenced by them is one thing; becoming them is quite another. Until someone invents a time machine, artists are really only allowed to ask what Right Now looks like, and what is relevant to a description of that experience.
             </p>
             <p>
              While a suspicion of craft for crafts sake is legit, a suspicion of craft
              <em>
               itself
              </em>
              is usually how that suspicion plays out. Which Im taking some pains to point out is nuts. Understand: denying craft to make a point is perfectly fine. I can see denying the sensual in a sensual experience in order to do that. Also fair is to expand on the idea of what sensual is in the first place. Still good. What is totally crazy is to banish sensuality
              <em>
               forever
              </em>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              But there is a further hurdle for craft to clear, and its probably the highest: nobody really wants to become highly skilled at anything anymore. Doing so could take years, and maybe even a lifetime to achieve. Who wants to spend a lifetime doing anything? Our culture is described quite well by the researcher Linda Stone, who identified a mental state she described as Constant Partial Attention. In other words, skimming lightly over everything, and sinking deeply into nothing. Constant distractions, and shorter attention spans, mark the mental state of most of us.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem is that tangible skills are still relevant. For example: whatever life choices you have made for yourself, thank a farmer for growing the food for you to pursue it. Somebody, probably an immigrant, stuck their hands in the dirt to make sure you had something to eat. Just as somebody made you a house to live in, a bed to sleep on, shoes to wear, and so on and so on. Our distance from most of this stuff doesnt mean it doesnt happen, it just means were rich enough to ignore it. Should we care? You get to answer that for yourself of course, but for me, as most of us disappear into constant partial attention, my answer is yes.
             </p>
             <p>
              The personal is political, and ones art is one of the most personal, and therefore political things of all. Hands-on skills for the most part are in decline, and I think it is a political act to re-engage with them, a political act that seems relevant to our disassociated postmodern present. Its unfortunate to me that artists in particular get really touchy around anyone technically proficient, like furniture makers, or fabricators, or welders, or machinists or even the occasional sculptor. They tell each other that their ideas make them better than mere craftsmen, but most of the time, they struggle to articulate what their ideas actually are. To paraphrase David Hockney, they think theyre poets, but nobody taught them how to spell.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope my own work can reclaim some of the agency that Im not sure I really have anymore. Can I overcome my own Constant Partial Attention? Can I find a level of competence in myself, when Im not really sure that I know how to do anything well? Can I make something beautiful, rather than say something clever? Can beautiful and smart be the same thing? Can art feel necessary? I want to make the things that ask those questions, and so far Im not sure Ive managed to articulate clear answers of my own. But what I do know now, years into all of this, is that thinking about what the answers might be is every bit as rewarding as the making, and that the making led to the thinking. Both form a continuum, always being added to and refined, never becoming definitive, and never finished. And on that note, I have some carving to do.
