          <a href="http://www.airporthotelguide.com/articles/category/activities/" title="What fun is traveling if you do not explore all the great activities your travel destination has to offer? Travel activities can be all sorts of things from strolling through historic monuments and museums to leisure activities. When you travel to a certain destination you want to make sure to hit all the hot spots of that location.
Be sure to make a list of activities that you want to see and do while you are visiting. Make sure to allow time for everything. Remember this could be the first time you or someone in your family/group are seeing something. You want to be sure everyone has the time they need.
Check out times and dates of activities and places. Perhaps you will be there on a day when a museum is closed or you may also visit a spa on a day when they have discounts. Calendars and timing is everything when traveling. It is also great to check out family friendly activities ahead of time so you do not have to worry last minute about what to do with your children. There is nothing worse than promising to take them to the water park and then realize that rainy weather was forecasted. So be sure to plan a mixture of indoor and outdoor activities. That way, you know you will have a spectacular trip no matter the circumstances. ">

          <a href="http://www.airporthotelguide.com/articles/category/airports/" title="Airports are hectic places, full of crowds, noise, and mediocre food. However, they serve as the gateway to most places and are thus often unavoidable. The airport experience is generally the most dreaded part of a trip but there are ways to make it tolerable. Several airports, especially those in Europe and Asia, have added amenities that were previously unheard of. Restaurants owned by celebrity-chefs, relaxing day-spas, and high-end boutiques are quickly replacing the fast food chains, lonely shoe-shine guys, and magazine stands of the past. Art installations that reflect the local culture are displayed to give those passing through a small glimpse into the destination, even if they never leave the building; many even have professional curators to choose museum-quality pieces.
Next time you are headed on a trip, take some time to check the website of your destination's airport. This is where you will find information about the amenities offered in each terminal but also ideas for things to do on long layovers. In many places, if you have more than a 4 hour stop you will have time to explore outside of the airport and experience a slice of the country you are transiting through. Airports no longer have to be dreaded but can instead be anxiously anticipated.">

As a business traveler, you may be afforded this opportunity with many regions that you've never visited before. Whether you're going to meet a new client or attending a convention, traveling for business can be a great way to explore a city while enjoying the benefit of not having to pay for the entire trip.

When you're traveling for business, your time is more limited than it is when you are visiting a city for leisure. This forces you to prioritize and determine the attractions, restaurants, and hotspots that are a &quot;must-visit&quot; for you. Sometimes these will be the obvious famous attractions, and sometimes they may be more low-key spots that are off the beaten path.

To make your business trip memorable, it helps to plan ahead of time, while allowing for spontaneity as well. Doing online research can be very helpful. The internet is an incredible resource, as long as you're visiting travel websites with trusted reviews. Reaching out to those who have been to the city before is also helpful. If you're limited for time, you can even ask people on the plane while you're on your way there!

Researching a new city can be an incredibly fun way to widen your horizons and learn more about yourself in the process. Traveling for business allows you to do this while getting your work done at the same time.">

Some hotels are smaller, making them ideal for the traveler who needs somewhere to sleep for one night while driving on a long distance. A family hotel is often larger and has more amenities. Many hotels have a swimming pool that is open during the summer season. Some larger hotels have a lazy river or water fountains so that children can play. There are various types of rooms in hotels so that families and groups of all sizes have somewhere to stay. Parents with small children can get a crib to put in the room. There are rooms with kitchenettes that include a refrigerator, stove and dishes so that you don't have to go out to eat all of the time while on vacation. Larger hotels often have some kind of breakfast area, and many serve a free breakfast for guests. There is a maid service offered almost every day, and free newspapers are usually available in the lobby. Hotels are an ideal place to stay if you have a trip planned in the future.

Leisure travel is for the tourist who wants to get away from the mundane of everyday life. Perhaps you want to relax and really experience a world totally different than you see everyday. 
Be sure to check out the spas, guided tours and dine in the most exquisite restaurants because leisure traveling is all about making you feel as relaxed and at peace as you will ever be. It is fun to splurge for a change and experience everything you can that you may not get to see or even do in your everyday life. Get that taxi ride, splurge on that seaweed wrap or spend some time enjoying a round on the golf course. Just be sure that you are relaxing the way you want to. 
Leisure travel can be luxurious, but remember it does not have to be expensive. It can be just as relaxing to pack a picnic lunch for the park all day or lie on a white sand beach and read your favorite book or even take a much needed rest.

Whether with loved ones, friends, or by yourself, going on vacation is a great way to get away from the stress of your job and just relax doing what you love. Whether this means going to the tropics and relaxing on the beach, or heading to the snow to enjoy winter sports, it is crucial you choose a vacation spot that best suits you. And the best part about picking a vacation is that you are not limited to one spot. Now a days, you can go almost anywhere you think of, or have the desire to go. 

There are a few important factors to take into account. Make sure you are taking sufficient leave from work to fit in everything you want to do on your time off. You don't want to get halfway into your vacation and realize that you have to cut it short just to return to work, knowing that there was still so much to see. Granted, you probably won't be able to explore everything you want on a trip, but it is important to have a plan ahead of time. Know what you want to see, understand how much time you have, and start mapping out how you can best use your time to capitalize on your vacation. In other words, ask yourself the reasons for your trip, figure out a location that fits your personality and interests, schedule an itinerary of what you want to do, and make sure you have enough time to see as much as possible. Vacations are great. Make the most of them by having a plan ahead of time that leaves you feeling satisfied and rewarded when you return home.">

         Twenty percent? Traveling from the door to door often requires taxi drivers, bell staff in airport hotels and other intermediaries along the way. And when it comes to tipping, it can be hard to find that sweet spot  you don't want to appear cheap but at the same time, you know you ought to stick to the travel budget. Check out this guide to tipping, and you and your wallet will be ready for your next vacation.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Variance Across the US
        </h2>
        <p>
         Even though Americans rank as the best tippers in the eyes of the rest of the world, tipping etiquette changes in regions across the U.S. You might be expected to tip 20 percent to a good waiter in New York City, but a server in Tulsa, Oklahoma, may be cheery about a 15 percent tip.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tip is always calculated as a percentage of the bill, not including tax. As a good rule of thumb, it usually follows this rule: 10 percent if you were unsatisfied, 15 percent if it was OK, 20 percent for excellent service, 25 percent for above-and-beyond service.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, not all services require the same amount.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Restaurants and Bars
        </h2>
        <p>
         Whether you're out to eat with family or co-workers, it's proper etiquette to tip servers. A cheap tip can rub off poorly  especially if you are trying to impress potential clients over drinks. As good business travel advice, here's the breakdown.
        </p>
        <p>
         A full-service food service should receive 15 to 20 percent of the pretax bill. So, if your bill comes out to $55, a generous 20 percent tip would be $11. A 15 percent tip totals $8.25. If the server was bad but not horrible, put down 10 percent,$5.5. (Slice of advice: An easy way to calculate 10 percent in your head is to simply move the decimal left one digit.)
        </p>
        <p>
         It's always worth keeping in mind that in many restaurants, the waiter is required to give part of his or her tips to the bus boy, hostess and food runners. Try to tip in cash when you can and directly to the person who provided the service. Saying a simple "thank you" when handing cash over is customary.
        </p>
        <p>
         For food servers in a buffet-style or pickup-style restaurant, such as coffee or sandwich shop, tips should be at least 10 percent.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no obligation to tip for take-out service, but a 10 percent tip is favorable for extra service  curbside delivery or a large, complicated order.
        </p>
        <p>
         For bartenders, tip $1 or $2 per drink, or 15 or 20 percent of the total bill.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Gratuity included?
        </h2>
        <p>
         Gratuity included means the same thing as a tip. If the bill clearly states "18 percent gratuity included," that's the tip for the server, and you don't have to tip any extra. If you want to tip more, you can, but it's not necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         Restaurants often include gratuity in the bill if there's a large party, so be sure to check it out. Yet in some cities, such as Miami Beach, Florida, it's customary for bars and restaurants to throw in an included tip no matter what.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Taxis
        </h2>
        <p>
         Most vacations are filled with cab drivers who make their living on tips. Depending on the city you're traveling in, a 15 percent tip is usually enough. If the driver helps with any bags, include an extra $1 to $2. For example, a cab ride costs $13 and the driver helps with bags. How much should you pay? $16 is suitable.
        </p>
        <p>
         The price depends on your comfort level, how safe you feel during the drive and the friendliness of the driver.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Hotels
        </h2>
        <p>
         Between room service, maids and bell staff, knowing your tip amounts at hotels is sure to come in handy. Tip the bell staff around $1 to $2 per bag, and more if the bags are especially heavy. For room service, you can give 15 to 20 percent of the total bill, like tipping a waiter or waitress at a restaurant. After your stay at an airport hotel, it's customary to leave $2 to $3 per night and more in upscale hotels or if more than three people were staying the room. Leave the tip on the pillow or the main table, wherever is most visible.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you get valet parking, hand $2 to $5 to the driver when your car is returned to you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many airport hotels in destinations such as
         <a href="http://www.airporthotelguide.com/boston-logan/">
          Boston
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://www.airporthotelguide.com/denver/">
          Denver
         </a>
         offer a complimentary shuttle from airport to hotel. Tip these courtesy shuttle drivers $1 to $2 per bag.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Airports
        </h2>
        <p>
         At the airport, if you happen to use an airport or a train porter, it's proper to tip $1 to $2 per bag. Airport wheelchair assistance gets $3 to $5 upon arrival at the gate.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Beauty
        </h2>
        <p>
         Enjoying a little pampering on your leisure travel? Consider leaving a tip. Beauty salon professionals deserve around 15 to 20 percent for a manicure or pedicure. A good tip for a hair stylist or barber is a minimum of 15 to 20 percent of the cost of service, which might be split among others who assisted. For spa services like a massage, drop a 15 to 20 percent tip. However, no tip is necessary if the service was provided by the owner of the establishment.
        </p>
        <h2>
         Extra Advice
        </h2>
        <p>
         Consider whipping out the calculator on your phone, or downloading tipping apps such as Tip Me or Tip N Split Tip Calculator. These tools can make tipping a lot easier.
