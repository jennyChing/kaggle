    The wars against Carthage changed Rome. The Senate had gained in power and prestige relative to the  people's  assemblies, the Comitias Plebis. The Romans  emerged from the Punic wars with the widespread understanding that ultimate authority over the military lay with the Senate, that it was the Senate's job to know, advise and guide, and the Senate's job to decide the question of war or peace and other foreign policy matters.
   </p>
   <p>
    Rome's second war against Carthage reduced the number of people in the Italian 
    countryside. Men had gone off to war. People had died and people had moved to 
    the cities to escape war. Some people had left the countryside to work in the 
    arms industry, and some had left for  Rome looking for subsistence. The new arrivals in Rome 
    enjoyed the festivals and other public entertainment that were created to maintain 
    public morale during the dark days of the war. Newcomers developed a preference 
    for the city over the life of drudgery they had known working on farms. And 
    after the war ended, many veterans from farming families preferred settling 
    in cities, especially Rome, rather than return to the countryside. Cities in 
    Italy became overcrowded, and Rome became the most populous city in Europe and 
    West Asia.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result of the war, much farmland in Italy could be bought
    cheaply. Those  with wealth began buying this farmland,
    some landowners expanding their holdings and some businessmen
    from the cities looking for a secure investment and a source
    of social respectability. With the accelerated trend toward
    larger farms came  a greater use of slaves. More lands
    in the countryside were transformed into pasture, vineyard,
    and olive orchards  more suited to Italian soil and climate
    than was the growing of grain. The richest lands were
    converted to vineyards and the poorer tracts to olive groves,
    while ranching was the most profitable for capitalist landowners.
    Holdings that were a mix of ranching and farming  grew
    to more than 300 acres, found mostly in southern
    and central Italy, the area most heavily devastated by
    the Second Punic War.

   <p>
    Many small farmers found themselves unable to compete with the larger farms 
    and their more numerous slaves. Moreover, a greater importation of grain from 
    Sicily and North Africa brought a drop in grain prices, and many small farmers 
    gave up, sold their farms  and joined the migration to the cities. 
    The wars that began with the minor incident at Messana in the early 260s BCE had brought unintended 
    consequences  as wars often do. Many of Rome's small farmers, who had been 
    the backbone of the Roman Republic, had become city-dwellers living off of free bread and enjoying circuses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Also, empire had grown. Rome now  considered  Spain as its possession, and it began what would become 
    a long struggle to conquer Spain's various inhabitants.
   </p>
   <p>
    Romans had begun investing their 
    money abroad, in  mines in Spain,  vast tracts of land in Sicily 
    and elsewhere, and they turned these lands into slave plantations. Some of them 
    lent money abroad, at high interest rates, and Roman financial operations became 
    greater than that of the Greeks and Near Easterners. There would be an increase 
    in fraud, against which the Senate would  not always be willing to press charges. 
    And those with wealth would import more spices, carpets, perfumes and other luxury 
    goods from the East.
