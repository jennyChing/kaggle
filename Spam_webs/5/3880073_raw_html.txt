It lists the job title, a smattering of responsibilities, and contact info by which you can apply for the position. But upon a second reading, you\u2019re sure to find many layers to the posting, full of nuances and hidden messages that a seasoned job seeker might be able to pick up. If you\u2019ve ever read a posting and wondered, \u201cWhat are they really asking for?\u201d here are some tips on how to read between the lines of a job description\u2014and submit a job application that will get you the position.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Pay attention to the placement.&lt;\/b&gt;\u00a0By their very nature, job descriptions are fairly short and succinct. Without having pages to list every single job duty, company background, and so on, hiring managers will write what\u2019s most important at the top of the job description. It\u2019s there that they\u2019ll give you\u2014in either a sentence or two\u2014an overarching idea of what they want from their potential employee. As a job seeker, it\u2019s important for you to repeat that information (in your own words, of course) in your cover letter. Not only does it show that you read through the job description, but that you can do the work as well.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Respect the responsibilities.&lt;\/b&gt;\u00a0A typical job description might have upwards of ten or more job duties listed. Generally, the top five are the most critical ones and those that can make or break your job application. Make sure you actually can perform these duties, particularly if some of them are listed as \u201crequirements\u201d or \u201cqualifications.\u201d If you don\u2019t, your job application will be rejected by the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) or the actual person who is reading your resume.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Learn the lingo.&lt;\/b&gt;\u00a0Team player. Strong organizational skills. Leadership qualities. There are some terms that go hand in hand with a job description. But what do they really mean\u2014and do you really need to possess these skills and traits? A team player means that you\u2019ll be working with others, and you\u2019ll need to do so without any drama or complaining. Strong organizational skills is code for having a very busy workload and having to be able to manage it all well without dropping the ball\u2014or making your prospective boss look bad. If you\u2019re expected to have leadership qualities, you\u2019ll need to command the respect of your colleagues and lead and inspire them, which will require you to think outside of the box at times and be adaptable.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Share the love.&lt;\/b&gt;\u00a0In an effort to avoid being inundated with job applications, some companies will refrain from posting the company\u2019s name in the job description. If the company\u2019s name is listed, though, you should make a concerted effort to offer up some praise about the organization in your cover letter. If you\u2019re not very familiar with the company, do some research first, and then include a couple of sentences in your job application that depict how much you want to work for that specific organization. For example, you might write something like, \u201cI admire your organization\u2019s policy on workplace flexibility.\u201d After all, a boss is more apt to hire someone who specifically wants to work for his company as opposed to someone simply looking for any old job.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Find out the compensation.&lt;\/b&gt;\u00a0It\u2019s the question of any job seeker: how much does this job pay? Unfortunately, very few job postings will name a dollar amount. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find out how much the company is willing to cough up for the position, though. By using sites such as salary.com, you can find out comparable salaries for the job you\u2019re after, and you can use this info to determine if it\u2019s worth applying for the position or not.\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019re deep in the throes of your job search, it\u2019s easy to quickly scan a job description so that you can submit your application ASAP. But taking the time to thoroughly read through the posting can help you submit quality job applications that will get you hired for a position that you truly want\u2014and deserve.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr \/&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/jennifer-parris.jpeg\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-13229\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/jennifer-parris.jpeg\" alt=\"Jennifer Parris, FlexJobs\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Author&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Jennifer Parris is a Career Writer for FlexJobs, an award-winning service that helps job-seekers find professional opportunities that offer work flexibility, such as telecommuting, freelance, part-time, or alternative schedules.

Writers, by nature, are collectors of words and catchy turns of phrase, but are there some that should be retired when they fall out of season? Look to literature for inspiration.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Words for Spring&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/russellstreet\/7526097344\/sizes\/l\"&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13305 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Untitled8.png\" alt=\"seasons, trees, Grammarly\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nSpring is associated with birth and youth, and the emergence of color after drab winter days. &lt;i&gt;Vernal, verdant, fertile, burgeoning,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;callow&lt;\/i&gt; are favorite spring words, as are &lt;i&gt;blossoming, sprouting,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bursting forth.&lt;\/i&gt; A line from Rainer Maria Rilke says it best: \"Spring has returned. The Earth is like a child that knows poems.\"\r\n\r\nSpring is also the perfect time to express &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/a-national-grammar-day-tale-of-love\"&gt;words of love&lt;\/a&gt;. Pablo Neruda, master of love poems, invokes spring themes: \"I want to do to you what spring does with the cherry trees.\" You can't help thinking of romance with spring-like phrases such as &lt;i&gt;breathe in&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;come alive.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Words for Summer&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n\"In summer, the song sings itself,\" wrote William Carlos Williams. Summer is the season of daydreams, beach walks, and carefree afternoons soaking up the sun. &lt;i&gt;Languid, languorous,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;leisurely&lt;\/i&gt; are &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/shall-i-compare-thee-to-a-summers-day\/\"&gt;favorite summer words&lt;\/a&gt;, as are &lt;i&gt;jaunty, jovial,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;happy-go-lucky.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nSummer is also the season of heat and passion. Think &lt;i&gt;sizzling, sweltering, searing,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;scorched.&lt;\/i&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Mad in Pursuit&lt;\/i&gt;, Violette Leduc describes summer well:\u00a0\"I walk without flinching through the burning cathedral of summer.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, no &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/12-common-words-that-will-boost-your-scrabble-score\"&gt;summer vocabulary&lt;\/a&gt; is complete without recreational words like &lt;i&gt;picnic, cookout, camp,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;vacation.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Words for Autumn&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nAutumn is the only season that has two names. The word &lt;i&gt;fall&lt;\/i&gt;\u00a0for the third season appeared in the 16th century; prior to that time, only summer and winter were defined seasons with names. &lt;i&gt;Spring&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fall&lt;\/i&gt; were shortened from \"spring of the leaf\" and \"fall of the leaf\" to define the in-between seasons.\r\n\r\nFall is the season of harvest, of crisp weather, and (of course) pumpkin spice latte. William Blake's &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/alphabet-of-errors-poem\"&gt;famous poem&lt;\/a&gt; \"To Autumn\" begins, \"Oh Autumn, laden with fruit and stained with the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit beneath my shady roof.\" Autumn is crackling, golden, and vibrant \u2013 a cornucopia of color.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Back to school sale,\u00a0Indian summer,&lt;\/i&gt;\u00a0and &lt;i&gt;pumpkin patch&lt;\/i&gt;\u00a0are uniquely autumn phrases that rarely get used once fall has passed.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Words for Winter&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen winter comes, it brings words such as &lt;i&gt;snowflake, shiver, frostbite,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;flurry.&lt;\/i&gt; John Updike wrote of winter: \"The day is short, the sun a spark hung thin between the dark and dark.\" &lt;i&gt;Earmuffs, parka, mittens, boots&lt;\/i&gt;\u00a0\u2013 winter has its own wardrobe of words. It has its own menu, too: &lt;i&gt;hot cocoa, hearty stew, fruitcake, Christmas cookies,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;milk.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nSome &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/how-to-keep-your-kids-writing-during-holiday-break\/\"&gt;winter words&lt;\/a&gt; melt away with spring: &lt;i&gt;icicle, hibernate, toboggan, snowball fight, wind chill factor,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;arctic blast.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Words for Holidays&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nEach holiday has a unique lexicon of seasonal words. New Year's Eve brings &lt;i&gt;resolutions&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Auld Lang Syne.&lt;\/i&gt;\u00a0April heralds &lt;i&gt;Easter bunnies&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Easter bonnets, egg rolls&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;egg hunts,&lt;\/i&gt; and the iconic &lt;i&gt;marshmallow Peep.&lt;\/i&gt; In July, we get &lt;i&gt;fireworks, parades,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;patriotism&lt;\/i&gt; wrapped in the American flag. Christmas is the mother lode: &lt;i&gt;Santa, mistletoe, Black Friday, eggnog, nutcracker, Scrooge, tinsel, wassail, carol,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yule.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nMost words are evergreen and show up all year round, but some words evoke seasonal memories and feel out of place when they're used out of turn. &lt;i&gt;Pumpkin pie&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;picnic,&lt;\/i&gt; for example, elicits a seasonal disconnect.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of your favorite words to conjure up a warm spring day or a cold winter night?","post_title":"\"Seasonal\" Words: Do They Exist?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"seasonal-words-do-they-exist","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-07-09 08:29:29","post_modified_gmt":"2015-07-09 15:29:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=13303","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13297,"post_author":"4","post_date":"2015-07-07 02:00:18","post_date_gmt":"2015-07-07 09:00:18","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/iphone-evening.jpg\" alt=\"Here&#039;s how to be nicer on the phone\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15325\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nCell phones hit the free market 30 years ago, but Americans still haven't internalized a complete set of social rules for cell phone usage. If you're not sure what's acceptable in the world of cell phone etiquette, check out these five tips in honor of Cell Phone Courtesy Month in July.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Keep Private Conversations Private&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/edenpictures\/3385862821\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-full wp-image-13299 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Untitled7.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by edenpictures\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen you're engrossed in a phone conversation, it's easy to fool yourself into believing that no one can hear you except the person on the other end of the line.\r\n\r\nIn truth, anyone within 10\u00a0feet can hear your half of the conversation, and whether they mean to or not, they're bound to follow along. It doesn't matter if you're wandering the aisles of the grocery store or huddled inside your work cubicle; others'\u00a0ears perk up at the hint of a private exchange. If you don\u2019t want the other patrons of Starbucks to hear about your recent dermatological exam, don\u2019t call your mom with the details as you\u2019re waiting for your morning latte.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Toilet Talk&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nData suggests that up to 87 percent of all people have texted or chatted on the phone &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/life-style\/health\/cell-phone-bathroom-75-americans-admit-calling-texting-toilet-article-1.1015634\"&gt;while sitting on the toilet&lt;\/a&gt;. While it may be acceptable to do this in the privacy of home, it's just plain rude to talk on the phone in a public bathroom. People visiting the lavatory expect privacy. Wielding your cell phone while others answer nature's call is like filming an impromptu movie in a public locker room. You wouldn't bring a live mic into a bathroom stall. Don't bring your cell phone, either.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Caution With Text-Speak&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTexting is still a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/brb-im-learning-these-grammar-rules-for-texting\/\"&gt;seedling technology&lt;\/a&gt;, and society hasn't adopted a definitive consensus as to what's acceptable yet. However, if you suspect a person might feel annoyed or inconvenienced by your texting language, you might want to mind your p's and q's.\r\n\r\nIf you need to text a boss, coworker, or professional acquaintance, don't use the same language and abbreviations you would use when texting a friend. Though \"text speak\" (K, LOL, etc.) is quick and easy, you sacrifice professionalism and credibility when you use it for work purposes.\r\n\r\nThough it is occasionally acceptable to throw an \"OMW\" or \"SMH\" into your daily texts, you should practice using correct punctuation, spelling, and grammar when texting. After all, you don't want to confuse Grandma with your trendy text speak or offend anyone when you say \"LMFAO.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Don't Dial and Drive&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIn certain areas of the country, driving with a cell phone in hand is &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ghsa.org\/html\/stateinfo\/laws\/cellphone_laws.html\"&gt;illegal&lt;\/a&gt;.\u00a0Even if you live in a state where the cops can't arrest you for it, dialing and driving is considered rude by plenty of people.\r\n\r\nWhy do some people frown upon dialing and driving? Perhaps it's due to the fact that distracted driving claims the lives of at least &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/motorvehiclesafety\/distracted_driving\/\"&gt;nine people per day&lt;\/a&gt; in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control.\u00a0To these folks, talking on the phone while driving is akin to saying, \"My phone call is more important than your life.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, that's rather rude.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Don't Text and Drive&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile driving and dialing might fall into a gray area of acceptability, driving and texting is never okay. It doesn't matter how careful and coordinated you are; texting removes your hands from the wheel, your eyes from the road, and your mind from what you're doing.\r\n\r\nIn fact, \"&lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.textinganddrivingsafety.com\/texting-and-driving-stats\/\"&gt;driving while intexticated&lt;\/a&gt;\" has grown into a national epidemic. Some claim that it's a cinch for them to text and drive. However, these people may not realize that texting causes over 1\u00a0million crashes per year \u2013 and the trend isn't improving.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of social situations, norms guide behavior. However, with cell phone usage, norms are still evolving. Are you guilty of breaking any of these rules of cell phone etiquette?","post_title":"5 Cell Phone Etiquette Tips","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"5-cell-phone-etiquette-tips","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-07-07 08:29:37","post_modified_gmt":"2015-07-07 15:29:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=13297","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13291,"post_author":"4","post_date":"2015-07-02 02:00:57","post_date_gmt":"2015-07-02 09:00:57","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/45tfrds5rtf.jpg\" alt=\"7 Words\/Phrases Used Differently as Years Go By\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15245\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nRead a piece of literature from a couple hundred years ago \u2014 or even just a few decades ago \u2014 and you might feel like you're reading a different dialect of English. &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/ed.ted.com\/lessons\/how-languages-evolve-alex-gendler\"&gt;Languages evolve&lt;\/a&gt;, usually &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rosettastone.com\/blog\/language-myths-and-complicated-languages\/\"&gt;becoming simpler&lt;\/a&gt; over time. Acceptable grammar practices change, writing styles shift, and words and phrases take on meanings that may be a significant departure from their original definition.\r\n\r\nOne common example of a word with a new meaning is \"gay.\" You might often hear traditionalists point out that the word previously meant happy, and it had nothing to do with a person's sexual orientation. Of course, that is one example among hundreds; here are a few more words that have different meanings today than they did in yesteryear.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Awful&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Awesome\" and \"awful\" &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/these-words-may-sound-similar-but-they-have-very-different-meanings\/\"&gt;sound similar&lt;\/a&gt;, but they have opposite meanings \u2014 today. However, if you take a trip in the way-back machine, you'll find that \"awful\" really wasn't so bad. In fact, it used to describe something that inspired awe, something jaw-dropping in a good way. Next time you want to give a creative compliment, use awful in its original sense. Just make sure you explain what you really mean.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Broadcast&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bluecorvette\/8265586126\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-13293\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Untitled6.png\" alt=\"farm, broadcast, Grammarly\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nTelevision and radio stations transmit their content to a wide audience, and this is how we most often define \"broadcasting.\" However, the word has its roots in agriculture. Instead of meticulously planting each seed, a worker would scatter seed by tossing it in handfuls on primed soil. Even today, there are broadcasting machines that distribute grass seed and fertilizer.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Fantastic&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nHe can stretch for miles, and he leads a team of superheroes. He is Mr. Fantastic, and he lives up to his name in every sense of the word \u2014\u00a0according to both the archaic and modern meanings of it. Today, \u201cfantastic\u201d describes something that is outstandingly good, something above and beyond the everyday. However, it used to have a meaning more directly related to its root word, \"fantasy.\" Yep, fantastic once referred only to things that don't exist.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Backlog&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nToday, \"backlog\" refers to mountains of work that probably require an all-nighter or two to finish. Are you wondering about the word's original meaning? In colonial times, a &lt;a rel=\"no follow\"  href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2014\/02\/26\/words-that-have-changed-meaning_n_4847343.html\"&gt;backlog&lt;\/a&gt; was the biggest log in the fire. Go ahead, throw a backlog in the fireplace, grab some coffee, and get started on that backlog of paperwork.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Villain&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you like to write fiction, you probably pour hours into crafting the perfect villain. You come up with a potent back story, outstanding characteristics, and a sinister list of to-do's. Well, if you lived in the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;\/sup&gt; or 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;\/sup&gt; century, you wouldn't put so much effort into the villains of your novel unless you were writing a gripping tale of life on a farm. That's right; a villain was nothing more than a farmhand.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Passenger&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you're a passenger in a car or bus, you might look out the window and see pedestrians, but those folks on the sidewalk are passengers, too, according to the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/awesomer\/words-that-used-to-mean-something-totally-different\"&gt;word's old meaning&lt;\/a&gt;. Passengers were originally people who traveled by foot.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Pedant&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nBack in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;\/sup&gt; century, published works used this word about &lt;a rel=\"no follow\"  href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/ngrams\/graph?content=pedant&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cpedant%3B%2Cc0\"&gt;six times as frequently&lt;\/a&gt; as they do today, and that isn't the only way that \"pedant\" has changed over the years. It used to describe a knowledgeable person, a schoolmaster. Today it refers to someone who is a little too concerned about details.\r\n\r\nLanguage, like culture, must adapt to new attitudes and new ways of thinking. That is why so many words do not mean what they used to. Can you think of any other interesting examples of words or phrases that have left behind their original meanings?","post_title":"7 Words\/Phrases That Don\u2019t Mean What You Think They Mean","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"7-wordsphrases-that-dont-mean-what-you-think-they-mean","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-07-02 09:24:53","post_modified_gmt":"2015-07-02 16:24:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=13291","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13247,"post_author":"4","post_date":"2015-06-18 02:00:34","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-18 09:00:34","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14931\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/23esagfd.jpg\" alt=\"Grammarly Quotations\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\nWhat does it mean to be a father? Dads approach fatherhood in a variety of ways, from overbearing to \u201cwrapped around your little finger,\u201d and everything in between. There\u2019s no formula for the perfect father, but there are some commonalities among father figures in literature that make the concept of fatherhood a powerful one.\r\n\r\nIn honor of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/what-to-write-for-fathers-day\/\"&gt;Father's Day&lt;\/a&gt;, here are six father figures in literature. Which reminds you of your own father?\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;King Lear, The \u201cPrideful\u201d Father&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nThe life of the title character in Shakespeare's &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;\/i&gt; is shaped by his three daughters. When it comes time for him to step down from the throne in his old age, King Lear makes a drastic mistake. Instead of dividing his empire evenly among his three daughters, a final deceit causes him to disown Cordelia. Unfortunately, King Lear doesn't realize that Cordelia loved him most until it's too late. Despite this tragic choice, King Lear's powerful love for his daughters defines his life.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Mr. Bennet, The \u201cProtective\u201d Father&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/allison-pataki\/top-ten-father-figures-in_b_5488200.html\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Mr. Bennet&lt;\/a&gt; may not be the richest character in Jane Austen's &lt;i&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;\/i&gt;, but what makes him a memorable father is the constant care and empathy that he shows for his daughters. Given the Bennet family\u2019s financial situation, he feels pressure to marry his daughters off, but instead of focusing on money he keeps his children's best interests in mind. Throughout the novel, it's clear how much Mr. Bennet admires his daughter Lizzy, in particular, in the way he uses both his wisdom and humor to guide her through difficult life decisions.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Bob Cratchit, The \u201cOptimistic\u201d Father&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nThe majority of Charles Dickens' &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;\/em&gt; focuses on the eternally grumpy Ebeneezer Scrooge and the unfortunate Tiny Tim. The unsung hero here, however, is Tiny Tim's father, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bridgemanimages.com\/en-US\/explore\/news\/features\/2013\/June\/top-10-father-figures-from-literature\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Bob Cratchit&lt;\/a&gt;. As Scrooge's employee, Cratchit can't see much light at the end of the tunnel, and he is perpetually kept cold and underpaid. Instead of giving up, Cratchit makes the best of the situation and dutifully reports to work in order to take care of his beloved son. After a spiritual intervention, Scrooge makes a turn for the better and Cratchit's persistence and steadfastness pays off.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Atticus Finch, The \u201cRole Model\u201d Father&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/x-ray_delta_one\/5899419289\/sizes\/m\/\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-13249\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Untitled2-319x410.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by x-ray delta one\" width=\"319\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nDespite tough times, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/blog.chegg.com\/2013\/06\/14\/10-of-the-best-fictional-fathers\/\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Atticus Finch&lt;\/a&gt; serves as a father figure to admire in Harper Lee's &lt;i&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;\/i&gt;. A widower and lawyer in the Jim Crow South, Finch does his best to be his children's moral compass. Perhaps the best example of this is the way Finch encourages his children to be who they want to be instead of what their troubled society says is right. Instead of forcing his daughter to be a girly girl, Finch encourages Scout to develop her tomboy personality. He has a challenging road in front of him, but he remains a pillar of strength throughout the novel.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Calvin's Dad, The \u201cPatient\u201d Father&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nFor years, fans enjoyed Bill Watterson's funny and sweet comic strip, &lt;i&gt;Calvin and Hobbes&lt;\/i&gt;. A calm and collected counterpoint to the mischievous Calvin, his dad proves time and time again that patience is a virtue. Throughout many story lines, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/gliterature.com\/2011\/06\/19\/top-5-fictional-fathers\/\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Calvin's dad&lt;\/a&gt; answers his son's often-obnoxious questions and deals with his many well-intentioned mishaps. Best of all, he loves Calvin through all of his trying moments and troublesome times.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;The Man, The \u201cSacrificing\u201d Father&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;The Road&lt;\/i&gt; by Cormac McCarthy is a post-apocalyptic novel that remains grim from cover to cover, but one of the shining lights throughout is &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.shortlist.com\/entertainment\/books\/30-most-memorable-literary-fathers\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;The Man&lt;\/a&gt;. This father figure doesn't have a lot to offer his son, due to their extraordinary circumstances. Instead, he does everything he can to keep his son alive and motivated along their incredibly difficult journey through what seems like the end of the world.\r\n\r\nThese father figures demonstrate a full range of parenting styles throughout &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/how-literature-changes-your-brain-for-the-better\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;centuries of literature&lt;\/a&gt;.

Pack these nifty word-related car games in your overnight bag the next time you hit the road.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Character Sketches&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nChoose another car and take a good look at its passengers. Each person makes up a backstory about the passengers in the other vehicle and shares it with the others.\r\n\r\nIf you're stumped, start by answering these questions about the folks in the other car:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;1. Who are they?\r\n2. Where are they going?\r\n3. What are their hopes and fears?\r\n4. What are their flaws and strengths?&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nFiction writers use &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/embrace-your-geekness-with-the-character-sketch\/\"&gt;character sketches&lt;\/a&gt; to spur their creativity. These thumbnails often morph into the fascinating characters we meet it books. You can do it, too \u2013 on wheels.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;License Plate Decoding Game&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/gammaman\/9114536420\/sizes\/m\/\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-13241\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Untitled1.png\" alt=\"License Plate, Grammarly, car games, road trip\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat if every license plate harbored a secret meaning within its letters and numbers? That's the premise behind the License Plate Decoding Game. The game works especially well when you're caught in traffic because you have plenty of time to peruse and \"decode\" the license plates around you.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"&gt;\u2022 \"PTA 247\" becomes \"Peanut butter tastes awesome to 47-year-olds.\"\r\n\u2022 \"YHB 711\" becomes \"Your hair looks bad seven days a week, eleven hours a day.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;License Plate School&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nIf you're traveling with little ones, consider using license plates to reinforce geography and phonics lessons learned at school. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.edmunds.com\/car-reviews\/top-10\/top-10-road-trip-games.html\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Edmunds.com&lt;\/a&gt; suggests that children \"collect\" plates from the different states or try to find all the letters of the alphabet - first forwards, then backwards.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Related Words Game&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nThe Related Words Game requires each player to brainstorm a list of words that relate to a specific starting word. The subsequent list must bring the topic back full circle. Whoever creates the shortest list wins.\r\n\r\nFor example, Player One might create a list like this:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"&gt;\u2022 noodles\r\n\u2022 delicious food\r\n\u2022 cake\r\n\u2022 birthday cake\r\n\u2022 presents\r\n\u2022 wrapping paper\r\n\u2022 ribbons\r\n\u2022 strings\r\n\u2022 noodles&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nPlayer Two might create a list like this:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"&gt;\u2022 noodles\r\n\u2022 yellow\r\n\u2022 egg yolks\r\n\u2022 chicken\r\n\u2022 chicken noodle soup\r\n\u2022 noodles&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nBecause Player Two created the shorter list, he\/she wins. You can play as many rounds of the Related Words Game as you like, but if you wish to limit the game, choose a random word like PIG. Each time someone loses a round, they take one letter of the word. For example, Player One earned a \"P\" for this round. Whoever spells the word \"PIG\" first loses the game.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Round Robin Story Game&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nTeachers have used &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.edutopia.org\/blog\/alternatives-to-round-robin-reading-todd-finley\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;round robin reading strategies&lt;\/a&gt; in the classroom for decades. In this game, car riders use the round-robin style to create a groupthink story. Each rider contributes one word at a time. The entire story lasts four or five sentences. If possible, choose a scribe to write or record the words as they are generated.\r\n\r\nIf a player thinks a sentence sounds complete, any passenger can &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/\"&gt;insert punctuation&lt;\/a&gt; by shouting \"Period!\" or \"Exclamation point!\"\r\n\r\nHere's an example of an opening sentence created by a four-person car load:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 90px;\"&gt;Person 1: Once\r\nPerson 2: upon\r\nPerson 3: a\r\nPerson 4: time\r\nPerson 1: I\r\nPerson 2: ate\r\nPerson 3: twenty-six\r\nPerson 4: frogs\r\nPerson 1: and\r\nPerson 2: turned\r\nPerson 3: into\r\nPerson: 4: a\r\nPerson 1: wombat.\r\n(PERIOD)&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nNo matter how silly the story gets, each word must make &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/49238\/7-sentences-sound-crazy-are-still-grammatical\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;grammatical sense&lt;\/a&gt; in the context of the story.\r\n\r\nVacations are essential for happiness and well-being, but getting to your vacation spot can be tedious.

From the poetry of Walt Whitman to the landmark plays of Tony Kushner, it's impossible to overstate the impact LGBT authors have had in American literature. In honor of Pride Month, here are five of the most important and influential LGBT writers of all time.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.biography.com\/people\/oscar-wilde-9531078\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Oscar Wilde&lt;\/a&gt;, a prolific Irish author whose poems, essays, and plays remain relevant more than 100 years after his death, wrote just one novel, \"The Portrait of Dorian Gray.\" The novel provoked a public outcry over what was perceived as a stunning lack of morality. Wilde, perhaps Britain's leading proponent of the Aesthetic Movement, defended his &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/7-novels-to-read-for-a-better-vocabulary\/\"&gt;novel &lt;\/a&gt;in its preface,\u00a0stating, \"ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.\" Later, he wrote, \"Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.\"\r\n\r\nWilde was arrested on charges of public indecency for his open homosexuality and served two years in prison. He died at 46, penniless and in exile in France.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Tennessee Williams&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nBorn Thomas Lanier Williams in 1911, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.biography.com\/people\/tennessee-williams-9532952\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Tennessee Williams&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0is considered one of America's best playwrights of the 20th century. His iconic \"Streetcar Named Desire\" earned Williams both a Pulitzer Prize and a Drama Critics Award. Other important successes include \"The Glass Menagerie,\" \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" and \"Orpheus Descending,\" which was made into a movie (\"The Fugitive Kind\") starring Marlon Brando.\r\n\r\nWilliams was openly gay, even suffering a hate attack in Key West in 1979.

Woolf suffered sexual abuse early in her life at the hands of half-brothers; her battle with mental illness and depression throughout her life influenced her work. \"Mrs. Dalloway,\" written in mesmerizing prose, raises emerging social issues, such as feminism and homosexuality.\r\n\r\nWoolf ultimately succumbed to her depression and committed suicide at the age of 59 by filling her pockets with stones and walking into the River Ouse.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Alice Walker&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nA committed social activist, teacher, and lecturer, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/lesbianlife.about.com\/od\/artistswriterset1\/p\/Pulitzer-Prize-Winning-Author-Alice-Walker.htm\" rel=\"no follow\"&gt;Alice Walker's prolific writing career&lt;\/a&gt; spans more than four decades.

You can &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/spelling-counts-make-sure-you-use-these-words-correctly\/?sf\"&gt;switch around a few letters&lt;\/a&gt;, relocate a comma, or replace a pronoun, and you've suddenly changed the meaning of a sentence. The same principle applies to product logos. A small change can make a big \u2014 and hilarious \u2014 difference. Here is a short list of some side-splittingly funny product knock-offs from around the world.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Sunbucks Coffee&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nRealistically, the name Sunbucks\u00a0makes more sense for a coffee shop than Starbucks, right? After all, more people drink coffee in the morning than they do at night. Sunbucks in China serves up coffee under a logo\u00a0like\u00a0Starbucks, but instead of the goddess Siren as their logo, they use a crazy-looking dog.\r\n\r\nAs if Sunbucks isn't enough, Bucksstar is another Starbucks knock-off in the Middle Kingdom.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;KicKer Candy Bars&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Give me a break. Break me off a piece of that KicKer bar.\" &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/en.rocketnews24.com\/2012\/12\/24\/obama-fried-chicken-ridiculous-knockoff-goods-from-china\/\"&gt;KicKer bars&lt;\/a&gt; are basically KitKats; they're chocolately deliciousness draped over thin, crispy wafers. Of course, the name \"KicKer\" might make the candy sound more like a punishment \u2014 or a cocktail \u2014 than a sugary treat, but, hey, why not just go with it?\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Arm and Hatchet Baking Soda&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/kafka4prez\/2348899252\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12417\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Untitled4-308x410.png\" alt=\"baking soda, brand names, knock-offs, misspelling\" width=\"308\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can use baking soda for all sorts of things; use it to clean your house, do your laundry, or brighten up your smile. Sure, you could go with the classic Arm and Hammer baking soda, but &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mainstreet.com\/slideshow\/funniest-product-knockoffs\/page\/3\"&gt;Arm and Hatchet&lt;\/a&gt; sounds a little more powerful, doesn't it? The products are the same, but the labels and the pictures are different. Arm and Hatchet's logo features \u2014you\u00a0guessed it\u2014a hand holding a small axe instead of a hammer.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;ABCIDS Athletic Wear&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nAdidas is an icon in the sports world, so it makes sense that someone would try to capitalize on the brand's popularity by creating products with a similar image and font but with a different brand name. Some claim that \"ADIDAS\" is an acronym for \"All day I dream about sports.\" ABCIDS, however, well\u2026it kind of sounds like some sort of alphabet disease.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;WuMart: The Wal-Mart of China&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nThere's no shortage of bargains in China, and you'll find plenty of good prices at &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/22-best-knockoff-products-2009-11?op=1\"&gt;WuMart&lt;\/a&gt;. It is the same sort of business as Wal-Mart; a range of items at low prices. However, the company logos are different. WuMart has more red and they don't use a star. Their stores' signs include an English translation that calls WuMart a hypermarket, whatever that is. What does the \"Wu\" in WuMart mean? The character they use literally means \"object,\" \u00a0\"thing,\" or \"matter.\" Seems reasonable, right?\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Goojje.com \u2014 Who Needs Google, Anyway?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nThe only way to use Google in China is via a VPN. Naturally, the solution is to create a knock-off version of Google known as Goojje. Sure, the scope of Goojje's services don't really compare to the company that served as the inspiration behind the copy, but you have to give Goojje's creators credit for seeking to fill a consumer want.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;S&amp;M's Chocolate Candies&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile this product might sound like something that belongs in \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" S&amp;M's are actually just a knock-off of good old M&amp;M's. Hopefully they taste better than their ill-thought-out name implies. Maybe they're the perfect treat for date night!\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/funny-phrases-the-hair-of-the-dog\/\"&gt;Funny phrases&lt;\/a&gt; and intentional misspellings make for some of the most laughable products out there. While you might never visit a WuMart or wake up with Sunbucks coffee, it is still amusing to know that shameless imitation is around to keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive.

If you\u2019re a grammar lover, maybe you\u2019ve found yourself fighting the urge to correct a misspelled menu item at a restaurant. Perhaps you\u2019ve even corrected a \u201cwho\u201d to a \u201cwhom\u201d when your friend used the wrong word in a story.   \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to grammar correction and education, where is the line between agitating and helping? As grammar lovers, our intentions are often good. We care about language and communication, and we want to make sure people are understood clearly. However, grammar lovers too often overstep the boundaries of appropriate correction.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a tip: Whenever you feel the urge to correct someone\u2019s grammar, take a step back and ask yourself: does this person want to be corrected? If the answer is no, or even just maybe,  keep your knowledge to yourself. Sometimes it\u2019s hard, especially if an error is repeated over and over again. But remember that an essential part of good communication is building good relationships, and correcting people\u2019s grammar without asking often hurts relationships rather than helping them.\r\n\r\nInstead of correcting others\u2019 grammar, try modeling good grammar in your own spoken and written communication. If people see and hear that you know how to construct a sentence correctly, they might reach out to you with questions about their grammar, spelling, and punctuation. These are your opportunities for education, not the moments when people make mistakes.\r\n\r\nAbove all, remember that communication\u2014correctly formatted or not\u2014is all about understanding. Give a little grace when it comes to grammar mistakes, and you\u2019ll find that your communication improves overall.","post_title":"Correcting People's Grammar: Just Don't Do It","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"correcting-peoples-grammar-just-dont-do-it","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-06-07 06:07:28","post_modified_gmt":"2015-06-07 13:07:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=14631","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":14627,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-06-03 08:01:25","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-03 15:01:25","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14705\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/cry-wolf.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;Cry wolf&quot; does not mean &quot;cry, wolf.&quot; \" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThese idioms about animals are the cat\u2019s meow.

From early nursery rhymes to contemporary tales, cats are omnipresent stars and sidekicks. To celebrate Adopt-a-Cat month in June, here are five famous cats that feature prominently in some &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/all-romance-no-grammar-lessons-we-can-learn-from-great-works-of-literature\/\"&gt;much-loved books&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Cat in the Hat&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/jdhancock\/5190887407\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12411\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Untitled3.png\" alt=\"cat, cats in literature, Grammarly\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nOne of the best-known title characters in children's literature, readers can easily identify the &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/childrens-books-site\/2014\/jan\/30\/pip-jones-top-10-cats-fiction\"&gt;Cat in the Hat&lt;\/a&gt; by his elongated body, striped hat, and red bow tie. In Dr. Seuss's story, the Cat is notorious for pushing boundaries and questioning the limits of his young charges while their parents are away. As a children's book, \"The Cat in the Hat\" tests readers' limits as well as their reading skills. Though this story is provocative, it's also a reading primer that's one of the best-selling children's books of all time.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Puss in Boots&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.thegreatcat.org\/origins-story-puss-boots\/\"&gt;Puss in Boots&lt;\/a&gt;, a classic fairy tale and now an animated movie, has its roots in a 16th-century fable by Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola. A 17th-century version of the story appeared in the first version of Mother Goose tales, making \"Puss in Boots\" one of the first nursery rhymes. Its basic premise focuses on the well-dressed cat prompting trickery and deceit to ensure riches and success for his undeserving master. The original story's emphasis on lying to get ahead has been adapted and downright ignored in later adaptations of the tale.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Cheshire Cat&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/flavorwire.com\/397030\/10-great-books-starring-cats\/3\"&gt;Cheshire Cat&lt;\/a&gt;, who appears in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland,\" is best known for his distinctive smile. In the story, this character can appear and disappear as he pleases, dissolving into nothing but a mischievous grin once he's had his say. This motif also appears in a carving in a 16th-century English church, believed to be the inspiration for Carroll's character. Though the cat has a knack\u00a0for volunteering sage advice amidst confusion, he offers puzzling chatter and mystical sayings almost as often. Nevertheless, the Cheshire Cat represents a pleasantly sane character in a bizarre world.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Mrs. Norris&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis feline character in the \"Harry Potter\" series has a supporting role as the pet of Argus Filch, the unpopular caretaker of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A true sidekick, &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.scholastic.com\/browse\/article.jsp?id=5802\"&gt;Mrs. Norris&lt;\/a&gt; is known to have a strong connection with Filch, and even looks like him, with a scrawny build, yellow eyes, and gray fur. Mrs. Norris acts as an excellent spy and even a tattletale at times, alerting her master to unusual events on the school grounds. Throughout the series, the title character and his classmates survive narrow escapes from the sneaky cat, whom they believe can see them even when they're wearing an invisibility cloak.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Richard Parker&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nA big cat in the contemporary novel \"Life of Pi,\" Richard Parker co-stars as the Bengal tiger who accompanies the title character throughout the story. The tiger's name is somewhat of an inside joke, as it appears to be the result of improperly completed paperwork. Despite the mismatch, the name sticks as the story develops. Though the two characters aren't friends at the beginning of the novel, they learn to coexist with one another after surviving a sunken ship and a series of struggles on a lifeboat.

However, it isn't all roses with email. If you don't use the proper etiquette, you can end up annoying your recipients. You've probably already heard the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/navigating-email-etiquette-at-work\/\"&gt;basic email etiquette tips&lt;\/a&gt;, like use a specific subject line and reply as quickly as you can, but there is more you can do to ensure that your emails resonate with\u00a0the people you send them to.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Don't Be Sorry to Bother Someone&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen you start an email with, \"&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.businesswritingblog.com\/business_writing\/2012\/05\/surprising-reaction-to-sorry-to-bother-you-.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;sorry to bother you&lt;\/a&gt;,\" chances are that the recipient already feels bothered by that opening line. Those four words take seconds to read, seconds that the person could have used to find out the real point of your email. Furthermore, if you are sending a business email, you should never apologize for asking someone to do their job. You want to be polite, not obsequious.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Be Small-Screen-Friendly&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/ilamont\/4329363938\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12475\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Untitled8.png\" alt=\"cell phone, mobile, Grammarly\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nEmail is not the exclusive realm of desktop computers and laptops. People are always on the go, and they read their emails on mobile phones and tablets. It isn't easy to read long blocks of text on a tiny screen. Keep that in mind when you're composing your messages. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.feminiya.com\/10-tips-for-perfecting-your-email-etiquettes\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Keep your paragraphs short&lt;\/a&gt; and your message brief. If you must send a longer message, give a succinct summary near the beginning of the email so the recipient knows what's in store and can go back to read the rest later.\r\n\r\nAlso, think about the font you use. Some artsy fonts may look fabulous on a computer screen, but they could strain the eyes on a mobile screen.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Think Before You CC&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nA &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/communication\/following-email-etiquette.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;blogger for Lifehack&lt;\/a&gt; gives a personal experience with CC'ed emails: \"I'd say about 90% of messages I've received where I'm not in the To: field but the CC: field were completely and totally useless to me.\" Indeed, oftentimes those emails, intended to keep people in the loop, just end up being irritating white noise in the inbox.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean you should never CC anyone, but you should carefully consider who exactly needs the information you're about to send.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Use BCC for Bulk Mail&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWant to use email to invite the universe to your upcoming party? Maybe you want to share your vacation photos with a long list of people. Whatever reason you're sending out email in bulk, don't paste a novel-length block of email addresses at the top of a message. BCC everyone in your list. This also respects the privacy of your recipients, which is especially helpful if everyone who receives the email doesn't know each other.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Do Not Overload on Cuteness&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nFancy graphics and fonts do not look good on all browsers and devices and can make an email difficult to read. If you cannot resist the urge to embellish, use small adorable touches that add character but don't overwhelm a message.\r\n\r\nAlong the same lines, if you are sending photographs, it's better to send them as an attachment rather than in the body of an email, so the email itself doesn't take a billion years to load.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Stick to Your Grammar Guns&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nEmail is not as formal as a handwritten letter, but you should still &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.womansday.com\/relationships\/family-friends\/advice\/a3573\/8-rules-of-email-etiquette-68969\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;respect the English language&lt;\/a&gt;. Capitalize when needed, use punctuation, and give all your emails a read-through before you hit the send button. This applies to both business and personal emails.\r\n\r\nEmail isn't complicated, but there are some rules you need to follow to get the most out of it.

While we can\u2019t tell you what the next steps on life\u2019s journey should be, we can certainly clear up any confusion around the second question.

But what does the interrobang do?\r\n\r\nThe &lt;strong&gt;interrobang&lt;\/strong&gt; combines the question mark (?) and the exclamation point (!) into a single punctuation mark. It conveys a question asked in an excited way. For example:\r\nAre you really coming over to my house on Friday?!\r\nYou can\u2019t be serious! You\u2019ve never seen an episode of Friends?!\r\nHe said what?!\r\n\r\nAlthough writers have used punctuation marks in combination in their writing for years, the interrobang was officially created by advertising executive Martin Speckter in 1962. \r\n\r\nMany typefaces don\u2019t include the interrobang with the superimposed question mark and exclamation point.

Whether you love the red pen or hate it with a passion, your first draft will require some polishing. The trick is to write prose that's brilliant yet brief, colorful yet concise. Here are five tips for writing concisely.\r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/always-cut-it-out.1.jpg\" alt=\"always cut it out\" width=\"600 height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14649\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Cut Weasel Words&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nEven the best writers fall prey to weasel words. These pesky critters sneak into your writing, take up space, and\u00a0contribute nothing. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2013\/mistake-of-the-month-unnecessary-modifiers\/\"&gt;Common weasel words&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0include the\u00a0following:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Really&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Basically&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Actually&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Very&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;More&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nThey often attack in groups. Consider these weasely phrases:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"The vast majority . . .\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"Studies suggest that . . .\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"Some would argue that . . .\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nAfter you write a draft, take time to banish all weasel words back to the wilderness\u00a0where they belong.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Axe Redundancy&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhy do something twice if you only need to do it once? Redundant phrases clutter your writing and\u00a0hinder its flow.\r\n\r\nConsider the sentence: \"I love the blue color of her eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blue color\" is redundant. Your reader already understands that blue is a color. \"I love her blue eyes\" is\u00a0more concise.\r\n\r\nAnother example: \"The reason I'm reading this is because I love writing.\"\r\n\r\nYou don't need the word \"reason\" and the word \"because\" in the same sentence. One implies the\u00a0other. \"I'm reading this because I love writing\" conveys your point with fewer words; it's more\u00a0concise.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate Transitional Words and Phrases&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTransitional words and phrases unify ideas and make your writing easy to understand. Without them,\u00a0your prose can come off as choppy and directionless.\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Transitional words like &lt;i&gt;however&lt;\/i, &lt;i&gt;nevertheless&lt;\/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;conversely &lt;\/i&gt;pave the way toward your next idea.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Transitional phrases like&lt;i&gt; for example&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;as shown by&lt;\/i&gt; help readers understand that you're clarifying an argument.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nNext time you write, try to incorporate\u00a0one or more &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/organization-and-development\/organizing-and-developing-your-ideas\/4\/transitional-words-and-phrases\/\"&gt;transitional words or phrases&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0to improve cohesion.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Go Easy on the Adverbs&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/cellardoorfilms\/7634010748\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12469\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Untitled7.png\" alt=\"red pen, Grammarly\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nSome writers resist adverbs the way a cat resists a leash. The grammar gods won't strike you down if you insert an &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.brainpickings.org\/2013\/03\/13\/stephen-king-on-adverbs\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;adverb&lt;\/a&gt; here or there, but before you do, read these two sentences:\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Adverbs aren't horribly bad, but they're usually not needed.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Your writing will be more concise if you avoid adverbs.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\nWhich sentence packs more of a punch? The one without adverbs \u2013 number two. Words that end in\r\n\"ly\" are often just &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/how-to-eliminate-adverbs\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;careless intensifiers&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0that add no real meaning. Vivid writing shows the reader a picture; it doesn't\r\ntell the reader what to think.\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"I broke my diet again!\" Betty wailed sadly.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"I broke my diet again!\" Betty wailed, wiping salty chocolate tears from the corners of her mouth.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nThe second example includes no adverbs, and it creates a clearer picture in the reader's mind than the first. We see the salty chocolate crumbs on\u00a0Betty's lips, and we feel her bittersweet anguish.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Skip \"There is\" and \"There are\"&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nYou could be the most energetic person on earth, but writing \"There is\" or \"There are\" makes you look lazy. Consider rearranging your sentence parts when these &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/owl.english.purdue.edu\/owl\/owlprint\/539\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;passive&lt;\/a&gt; pairings pop up in your writing.\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"There are lots of people in this world who love bumpy cake\" becomes \"People around the world love bumpy cake.\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"There is a stink bug in every room of my house\" becomes \"Stink bugs have descended upon every room of my house.\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nPlenty of writers, both amateur and professional, start their sentences with \"There is\" and \"There are.\"\u00a0You needn't be one of them.\r\n\r\nStephen King said, \"To write is human. To edit is divine.\" So the next time you find yourself wrestling with a few extra words, just remember: you're in excellent company.

No matter which version of the story you prefer, the great thing about book-to-movie adaptations is that you can enjoy the story twice: once on the page and again on the screen. Here are three young adult series we recommend you read before you see their on-screen counterparts:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Divergent&lt;\/i&gt; series by Veronica Roth&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn the film version of &lt;i&gt;Divergent&lt;\/i&gt;, the first book in the trilogy by Veronica Roth, Shailene Woodley does a wonderful job of conveying protagonist Tris Prior\u2019s determination and bravery as the world around her changes into something she barely recognizes. The movie keeps all the essential scenes from the book, but as movies often do, it compresses some of the relationships and plotlines that are more deeply developed in the novel. For this reason, pick up a copy of &lt;i&gt;Divergent&lt;\/i&gt; and give it a chance before you watch the movie. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;\/i&gt; series by Suzanne Collins&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThere\u2019s no denying that Jennifer Lawrence embodies the character of Katniss Everdeen on screen. But there\u2019s one character who gets a lot more development in the book series, particularly the first book, than in the movies: Gale, Katniss\u2019s best friend. In order to feel the true tension of the Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle, you must get to know Gale better. And to get to know Gale better, you must read the books.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Chaos Walking&lt;\/i&gt; series by Patrick Ness&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe most obvious reason you should read the &lt;i&gt;Chaos Walking&lt;\/i&gt; series before watching the movies is that the movies haven\u2019t been released yet! This young adult sci-fi series is set in a world where humans can hear each other\u2019s thoughts, which makes for a very loud and often chaotic society. It also makes the writing creative and colorful, which is why the book is worth a read before the movie makes it to the big screen. \r\n\r\nWhich book-to-movie adaptation is your favorite?

In many cases, you can quickly bypass the information that comes before a colon and simply focus on what\u2019s written after it. For example:\r\nI have one thing to say: I love you.\r\n\r\nColons can also be used to present a list. For example:\r\nI wrote my grocery list this morning: olive oil, tomatoes, pasta, and cheese.\r\n\r\nAn independent clause is followed by a colon if the dependent clause is directly related to the independent clause. The dependent clause should clarify or give more information about the independent clause. For example:\r\nTake some leftovers with you: pasta salad or chicken or whatever you like.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need to capitalize the beginning of the dependent clause after the colon unless it begins with a proper noun or an acronym, or it\u2019s a quote that originally began with a capital letter.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other uses for colons, such as:\r\nSeparating hours, minutes, and seconds:\r\n9:15 a.m.\r\n\r\nSeparating chapters and verses or acts and scenes in literature:\r\nJohn 3:16\r\n\r\nSeparating the speaker\u2019s name from a line of dialogue in a play or film:\r\nRayna: I love you, Deacon.\r\n\r\nAfter the salutation in a business letter:\r\nTo whom it may concern:\r\n\r\nTo learn more about punctuation, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/three-things-you-need-to-know-about-semicolons\/\"&gt;read this blog post about semicolons&lt;\/a&gt;.

Tolkien&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nNothing solidifies friendships quite like an epic adventure.

Ever hit \"reply all\" and sprayed a private message to a group of co-workers and lived to regret it?\r\n\r\nWriting internal business communications shouldn't be &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/email-presents-major-challenge\/\"&gt;fraught with peril&lt;\/a&gt;, but for these unfortunate executives, things went terribly wrong. From the ridiculous to the tragic, take a look at these five truly terrible business memos.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Western Union Internal Memo&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/nostri-imago\/3407786186\/sizes\/l\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12399\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Untitled1.png\" alt=\"Western Union, Grammarly\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nGo back in time to 1876 for the first example of a really ridiculous internal memo (in hindsight). Western Union had a monopoly on fast communication; the telephone had just been invented in March of that year. In a bad move of epic proportions, the business executives at Western Union circulated a memo insisting that the telephone would not be a threat to its business. In part, the memo read,\u00a0&lt;em&gt;\"&lt;\/em&gt;This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication.\"\r\n\r\nHow did that work out for Western Union? Ask yourself the last time you or anyone you know received a telegram. Enough said.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Greg McKay's Mumbling Memo&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nYou probably don't know who &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.azcentral.com\/story\/opinion\/editorial\/2015\/02\/12\/greg-mckay-memo\/23316911\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Greg McKay&lt;\/a&gt; is, but he's infamous at the Arizona Department of Child Safety. After Governor Ducey appointed Greg McKay to head the department, McKay sent his employees a memo that managed to be meandering, vainglorious, self-righteous, and insulting all at the same time. Check out these awesome quotes:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"I will begin by announcing I am not worthy of this position. In fact, no one man or woman could fulfill this endeavor.\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"Any projects or pilots that lead our staff down a path of potential lawbreaking will stop now.\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;\"Please do not be afraid and know that all things done in good faith will be tolerated.\"&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Law Firm's Diversity Memo&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nDiversity in the workplace is an admirable goal and the writers of this &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/madamenoire.com\/424197\/invite-attorney-another-race-coffee-lunch-diversity-memo-gone-wrong\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;internal communication&lt;\/a&gt; should be commended for working to achieve that goal. But things went\u00a0downhill quickly. The memo encourages other employees to engage in activities with \"diverse hires\" to make them feel more welcome. The writer suggests some swell ideas: a 20-minute chat, a lunch invite, or even an invitation to a non-work event.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good\u2014and then the hammer drops. Employees are required to record and verify their activities with the HR department to prove they remain\u00a0compliant\u00a0with the new \"inclusivity policy.\" How's that for creating a warm and inclusive workplace?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft's Layoff Memo&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nMicrosoft boss, Stephen Elop, decided the best way to notify employees their jobs were on the line was with a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/nymag.com\/daily\/intelligencer\/2014\/07\/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-with-bad-memo.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;mass memo&lt;\/a&gt;. Nothing revolutionary there, even though many would argue a more personal approach. Elop, however, badly mangled the job. The memo, which went out to 12,500 Microsoft employees, opened with a jocular \"Hello there,\" before &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/make-your-writing-clearer-6-tips-for-re-wording-sentencesa\/?lf\"&gt;rambling on&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0for 14 paragraphs about Microsoft's role, goals, and future plans. The hapless employees had to read through 10 paragraphs before they hit the key bit\u2014notice of the layoff finally appears in paragraph 11.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Aviva Termination Memo&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter UK-based insurance company Aviva Investors fired an employee, the HR department &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/web\/when-email-goes-wrong-uk-company-mistakenly-dismisses-entire-workforce-in-memo-mix-up\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;prepared a memo&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0for the unlucky worker with instructions for leaving the building. The memo included guidelines for turning over all company property and security passes and urged quick compliance. Unfortunately, the HR staffer sent that memo to the company's entire 1,300-member global workforce. It took over 30 minutes for the company to realize its error and send another &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/navigating-email-etiquette-at-work\/\"&gt;mass email&lt;\/a&gt; explaining the mistake.\r\n\r\nSo, what did we learn about writing effective memos from the examples above? Don't use your memo to predict the future; be concise; be kind; get to the point; and know your audience.\u00a0Easy, right?\r\n\r\nMay 21 is National Memo Day!

For readers, the short story is the perfect literary snack, a choice morsel that fills a spare hour, refreshes the brain, and gives a moment of escape from daily routines. When you need something to nibble and lack the time for a novel, feast your eyes on these tiny tomes with outsized impact.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;For Esme--with Love and Squalor&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/42931449@N07\/6092122923\/sizes\/l\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12051\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled111-547x410.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by photosteve101\" width=\"547\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nNo list of short stories would be complete without the work of JD Salinger and \"For Esme\" is one of his finest. First published in 1950 in\"The New Yorker\" and anthologized two years later, the story takes place in England during World War II and involves a soldier who meets an adolescent girl during a church visit in Devon. A year later, the soldier suffers a nervous breakdown in the weeks following V-E Day, but a letter from Esme, the young lady, inspires his recovery. This\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/figurative-language-5-tools-to-spice-up-your-writing\/\"&gt;beautifully written&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0story sings with a message of redemption.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Harrison Bergeron&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen life hands you lemons, why not wallow in a deeply &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/how-do-you-tell-if-something-is-true\"&gt;satirical&lt;\/a&gt; critique of authoritarian dystopia? This story, published in Kurt Vonnegut's \"Welcome to the Monkey House\" collection, is set in the year 2081 and features a society in which everyone is \"handicapped\" by the government to ensure equality among all. The beautiful must wear masks; the intelligent, a headset that blasts shrill sounds to interrupt their thinking. Harrison, the protagonist, rebels against the Handicapper General and attempts to overthrow the tyrannical government. The dark humor and tight journalistic style make this an easy, if somewhat disturbing, read.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Three Questions&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTolstoy is the recognized master of epic &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2013\/writing-great-american-novel-top-three-mistakes-youll-make\/\"&gt;novels&lt;\/a&gt;, but few appreciate his skill with the short story. This story was first published in 1885 and is written in parable form. A king seeks answers to the three questions he considers most important in life and after receiving inadequate responses from the educated men in his kingdom, he looks to a wise hermit in a neighboring village. In an &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/irony-0\"&gt;ironic twist&lt;\/a&gt;, the king learns the answers to his questions as he helps the hermit care for a severely wounded man who shows up at the hermit's hut. This story is classic for its timeless answers and masterful way they are revealed.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;A Man From the South&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis Roald Dahl masterpiece was published in 1948 in \"Collier's Magazine\" and was adapted for film in a 1960 episode of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" starring Steve McQueen. In the story, Carlos, an old man, offers a young American his gorgeous green Cadillac if he can light his lighter 10 times in a row. The catch, however, is that if he cannot, the old man will chop off the Gambler's finger. The story involves a mysterious woman, a zinger of a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com\/?s=plot+twist\"&gt;plot twist&lt;\/a&gt;, and an unexpected ending, just the thing to perk up a tired brain.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this 1953 story, Flannery O'Connor tells the tale of a manipulative grandmother and her son, his wife, and his children who encounter a dangerous escaped criminal after their car overturns on a journey from Georgia to Florida. It is a stunning and disturbing story that deals with universal themes of cowardice, selfishness, redemption, and grace -- and coming to terms with a person's true self. The controversial final scene is the subject of endless scholarly debate and will be indelibly stamped in your brain once you've read it.\r\n\r\nNext time you need a quick refresher for a tired brain, pick up an anthology of short stories and curl up on the couch for an empowering hour of literary diversion.

Some of the world\u2019s greatest treasures and most valuable art are housed in museums, but you can also find smaller museums that cater to nearly every taste and interest. Here are five museums literature lovers might want to visit:\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.monroecountymuseum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monroe County Museum in Alabama&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\nLocated just down the street from the childhood home of Harper Lee, the author of the famous novel To Kill a Mockingbird, the Monroe County Museum is the home of the famous courtroom in which part of the novel was set. The museum offers school field trip tours and teacher workshops about the history and context of the novel. It is also open to the public. \r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.poemuseum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Museum of Edgar Allan Poe in Virginia &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\nTake a spooky trip to the Museum of Edgar Allan Poe, which features some of the writer\u2019s letters and personal items, as well as first editions of some of his works. If you\u2019re a real Poe fan, you can even book your wedding at the museum and, as the website says, \u201clive happily evermore.\u201d \r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.matchstickmarvels.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matchstick Marvels Tourist Center in Iowa&lt;\/strong&gt;  &lt;\/a&gt;\r\nThis quirky museum features models of famous buildings, modes of transportation, and more made out of (you guessed it) matchsticks! Matchstick Marvels features something special for literary fans: a model of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling made from 600,000 matchsticks. You\u2019ll have to see it to believe it.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Steinbeck_Center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;The National Steinbeck Center in California&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nFans of The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden will love the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, California. In addition to housing archives of the author\u2019s work, the museum also provides information about American agricultural workers, around whose experiences many of Steinbeck\u2019s novels are centered. \r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.waltwhitman.org\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Walt Whitman Birthplace State Historic Site and Interpretive Center&lt;\/strong&gt;  &lt;\/a&gt;\r\nYou know you\u2019ve really made it when your childhood home is declared a historic site. The poet Walt Whitman\u2019s home is now a hot spot on the map and is dedicated to literacy and writing. The Center hosts writing workshops, poetry readings, and informational tours. \r\n\r\nDo lovers of the written word flock to a museum in your state or country? Share the details in the comments!

It seems as if everyone, at one time or another, needs help with grammar. As Grammar Girl\u2019s assistant, I\u2019m lucky enough to help people find the answers to their grammar questions sent in by e-mail, whether it\u2019s how to remember &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/affect-versus-effect\"&gt;\u201caffect\u201d or \u201ceffect,\u201d&lt;\/a&gt; or how to use the &lt;a rel=\"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/how-to-use-semicolons\"&gt;semicolon&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\nWe get a lot of the same grammar questions, and we also get tons of tips and podcast ideas straight from the e-mail we receive. Mignon and I work as a team to make sure we provide the right, or best, answers to people\u2019s questions, and whenever I run into a particularly challenging or difficult question, I send it to Mignon.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, there isn\u2019t an answer. This is frustrating not only for me, but for the person who asked the question. A popular and frustrating question people ask is why we say \u201cthe Eiffel Tower,\u201d but we don\u2019t say, \u201cthe Buckingham Palace,\u201d or why we say \u201cI\u2019m going to church,\u201d but not \u201cI\u2019m going to museum.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is frustrating because we can tell you the answer to your specific question, and we can give you some guidelines about when to use &lt;a rel= \"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/when-to-use-articles-before-nouns\"&gt;determiners&lt;\/a&gt; (\u201ca,\u201d \u201cthe\u201d), but we can\u2019t answer the question people want, which is \u201cWhy? Why do you need a determiner with countable singular nouns but not proper nouns?\u201d Often people want the answer to that \u201cWhy?\u201d question, and there isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s just one of the many examples of English\u2019s complexity, complications, and confusion.\r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Ashley-Dodge-Partner-.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Dodge Grammar Girl Post Quotation\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14309\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nTo support or find my answers to grammar e-mail, I start with Grammar Girl, of course! I search the &lt;a rel= \"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/grammar-girl\"&gt;Grammar Girl&lt;\/a&gt; website, newsletters, and books. If I can\u2019t find what I\u2019m looking for in any of those sources, I do a Google search; search the dictionary; look through &lt;i&gt;Garner\u2019s Modern American Usage&lt;\/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;Chicago Manual of Style&lt;\/i&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;AP Stylebook&lt;\/i&gt;, grammar blogs, books, or websites such as &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\"&gt;Grammarly&lt;\/a&gt;; or search &lt;a rel= \"no follow\" href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/ngrams\"&gt;Google Ngram&lt;\/a&gt;, which shows how often words or phrases are used in published books.\r\n\r\nThe latter source is fascinating and many people don\u2019t know it exists. Grammar Girl has &lt;a rel= \"no follow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/google-ngram-and-impact-as-a-verb\"&gt;written&lt;\/a&gt; about it, and when I use Google Ngram to support or find my answer, this is usually the first time people have heard of it.\r\n\r\nYou might think responding to grammar questions would be easy, but sometimes it\u2019s difficult to craft a polite response to someone who, let\u2019s say, has had an ongoing debate about a specific grammar issue, and the side the writer has chosen is wrong. People don\u2019t like to hear that they\u2019re wrong or are going to lose a bet. I always try to keep a friendly, conversational tone. Mignon wants to provide a comfortable, supportive, and friendly place where you don\u2019t have to worry about us making a comment if you make a grammar mistake. That\u2019s what I try to create.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the best part about answering grammar e-mail? It\u2019s rewarding to know you\u2019re helping people.

Whether you think it\u2019s acceptable or should be completely avoided, it\u2019s important to understand what passive voice is and how it\u2019s used. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Passive voice&lt;\/i&gt; occurs when the object of the action in the sentence becomes the subject of the sentence. The opposite of passive voice is &lt;i&gt;active voice&lt;\/i&gt;, in which the subject simply performs the action. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\nLayla threw the ball. (Active voice)\r\nThe ball was thrown by Layla. (Passive voice)\r\n\r\nWe corrected the errors. (Active voice)\r\nThe errors have been corrected. (Passive voice)\r\n\r\nSomeone took the last piece of cake. (Active voice)\r\nThe last piece of cake was taken. (Passive voice)\r\n\r\nActive voice tends to give writing more clarity, which is why many people prefer it. Writing in passive voice can be confusing, vague, and wordy; however, there are instances in which it\u2019s a better option than active voice. For example:\r\n\r\nIncidents of inappropriate behavior were reported. (Passive voice)\r\n\r\nIn this case, the focus of the sentence should be on the incidents, not on the people who reported them. In fact, there are situations in which the subject of the sentence might be unknown or unimportant. In those cases, sometimes using passive voice is preferable to using \u201csomeone\u201d as the subject. Another example:\r\n\r\nThe test results were delivered late in the afternoon. (Passive voice)\r\n\r\nAs in the sentence above, the focus of the sentence is on the test results rather than the person who delivered them.\r\n\r\nDo you have an opinion about passive voice?

How are you celebrating? Breakfast in bed? A handmade card? For many people, an even bigger question than what to do for Mother\u2019s Day is where to place the apostrophe in Mother\u2019s Day.\r\n\r\nSome people write \u201cMothers\u2019 Day,\u201d based on the logic that it is the day to celebrate all mothers. Others simply write \u201cMothers Day,\u201d leaving out the apostrophe altogether possibly because they\u2019re unsure of where to place it.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;The correct placement of the apostrophe is this: Mother\u2019s Day.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nAnna Jarvis, who first celebrated Mother\u2019s Day in 1908, specifically wanted Mother\u2019s to be singular possessive.

Buying Mom a blouse at the mall might be convenient, but creating a heartfelt gift with your own hands means more.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/mother-blog-posts\/\"&gt;Mother's Day&lt;\/a&gt; is May 10. Check out these five creative ways to help Mom understand just what she means on her special day.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Make a Homemade Craft &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nMaybe\u00a0in grade school you crafted a fruit bowl or papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture for Mother's Day. You can still make her something with your own hands. Not artistic? Not a problem. Check out these craft ideas:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Make her a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/tikkido.com\/node\/972\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;chocolate bouquet&lt;\/a&gt; using a vase, cardstock, bamboo skewers, and tape. And, of course, chocolate.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Create a personalized decoupage flower-pot using favorite family photos or floral prints. You'll need a terra-cotta pot, Mod Podge, a brush, and your choice of photos or prints.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Build a lovely\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/littlebirdiesecrets.blogspot.com\/2009\/12\/washer-necklaces.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;necklace out of a washer&lt;\/a&gt;. Apply scrapbook paper and Diamond Glaze to the washer, then adorn with a leather cord.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;If you're feeling ambitious, visit the craft store and string your own special combination of beads on an elastic band. Try to incorporate at least three different types of beads\u2014seed beads, faceted glass, chevrons, heishi discs\u2014for the best look.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Make Homemade Beauty Products&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nDoes your mother love the spa? If so, consider concocting your own version of department store beauty products at home. Whip up a handmade batch of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.marthastewart.com\/271871\/bath-fizzies\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;bath fizzes&lt;\/a&gt; by Martha Stewart, heart-shaped soaps by According to Kelly, or Neapolitan Ice Cream Body Scrub by Craftster.org. Keep Pinterest in mind, as well; this DIY site offers a never-ending supply of crafty recipes and ideas.\r\n\r\nIf making crafts isn't your cup of tea, consider using pen and paper to create something special for Mom.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Write a Story Starring the Woman Herself&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nDoes your mom enjoy reading? Do you have a flair for writing? If you answered yes to either of these questions, consider writing a story with Mom as the protagonist. True story, love story, crime story, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/6-ways-to-celebrate-tell-a-fairy-tale-day\/?lf\"&gt;fairy tale&lt;\/a&gt;, a book of poetry\u2014you decide.

Printing a book costs less than you might expect, and here at Grammarly, we offer proofreading help for free.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Assemble a Photo Collage&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/footloosiety\/5484360883\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11991\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled5.png\" alt=\"Grammarly, Mother's Day\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nPhoto collages stir warm memories and touch Mom's heart.

Whether you throw a few sentimental pics into a frame, fill an album with a visual timeline of family togetherness, or assemble your own family genealogy project, Mom will surely appreciate your efforts. So will the rest of the family.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Buy a Unique Gift&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you're short on time or creativity, consider buying a unique gift for Mom made by someone else's hands. We're not talking about that photo print you spied at Wal-Mart. We're talking about a one-of-a-kind piece of art, home decor, jewelry, or clothing.\r\n\r\nThe Internet boasts a treasure trove of online sellers with unique wares. Of course, there's always\u00a0Etsy, but consider these alternatives:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;ArtFire.com: Find homemade goods, art, and vintage products here.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;MadeItMyself.com:\u00a0Find jewelry, clothing, and unique trinkets here.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;UncommonGoods.com:\u00a0Find original artwork\u2014watercolors, acrylics, photos, posters\u2014here.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nMothers toil 365 days a year to support their children, grandchildren, and other loved ones.

While it is true that some of the most beautiful poems are also difficult to understand, poetry in general isn't that tough. By following some simple guidelines, you can pen verses that are poignant, pure, and easy on the ears.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Employ Imagery&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/pedrosimoes7\/8935913893\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12039\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled10-402x410.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by pedrosimoes7\" width=\"402\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nEvoke, don't emote. You can tell someone \"I'm sad\" a million times, but the person will have a hard time empathizing if the words don't have anything to back them up. Imagery, like &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/knowledge-is-power-using-idioms-to-give-power-to-your-writing\/\"&gt;idioms&lt;\/a&gt;, takes an abstract idea, such as an emotion, and turns it into something concrete. In the mind and heart of the reader, it goes back to being something abstract. As an exercise, try writing down all the items you can think of that you associate with a certain emotion. You could also take a walk and jot down how the sight of certain things makes you feel. Use those images in your next poem.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/organization-and-development\/text-level-measurements-adequate-writing\/6\/cliches\/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid Clich\u00e9s&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nClich\u00e9s are someone else's words. Use them, and you steal away your poetry's true potential. Clich\u00e9s might be convenient to use, and some are easy to find rhymes for, but the use of clich\u00e9s will make your readers turn away the moment they stumble upon those trite and tired truisms.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Keep the Reins on Your Rhymes&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"No more rhymes now, I mean it!\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"Anybody want a peanut?\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nVizzini from \"The Princess Bride\" may have been inconceivably mean, but he did have a valid point when he told Fezzik to stop rhyming. That isn't to say that all rhyming in poetry is bad; it has its time and place, but you should &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/grammar.yourdictionary.com\/grammar-rules-and-tips\/tips-on-writing-poems.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;never rhyme simply for the sake of it&lt;\/a&gt;. Don't sacrifice the meaning of your poem because you feel obligated to rhyme. The &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.writing.com\/main\/view_item\/item_id\/1537612-Basic-Rules-to-Writing-Poetry\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;same principles apply to metering&lt;\/a&gt;. There is something enthralling about a sonnet in perfect iambic pentameter, but only use forms like that if it truly fits what you're writing about.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Pay Attention to Form&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nEven poets who write free verse may choose to stick to a certain form. They may try to make all their lines about the same length, or they may vary the length of each line so the poem has a certain shape. You should consider those things, too. Also, think about how you use empty space in a poem. The way you present your work on paper contributes to the poem's overall message.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Don't Overdo Anything&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/education-portal.com\/academy\/lesson\/poetic-devices-definition-types-examples.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Poetic devices&lt;\/a&gt; like similes, alliteration, repetition, anapest, and onomatopoeia are a great way to add impact to your writing, but overuse can make your poem seem silly. For example, if you want to convey a serious message but start most words in your poem with the letter \"b,\" that will distract readers from what you want to say.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Bare Yourself&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nNo, poets don't have to be streakers. However, you should bear in mind that the more honest you are in your poetry, the better. As\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/freelance-writing.lovetoknow.com\/Rules_for_Writing_Poetry\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;lovetoknow.com&lt;\/a&gt; points out, \"This is probably the only rule that you should rely on all the time. If you're not honest with yourself in your poetry, no one else is going to feel anything genuine when they read your work. It can be painfully terrifying to open up and honestly express your feelings on paper, but that's the name of the game.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Learn the Rules and Break Them&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe above tips are by no means the laws of poetry. Poetry is anarchy. You can do pretty much anything you want with it. However, you should learn as much as you can about it so you can make wise decisions about how to express yourself. For example, you might discover that a sestina was the perfect way to commemorate your anniversary.\r\n\r\nAre you a poet?

Over time, people from all walks of life -- children, scholars, drunks, beggars -- have delighted in the witty limerick. Here's a brief history of five of the world's best-loved limericks.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Hickory Dickory Dock&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nHickory Dickory Dock showed up in \"&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bl.uk\/collection-items\/tommy-thumbs-pretty-song-book\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook&lt;\/a&gt;\" in 1744. The famed tale of the timepiece-dwelling mouse appeared beside\u00a0\"Bah Bah, Blacksheep\" and \"Lady Bird, Lady Bird,\" among others. No one knows for certain who penned the book, but it was one of the world's first attempts to entertain children with literature.\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"Hickory dickory dock.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;The mouse ran up the clock.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;The clock struck one,&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;And down he run.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Hickory dickory dock.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Man from Nantucket&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe Man from Nantucket serves as inspiration for limericks both dirty and pure. Perhaps you've even heard a \"Rated X\" ending to this story-starter. However, the original Nantucket limerick was quite tame. It appeared in Princeton University's humor magazine, the \"&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.tigermag.com\/about-us\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Princeton Tiger&lt;\/a&gt;,\" in 1902:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"There once was a man from Nantucket&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Who kept all his cash in a bucket.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;But his daughter, named Nan,&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Ran away with a man,&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;And as for the bucket, Nantucket.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of Geography . . . &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nPrinceton wasn't the only publisher of geographically themed limericks. Lear chose Peru as his muse at least once, as shown by the following:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"There was an Old Man of Peru&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Who watched his wife making a stew.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;But once, by mistake,&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;In a stove she did bake&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;That unfortunate Man of Peru.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nLear's story of the unlucky Peru gent blazed a path for hundreds of amateur Peru poems to come, many of which are less than chaste. Middle schoolers excel at crafting this kind of literature, from what we hear. Perhaps a Peru limerick or two lingers in your own adolescent memory.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Shakespearean Limerick&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/tonynetone\/2688212829\/sizes\/m\/\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12029\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled9-409x410.png\" alt=\"Shakespeare, limerick, Grammarly\" width=\"409\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nEven William Shakespeare practiced what some would call the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/limericks-lowest-form-poetry\/\"&gt;lowest form of poetry&lt;\/a&gt;. The following limerick about imbibing spirits appeared in \"Othello, Act II, Scene III\":\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"And let me the canakin clink, clink.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;And let me the canakin clink.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;A soldier's a man.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;A life's but a span.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Why, then, let a soldier drink.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;The Bard also used limericks in \"King Lear\"\u00a0and \"The Tempest&lt;i&gt;.\"&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Ogden Nash&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nPoet Ogden Nash coined the phrase, \"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.\" Some limerick fans insist he wrote the following limerick about a pelican:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"A wonderful bird is the pelican,&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;His bill can hold more than his beli-can.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;He can take in his beak&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Food enough for a week&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;But I'm damned if I see how the heli-can.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nThis clever verse has also been attributed to Dixon Lanier Merritt, a humorist who lived at the same time. Nash died in 1971 and Merritt in 1972.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Crafting a Limerick&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nLimericks are \"closed form\" poems that adhere to a strict template. Want to write your own? Follow these\u00a0guidelines:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;The last word in lines 1, 2, and 5 must rhyme and contain 8-9 syllables each.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;The last word in lines 3 and 4 must rhyme and contain 5-6 syllables each.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nOf course, what fun are rules unless they're broken -- or at least bent -- every once in a while? Consider this limerick by &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.smbc-comics.com\/?id=3201\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Zach Weiner&lt;\/a&gt; of the comic \"Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal,\" which coherently flows both backward and forward:\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;\"This limerick goes in reverse&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;Unless I'm remiss&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;The neat thing is this:&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;If you start from the bottom-most verse&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"&gt;This limerick's not any worse.\"&lt;\/p&gt;\r\nNow we challenge you to write your own limerick.

Here are four groups of siblings from literature we wish we were related to:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The March sisters in &lt;i&gt;Little Women&lt;\/i&gt; by Louisa May Alcott&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nMeg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March show us what true sisterhood is all about. They make up each other's worlds, acting as playmates, enemies, counselors, and friends. Like many sisters, they could be arguing over a pair of shoes one minute and bonding over a family tragedy the next. I\u2019d act out a play in the attic with the March sisters any day.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Weasley siblings in the &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;\/i&gt; series by J.K. Rowling&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nGinny, Ron, Fred, George, Percy, Charlie, and Bill weren\u2019t always on the best terms (ahem, Percy\u2019s stint in the Ministry of Magic), but in the end, they have each other\u2019s backs. Rowling paints a noisy, cozy picture of the Weasley household in the &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;\/i&gt; series, with Fred and George teasing their siblings constantly and Mrs. Weasley riding the line between total exasperation and complete control. The Weasleys are wild, but in a fight against Voldemort, you couldn\u2019t ask for anyone better on your team.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Marianne and Elinor Dashwood in &lt;i&gt;Sense and Sensibility&lt;\/i&gt; by Jane Austen&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn matters of the heart, Marianne and Elinor don\u2019t always see eye to eye. In a way, their very different perspectives end up bringing them closer together. Marianne and Elinor\u2019s relationship mirrors what many siblings go through as they grow up together: establishing an understanding of who your siblings are and respecting them, even if they\u2019re very different from the way you want them to be. If I had to move to a cozy cottage in the country, I\u2019d want the Dashwood sisters with me to add both sense and sensibility.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Alden siblings in the &lt;i&gt;Boxcar Children&lt;\/i&gt; series by Gertrude Chandler Warner&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nHenry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny Alden know how to sniff out a mystery...and how to solve it, too. Adopted by their kind, wealthy grandfather, the Alden siblings are free to solve mysteries, have adventures, and generally explore the world to their hearts\u2019 content. If you slid open the door of an abandoned boxcar and found these kids, it would be a pleasant surprise.  \r\n\r\nWho are your favorite siblings from literature?

The Jedi master's method of speaking includes &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/rewriting-101-how-to-add-clarity-to-your-sentences\/\"&gt;quirky sentence structures&lt;\/a&gt;, unusual words, and wise phrases. Read on for some theories of Yoda-speak and a guide to talking like Yoda on your own.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Yoda's East African Roots&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/xtyler\/3215653831\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11997\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled6-410x410.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by Alex Abian\" width=\"410\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you've ever thought that Yoda's way of speaking sounds almost primeval, you're not far off. A &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2011\/10\/14\/yoda-language-study_n_1010720.html\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;language study&lt;\/a&gt; spearheaded by Stanford University focused on the unique subject-object-verb (SOV) agreement in Yoda's language. Since this structure preceded subject-verb-object (SVO) agreement, it almost certainly has roots in ancient languages. Stanford researchers determined that the structure of Yoda-speak is based on very early East African languages that influenced the development of early modern language that we know today.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Yoda's Old English Roots&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nNot only is SOV agreement prevalent in East African languages, but it appears in Old English as well. A side-by-side comparison of Yoda's statements and some of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/theweek.com\/articles\/442256\/strangely-yoda-speaks\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Shakespeare's famous lines&lt;\/a&gt; reveals similarities. Both tend to feature the subject at the beginning of the sentence and the conjugated verb at the end of the sentence. Thus, Yoda's quirky but profound English statements also borrow from its ancestor, Old English.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that even though Yoda's sentence structure may appear odd when compared with modern phrasing, his statements are still recognizable as English. Altering word order to the extent that Yoda does wouldn't be possible in many other languages, let alone understandable.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Yoda's Yiddish Roots&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIn addition to Old English and East African, linguists have also compared Yoda speak to Yiddish-influenced English, prompting interesting results. Yiddish-influenced English often plays with word order, placing verbs at the end of sentences. This frequently results in witty, whimsical phrasings, which moviegoers can also observe in Yoda's speech.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Why Yoda Speaks the Way He Does&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSome Star Wars experts point out that Yoda's sentence structure can be inconsistent. While his speech may lean toward SOV agreement, he often inserts\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/scifi.about.com\/od\/starwarsglossaryandfaq\/a\/SWAR_yoda-speak.htm\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;object-subject-verb (OSV) statements&lt;\/a&gt; into his lexicon as well. Other more rare statements reflect the SVO agreement we're used to in modern English.\r\n\r\nExperts theorize that Yoda deploys his various phrasings purposefully. Since his SOV statements tend to make him sound wise, profound, and clever, it's likely that he uses them strategically. On the rare occasion that he doesn't have an important message to deliver, he may slip back into standard modern English.\r\n\r\nAs &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/yoda-grammar\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;Grammar Girl&lt;\/a&gt; explains, though Yoda's speech is memorable, it's not completely unusual in the world of Star Wars. Many of the movie's characters are immigrants from lands far away, and their speech also includes numerous oddities. Like any immigrant, Yoda incorporates his own phrasing into the language of the land.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;How You Can Talk Like Yoda&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nYoda speak may be quirky, but it's certainly possible to imitate. To &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/star-wars\/\"&gt;talk like Yoda&lt;\/a&gt;, start by thinking of something wise to say. This can be as simple as a short, poignant statement. Next, change around the word order of your statement. Place the subject and the most important phrase first. Any negatives in your statement should go to the end.\r\n\r\nBe sure to reaffirm your statements or questions. If you're making an affirmative statement, add \"yes\" at the end. If you're asking a question, add an inquisitive \"hmm?\" at the end. Including these will help emphasize the context of your statement and provide Yoda speak newbies with the clues they need to communicate with the wise one.\r\n\r\nTry incorporating some Yoda speak into your daily life and see how well you're able to communicate with those around you. Does your language sound profound, witty, or both?","post_title":"Speak like Yoda You Can","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"speak-like-yoda-you-can","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-05-04 11:27:38","post_modified_gmt":"2015-05-04 18:27:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11995","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12001,"post_author":"4","post_date":"2015-04-30 00:00:20","post_date_gmt":"2015-04-30 07:00:20","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Blind-Mouse-670x352.jpg\" alt=\"Blind-Mouse\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14045\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nMurder, torture, mass death by plague...not exactly the stuff of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/happily-ever-after-or-not\/\"&gt;children's literature&lt;\/a&gt;, right? Actually, if you read the rhymes of Mother Goose, it is. Most people don't realize the macabre history of these innocuous-sounding rhymes, but dig beneath the surface, and you'll find Mother Goose poetry is chock-full of gruesome imagery.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many of today's nursery rhymes are sanitized versions of the grim originals. Back in the 1950s, a group of concerned citizens rallied to clean them up lest they terrify little children, a crusade similar to one today's parents wage against violent video games.\r\n\r\nIf you doubt the dark side of good Mother Goose, check out the stories behind these rhymes.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Ring Around the Rosie&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/95072945@N05\/12779343884\/sizes\/l\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12003\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled7.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by kelly.sikkema\" width=\"600\" height=\"398\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nChildren love to hold hands and chant this little &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/finding-rhyme-reason-national-poetry-month\/\"&gt;rhyme&lt;\/a&gt;, falling to the ground in a fit of giggles at the phrase, \"Ashes, ashes, we all fall down!\" What could be better than a ring of roses and a pocket full of posies? Actually, this rhyme reputedly refers\u00a0to the bubonic plague that wiped out 20 percent of the population of London in less than a year. Ring of roses? The ugly rash that heralds the disease. Pocket full of posies? To disguise the smell of sickness. Ashes, ashes? Cremated bodies. Not such a cheery children's rhyme after all.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Three Blind Mice&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis cute little ditty seems bland enough, other than the somewhat disturbing imagery of a knife-wielding farmer's wife hacking off a few rodent tails. In truth, this rhyme is about the bloody reign of England's Queen Mary I, the fierce Catholic who spent much of her time on the throne executing Protestants. The three mice in this rhyme refer to Nicholas Ridley the Bishop of London, Hugh Latimer, and Archbishop\r\nThomas Cranmer, who were burned at the stake for heresy. The blindness is a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/figurative-language-5-tools-to-spice-up-your-writing\/\"&gt;device&lt;\/a&gt; referring to their refusal to see Catholicism as the true faith.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Mary Mary Quite Contrary&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat could be more innocuous than a little agricultural advice? This sweet rhyme conjures up a garden full of blooms tended by smiling maidens surrounded by tinkling bells and cockle shells. In truth, however, this is another tribute to Bloody Mary and her murdering methods. Silver bells and cockle shells were medieval torture devices, and the garden is a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/metaphors-and-similes\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;metaphor&lt;\/a&gt; for the fast-growing graveyards that accompanied her reign.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Jack and Jill Went Up the Hill&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nReading this rhyme brings to mind a pair of laughing children merrily filling their buckets at the well and suffering a small slip as they skip down the hill. Actually, most theorists attribute the story behind this rhyme as that of France's King Louis XVI and his wife Marie-Antoinette, who were found guilty of treason and publicly beheaded by the guillotine.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;London Bridge is Falling Down&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the surface, this utterly harmless little rhyme seems to be just another story set to a tune and turned into a playground game for children. The rhyme refers to the famous bridge of stone built by Henry II in the 1100s; no one is certain of the identity of \"my fair lady.\" However, the second verse is where things get gruesome. The line \"Set a man to watch all night\" refers to the practice of embedding living human beings into bridges and foundational walls to act as a guardian spirit. In the Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, three bridges are cited where the bodies of adults or children were &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/38274\/38274-h\/38274-h.htm\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;found embedded in the walls&lt;\/a&gt;. For the record, there's no evidence any human beings were used to build the London Bridge.\r\n\r\nSo you see, old Mother Goose wasn't exactly the benign feathered scribe depicted in &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/writing\/common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-writing-a-childrens-book\" rel=\u201cnofollow\"&gt;children's books&lt;\/a&gt;.

In advance of the holiday, it's important to remember that you wouldn't be where you are today without the teachers that influenced you throughout your life. Whether your favorite educators are from elementary school, high school, or college, make sure to tell them what a positive effect they've had on your life. Here are six ways to celebrate National Teacher Day.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Write a Thoughtful Letter&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/bunchesandbits\/6354798575\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12009\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled8-410x410.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by Bunches and Bits [Karina}\" width=\"410\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nSometimes heartfelt words are the best gift a teacher can receive. Think about how significantly your favorite teacher has impacted your life\u00a0and take a minute to write down exactly how much she or he has done for you. Whether a great elementary science teacher influenced you to become the biologist you are today or a tough high school literature teacher challenged you to become the writer you are now, let that teacher know. Include the kids in this project and help them write a short but sweet note to their current favorite teacher.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Help With Classroom Chores&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen time is short, teachers can't always do everything they want to for their classrooms. Many teachers could use a helping hand with &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.ptotoday.com\/pto-today-articles\/article\/1105-teacher-appreciation-9-ways-to-celebrate\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;projects, large and small&lt;\/a&gt;. Talk with your favorite former teacher or one that the kids love and find out how you can help. Be prepared to pitch in with photocopying educational materials, hanging art projects, or taking on lunchtime duty. For many teachers, having a little extra time each week or month is the greatest gift.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Provide Lunch&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTeachers work long hours, and they don't always have time to throw together a nutritious lunch in the morning. On National Teacher Day, tell your kids' teachers that &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.educationworld.com\/a_admin\/admin\/admin162.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;lunch is on you&lt;\/a&gt;. Make lunch for a favorite teacher or partner with other parents at your kids' school to put together a lavish lunchtime spread. If each parent volunteers for one course, your gourmet meal will come together in a flash. Choose healthy foods to keep your teachers nourished throughout the day, and don't forget something sweet to finish the meal.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Volunteer in the Classroom&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nMany schools have programs that allow parents to volunteer their time in the classroom. Whether you have an hour or a whole week to give each month, volunteering your time can significantly impact how much a teacher can accomplish in the classroom. Depending on the teacher's needs, you may be able to help coordinate an educational field trip, prepare activities in the classroom, or even organize seasonal events.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, know that donating your time makes the day much smoother, more efficient, and much more fun for teachers and their students. Check with a teacher or the school's administrative staff to find out more about the school's volunteer program.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Read About Great Teachers&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.readwritethink.org\/classroom-resources\/calendar-activities\/teacher-appreciation-week-honors-20501.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;excellent books&lt;\/a&gt; about truly great teachers for every grade level. Choose an appropriate one to read with the kids and help them pick out the qualities that make a teacher truly great. Encourage them to think about which of their teachers have these qualities, and be sure to celebrate them on National Teacher Day.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Tell the Newspaper&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTeaching can feel like a thankless job, so there's no better way to celebrate National Teacher Day than to shout from the rooftops just how great your favorite teacher is. If you can't quite do that, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.nea.org\/grants\/55148.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;tell your local newspaper&lt;\/a&gt; instead. Contact the newsroom about establishing a thank you section in the paper and encourage others in your community to write a note about an educator who has made a difference in their lives.\r\n\r\nHowever you choose to celebrate, remember to give the educators who taught you the basics of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/3-punctuation-mistakes-that-can-make-you-look-like-a-cannibal\/\"&gt;punctuation&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/learn-the-difference-between-these-confusing-homophones\/\"&gt;homophones&lt;\/a&gt;, and everything in between a day of recognition. Donate your time, your cooking prowess, or your thoughtful words, and celebrate your teachers and their impact on your life.

Other forms of written and spoken communication, however, are often filled with confusing and ambiguous vocabulary. Here are four words we\u2019ve poached from the scientific world that should be adopted in non-scientific communication.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn scientific writing, an abstract summarizes the key points of a presentation or paper. Written scientific research is often lengthy, so an abstract serves as a way to let the reader know what he or she is getting into up front.\r\nMost people use the word \u201cabstract\u201d to describe art or theoretical concepts. But if you use its scientific meaning, whether you\u2019re writing a long email or a detailed list of directions, you can create an abstract that summarizes the key points.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Volume &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn our everyday lives, we often talk about volume in terms of noise. In science, volume is the amount of space occupied by an object measured in three dimensions, expressed in cubic units. Try using \u201cvolume\u201d as a more specific way of talking about how much space is available for or taken up by an object.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Hypothesis&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn the scientific world, a hypothesis is a supposition made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.\r\nIn our everyday conversation, the word \"hypothesis\" can often be substituted for the word \"idea.\" For example, if you're planning a bake sale and you base your sales projections on how many cookies and cupcakes you sold last year, you might say you have \"an idea\" of how much money you'll make this year. Since your idea is based on evidence from the year before, it's actually a hypothesis. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Conductor&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nA train conductor, a symphony conductor...we know conductors as people who orchestrate actions. In the scientific world, a conductor is a material or an object that conducts heat, electricity, light, or sound. For example, the cord between your lamp and the wall is a conductor of electricity. (Interestingly, the plastic or rubber casing around the wire acts as an insulator and the internal metal wiring is the strict conductor.) Once you know what a conductor is, you\u2019ll start seeing them everywhere! Use this word from the science world to identify the conductors around you \u2014 even in a literary sense!\r\n\r\nWhat other scientific words should be adopted for everyday use?

Or maybe you're more the screenplay type that wants to go straight to Hollywood. Whatever your writing goals are, sometimes the biggest obstacles between them and you is a nasty case of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/grammarly\/5-ways-to-find-new-story-ideas_b_6053536.html\"&gt;writer's block&lt;\/a&gt;. How can you free up your creative juices and write a story worth telling? Here are some ideas to get you started.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Go &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2013\/word-nerd\/\"&gt;Wild for Words&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nStephen King holds thesauruses (&lt;i&gt;thesauri&lt;\/i&gt; for you prescriptive Latin-lovers) in disdain, but don't be afraid to rebel against his viewpoint. Learning new and &lt;a  rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.oxforddictionaries.com\/words\/archaic-words\"&gt;archaic words&lt;\/a&gt; can help you think from a different angle; those new words can serve as the seed for your story.\r\n\r\nOne way to approach this is to find a word you like and write it in the center of a piece of paper. Use word association to create an entire web on that paper; you might be pleasantly surprised at where your thoughts take you.\r\n\r\nForeign language words might also give you a nudge in the right direction. For example, German has a word that refers specifically to the \"glad it wasn't me\"\u00a0attitude that some people take up when something bad happens to someone else. Chinese has a word that literally means \"horse horse tiger tiger\" and means \"so-so.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSometimes writers go too deep into the \"me zone\" and end up isolated. Whether you get in touch with fellow writers online, on campus, or in a local writing group, your peers might be able to give you the boost that you need. Listen to their ideas and contribute your own; you'll come up with something that neither of you could have concocted on your own. &lt;a  rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.thebookdesigner.com\/2014\/08\/21-tips-for-creating-a-successful-writing-collaboration\/\"&gt;Collaborative writing&lt;\/a&gt; is a challenge, but the rewards can be beautiful.\r\n\r\nCheck out some information on Grammarly's annual collaborative novel, GrammoWriMo, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/grammowrimo\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Write Poorly&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nGrammarly is all about helping you to improve your writing, but bad writing also has its benefits. Bad writing isn't constrained by your inner editor's madness. When you accept that you're not at your best, the words flow freely. Sure, you might throw away what you work on, but you'll have a fresh mindset.\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2013\/beaten-path-nanowrimo-writing-tips\/\"&gt;NaNoWriMo&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0is a fantastic opportunity to write poorly. Writing 50,000 words in 30 days is tough, but if you commit yourself to the goal, you'll end up with something you can take pride in\u2014even if it needs a major rewrite to make it presentable.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Play Games&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/25559122@N06\/8054926394\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-11979\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled4.png\" alt=\"Scrabble, Grammarly\" width=\"500\" height=\"389\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are endless games out there that can stimulate your thinking and get you into story mode. You can participate in &lt;a  rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http:\/\/www.languageisavirus.com\/writing-games.html\"&gt;interactive creative writing games&lt;\/a&gt; online, or you can just sit down with some Mad Libs and see what happens. Board games are a good way to get you thinking, too. Games like &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/7-awesome-and-underused-scrabble-words\/?lf&amp;utm_source=Blog_org&amp;utm_campaign=Blog_Augment_1&amp;utm_medium=text_link\"&gt;Scrabble&lt;\/a&gt;, Quelf, and Cranium will have you thinking about words\u2014and perhaps the world in general\u2014in a different light.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Go to Boot Camp&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWriting boot camps are structured events wherein there is designated time to write and be productive. There may also be lectures and other encouragement. &lt;a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https:\/\/www.insidehighered.com\/blogs\/gradhacker\/writing-boot-camps\"&gt;Participating in a boot camp&lt;\/a&gt; can help you become more goal-oriented in your writing. The people you meet at a camp will inspire you to stay focused on improving your storytelling skills.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Veg Out With Media&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSteal some ideas! Watch movies and TV shows, dive into a new book, or look at photography and other artwork. Pick out the elements that touch you and adapt them; make them your own in your next project. If you're really in love with a particular book or show, you might even try your hand at fan fiction just for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nSometimes words might pour out of you like water out of a broken faucet. At other times, you might feel like you need to call a plumber to come unclog the pipes. When the latter happens, use the above tips to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/waking-the-muse-how-to-find-inspiration\/\"&gt;find inspiration for your writing&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0and get the ideas flowing.

While some of the characters we meet in Dickens\u2019 novels are endearing heroes, others are sinister villains. Here are three Dickens characters you would never want to meet.\r\n\r\nBill Sikes in &lt;i&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nA career criminal, violent abuser, and murderer, Bill Sikes is at the top of the list of characters to avoid. This is how Dickens describes him:\r\n\u201c...a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which enclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves\u2014the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke. He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three weeks' growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow.\u201d\r\n\r\nDaniel Quilp in &lt;i&gt;The Old Curiosity Shop&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nDaniel Quilp is a sneaky manipulator who uses secrets as currency. A condescending liar, Quilp can\u2019t be trusted. If you met him on the street, it would be wise to keep your head down and walk the other way.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham in &lt;i&gt;Great Expectations&lt;\/i&gt; \r\nAlthough her cruelty stems from the deep pain of betrayal and rejection, Miss Havisham is cruel nonetheless. She meddles in both Pip and Estella\u2019s lives, encouraging love in one and brutal indifference in the other. Miss Havisham succeeds in hurting everyone close to her and ruins the lives of others as a consequence. She\u2019s destructive, manipulative, and cruel. Watch out!\r\n\r\nWhich Dickens character is your favorite villain? Let us know in the comments!

I\u2019ll never forget snuggling up next to my dad while he read a section of C.S. Lewis\u2019s &lt;i&gt;The Chronicles of Narnia&lt;\/i&gt; to my brother and me each night before bed. Here are five books and series for kids that we recommend re-reading as an adult:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Little House series&lt;\/i&gt; by Laura Ingalls Wilder&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nBased on Wilder\u2019s experiences growing up on the American frontier, the &lt;i&gt;Little House&lt;\/i&gt; series paints an intimate portrait of an exciting time in American history. Read along as Laura and her family encounter bears, battle the elements, and survive in the early American West.\r\n \r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Giving Tree&lt;\/i&gt; by Shel Silverstein &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nWhile this popular children\u2019s book is intended for young readers, adults have found inspiration within its pages, too. &lt;i&gt;The Giving Tree&lt;\/i&gt; tells the story of a boy growing up alongside a tree and the relationship of give and take between them. It\u2019s a short picture book and worth another read from an adult perspective.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;\/i&gt; by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;\/i&gt; is one of those rare children's books that captivates young readers on one level and touches the hearts of adult readers on another. On the surface, it is about a pilot who crashes his plane in the desert and encounters a strange young boy who has traveled from his home on a distant asteroid. At a deeper level, &lt;i&gt;The Little Prince&lt;\/i&gt; is a story about being present in your own life \u2014 about paying attention to everyday pleasures and making time for friends.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fantastic Mr. Fox&lt;\/i&gt; by Roald Dahl &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nMany people are familiar with Wes Anderson\u2019s movie adaptation of &lt;i&gt;Fantastic Mr. Fox&lt;\/i&gt;, but if you haven\u2019t read the book, you\u2019re missing out. Roald Dahl is the author of many other favorite children\u2019s books, including &lt;i&gt;James and the Giant Peach&lt;\/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;\/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Matilda&lt;\/i&gt;. Pick up &lt;i&gt;Fantastic Mr. Fox&lt;\/i&gt; to enjoy a fun-filled journey through the animal world.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daddy's Little Girl&lt;\/i&gt; by Peter Wilson &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Daddy\u2019s Little Girl&lt;\/i&gt; tells the story of a father\u2019s love for his daughter through the years. The book is short and sweet and guaranteed to bring a tear to most fathers\u2019 and daughters\u2019 eyes. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Which books for children do you recommend rereading as an adult?

While filing taxes can cause stress and frustration, language lovers can find some solace in these creative idioms about money. Here are three of our favorites:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Bet one\u2019s bottom dollar&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nYour \u201cbottom dollar\u201d is the last dollar you have. If you\u2019re betting your bottom dollar, you\u2019re probably very sure that what you\u2019re betting on will turn out the way you think it will. Use of this phrase dates back to the mid-1800s.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Cost an arm and a leg&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIt might seem like a simple explanation, but this phrase likely became popular because arms and legs are very precious. You would think twice about purchasing something if it cost you your arm or your leg! According to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/56017\/10-wacky-whoppers-about-origins-popular-18th-century-phrases\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Mentalfloss&lt;\/a&gt;, use of the related phrase, \u201cI\u2019d give my right arm\u201d began as early as the 1600s. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Pay the piper&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThis idiom supposedly originates with the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Germany. According to the tale, the townspeople of Hamelin paid a piper with a magic flute to lure an infestation of rats out of the town with his song. They promised to pay him for his services, but after he rid the town of rats they took back their promise and refused to pay him. In retaliation, the piper used his magic flute to lure the children of the town away from their parents. Nearly all the children in the town were drawn away by the magical song and were never seen again. To \u201cpay the piper\u201d means to make good on your promise or face the consequences.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Squirrel away money&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThis idiom means to store away money with the same intensity as a squirrel preparing for winter. You can squirrel away pretty much anything, but most often this idiom is used with money. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;What are your favorite idioms about money?

However, this week is National Library Week and the more we thought about it, the more we realized that librarians are the real superheroes. Here's why:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. Librarians know how to locate every witty thing Tony Stark has said as well as every interesting or intelligent thing recorded in history.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nIron Man is great at cracking a joke (causing massive amounts of collateral damage), but librarians are masters of research. They know that the key to knowledge it not knowing the answer to every question but knowing how to find the answer to any question. This is what lead Einstein to say: \u201cThe only thing that you absolutely have to know is the location of the library.\u201d If you are on a mission to learn about something, talk to a librarian. So, Iron Man you might be able to think of some pretty witty one-liners, but librarians can basically find all the most hilarious one-liners in the history of ever.\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe class=\"aligncenter giphy-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/c4hnCnBbA19du\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. Librarians are way more experienced at their jobs.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nWhile Thor has been saving Earth for at least 1,000 years (more likely 2,200 years), the other Avengers are superhero toddlers. In comparison, librarians have been organizing and caring for books, helping seekers find answers, and leading adventurers to their new favorite books for nearly three millennia. (That's not including the cumulative experience of all those amazing library workers.)\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe class=\"aligncenter giphy-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/H1N1gMteRGLbq\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;3. They have personal relationships with their communities.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nSure, the Avengers are fighting to save Earth, but in-between epic battles that destroy cities (in multiple worlds), they remain somewhat detached from their communities. In contrast, librarians are on the ground every day helping community members find employment resources, teaching children to love reading, and generally making our neighborhoods better places to live.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;4. When saving the world, they don\u2019t destroy anything except simple minds.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nIt can\u2019t have gone unnoticed that the Avengers are pretty destructive in their defense of Earth. Of course, the attacks the Avengers have countered were corporal threats, but really? Thankfully when librarians wage their war, they don\u2019t destroy anything but stereotypes, hate, and simple thinking.\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe class=\"aligncenter giphy-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/DlYVPqQhwIhC8\" width=\"480\" height=\"278\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;5. Librarians are all about sharing. &lt;\/b&gt;\r\nUnlike the Avengers, librarians don\u2019t keep their superpowers to themselves. Librarians love to share information \u2014 how to find something, which book to read if you want to learn more about anything, what author to read if you enjoy doing X, Y, or Z. Librarians are all about sharing their skills to cultivate armies of people capable of taking knowledge and learning into their own hands.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;6. Librarians don\u2019t fight with weapons. They fight with ideas. &lt;\/b&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/fremontlibraries.wordpress.com\/2008\/04\/17\/thirteen-famous-librarians-real-and-fictional\/ \" rel=\u201dnofollow\u201d&gt;Some librarians&lt;\/a&gt; have effected massive change with their ideas. But all librarians help their communities by providing better access to better information.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;7. They don\u2019t get a break. &lt;\/b&gt;\r\nAfter saving the world, the Avengers go on vacation or work on other projects that don\u2019t require them to be an Avenger. Librarians don\u2019t get much of a break. They are dedicated professionals working day after day to rid the planet of ignorance. It\u2019s tiring work, but they are indefatigable.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;8. They are accessible. &lt;\/b&gt;\r\nAs stated earlier, librarians are in their communities. This means that when anyone from the neighborhood has a question or wants some reading advice, they are there \u2014 ready. I have a difficult time believing that the Avengers are so easy to find or generous with their time.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;9. Librarians have lifted stacks of books heavier than Thor\u2019s hammer.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nLet\u2019s face it. These people move a lot of books. Books are heavy.\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe class=\"aligncenter giphy-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/kbkhRXj6rGmUU\" width=\"480\" height=\"200\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;10. They are inspiring.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"I'm of a fearsome mind to throw my arms around every living librarian who crosses my path, on behalf of the souls they never knew they saved.\" \u2014 Barbara Kingsolver&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nWe're not trying to say that the Avengers can\u2019t inspire you to be a better person, but librarians have a few advantages:\r\n1) They are relatable.\r\n2) They are accessible.\r\n3) They are real.\r\nFor inspiration to be effective, we have to know that it is possible to achieve. When we see intelligent, creative, and hard-working people around us, it provides a compelling example for us to emulate. Trying to emulate the Hulk is probably just going to get you a few awkward looks and some vandalism fines.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;11. They often do all of this with budget cuts. &lt;\/b&gt;\r\nThough not strictly so, a librarian\u2019s ability to \u201cmake due\u201d borders on supernatural. The truth is that librarians are waging war on ignorance with pure human talent and a Xerox machine running out of toner. No military elixirs, mishaps with gamma radiation, or \u201cbillionaire philanthropists\u201d help librarians to provide interesting seasonal programming, update the computing systems, or cover subscriptions to several cutting-edge journals. The work is done on shrinking public budgets and local donations.\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe class=\"aligncenter giphy-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/128MHrlrHNwwU0\" width=\"480\" height=\"216\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;This week as National Library Week and April 14th was National Library Workers Day.

His complete resignation to the world inspires a similar sense of submission in my writing- deconstructing that wall between the words I know how to spell and the words I truly want to say. He snores, but lightly, the same way not every stanza may be perfect, filled with heavy, misplaced words every now and then. The curve of his lips, revealing that perfectly imperfect smile, as they prepare to kiss mine, no regard for the fact that neither of us have brushed our teeth yet- it inspires a want, a need to let each word be filled with urgent sincerity.\r\n\r\nThere is poetry in the way a cup of coffee tastes, strikingly bitter, but leaving a trail of wholesome warmth throughout your body. That first biting sip, too hot and scalding your tired tongue, inspires that necessary first word, sometimes forced and clumsy. The brown ring left at the bottom of the mug, a gentle reminder that all good things must come to an end- even the best sentence. The dancing flavors in your mouth, hints of this nut and notes of that fruit, inspire a melding of techniques, styles, and formats- not every poem has to rhyme.\r\n\r\nHere is poetry- sectioned out five, seven five. Heard of a haiku? Floats so delicate, you can hardly notice it. So many poem styles. Can\u2019t forget iambic pentameter. It\u2019s what made Shakespeare so very well known. The list can go on, poetry is infinitely diverse. It can be as breathtaking as a fawn, or as horrid as a curse. Boasting endless combinations, see, poetry is anything and everything in between. I\u2019m now on paragraph three, and still bitter that your strict essay structure is a rule- how mean! (A pause to observe this is actually paragraph four. Poets are seldom skilled in math.) Poetry influences my writing in that it dares me. It dares me to veer from tradition. It dares me to write what I feel rather than simply what is required. Hey- I only have ten more words to the minimum! (Rats.)\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nEmerson College class of 2017.

Given the literary nature of library work, it\u2019s not surprising that some of our favorite authors were also librarians. Here\u2019s a short list of writers who put in time between the stacks.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Lewis Carroll&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nBefore he began writing &lt;em&gt;Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;\/em&gt;, Lewis Carroll (whose real name was Charles Dodgson) worked as a librarian in England.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Jorge Luis Borges&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThis Argentinian author had quite a successful career as a librarian. After working as a librarian for years, Borges served as the Director of the National Library of the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Madeleine L\u2019Engle&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nAfter the success of her Newbery Award-winning novel &lt;em&gt;A Wrinkle in Time&lt;\/em&gt;, author Madeleine L\u2019Engle had a career as a librarian in New York City.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Marcel Proust&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nProust is famous for his novel &lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time&lt;\/em&gt;, but he also worked at the Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine. The Biblioth\u00e8que Mazarine is the oldest public library in France. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Beverly Cleary&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nNewbery Award-winning children\u2019s book author Beverly Cleary also worked as a children\u2019s librarian. Perhaps her experience putting books in the hands of eager readers helped her create some of her famous characters like Ramona Quimby and Henry Huggins. ","post_title":"The Secret to Success?

In order to enjoy the experience to the fullest, it\u2019s important to choose the right book for the right time. Here are three books we recommend reading in bed.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;When you want to stay in bed longer: &lt;i&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;\/i&gt; series by Philip Pullman &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nAlthough this series is written for children, it\u2019s a pleasure to read as an adult. Let Pullman\u2019s writing transport you to a magical world that parallels our own. Talking animals, daring adventures, epic battles\u2014this series has it all. Stay in bed for a few extra hours and enjoy this magical series.\r\n \r\n&lt;strong&gt;When you want to fall gently asleep: &lt;i&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;\/i&gt; by John Steinbeck &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014this novel is anything but boring. John Steinbeck\u2019s &lt;i&gt;The Grapes of Wrath&lt;\/i&gt; is a beautifully layered masterpiece. But the cadence of the language and the dry, dusty expanse of the scenery make for a soothing read that will lull your brain into a sleep-ready state. \r\n \r\n&lt;strong&gt;When you want to induce a dreamlike state: &lt;i&gt;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&lt;\/i&gt; by Haruki Murakami &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nMurakami\u2019s novel blends sci-fi and existentialism to create a dreamy, modernist experience. If you have trouble sleeping, read a few pages of this book and find yourself transported into a state that feels like dreaming but is still grounded in reality. Lean back against the pillow, pull that blanket up, and enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat's your favorite book to read in bed? Share your thoughts in the comments!","post_title":"Can't Sleep?

The subjunctive is usually the third-person form of the verb with the \u2011s dropped. For example, when using the verb &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;\/i&gt; in the subjunctive, the present tense is &lt;i&gt;be&lt;\/i&gt;, and the past tense is &lt;i&gt;were&lt;\/i&gt;. Here are a few other examples:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;It is recommended that she &lt;b&gt;drink&lt;\/b&gt; water throughout the day to stay hydrated.\r\nI demand that your brother &lt;b&gt;attend&lt;\/b&gt; my birthday party.\r\nThe author suggests that students &lt;b&gt;submit&lt;\/b&gt; their college applications early.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;The subjunctive is usually used with verbs like &lt;i&gt;desire, ask,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;require&lt;\/i&gt;, where whatever is desired or asked or required may not actually be done.&lt;\/b&gt; If you\u2019re unsure whether you should use the subjective or not, check to see if your sentence has this kind of structure.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;The subjunctive mood also comes into play with conditionals.&lt;\/b&gt; In these cases, the form of the verb &lt;i&gt;to be&lt;\/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;were&lt;\/i&gt;. These are sentences in which you\u2019re expressing a wish, hope, or fantasy. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I wish I &lt;b&gt;were&lt;\/b&gt; tall enough to ride the roller coaster.\r\nIf I &lt;b&gt;were&lt;\/b&gt; a bird, I would fly far away from here.&lt;\/i&gt; \r\n\r\nTo learn more about verb tenses, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/conjugating-verbs-doesnt-have-to-make-you-tenseab\/\"&gt;read this post&lt;\/a&gt; about how to conjugate the various forms of \u201clay.\u201d  ","post_title":"The Skinny on the Subjunctive","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-skinny-on-the-subjunctive","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-04-07 06:49:16","post_modified_gmt":"2015-04-07 13:49:16","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=13077","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":13181,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2015-04-07 02:13:55","post_date_gmt":"2015-04-07 09:13:55","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5y6t4egdfv.jpg\" alt=\"His correct use of &quot;whom&quot; makes me think this cat isn&#039;t messing around.\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13183\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to formal writing for school or work, it's important that if you use who and whom, you know how to use them correctly.

Why do writers need a style guide? A style guide helps writers know what the rules are: whether the Oxford comma should be used or not, when to spell out numerals, how to capitalize the names of organizations, etc. Writers may use other style guides in different situations, including the &lt;i&gt;Chicago Manual of Style&lt;\/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;American Medical Association Manual of Style&lt;\/i&gt;.\r\nEach year, the &lt;i&gt;AP Stylebook&lt;\/i&gt; is updated to include new terms and popular word usages. Here are two interesting updates being made to this year\u2019s Stylebook:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Social media terminology&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nSocial media users, rejoice! The terms \u201cfavorite\u201d (used as a verb) and \u201cmeme\u201d have been added to the AP Stylebook this year. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Global warming&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn the past, it\u2019s been unclear whether journalists should use the term \u201cglobal warming\u201d or \u201cclimate change.\u201d Now writers don\u2019t have to choose because the AP has declared that the terms can be used interchangeably. \r\n\r\nThe AP bases its Stylebook updates on common usage of words so that the language writers use is accurate and makes sense to readers. \r\nWhat terminology do you think should be added to or clarified in the &lt;i&gt;AP Stylebook&lt;\/i&gt;?

Words are words. Poetry is something more. Poetry is something that inhabits the depths of a man\u2019s soul and moves his pen to give life to words and so ascribe what some call poetry.\r\n\r\nPoetry is what lies behind the words, prompting them into being. Take a strand of expression, a strand of passion, and a strand of order. Let the lithe fingers of language plait them together with experience born of wisdom till they spill onto a page in verses. Then read them aloud with the voice of feeling. Shout them from the tree tops with the peril of passion. Quote them in the assembly with the tone of Wisdom. Whisper them to your children with an air of mystery. This is poetry.\r\n\r\nPoetry is not tucked away in a clever rhyme, nor strung about in garrulous language. Rhymes are rhymes and words are words whether garrulous or otherwise. Poetry is something more. True Poetry secrets itself away in the heart of us each. Those words that touch us deep within, that quaff the extremities of our heart; those are but the expression of Poetry.\r\n\r\nPoetry, in essence, is a wordless phrase. It is a song, a song of magnificence that touches and stirs our inner beings. Poetry is the aged wind rustling the great pines in a whisper of remorse for bygone days. It is the still yet powerful voice of one whom we love. Poetry is the aroma of Mother\u2019s molasses cookies in the tangy chill of a fall afternoon. Poetry is the great sea crashing and churning in all her splendor, as if she would break from her seething bed and swallow the earth whole. Poetry is a child after the rain, tumbling in the mud with a puppy and laughing at the water-drenched world. Poetry is a song \u2013 the song of life \u2013 that stirs our inner beings. Poetry is that part of us tied to something beyond.\r\n\r\nPoetry influences literature like the presence of air influences existence. I could extricate it. I could ignore its presence. I could type out long blocks of dry words with no regard for sentiment, sound, or presentation and pretend I have no need of such flippant language. But my writing would die. My words would stand lifeless, as I too, would lay lifeless should I attempt to exist while denying myself that which gives life. Words prescribe reality, and poetry gives life to the cold harshness of that reality.\r\n\r\n&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-12747\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/DSCN0274-297x410.jpg\" alt=\"Kaytee Green, poetry, Grammarly\" width=\"297\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;Poetry is that part of us tied to something beyond, and that something beyond gives life from beyond. Man is a creation molded after the image of a God. As such, man longs for something beyond and that something sometimes spills forth into a beautiful thing, phrase, or expression. And when we hear the phrase prompted by the beyond, it touches that part of us longing for more.

For the D&amp;D players of the world, a bugbear is a hairy, giant-like goblin. For Destiny\u2019s Child fans, a bugaboo is a particularly annoying boy who just won\u2019t stop calling you (or paging you, or showing up to your house unannounced). These definitions aren\u2019t exactly what the words were used for back when they first came into existence during\u00a0the Middle Ages. In fact, both bugbear and bugaboo have interesting backstories that involve our childhood nemesis, the bogeyman.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Bugbear&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;An ongoing problem; a recurring obstacle or adversity.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;A source of dread; resentment; or irritation&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;An imaginary creature meant to inspire fear in children.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\nThough linguists can\u2019t be certain on exactly where the word bogey originated, they all agree that it originally existed as a proper name for the Devil. Scary, right? It\u2019s no wonder, then, that parents began telling their children stories of the bogeyman coming to get them when they didn\u2019t do their chores or go to bed on time or whatever it is that children got reprimanded for in the Middle Ages. At some point, the rhetoric around the bogeyman changed, and instead of becoming a creature that would take children who didn\u2019t go to bed on\u00a0time, it became the bugbear who would get you if you tried to sneak out at night. As the word might suggest, a bugbear was a bear-like imaginary creature also meant to incite fear in children (and teens). Today, a bugbear isn\u2019t so much a creepy creature or giant-like goblin but a word that represents an ongoing problem; a recurring obstacle or adversity. Some might consider a bugbear to be getting politicians to agree on legislation for public school funding, for example. Alternatively, a bugbear can represent a source of dread, resentment, or irritation. Many Americans, for example, consider doing their taxes a real bugbear.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Bugaboo&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;An imaginary object of fear&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Something that causes fear or distress out of proportion to its importance&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\nWhile bugbear is a popular term in Europe, in North America the more popular word is\u00a0bugaboo and usually refers\u00a0to\u00a0a dreadful imaginary object than a creature. In this instance, it turns out that Destiny\u2019s Child &lt;a title=\"Destiny's Child &quot;BugABoo&quot;\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/9i-y0G8nNA8\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;got it wrong&lt;\/a&gt;. When you think about it, that guy who just won\u2019t stop calling you is more of a bugbear than a bugaboo\u2014the guy the girls are singing about is definitely real. If we took Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s use of bugaboo in the literal sense, it seems like Beyonc\u00e9 et al. are totally overreacting to the bogeyman instead of protecting their very important personal spaces. Also, once you learn the definition of bugaboo, it makes it hard to look at that &lt;a title=\"Bugaboo Baby Accessories\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bugaboo.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;cute line of baby accessories&lt;\/a&gt; that also bears the name quite the same way. Is strolling your baby suddenly an activity that causes fear or distress out of proportion to its importance (the importance being getting your baby from point A to point B)? Is your baby just an imaginary object of fear? I\u2019d like to think not.\r\n\r\nSo, while the two words are similarly defined (and often appear as synonyms of each other), be careful to make sure you\u2019re using the word with the right definition. Even Beyonc\u00e9 can lead us astray sometimes.","post_title":"Beyonc\u00e9 Was Wrong About This Word","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"beyonce-was-wrong-about-this-word","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-04-03 10:57:38","post_modified_gmt":"2015-04-03 17:57:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12889","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12799,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2015-04-02 05:00:12","post_date_gmt":"2015-04-02 12:00:12","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12801\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Nevermind.jpg\" alt=\"The Passive-Aggressive Raven\" width=\"700\" height=\"315\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe is an writer associated with American Romanticism. He is known for his exploration of dark themes in stories as well as poetry. While many people in the U.S. are vaguely aware of Poe (his writing is often taught in English curriculum), many people might not remember or be familiar with his writing as adults. In honor of #PoetryMonth, we have put together a short list of the most famous or culturally significant poems by Poe.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/poestories.com\/read\/raven\"&gt;\"The Raven\"&lt;\/a&gt; (1845)&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary . . .\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n\"The Raven\" may be Poe's best known poem. This one tops our list because the enormous number of popular cultural references to the poem (see the image above) make it highly relevant to various groups of people.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/poestories.com\/read\/annabellee\"&gt;\"Annabel Lee\"&lt;\/a&gt; (1849)&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Can ever dissever my soul from the soul\/Of the beautiful Annabel Lee . . .\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nA true rival in popularity and cultural ubiquity to \"The Raven,\" \"Annabel Lee\" gloomily explores the depressive, melancholy of lost love. The sorrow of the poem is only enhanced by the clear devotion of the author to his beloved even after death.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;3. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/poestories.com\/read\/alone\"&gt;\"Alone\"&lt;\/a&gt; (1875)&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"From childhood's hour I have not been\/As others were . . .\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nThis poem is a manifesto for every person who has felt like a black sheep. Poe beautifully describes the feeling of otherness that comes with not fitting the cultural mold. Reading these words, anyone who has ever felt different can take small comfort that their experience has been and remains shared.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr \/&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;What's your favorite piece of \"Poe-try\"?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nEvery weekday in April, we will be sharing a poem, an excerpt of poetry, or a feature on a poet.

Cartoon. \" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12983\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nYou probably have been told more than once that &lt;b&gt;double negatives&lt;\/b&gt; are wrong and that you shouldn't use them. However, usually, it's left at that \u2014 without any explanation of what exactly a double negative is or why it's considered incorrect (in standard English). We want to fix that. Here is the essential list of things you must understand about double negatives. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. In standard English, each subject-predicate construction should only have one negative form.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nNegative forms in English are created by adding a negation to the verb.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I will bake a cake. --&gt; I will not bake a cake.&lt;\/i&gt; \r\n&lt;i&gt;I can go anywhere tonight. --&gt; I cannot go anywhere tonight.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;We are planning a trip. --&gt; We are not planning a trip.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nSometimes there are negative forms of nouns \u2014 such as \"nowhere,\" \"nothing,\" and \"no one\" \u2014 that are used. If these are in a sentence, it is important that the verb in the sentence is not negated. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;He's going nowhere.&lt;\/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;not&lt;\/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;He's not going nowhere.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. A double negative is a &lt;i&gt;non-standard&lt;\/i&gt; sentence construction that uses two negative forms. &lt;\/b&gt;\r\nDouble negatives are created by adding a negation to the verb &lt;b&gt;and&lt;\/b&gt; to the modifier of the noun (adjectives, adverbs, etc.) &lt;b&gt;or&lt;\/b&gt; to the object of the verb. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I will bake a cake. --&gt; I won't (will not) bake no cake.&lt;\/i&gt; (verb negation + object negation)\r\n&lt;i&gt;I can go anywhere tonight. --&gt; I can't (cannot) go nowhere tonight. &lt;\/i&gt; (verb negation + modifier negation)\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;3. Learning standard English negation is difficult because many languages and some English dialects use double negatives conventionally.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nThough it's easy to assume that double negatives are simply unnatural aberrations, this assumption is wrong. In many languages worldwide, it is grammatically incorrect to use anything but the double negative! (This is called negative concord.) \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;No hay ningun problema.&lt;\/i&gt;(Spanish)\r\n\"There isn't no problem.\" meaning \"There isn't a problem.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u043d\u0456\u0447\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0457\u0441\u0442\u0438. (Ya ne hochu nichogo yisty.)&lt;\/i&gt; (Ukrainian)\r\n\"I don't want nothing to eat.\" meaning \"I don't want to eat anything.\"\r\n\r\nTo make it more complicated, it's not just foreign languages that conventionally employ double negatives but some dialects of English as well! African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Southern American English, and even some British regional forms use negative concord constructions. Negative concord is even used several times in Chaucer's &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;\/i&gt; (e.g. regarding the Friar: \"Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous.\") \r\n\r\nSo, while double negatives are not correct in standard English, that doesn't make them any less useful in other dialects. We encourage writers to learn how to negate sentences using the standard grammar \u2014 especially for professional settings \u2014 but we love the diversity of English (and language in general) and think that use of dialectal grammar is fine in open, less formal environments. \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;How do you remember not to use double negatives? Do you think double negatives should be considered incorrect?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n","post_title":"3 Things You Must Know About Double Negatives","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"3-things-you-must-know-about-double-negatives","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-04-01 07:36:33","post_modified_gmt":"2015-04-01 14:36:33","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12981","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12771,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2015-04-01 03:00:09","post_date_gmt":"2015-04-01 10:00:09","post_content":"We're ecstatic.

Most of us are used to office jargon, but we\u2019d like to take a minute to review some of the business-y words that do the job while kind of driving us crazy at the same time. Jargon varies from office to office, but here are five\u00a0of the words and phrases that make us cringe.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Goal-oriented:&lt;\/strong&gt; At work, it\u2019s important to be goal-oriented. After all, if you aren\u2019t working toward a goal, how the heck are you spending your time? But there is one issue with this term: it has become meaningless in its overuse. After seeing this term on multiple resum\u00e9s and in countless slideshows, we think it\u2019s time to find a new word.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Optimize:&lt;\/strong&gt; To optimize means to make the best or most effective use of\u2014to improve efficiency. The way some people speak at work, it seems like nearly everything can be optimized, from workflows to team structures to even refrigerator organization. If you can think of a relationship or process in your office, you can probably optimize it. Optimization is great\u2014who doesn\u2019t love efficiency?!\u2014but overuse of the term can become annoying. Optimize your vocabulary by cutting back on your use of this term.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Synergy:&lt;\/strong&gt; The definition of synergy is \u201cthe interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.\u201d But when people use the term synergy in the office, it seems to imply something mystical, almost magical, about working together. We would prefer to keep things simple and more concrete by\u00a0using terms like \u201ccooperation\u201d or \u201ccollaboration\u201d to describe the process of working together.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Impact (used as a verb):&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0While it\u2019s now acceptable to use impact as a verb (meaning to affect or influence something), this word is so overused and misused that we vote for stopping its usage completely. People want to \u201cimpact sales,\u201d \u201cimpact the community,\u201d and even \u201cimpact the future.\u201d Make an impact in your office by using &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/words\/impact\"&gt;other synonyms&lt;\/a&gt; instead of impact.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Disrupt: &lt;\/strong&gt;This word has gained popularity in the startup and technology world, but its use has started to become a bit\u2014eh hem\u2014disruptive. Most people use the term to mean something akin to \u201cupsetting the old balance of power\u201d or \u201cbucking expectations and completely changing the way things are done.\u201d There\u2019s even a conference, Techcrunch Disrupt, which\u00a0underscores the use and importance of the word. Do you know what would be truly disruptive? Finding a new term to describe this action.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Which work-related words or jargon drives you crazy? What are your preferred replacements?

Though they have the same pronunciation, homophones have &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/funny-homophones\"&gt;slightly different spellings&lt;\/a&gt; and totally different definitions. Since using the wrong one can completely change the meaning of your statement, it's important to make sure you have the right word in mind. Here are seven homophone mistakes to avoid.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Than vs. Then&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/cherieb\/201816498\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12433\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Untitled6.png\" alt=\"store, homophone, Grammarly\" width=\"500\" height=\"371\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nDespite their single letter of difference, misusing \"than\" and \"then\" can change a statement completely. \"Than\" is the word to use in a comparative statement, like \"You're a better writer today than you were yesterday.\" Use \"then\" when describing a sequence of events, like \"Write a good sentence, and then compose a great paragraph.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;To vs. Too&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile \"to\" and \"too\" sound the same, remember that the former is a preposition, while the latter is an adverb. \"To\" typically means \"toward,\" while \"too\" can either mean \"excessively\" or \"also.\" For example, you could say, \"When you go to the beach, take me too.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Your vs. You're&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThough it's a common mistake, using the wrong version of this word can &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robasghar\/2013\/08\/06\/which-grammar-mistakes-will-keep-you-from-getting-a-good-job\/\"&gt;make your writing look sloppy&lt;\/a&gt;. \"Your\" is always a possessive pronoun, so when you use this word, be sure you're declaring ownership. For instance, you could say, \"your book\" or \"your professional writing sample.\" \"You're,\" on the other hand, is a contraction of the words \"you\" and \"are.\" When using this word, check yourself by reading it with the words \"you are\" in place of the contraction to make sure it makes sense.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Threw vs. Through&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n\"Threw\" and \"through\" may be different parts of speech, but they can be &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/5-homophones-people-just-cant-seem-to-keep-straight\/\"&gt;tough to keep straight&lt;\/a&gt;. The first work in this homophone pair is the past tense of the verb \"throw,\" or the act of tossing something in the air. \"Through,\" however, is an adverb that implies movement through space or time. You could say, for instance, \"The pitcher threw the baseball through the air like a pro.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Stationary vs. Stationery&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nMany writers confuse these homophones, since the only spelling difference is a single vowel towards the end of the word. \"Stationary\" and \"stationery,\" however, have very different meanings. \"Stationary\" refers to standing still, while \"stationery\" refers to cards, paper, or other writing materials. Your stationery may be stationary, but never the other way around.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Seas vs. Sees vs. Seize&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nAs if two homophones weren't enough, you will find &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/howtowritebetter.net\/are-you-haunted-by-homophones\/\"&gt;three spellings of this sound-alike&lt;\/a&gt;. \"Seas\" is a noun that describes oceans and other large bodies of water, while the verb \"sees\" refers to looking or observing. Finally, \"seize\" means to take control. \"She sees the opposing forces seize the seas\" demonstrates the unique meaning of all three.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;There vs. Their vs. They're&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nYou'll also find three of these &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.copyblogger.com\/5-common-mistakes-that-make-you-look-dumb\/\"&gt;tricky homophones&lt;\/a&gt;. \"There\" refers to a general location or distance. When describing where you parked your car, for instance, you might say, \"My car is in the parking lot over there.\" \"Their\" serves as a possessive form for more than one person. When referring to the vehicles belonging to a group of people, for example, you would say, \"their cars.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, \"they're\" is a contraction of the words \"they\" and \"are.\" Whenever you use this term, make sure that what you really mean is \"they are.\" For instance, you could say, \"They're parking.\" If you're really ready to show off your knowledge of homophones, try out the statement, \"They're parking their car in that lot over there.\"\r\n\r\nHomophones may sound the same, but their meanings are very different when you use them in writing. Study up on which words you need to use, and when, as many spelling and grammar checkers cannot correct for words that are spelled correctly but used wrong.

Evans&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nThe valet pulled up in my car. I thanked him, tipped him and entered my car. I noticed both turn signals were blinking. What\u2019s up? It took me a minute to realize the valet had turned on the hazard lights. I didn\u2019t even remember if I had ever used them in this car.\r\n\r\nI touched every switch, button and stick searching for the toggle. Sure, I could dig for the instruction manual in the glove compartment, but I didn\u2019t want to hold up the folks behind me. So I asked a nearby valet for help. Click. She pushed the button with the hazard icon above the touchscreen display. Color me embarrassed.\r\n\r\nDespite this, I told my husband what happened. He said many people don\u2019t know where to find the hazard light switch because there was no standard location for it. Well, I won\u2019t forget next time.\r\n\r\nIf I read anything I wrote from five years ago, I flinch. I\u2019m a better writer than I was five years ago. And I hope I\u2019m better five years from now. Doing lots of reading and writing helped me grow as a writer.\r\n\r\nUnlike with the hazard lights, I\u2019ll pick up an instruction manual for writing to learn a few tricks. This would be any book on writing. The first memorable one I read was William Zinsser\u2019s \u201cOn Writing Well.\u201d Within 15 pages, I learned these four tips, which boosted my writing.\r\n\r\nWhy limit to four tips? Many articles provide a long list of tips. It\u2019s so overwhelming that you don\u2019t bother trying any. Keep it simple. Four is doable. And you can use them right now. Learn a handful of writing tricks at a time. Know them and nurture them. They\u2019ll become a habit.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt; Trade Five Dollar Words for Cheap Ones&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nThe first advice is to simplify. Zinsser covers it in one sentence: \u201cEvery word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that\u2019s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what \u2014 these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence.\u201d\r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/every-word-that-WZ.jpg\" alt=\"William Zinsser quotation\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12633\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nOne sentence taught me to swap fancy words for simple ones, cut words ending in -ly and don\u2019t be passive aggressive. Why opt for the snooty \u201cutilize\u201d when you can use the effortless \u201cuse?\u201d And who needs the mind-numbing \u201cnumerous\u201d when the four-lettered \u201cmany\u201d works? Here, the Thesaurus is your friend.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt; Cut Very Unnecessary Words&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nWhy not get to the point by cutting the underlined words? I blame the search engine optimization. People say online content needs to be more than 1,000 words for SEO\u2019s sake. They believe long content earns more love from search engines.\r\n\r\nAnxious to reach the word count goal, writers add a bunch of words especially qualifiers and adverbs, throw in statistics and amend sentences to plug in key phrases until it fits.\r\n\r\nDo we need \u201cvery\u201d to underscore how much we need to drop needless words? We\u2019ve used \u201cvery,\u201d \u201cso\u201d and \u201creally\u201d so often that these words have lost power.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt; Split Long Sentences to Create Two Shorter Ones for a Crisper Read&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nGranted, the quote from Zinsser runs long.

This stressed form eventually came to strictly emphasize addition or agreement, and a distinctive spelling is dated to the 16th century.

What's even more adorable is when children write something they didn't intend to write at all.

While it's definitely funny, it can also be\u00a0a disturbing sight if you aren't prepared for your child accidentally professing their love for the Devil.\r\n\r\nA couple of slip-ups can be funny, but if transposing words becomes common, make sure you check to see if your child has\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/php1.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/5-reasons-the-writing-world-%E2%80%A8should-celebrate-dyslexia\/\"&gt;dyslexia&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Sounding It\u00a0Out, Literally\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/moonlightbulb\/5294380424\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11587\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled31.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by moonlightbulb\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nSome children\u00a0spell words in exactly the way that they sound. This can lead to some embarrassing, and\u00a0possibly hilarious, moments for you and your family since\u00a0telling a child to \"sound it out\" doesn't always work as effectively when it comes to spelling. Expecting a five-year-old to account for long and short vowels and proper phonetics in a letter or doodle is overly ambitious. Don't be surprised when you see the word \"peace\" spelled as \"pies.\" Though your child is more likely to be wishing for \"World Pies\" than \"World Peace\" anyway.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Malapropisms Run Rampant with Children\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nChildren have a pretty limited vocabulary, so they simply aren't aware of the existence of many of the words that adults use. When children attempt to repeat the words they hear, this can often &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/literarydevices.net\/malapropism\/\"&gt;result in a malapropism&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0because\u00a0the child is substituting an unknown word or sound for one that they &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/php1.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/8-embarrassing-yet-common-malapropisms\/\"&gt;already know&lt;\/a&gt;. For example, it's a strong possibility that your child believes that Abraham Lincoln's name is actually April Ham Lincoln because that makes a lot more sense to him.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Oversimplifying Words Can Often Lead to Trouble\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the English language has many confusing and just plain silly rules in it\u00a0--\u00a0especially when it comes to spelling.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.boredpanda.com\/funny-childrens-spelling-mistakes\/\"&gt;Children will spell things&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0in the most simple way by sounding it out, but this tactic can often lead to some inappropriate, albeit hilarious, misspellings. Try not to get offended when your little boy hands you a drawing of his favorite place with the caption \"I love the biach.\" Though he just loves the beach, it might seem like he's down with the latest slang words.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;Sometimes, It's All About Handwriting&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's not just spelling mistakes on a child's drawing or letter that lead to hilarious misunderstandings.

In addition to rarely being taught in public schools, these pronouns are even more rarely used correctly, making it difficult to internalize the patterns. Despite these issues, it's still considered the mark of an educated person to be able to use \u2014 or at least navigate around \u2014 these words. So, what do you do if you don't have a clue? Here are two effective ways for you to deal with the whoever\/whomever problem.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. Learn the difference.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nThis one is shocking, we know. But before you let panic set in, go pour yourself a tea, have a long-look in the mirror, and remind yourself that if you were somehow able to program the universal remote, you can learn how to use these two words correctly.\r\n\r\n&lt;iframe class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"\/\/giphy.com\/embed\/Cx0JktG3wBWvu?html5=true\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;\r\n\r\nFirst, &lt;b&gt;who and whoever are subject pronouns.&lt;\/b&gt; They function the same way &lt;i&gt;I, he, she, we,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;they&lt;\/i&gt; function in sentences. Subject pronouns are\u00a0the actors in sentences. &lt;b&gt;Whom and whomever are object pronouns.&lt;\/b&gt; They function the same way &lt;i&gt;me, him, her, us,&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;them&lt;\/i&gt; function in sentences.* Object pronouns receive actions (they are the objects of verbs).\r\n\r\nSecond, don't make this harder than it has to be. You can use more familiar subject and object pronouns to sort out which is correct to use. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Give the correspondence to whoever\/whomever.&lt;\/i&gt; --&gt; &lt;i&gt;Give the correspondence to he\/him.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nYou're right. It should be \"whomever\" in exactly the same way that we would always say \"him.\" They are both object pronouns. Of course, not all sentences are as easy as this, but you should be able to whittle a sentence down to its essence to make the subject\/object distinction. The following sentence doesn't work as nicely with the replacement pronouns.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Report the problem to whoever\/whomever you can find at the bureau.&lt;\/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Report the problem to he\/him you can find at the bureau.&lt;\/i&gt; Eek.)\r\n\r\nIt can be simplified by removing the additional information \u2014 the modifier \"(who) you can find at the bureau\" \u2014 then the sentence is as simple as the first. If you are still not sure after the simplification, try replacing \"he\/him\" with \"he\/him who.\" It might sound a little formal, but if it still makes sense, then you know to stick with the subject case. The same trick will work for sentences similar to the following.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Whoever\/whomever double parked, you're being towed.&lt;\/i&gt; --&gt; &lt;i&gt;He who\/Him who double parked, you're being towed.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nClearly, we should stick to the subject case here \u2014\u00a0\"whoever double parked.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. Rewrite to avoid the issue all together.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nGrammar Girl, Mignon Fogarty, has it right \u2014 just re-write. If you still don't feel confident about your understanding of whoever\/whomever, you can always do as the professionals do and rephrase it. When rewriting, try to aim to be specific but brief. The word \"someone\" is a good replacement in many cases.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Give the correspondence to whoever\/whomever.&lt;\/i&gt; --&gt; &lt;i&gt;Give the correspondence to someone.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Report the problem to whoever\/whomever you can find at the bureau.&lt;\/i&gt; --&gt; &lt;i&gt;Report the problem to someone at the bureau.&lt;\/i&gt; OR &lt;i&gt;Report the problem at the bureau.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Whoever\/whomever double parked, you're being towed.&lt;\/i&gt; --&gt; &lt;i&gt;The person who double parked is being towed.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nNow, you can conquer whoever\/whomever with the best of them.

Catching typos after you've hit send can limit your personal and professional opportunities at worst or be just plain annoying at best. You know that you should proofread but don't because it requires an English degree (right?) and is time-consuming (right?). Actually almost anyone can quickly and easily reduce (dare we say eliminate?) post-send mortifications by following these three proofreading tricks.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. Copy your text into a different editor or change the font.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nOne of the biggest reasons that writing errors make it from draft to sent copy is because your brain is so familiar with the text that it literally auto-corrects the mistakes it sees \u2014 making them almost invisible to you. Unfortunately, the longer you work on a text, the more likely this is to happen. This trick is to help your brain perceive your writing as something fresh so that it can more easily spot oddities.  \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. Read your text backward.&lt;\/b&gt; \r\nIf you don't have time to step away from your writing for anywhere from few hours to a day or more, try this hack. Read the sentences in backward order. Instead of reading from top to bottom, read bottom to top. This will add novelty to the sentences, making it easier to find errors. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;3. Read your text out loud.&lt;\/b&gt; \r\nEven if you're just whispering away at your desk, reading aloud is a great way to find and spot mistakes, especially missing punctuation or repeated words. As an added bonus, you will likely hear when something doesn't flow properly or sounds awkward. While not necessarily incorrect, these phrases can be re-worded for better clarity in communication. \r\n\r\nThis is a much pared-down version of what we would recommend for more substantial proofreading tasks. However, if you are writing for social media or on a tight timeline, these tips should make a big impact. &lt;b&gt;What is your proofreading process?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\n","post_title":"3 Things You Should Do When Speed Proofreading","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"3-things-you-should-do-when-speed-proofreading","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-20 07:07:00","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-20 14:07:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12641","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12573,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2015-03-19 06:55:32","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-19 13:55:32","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/never-judge-a-book-by-its-movie.jpg\" alt=\"Never judge a book by its movie. \" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12577\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. &lt;i&gt;Great Expectations&lt;\/i&gt; (1947)&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nBook: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/files\/1400\/1400-h\/1400-h.htm\"&gt;Great Expectations&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/i&gt; by Charles Dickens\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/great_expectations_1947\/\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;\/a&gt;: 100% Fresh\r\nThis film adaptation of the literary classic immediately became the standard for Dickens adaptations. However, none have really been able to live up to the power of this version. The use of black and white film (despite the availability of color technology) lends a degree of austerity that reflects themes from the novel quite well on the screen. \r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. &lt;i&gt; The Godfather&lt;\/i&gt; (1972)&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nBook: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Godfather-Mario-Puzo-ebook\/dp\/B0022Q8CSC\/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426771439&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+godfather\"&gt;The Godfather&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/i&gt; by Mario Puzo\r\n&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/m\/godfather\/\"&gt;Rotten Tomatoes&lt;\/a&gt;: 99% Fresh\r\nGiven that Puzo assisted with the screenplay, it may not be such a surprise that the film adaptation maintains so much of the book's integrity.

Stop. Put that finished story away and start another one. In a month, go back and look at the first story. RE-EDIT it. Then send it to a person you respect in the field who will be hard on you. Pray for many many many red marks. Fix them. Then put it away for two weeks. Work on something else. Finally, edit one last time. Now you are ready to sub your first work.\r\n\r\nCriticism is hard to take at first. Trust me, I've been there. But learn to think of crit marks as a knife. Each one is designed to cut away the bad and leave a scar. Scars prove you've lived, learned and walked away a winner. Any writer who tells you they don't need edits is lying. I don't care if they have 100 books out.

Read on to find our quick and easy tips on how to properly use &lt;i&gt;that&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;which&lt;\/i&gt;.\r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/78tygh.jpg\" alt=\"That is not the same as which.\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12559\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Restrictive Clause vs. Non-restrictive Clause&lt;\/b&gt;\r\nThat\u2019s right, it all comes down to these two kinds of clauses.\r\n\r\nA &lt;b&gt;restrictive clause&lt;\/b&gt; acts as an adjective to modify the subject of the sentence. The restrictive clause is essential to the sentence because it provides information that, if taken out, changes the subject of the sentence completely. A restrictive clause is always preceded by &lt;i&gt;that&lt;\/i&gt;. Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;The ring &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; she had custom-made was stolen from the vault.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Circus animals &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;aren\u2019t in cages scare me.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Personal computers &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; utilize retina displays are great for graphic designers.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nA restrictive clause is never placed between punctuation.\r\n\r\nA &lt;b&gt;nonrestrictive clause&lt;\/b&gt; typically contains optional information on the subject that isn\u2019t entirely necessary to the sentence. In other words, if you remove a nonrestrictive clause from a sentence, the subject of the sentence remains unaffected. A nonrestrictive clause is usually preceded by &lt;i&gt;which&lt;\/i&gt; (if a pronoun is used at all). Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;The ring, &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;which&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; was part of a custom jewelry set, was stolen from the vault.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Circus animals, &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;which&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; sometimes make cute pets, are rather expensive.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Personal computers, &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;which&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; were actually invented in 1964, have come quite a long way.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nA nonrestrictive clause is usually placed between commas, dashes, or parentheses.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;\r\nRemember: if your sentence &lt;i&gt;needs&lt;\/i&gt; it, then you\u2019ve written a restrictive clause, and you should use &lt;i&gt;that&lt;\/i&gt;. If the clause gives a little extra, &lt;i&gt;unnecessary&lt;\/i&gt; information, then you\u2019ve written a nonrestrictive clause, and you should use &lt;i&gt;which&lt;\/i&gt;. &lt;\/b&gt;","post_title":"Using That and Which is All About Restrictive and Non-restrictive Clauses","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"using-that-and-which-is-all-about-restrictive-and-non-restrictive-clauses","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-20 09:58:28","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-20 16:58:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12463","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11575,"post_author":"4","post_date":"2015-03-19 01:00:26","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-19 08:00:26","post_content":"Merriam-Webster defines grammar quite simply as the set of rules explaining how we use words in the English language. And as language itself has evolved over time, so have the rules of grammar. Given the speed with which written communication has adapted to life in the Internet era, even the strictest style mavens understand that some grammar conventions may no longer apply. Here are some grammar rules today's writers can usually safely ignore.\r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/6-Outdated-Grammar-Rules-.jpg\" alt=\"Outdated Grammar Rules You Can Forget\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12547\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Ending a Sentence With a Preposition&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe English poet John Dryden proclaimed it \"inelegant\" to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/youve-been-lied-to-heres-why-you-absolutely-can-end-a-sentence-with-a-preposition\/\"&gt;end a sentence with a preposition&lt;\/a&gt; simply because it wasn't possible to do so in Latin, the gold standard of the time. In fact, many early grammar rules were heavily influenced by the limitations of Latin. Today, most writers agree with Winston Churchill, who, when asked about the preposition rule, drolly replied, \"This is the sort of bloody nonsense up with which I will not put.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Splitting Infinitives&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe rule against &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/split-infinitives\"&gt;split infinitives&lt;\/a&gt; is another relic left over from Latin constructions. In the past, strict grammarians would object to separating the infinitive with a descriptive word, insisting that &lt;i&gt;to quickly run &lt;\/i&gt;must be replaced with &lt;i&gt;to run quickly. &lt;\/i&gt;Now it's universally understood that the writers are free to choose the style that best suits their needs.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Using Possessive Pronouns With Gerunds&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nPurists insist that writers treat gerunds as they would any other noun and precede it with a possessive pronoun. \"Mother didn't appreciate my singing during dinner,\" is technically correct, but it is also acceptable to say, \"Mother didn't appreciate me singing during dinner.\" In many cases, pronoun choice is more a stylistic choice than a strict rule of grammar.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Not beginning a Sentence With a Conjunction&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/rowdykittens\/8334859582\/sizes\/o\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11577\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled21-410x410.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by Rowdy Kittens\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nThe prohibition against opening a sentence with a conjunction is one of the most persistent grammar myths of all time. In fact, the \"Chicago Manual of Style\"\u00a0estimates that as many as 10 percent of the finest sentences ever written began with a conjunction. Since this practice is accepted by all the major style guides, it's safe to say it's okay to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/grammarist.com\/grammar\/conjunctions-to-start-sentences\/\"&gt;start a sentence with a conjunction&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Sentence Fragments&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nFiction writers recognize the stylistic value of employing a sentence fragment to emphasize a point. In general, it's still the rule to avoid fragments in formal and academic writing, but employed sparingly and judiciously, the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/sentence-fragments-0\"&gt;sentence fragment&lt;\/a&gt; is a powerful tool in prose. Of course, as with any subjective matter in writing, the danger lies in using stylistic tricks to disguise sloppy composition.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Using Gendered Pronouns&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of written English, &lt;i&gt;he &lt;\/i&gt;was the preferred pronoun for generic writing. Today, this is no longer the case, a condition causing fits for the current generation of writers. English lacks &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/are-gender-neutral-pronouns-the-wave-of-the-future\/\"&gt;gender-neutral pronouns&lt;\/a&gt;, and it doesn't seem as though a widely acceptable alternative to &lt;i&gt;he &lt;\/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;she &lt;\/i&gt;will be available any time soon.\r\n\r\nSince the major style guides caution against using a generic &lt;i&gt;he, &lt;\/i&gt;some writers have resorted to using &lt;i&gt;they &lt;\/i&gt;as a singular pronoun: \"The student needs to understand that they are responsible for bringing lunch.\" Since most editors are not as comfortable with that construction, it's best to rewrite the sentence with a plural noun: \"The &lt;i&gt;students&lt;\/i&gt; need to understand that they are responsible for bringing lunch.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, for the most formal writing, especially in academic situations, it's best to adhere to strict grammatical constructions. But for other writing, especially where style, point of view, and dialect are important to give nuance to a piece, go ahead and ignore the archaic constraints.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Do you play loose with grammar rules in your daily writing? Which ones annoy or confuse you the most?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n","post_title":"Remember When? 6 Grammar Rules From the Past","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"remember-when-6-grammar-rules-from-the-past","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-23 05:02:17","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-23 12:02:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11575","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12515,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2015-03-18 07:14:58","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-18 14:14:58","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/789iopknjpg.jpg\" alt=\"How many Fs can you count?\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12543\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n\"Finished files are the result of years of scientific study combined with the experience of years.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is 6. \r\n\r\nOdds are high that the first or second time you tried to count the Fs in this sentence you overlooked one or more of the Fs in \"of.\" The reason for this is that we often say the words in our heads as we read.

Something which completes one's equipment, dress etc.; an accessory.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;So, the correct answer to this fill-in-the-blank is complement.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nA great way to remember the difference is to think of the following: &lt;i&gt;\"I\"&lt;\/i&gt; give &lt;i&gt;compliments&lt;\/i&gt; to others.","post_title":"Compliment or complement?","post_excerpt":"Can you complete this sentence with the correct word? \"The necklace is a perfect ________________ to her eyes.\" ","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"compliment-or-complement","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-18 06:24:37","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-18 13:24:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12517","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12453,"post_author":"2","post_date":"2015-03-17 03:32:48","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-17 10:32:48","post_content":"Post written by Hadiyah Dache\r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Vintage-card-3wed.png\" alt=\"It takes me so long to reply to your text messages because I insist on using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. \" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12505\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nKeeping up with grammar rules when you're texting and tweeting can be difficult. We get it\u2014your characters are limited and you've got to keep things brief\u2014but the challenge with typing in shorthand is the risk of getting things lost in translation (and autocorrect misinterpreting what you're trying to say entirely). Communicating a clear message through texts and tweets can be even trickier now that emoji use is replacing words altogether. We've all had our moments when what we thought was a clear, simple text completely confused the person on the other end. Here are a few texting tips to help you get your message across:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Use Acronyms Sparingly&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIMHO IDC. IANAL but LMK JIC.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;In my honest opinion (&lt;\/i&gt;IMHO)&lt;i&gt;, I don't care (IDC). I am not a lawyer (IANAL) but let me know (LMK) just in case (JIC).&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you aren't a world champion of shorthand, it\u2019s easy to get a little apprehensive at the sight of a string of acronyms. For clarity's sake, it's best to stick to 1 or 2 acronyms per text. And usually, if it's longer than a 4-letter acronym, it may be better to take the extra second to type the phrase out.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Know Your Audience&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nYou: Can You MM@ Market Street? TIA. (&lt;i&gt;Can you meet me @ Market Street? Thanks in advance.&lt;\/i&gt;)\r\nThem: Huh?\r\n\r\nThough we may not realize it, sometimes we can be slightly more conversant in textspeak than the person we're communicating with. While you and your best friend can seemingly have an entire conversation through a series of shorthand texts, someone you text only periodically may not understand your lingo. If you've coined a new acronym, it's probably best to type the phrase out first and then place the acronym in parentheses.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. An Emoji Says 1,000 Words&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe good news: there's an emoji for just about everything. The bad news: many of us still aren't sure which emoji means what. For example, the high five emoji is often mistaken for (and used as) praying hands. The difference between the crying, sick, and sweating emoji are so minimal that you probably never noticed there was a distinct emoji for each. And what about the woman with her hand in the air? You may be surprised to learn that she isn't in the middle of a casual hair flip or raising the roof, but instead she's assisting you. (Her proper name is \"Information Desk Lady\".) Review your emoji with \u00a0the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com\/\"&gt;Emoji Cheat Sheet&lt;\/a&gt; to ensure you use the correct one every time. Who knew the emoji with steam coming from its nose actually means \"triumph\"?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;4. Capitalization and Punctuation Still Matter&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nCapitalizing a letter doesn't limit your character count, so there's no need to skip this step. With numbers, for clarity and speed, it's best to use numerals at all times (e.g. I'll meet you @ 4 vs. I'll meet you @ four). Also, using proper punctuation will help your reader better understand what you're trying to convey. Sure, adding that comma may use up an extra character, but it will certainly help avoid confusion and possibly embarrassment.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;5. Sentence Fragments Are Okay&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Going to the movies. Back around 9.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you leave a word out in a text message response to save some space, it's okay. Chances are your reader will still understand you. Because text messages are such a direct form of communication, you don't have to start each response with I'm\/I am.\r\n\r\nWe hope these tips help you out the next time you\u2019re in a pinch and need to send a quick text or tweet.

Sporting shamrocks and shillelaghs and wearing a bit o' green, friends come together to celebrate this most Celtic tradition -- and no one celebrates like the Irish!\r\n\r\nGiven the enthusiasm with which America endorses this holiday, perhaps it's no surprise that Irish culture has blended so happily with American pop culture. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/looking-get-lucky-saint-patricks-day-idioms-may-help\/\"&gt;In honor of Saint Patrick's Day&lt;\/a&gt;, here are a few examples of Irish wisdom and sayings that have come to be part of modern culture.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;May the Road Rise Up to Meet You&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/jpmpinmontreal\/3376735957\/sizes\/l\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11571\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Untitled11.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by jpmpinmontreal\" width=\"450\" height=\"300\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nChances are you've seen this famous blessing stitched on a pillow at your Irish granny's house or emblazoned on a plaque hung near her door. This blessing is a nod to the Celtic fondness for using symbols from nature to illustrate God's relationship with man.\u00a0Historians believe that invoking imagery, such as a welcome breeze or the warm sun, made the concept of an all-powerful Christian god more easily understood by common folk.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;It Is Often That a Person's Mouth Broke His Nose&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSure, this one plays into the stereotype of an Irishman's passion for brawling, but this good advice applies to everyone equally. If you don't want a punch in the nose, don't shoot off your mouth. Words to live by, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.irishcentral.com\/roots\/top-ten-old-irish-phrases-and-their-meanings-eirinn-go-brach-137123193-237785321.html\"&gt;Erin go bragh&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;A Son Is a Son 'Til He Takes Him a Wife. A Daughter's a Daughter All of Her Life&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis nugget of wisdom -- that any mother of sons will understand -- comes from the New Testament in the Gospel of Mark: &lt;em&gt;For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife...and they shall be as one flesh. &lt;\/em&gt;It took the Irish, however, to turn it into a snappy little rhyme.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The Older the Fiddle, the Sweeter the Tune&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis charming sentiment has several subtle variations, but most recognize it to mean that most things improve over time, or that the best things in life are worth waiting for. This &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/php1.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/knowledge-is-power-using-idioms-to-give-power-to-your-writing\/\"&gt;powerful idiom&lt;\/a&gt; was immortalized in popular culture by Gus McCrae, the feisty hero of Larry McMurtry's novel \"Lonesome Dove.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Slainte!&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nPronounced &lt;em&gt;slahn-sha, &lt;\/em&gt;this classic Irish toast means \"your health.\" From the Gaelic word for \"safe,\" this pithy exclamation stands in for the wordier, \"I drink to your good health.\" To endear yourself to your Irish friends this St. Patty's Day, grab a pint of Guinness at your local pub, clink bottles with your mates, and shout out a hearty, \"&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.irishcentral.com\/opinion\/niallodowd\/slainte-and-what-the-irish-words-means-on-stpatricks-day-118163119-238075881.html\"&gt;Slainte&lt;\/a&gt;!\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;May the Cat Eat You and the Devil Eat the Cat&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe Irish are masters of the elaborate curse, and you'll really feel the burn if your Celtic acquaintance says this to you. Most save this double-barreled insult for the worst of characters. This one is considered worse than \"May you have an itch and no nails to scratch it,\" but not quite as bad as \"May you be a load for four before the year is out,\" with four referring to pall bearers at a funeral.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;You'll Never Plow a Field By Turning It Over in Your Mind&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nMany cultures have proverbs admonishing one that nothing gets done by just thinking about it. In fact, the Irish like this sentiment so much, they have several variations on the theme. Another popular Irish proverb along the same line is \"There's no use boiling your cabbage twice.\"\r\n\r\nThere's no denying the Irish have some of the most colorful &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/crazy-english-idioms\"&gt;idioms&lt;\/a&gt; for imparting everyday folk wisdom and lore.

The name contains a T rather than a D, after all. However, \u201cPaddy\u201d comes from the Irish name Padraig, which is the reason St. Paddy\u2019s Day is spelled with a D instead of a T. \r\n\r\nThe \u201cPatty\u201d vs. \u201cPaddy\u201d debate is so hot that there\u2019s even a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/paddynotpatty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;website&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paddynotpatty\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Twitter account&lt;\/a&gt; dedicated to promoting the correct spelling.\r\n\r\nCheers to knowing the correct spelling of St. Paddy\u2019s Day!

What are the Ides and why should we beware? Here\u2019s an explanation:\r\n\r\nThe Ides of March is a date on the Roman calendar that corresponds to what we know as March 15. For the Romans, the middle of each month (usually the 13th or 15th) was called the Ides. Other times of the month were called the Nones and the Kalends. These periods were determined by the cycle of the moon.\r\n\r\nWhy should we beware the Ides? Julius Caesar was assassinated at a Senate meeting on the Ides of March in 44 BCE. He had been warned by a seer that he would be harmed by that time, but Caesar ignored the prediction.\r\n\r\nThis warning was dramatized in William Shakespeare\u2019s play, &lt;i&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;\/i&gt;:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Soothsayer:&lt;\/strong&gt; Beware the ides of March.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Caesar:&lt;\/strong&gt; What man is that?\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Brutus:&lt;\/strong&gt; A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Caesar:&lt;\/strong&gt; Set him before me; let me see his face.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Cassius:&lt;\/strong&gt; Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Caesar:&lt;\/strong&gt; What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Soothsayer:&lt;\/strong&gt; Beware the ides of March.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Caesar:&lt;\/strong&gt; He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.","post_title":"Funny Phrases: The Ides of March","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"funny-phrases-the-ides-of-march","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-12 06:08:18","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-12 13:08:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12309","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12301,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-03-12 04:58:41","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-12 11:58:41","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/3edsafd2.jpg\" alt=\"It&#039;s &quot;nip it in the bud&quot; not &quot;nip it in the butt.&quot;\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12379\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThe phrase &lt;strong&gt;nip it in the bud&lt;\/strong&gt; means to stop something before it gets going. You\u2019ve probably heard it used in this way:\r\n&lt;i&gt;Nip that bad habit in the bud before it gets out of control!&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat does this phrase actually mean? &lt;strong&gt;Nip&lt;\/strong&gt; means to remove by pinching, biting, or cutting with two meeting edges of anything; to clip. A &lt;strong&gt;bud&lt;\/strong&gt; is a newly formed leaf or flower that has not yet bloomed. To nip something in the bud means to pinch off a newly formed leaf or flower before it has a chance to grow. When this literal meaning is translated to a figurative sense, it means stopping something before it has a chance to progress further.\r\n\r\nPeople have been saying &lt;strong&gt;nip it in the bud&lt;\/strong&gt; as far back as the 1600s, and the phrase is still a popular idiom today.

Break up long sentences into several shorter chunks of text for clarity.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Passive voice: &lt;\/strong&gt;Using the passive voice\u2014where the subject does not &lt;em&gt;act,&lt;\/em&gt; but rather is &lt;em&gt;acted upon&lt;\/em&gt; by an outside force\u2014causes confusion in writing. For clarity, make sure that the subject of your sentence is doing the &lt;em&gt;acting&lt;\/em&gt; and that it precedes the action.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Sentence fragments:&lt;\/strong&gt; In order to convey a meaningful idea, sentences require a subject and a verb. The best sentences indicate who or what is doing something, as well as what is being done. For example: &lt;em&gt;I am writing&lt;\/em&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Squinting modifier: &lt;\/strong&gt;When the meaning of an adjective or an adverb in your sentence is ambiguous, you need to make the sentence clearer. Make sure your modifier is describing the word or phrase before it, or the word or phrase after it.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Unclear antecedent: &lt;\/strong&gt;A pronoun may refer to more than one antecedent, leaving readers unsure of your intended meaning. The best way to fix the problem is to rephrase the sentence in a new way so it is clear which pronoun refers to what.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Redundant Prepositions: &lt;\/strong&gt;Modern English has changed to the point where once-necessary prepositions are now considered unnecessary. (E.g. &lt;em&gt;Where did that report go to?&lt;\/em&gt;) Use of unnecessary prepositions gives a somewhat childish quality to your writing, so you should tighten up your writing as much as possible.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Conjunctions: &lt;\/strong&gt;Conjunctions (e.g. &lt;em&gt;and&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;but&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;if&lt;\/em&gt;) are used to connect words or phrases together in a sentence. Too many conjunctions can cause run-on sentences, so make sure you close separate your sentences into complete thoughts.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Dangling Modifiers: &lt;\/strong&gt;A modifier is considered dangling when it has been \u201cleft hanging\u201d by an identifiable subject or noun. Dangling modifiers can be corrected by providing the modifier with an obvious and appropriate subject, noun, or pronoun.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Split Infinitives: &lt;\/strong&gt;An infinitive combines the root form of a verb with the word \u201cto.\u201d (Examples: &lt;em&gt;To love&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;to read&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;to walk&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;to cry&lt;\/em&gt;, etc.) An infinitive is considered \u201csplit\u201d if a word or phrase comes between the \u201cto\u201d and the verb.&lt;strong&gt;\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Redundant Phrases: &lt;\/strong&gt;Repeating the same thing over and over again will not help others to understand your writing. Make sure your message is clear the first time, or explain using different words and phrases.\r\n\r\n&lt;code&gt;To embed this infographic into a blog post, paste the following HTML snippet into your web editor: &lt;textarea style=\"width: 630px; height: 60px;\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/grammar-check\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Grammarly: Use Plain English, Please\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/about\/content\/04-press-room\/fedagencies-02.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"2983\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/textarea&gt;&lt;\/code&gt;\r\n\r\nPlease attribute this content to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/grammarly.com\/grammar-check\"&gt;grammarly.com\/grammar-check&lt;\/a&gt;.","post_title":"Use Plain English, Please","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"use-plain-english-please","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-10 05:03:03","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-10 12:03:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12341","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12295,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-03-09 03:58:17","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-09 10:58:17","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Blog-post-Happy-Dagger.jpg\" alt=\"O happy dagger!

It\u2019s that little punctuation mark you use to &lt;strong&gt;indicate contractions&lt;\/strong&gt;:\r\nCan\u2019t \r\nCould\u2019ve\r\nHasn\u2019t\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Show possession&lt;\/strong&gt;:\r\nSandra\u2019s toothpaste\r\nTyson\u2019s puppy\r\nAbigail\u2019s gift card\r\n\r\nAnd can even sometimes &lt;strong&gt;indicate when something is plural&lt;\/strong&gt;: \r\nCross your T\u2019s and dot your I\u2019s\r\n\r\nHowever, another form of apostrophe is much less common than the uses described above. An apostrophe is also a name for a figure of speech that is often heard in plays and poetry. When the speaker addresses another person, often one who isn\u2019t in the room and even more often is the personification of an idea or theme, this phrase is called an apostrophe. \r\nHere are some examples of apostrophes:\r\n\r\n\"O happy dagger! This is thy sheath; there rust, and let me die.\"\r\n\"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?\"  \r\n\"Death, be not proud, though some have called thee \/ Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.\" \r\n\r\nLooking for more fun facts about language? &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/knowledge-is-power-using-idioms-to-give-power-to-your-writing\/ \"&gt;Read this post about idioms.&lt;\/a&gt; \r\n","post_title":"When is an apostrophe more than an apostrophe?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"when-is-an-apostrophe-more-than-an-apostrophe","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-03-09 03:58:17","post_modified_gmt":"2015-03-09 10:58:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=12295","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12259,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2015-03-05 06:47:23","post_date_gmt":"2015-03-05 14:47:23","post_content":"Sometimes life can be tough.

For example:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive: &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is believed&lt;\/em&gt; by the\u00a0boxer that the power is there to cause his opponent to fall down.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active: &lt;\/strong&gt;The boxer thinks he has a knock-out punch.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Trim the Fat from Flabby Phrases&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSome writers use &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/because-due-to-since-and-as\"&gt;wordy phrases&lt;\/a&gt; when a single word will do.\r\n\r\nUse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;because&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0instead of:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Due to the fact that&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;In light of the fact that&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Owing to the fact that&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nUse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;about&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; instead of:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Concerning the matter of&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;In reference to&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;With regard to&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nUse &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;can&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; instead of:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Is able to&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Is in a position to&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Has the capacity to&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Limit Prepositional Phrases&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nUse an apostrophe, not a prepositional phrase, to show possession.\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;It was the opinion &lt;em&gt;of the teacher&lt;\/em&gt; that Susan was ready for third grade.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;teacher's opinion&lt;\/em&gt;, Susan was ready for third grade.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nDon't use too many &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/how-to-kick-your-annoying-preposition-habit\"&gt;prepositional phrases&lt;\/a&gt; in a sentence.\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;The ultimate point &lt;em&gt;of&lt;\/em&gt; the discussion &lt;em&gt;with&lt;\/em&gt; all &lt;em&gt;of&lt;\/em&gt; the people was to reach a consensus &lt;em&gt;of&lt;\/em&gt; the group &lt;em&gt;about&lt;\/em&gt; what to do with the leftover funds &lt;em&gt;from&lt;\/em&gt; the fundraiser.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;The group discussed options for the leftover fundraiser money and ultimately reached a decision.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/nics_events\/2349630643\/sizes\/o\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-11267\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Untitled6.png\" alt=\"Image via Flickr by Nic's events\" width=\"400\" height=\"265\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Watch for Wordiness&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWordiness is a problem for many writers, whether it's redundancy, stating the obvious, or packing a sentence with excess detail and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2013\/mistake-of-the-month-unnecessary-modifiers\/\"&gt;unnecessary modifiers&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wordy&lt;\/strong&gt;: Imagine &lt;em&gt;in your mind&lt;\/em&gt; what a caveman &lt;em&gt;from an earlier prehistoric time&lt;\/em&gt; must have thought about when he &lt;em&gt;originally&lt;\/em&gt; saw fire &lt;em&gt;for the first time&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better&lt;\/strong&gt;: Imagine what prehistoric man thought when he saw fire for the first time.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nFor precision and clarity, excise these words from your writing:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;kind of&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;sort of&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;really&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;basically&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;actually&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;generally&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;typically&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;for all intents and purposes&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nEdit your writing for redundant pairs such as:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;true facts&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;past history&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;free gift&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;unexpected surprise&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;each individual&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Combine Sentences&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIn many cases, you can combine information from two short sentences into one complex sentence without sacrificing clarity.

My first Grammar Girl project was the podcast, but when it launched, it was just a hobby and I was working full time, so I wasn\u2019t watching the traffic closely. Within a few weeks it was #2 in all of podcasting at iTunes and the success took me by surprise. Four months after the podcast launched, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;\/em&gt; picked the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/grammar-girl\"&gt;Grammar Girl&lt;\/a&gt; website as their pick of the day, and I started getting book-deal offers and eventually partnered with Macmillan to write Grammar Girl books and to manage and expand the Quick and Dirty Tips network, of which Grammar Girl is a part.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning, my readers and listeners have been wonderfully enthusiastic and supportive. The success of Grammar Girl is all because of them. Early on, I got a lot of e-mail messages from listeners telling me how much they loved the show and that they had shared it with all of their friends.\r\n\r\nI also like to think that I\u2019m recognized as an expert because I thoroughly research every topic I cover. I see a lot of people commenting online about what they think are grammar rules, but they\u2019re going on their memory or what they learned in grade school, and they\u2019re often incorrect. Readers and listeners learn that they can trust that I have looked up the rules and history of a topic and that I\u2019m not just spouting my own opinions. In fact, I so diligently avoid inserting my opinion that at times my book editors have had to remind me that sometimes people actually do want to know what I think.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0What is your biggest grammar pet peeve?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;After years of answering people\u2019s questions about grammar, seeing how they struggle, and writing about it, I don\u2019t really have any pet peeves. The more research I do, the more I discover that many hard-and-fast rules are just consensus opinions or suggestions, such as the \u201crules\u201d about &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/split-infinitives\"&gt;splitting infinitives&lt;\/a&gt; or that using &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/top-ten-grammar-myths\"&gt;passive voice is always wrong&lt;\/a&gt;. I guess it mildly annoys me when I see &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/when-should-you-capitalize-words\"&gt;words capitalized&lt;\/a&gt; that shouldn\u2019t be, but I don\u2019t get too worked up about it.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0Is there a grammar rule you don\u2019t mind bending\/breaking?&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;I can\u2019t think of any hard-and-fast rules that I would break, but because the articles on my website are also the scripts to my audio podcasts, I write them in an informal, conversational style. For example, I often start sentences with conjunctions and use contractions. Those things aren\u2019t wrong, but sometimes people think they are, and it is definitely a casual writing style.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0Oxford Comma, yes or no?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;My Twitter fan @ravishlydotcom asked me this &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/grammargirl\/status\/544600885482242048\"&gt;question&lt;\/a&gt; in December. I tend to favor the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/serial-comma\"&gt;Oxford comma&lt;\/a&gt; because it makes things more clear and avoids the rare potential ambiguities.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0Why is good grammar important? Isn't it enough that we all \"kind of\" understand each other?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;Good grammar has become even more important today than it was ten or fifteen years ago. It\u2019s common to meet people online now, so the quality of your writing has a huge influence on the first impression you make on people. I like to say that instead of \u201cdressing for success,\u201d you need to \u201cwrite for success.\u201d I have an article that my friend Martha Brockenbrough (who founded &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/nationalgrammarday.com\"&gt;National Grammar Day&lt;\/a&gt; in 2008) wrote about the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/does-grammar-really-matter\"&gt;importance of good grammar&lt;\/a&gt; and how it can help you stay out of jail, keep your job, and even find love.\r\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you find this interesting?

Martha\u00a0recently spoke with the Grammarly team to provide some insight into National Grammar Day and to share her perspective on language.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt; You established National Grammar Day in 2008. When did you realize that such a holiday was necessary?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;Martha:&lt;\/em&gt; \"Necessary\" might not be the first word I'd choose. Food, water, love, underpants. All of these are necessary things. But I knew National Grammar Day would be a lot of fun. Fun is necessary, too, and as soon as I learned the holiday did not yet exist, I set about creating it. I was inspired by the high school students I was teaching at the time. They needed a bit of help with their grammar, and I wanted to make the learning experience lively and positive. Everyone can probably remember that teacher who made grammar seem difficult or unpleasant. I wanted to show my students the fun they could have with language. They more they knew about how it worked, the more they could do, much in the same way you play better basketball when you know all of the rules.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of rules: Much has been said about the fact that many so-called rules in our language aren't. That's quite true. But it doesn't mean people don't have certain expectations about the grammar we use. Hiring managers, potential dates: People will judge you if your grammar is non-standard, just as they will judge you for wearing a Speedo to a black-tie event (even with a black tie, which would be the worst).\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;G: What is your biggest grammar pet peeve?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nM: I try not to keep too many pet peeves. That said, every time I see \"your\" instead of \"you're,\" my soul shrivels a little more.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;G: Is there a grammar rule you don\u2019t mind bending\/breaking?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nM: There are plenty of so-called \"rules\" that really and truly aren't. It's fine, for example, to begin a sentence with a conjunction. You probably don't want to do this a lot, because it makes your writing sound choppy. But it's perfectly fine style. Same goes for ending a sentence with a preposition.\r\n\r\nAs a novelist, though, I routinely and purposefully bend the language as many ways as I possibly can to create memorable characters who feel authentic. All we have with novels are words, and out of this, we create not only worlds, but all of their inhabitants. Books breathe, in many cases, because of the artful bending of words, punctuation, and expectations. Mark Twain, an absolute genius with language (and a proponent of simplified spelling), depended utterly on making rubber out of rules. Imagine how awful it would be if someone standardized the grammar in Huckleberry Finn. That would be like putting a tasteful blouse on the Venus de Milo.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's about context. If you're applying for a job with the Queen, spray the starch and follow the most formal conventions. If you're doing something else, then do whatever it takes to do it well.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;G: Oxford Comma, yes or no?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nM: It depends. I write for a variety of publications. Some follow Associated Press Style, which is a serial comma killer.\r\n\r\nSome don't. When I write books, for example, I use the Oxford comma.\r\n\r\nIf I were in charge of the world, I suppose I'd urge use of the Oxford comma. It's easy to point out cases where confusion arises without it. My favorite is the one that says, \"We invited the strippers, JFK, and Stalin.\" This is not the same as \"We invited the strippers, JFK and Stalin.\" (For the record, I would pay many folded single dollar bills to watch JFK and Stalin strip together.) What's more, we no longer live in an age where we're communicating via telegraph, so we don't need conserve characters in quite the same way we used to, except on Twitter.\r\n\r\nThat said, the opposite confusion can sometimes arise. Consider this: \"For my sister, an orangutan, and Jerome\u2026\" It's unclear whether the speaker's sister is an orangutan.\r\n\r\nThis is why you have to pay attention to every sentence you write. Communicating what you mean in a way that other people can understand is the goal. (That and inventing time travel so we can all catch that hot Cold War stripper act.)\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;G: Why is good grammar important? Isn't it enough that we all \"kind of\" understand each other?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nM: Tell that to the person who wrote the contract between Rogers Communication and Atlantic Canada. One rogue comma ended up costing Rogers something like $1 million a year. Most of us won't be in a situation like this, but any time you write a letter, a personal ad, a job application, a Facebook status post, or even a tweet, you're putting yourself into the world for all to judge and potentially misunderstand. Just as you wouldn't want to go outside with your pants only \"kind of\" zipped, you want to give yourself the best chance of making whatever connection you seek. It saves all sorts of heartache and embarrassment, not to mention the occasional heap of cash.\r\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you find this interesting?

Read on to find out which one is correct! &lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are many (perhaps countless) homophones in the English language. These are words and phrases that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings. Here are three commonly confused homophones worth knowing:\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. A while vs. awhile&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;A while&lt;\/i&gt; refers to a period of time. In this construction, \u2018while\u2019 acts as a noun.\r\n\"I haven\u2019t read any good books in &lt;i&gt;a while&lt;\/i&gt;.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Awhile&lt;\/i&gt; is an adverb and means for a period of time.\r\n\"I\u2019m going to think about this &lt;i&gt;awhile&lt;\/i&gt;.\"\r\n\r\nIn many cases, you can replace \u2018awhile\u2019 with the prepositional phrase \u2018for a while.\u2019 If you have a hard time remembering the difference between the two, you might want to adopt the prepositional phrase strategy.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;2. Stationary vs. stationery&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Stationary&lt;\/i&gt; means not moving.\r\n\"Today I\u2019ll ride the &lt;i&gt;stationary&lt;\/i&gt; bike in my living room instead of going for a ride outside.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Stationery&lt;\/i&gt; is writing materials, envelopes, office materials.\r\n\"I bought some nice &lt;i&gt;stationery&lt;\/i&gt; to use for thank you notes.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Discreet vs. discrete&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Discreet&lt;\/i&gt; means respectful of privacy or secrecy; quiet; diplomatic; inconspicuous.\r\n\"I don\u2019t want anyone to know about my secret, so please be &lt;i&gt;discreet&lt;\/i&gt;.\"\r\n\"The cabin was nestled in a &lt;i&gt;discreet&lt;\/i&gt; corner of the forest.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Discrete&lt;\/i&gt; means individually separate and distinct and is often use in mathematical contexts.\r\n\"The syllabus was broken down into three &lt;i&gt;discrete&lt;\/i&gt; sections.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt; The correct answer is &lt;i&gt;discreet&lt;\/i&gt;.&lt;\/b&gt; Did you answer correctly?

My first Grammar Girl project was the podcast, but when it launched, it was just a hobby and I was working full time, so I wasn\u2019t watching the traffic closely. Within a few weeks it was #2 in all of podcasting at iTunes and the success took me by surprise. Four months after the podcast launched, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;\/em&gt; picked the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/grammar-girl\"&gt;Grammar Girl&lt;\/a&gt; website as their pick of the day, and I started getting book-deal offers and eventually partnered with Macmillan to write Grammar Girl books and to manage and expand the Quick and Dirty Tips network, of which Grammar Girl is a part.\r\n\r\nSince the beginning, my readers and listeners have been wonderfully enthusiastic and supportive. The success of Grammar Girl is all because of them. Early on, I got a lot of e-mail messages from listeners telling me how much they loved the show and that they had shared it with all of their friends.\r\n\r\nI also like to think that I\u2019m recognized as an expert because I thoroughly research every topic I cover. I see a lot of people commenting online about what they think are grammar rules, but they\u2019re going on their memory or what they learned in grade school, and they\u2019re often incorrect. Readers and listeners learn that they can trust that I have looked up the rules and history of a topic and that I\u2019m not just spouting my own opinions. In fact, I so diligently avoid inserting my opinion that at times my book editors have had to remind me that sometimes people actually do want to know what I think.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0What is your biggest grammar pet peeve?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;After years of answering people\u2019s questions about grammar, seeing how they struggle, and writing about it, I don\u2019t really have any pet peeves. The more research I do, the more I discover that many hard-and-fast rules are just consensus opinions or suggestions, such as the \u201crules\u201d about &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/split-infinitives\"&gt;splitting infinitives&lt;\/a&gt; or that using &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/top-ten-grammar-myths\"&gt;passive voice is always wrong&lt;\/a&gt;. I guess it mildly annoys me when I see &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/when-should-you-capitalize-words\"&gt;words capitalized&lt;\/a&gt; that shouldn\u2019t be, but I don\u2019t get too worked up about it.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0Is there a grammar rule you don\u2019t mind bending\/breaking?&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;I can\u2019t think of any hard-and-fast rules that I would break, but because the articles on my website are also the scripts to my audio podcasts, I write them in an informal, conversational style. For example, I often start sentences with conjunctions and use contractions. Those things aren\u2019t wrong, but sometimes people think they are, and it is definitely a casual writing style.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0Oxford Comma, yes or no?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;My Twitter fan @ravishlydotcom asked me this &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/grammargirl\/status\/544600885482242048\"&gt;question&lt;\/a&gt; in December. I tend to favor the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/serial-comma\"&gt;Oxford comma&lt;\/a&gt; because it makes things more clear and avoids the rare potential ambiguities.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grammarly:&lt;\/em&gt;\u00a0Why is good grammar important? Isn't it enough that we all \"kind of\" understand each other?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grammar Girl:\u00a0&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;Good grammar has become even more important today than it was ten or fifteen years ago. It\u2019s common to meet people online now, so the quality of your writing has a huge influence on the first impression you make on people. I like to say that instead of \u201cdressing for success,\u201d you need to \u201cwrite for success.\u201d I have an article that my friend Martha Brockenbrough (who founded &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/nationalgrammarday.com\"&gt;National Grammar Day&lt;\/a&gt; in 2008) wrote about the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/does-grammar-really-matter\"&gt;importance of good grammar&lt;\/a&gt; and how it can help you stay out of jail, keep your job, and even find love.\r\n&lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you find this interesting?

Often, the issue lies in separating personal email preferences from professional communication policies. Follow these tips for maintaining email etiquette at work, and you'll develop a more effective communication strategy in no time.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Use a Clear Subject Line&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe subject line of your email is your first and only chance to make a good impression on your recipient. When you draw your subject out into a rambling prologue, you'll give the recipient the sense that your message is similarly lengthy and poorly structured. When you opt for short, single word subject lines, however, you run the risk of being too vague and not offering enough information.\r\n\r\nIn a professional setting, it's best to keep your subject lines &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/email-etiquette-rules-everyone-should-know-2014-9\"&gt;clear and concise&lt;\/a&gt;. Tell your recipients what they can expect to read in your email without crossing the line into needless detail or flowery language.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;CC or BCC for Organization and Confidentiality&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/rahulrodriguez\/9162677329\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11261\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Untitled51-410x410.png\" alt=\"email, work, professional, Grammarly\" width=\"410\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nCarbon copy (CC) and blind carbon copy (BCC) features offer helpful options for keeping your emails organized and confidential. Though you often carry on email-based conversations with a few key coworkers, you may find that you need to bring other colleagues into the picture, too. Opt for CC when including a colleague on an email for informational purposes only, with no expectation of a reply.\r\n\r\nSince a BCC essentially makes its recipient's email address invisible to everyone except the sender and the BCC recipient, this feature is best used for confidentiality purposes. When you need to include a colleague or a client in a conversation without alerting the other \"To\" recipients, opt for BCC. This feature is also helpful when emailing a list of business contacts whose email addresses must remain confidential.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Reply as Quickly as Possible&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nHave you ever read an email and set it aside, only to reply a week or more later? Always reply to emails as quickly as you can, and never make your recipient wait for a reply for &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/work\/27-email-etiquette-tips-for-professionals.html\"&gt;more than 48 hours&lt;\/a&gt;. Remember that time is money, so when you delay your replies, you're only costing yourself and your recipient.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Choose Appropriate Language&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, your professional emails should not read the same way that your personal ones do. In professional emails, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/conquering-email-in-the-workplace\/\"&gt;avoid trendy language&lt;\/a&gt;, overly casual phrases, and emoticons.\r\n\r\nDon't take it so far, however, that your messages come across as stuffy or too lofty. Also, when you choose your wording, consider your office culture. If your coworkers keep things casual, you can probably feel free to tone down your overly professional email.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Choose an Appropriate Signoff&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nEmail users and experts eternally debate about the best words and phrases to use when &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/grammarly\/email-signoff-etiquette_b_4809863.html\"&gt;closing an email&lt;\/a&gt;. A friendly \"cheers\" may work in personal emails, but it comes across as too casual in most professional settings. Signing off with a simple \"thanks\" may work in many situations, but it's not suitable when your message doesn't actually suggest gratitude. Make sure your signoff fits the occasion, given your message and your audience.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Call When Necessary&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSometimes email just isn't the right mode of communication, and it's best to tackle the business at hand with a phone call or an in-person meeting instead. When your communication gets too complex or personal, eliminating email may be helpful.\r\n\r\nThis rule of thumb is particularly true when &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/quickbase.intuit.com\/blog\/2012\/12\/03\/how-to-resolve-a-conflict-with-a-colleague\/\"&gt;issues with coworkers&lt;\/a&gt; arise. Since miscommunication can happen with email despite your best efforts, know when to take your conversations offline.\r\n\r\nMaintaining email etiquette at work can mean the difference between miscommunicating and getting the job done efficiently.

If you don't zero in on your main idea right away, you run the risk of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/essay-writing-mistakes-the-3-ss-and-how-to-correct-them\/\"&gt;confusing your reader&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Forecast Your Arguments in a Thesis Statement&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nConclude your introductory paragraph with a thesis statement that ties your essay's three forthcoming arguments together.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Good:&lt;\/strong&gt; \"Owning your own cake decorating business can lead to artistic satisfaction, job security, and personal freedom.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Bad:&lt;\/strong&gt; \"Owning your own cake decorating business is a great idea.\"\r\n\r\nThe second example is too vague. A quality thesis statement provides a concrete list of facts or ideas that your reader will internalize by the end of the essay.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Present Your Best Argument First&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nPresent your best argument in the second paragraph. In this example, exactly why should your reader consider a career in cake decorating?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Good:&lt;\/strong&gt; \"Decorators enjoy the artistic satisfaction of creating beautiful cakes for special occasions.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Bad:&lt;\/strong&gt; \"People like frosting cakes.\"\r\n\r\nOur vague second example tells the reader something she already knows. Don't bore her with the obvious. Give her a compelling reason to jump into cake decorating.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Continue Your Arguments in Paragraphs Three and Four&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nA five-paragraph essay cannot stand on one argument alone. The third and fourth paragraphs should continue your pro-decorating sentiment.\r\n\r\nRecall that the example thesis mentioned three cake-decorating perks: artistic satisfaction, job security, and personal freedom.\r\n\r\nAddress job security and personal freedom in paragraphs three and four. How does owning your own business provide job security? What are the benefits of being your own boss? If you're not sure, brainstorm ideas via a Google search. Play with search terms such as \"cake decorator,\" \"owning your own business,\" and \"personal freedom entrepreneur.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Wrap Up Your Arguments&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWrap up your arguments by restating them in your concluding\u00a0paragraph. It's okay to repeat some of the same language you used in your introductory paragraph. Your conclusion is your last chance to persuade the reader, but make sure you don't introduce any new ideas.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Rest, then Review with Fresh Eyes&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nOnce you've finished your essay, put it away for a while. You'll return to it with fresh eyes, and you'll undoubtedly notice things you could change. It's perfectly normal to draft three, five, or even ten versions of an essay before you're completely satisfied.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have time to set your piece aside, ask a friend to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/the-editing-process-how-to-get-started\/\"&gt;edit it&lt;\/a&gt;.

Running an online &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/what-is-plagiarism\"&gt;plagiarism check&lt;\/a&gt; is also smart.\r\n\r\nAll good writing adheres to a structure.

If you\u2019re learning English as a second language, or even if you\u2019re a lifelong English speaker, it\u2019s a good idea to review the rules of apostrophe usage. The rules are relatively simple, and once you learn them you\u2019ll never wonder again if you should or shouldn\u2019t use an apostrophe.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;DO use apostrophes to show possession.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nWhen you\u2019re showing possession, use \u201c \u2019S \u201d after a noun. For example:\r\n&lt;i&gt;The ring belonging to Jacob \u2192 Jacob\u2019s ring\r\nThe car that Sheryl owns \u2192 Sheryl\u2019s car&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIf the noun ends with an S, add the apostrophe after the S but don\u2019t add an additional S.\r\n&lt;i&gt;The shirt that belongs to Ross \u2192 Ross\u2019 shirt\r\nThe computer that the twins own \u2192 The twins\u2019 computer&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIf the noun is plural, add the apostrophe after the pluralized noun if ending in S. No added S is needed. However, if the plural is irregular, you add an     \u201c \u2019S. \u201d\r\n&lt;i&gt;The costumes belonging to the actors \u2192 the actors\u2019 costumes (regular plural)\r\nThe laughter coming from children\u2192 the children\u2019s laughter (irregular plural)&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;In general, DON\u2019T use apostrophes to make a word plural.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nPeople often mistakenly use apostrophes to make singular words plural. This is incorrect! \u201c \u2019S \u201d conveys possession and will indicate possession, not pluralization, to the reader. For example:\r\n&lt;i&gt;I bought apple\u2019s, banana\u2019s, and carrot\u2019s at the store.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nThis is incorrect. No apostrophes are needed! Here\u2019s the correctly written sentence:\r\n&lt;i&gt;I bought apples, bananas, and carrots at the store.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Exceptions: &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nAs with many rules in the English language, there are exceptions. The exception in this case, however, is extremely logical. If the plural of the term without the apostrophe could be confused with another word, then you should use an apostrophe to clarify that it is a plural and not the other word. Consider the following: \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;A\u2019s without the apostrophe would be confused for \u201cas.\u201d&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nWhen writing letters, if the standard plural form (adding S) creates a word that looks like a different word\u2014e.g. Is\u2014it is 100% OK to use an apostrophe. \u201cDot your I\u2019s!\u201d \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Do\u2019s without the apostrophe would be confused for \u201cdos.\u201d&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nYou\u2019ll see an example of this in the blog title: Do\u2019s and don\u2019ts. The apostrophe in \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d is acceptable because it could be misread as the Spanish word \u201cdos\u201d without the apostrophe or as short form for the early operating system, MS-DOS. \u201cDon\u2019ts,\u201d however, does not need an apostrophe before the S to make it plural.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;DO use apostrophes to show that a letter has been removed.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nWhen you combine two words into one, you often use an apostrophe in place of the omitted letters. This is called a contraction. For example:\r\n&lt;i&gt;Do + not = Don\u2019t \r\nThey + are = They\u2019re\r\nIt + is\/has = It\u2019s &lt;\/i&gt;\r\nThe exception to this rule is won\u2019t, which is the contraction of will + not and has a stem change.","post_title":"Follow these guidelines to avoid an #apostrofail.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"follow-these-guidelines-to-avoid-an-apostrofail","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-26 14:31:54","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-26 22:31:54","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11759","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11251,"post_author":"4","post_date":"2015-02-25 08:00:32","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-25 16:00:32","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-11841\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Fairy-tales-intelligent1.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be very intelligent, read them more fairy tales.&quot; \u2014 Albert Einstein\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nEvery year on February 26th, Tell a Fairy Tale Day celebrates the art of storytelling. Though you may not read traditional fairy tales very often any more, chances are that many of the story threads throughout your favorite books and movies have their roots in fairy tales. Here are six ways to have fun with storytelling on Tell a Fairy Tale Day.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Take a Trip to Your Local Library&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/missindipop\/3389501692\/sizes\/m\/\"&gt;&lt;img class=\" size-medium wp-image-11253 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Untitled41-273x410.png\" alt=\"fairy tale, reading, Grammarly\" width=\"273\" height=\"410\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\nIf it's been a while since you've visited the library, make a trip to your local branch. Take the kids and settle in for story time with some real hardback books for an hour or two. Pick out your favorite &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/happily-ever-after-or-not\/\"&gt;classic fairy tales&lt;\/a&gt;, and start a conversation about how these timeless stories have influenced the movies and books that you love.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Make Fairy Tale Dice&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nFor an easy craft project that the whole family will love, try &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.eriesprout.com\/Articles\/2014\/February\/Fairy-Tale-Day-Activities.html\"&gt;fairy tale dice&lt;\/a&gt;. Print out a template, cut out the dice, and even color them in if you like. Take turns rolling the dice, and do your best to weave an interesting story from the pictures that appear. Reference some of the stories you know, or if you find the classic fairy tales too &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/parenting.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/28\/are-fairy-tales-really-for-children\/\"&gt;dark and outdated&lt;\/a&gt;, create an upbeat and modern tale instead. See how imaginative you can get with these basic prompts, and have fun telling a story.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Illustrate Your Own Tale&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIf your kids can't get enough of visual activities, illustrate a tale of your own together. Register for a free account on a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/storybird.com\/\"&gt;storytelling website&lt;\/a&gt;, and get creative with the built-in artwork. Even though you don't have to draw your own pictures from scratch, you can still let your artistic side shine. Layer as many background images, character pictures, and story elements as you want to create something that's uniquely your own. You can invent a completely new story or collaborate with the kids to tell your version of a classic tale.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Write an Inventive Newsletter&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you have future journalists in your midst, get together to compose a fairy tale newspaper.\u00a0Find a template online and insert a variety of news pieces along with updates on some of the classic stories and characters. Has Goldilocks turned into a foodie since her porridge days? Is the Big Bad Wolf still up to no good? This project can be as funny or as serious as you want it to be.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Act It Out&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIf your kids prefer to tell stories through movement, there's no end to the fun you can have by acting out fairy tales. Whether they have acting chops or prefer a directorial role, compose a simple play based on a traditional story and act it out together. If a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.earlylearninghq.org.uk\/stories\/\"&gt;shadow puppet&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0play is more your style, download forms and puppet shapes for help with the setup, and get creative with the acting.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Fairy Tale Snack&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nFood can serve as an excellent storytelling medium, too. Think about the visual elements from your favorite tales, and try to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/thewinekat.com\/2012\/09\/10\/fairytale-foods-and-storybook-snacks\/\"&gt;represent these in snack form&lt;\/a&gt;. For the Three Little Pigs, find foods that can stand in for their construction materials, like pretzels for straw or fruit snacks for bricks. If you're feeling really ambitious, try to build the candy-themed house from Hansel &amp; Gretel.\r\n\r\nEven though these stories\u00a0can be casual and free form, the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.quickanddirtytips.com\/education\/grammar\/the-brothers-grimm-rockstar-linguists\"&gt;Brothers Grimm&lt;\/a&gt;, whom we generally consider\u00a0the original fairy tale weavers, were actually serious wordsmiths. This may come as no surprise, given how their tales continue to influence even the contemporary stories that we tell today.

Good writing takes work, but it also takes organization. Here are a few organizational tips to help improve your writing:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep a schedule&lt;\/strong&gt; \r\nSome of &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.brainpickings.org\/2012\/11\/20\/daily-routines-writers\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the best writers&lt;\/a&gt; keep to a strict writing schedule, so why shouldn\u2019t you? Establish a time and place to write every day and do your best to stick to your schedule. You might not always feel like writing during your daily writing \u201cappointment,\u201d but writing when you don\u2019t think you can is one of the best ways to overcome writer\u2019s block and possibly come up with some creative new ideas.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Use an outline&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nUsing an outline might give you flashbacks of essay writing in high school, but there\u2019s a reason those essays were so well written. Outlines help give structure to your writing. They help you see where you\u2019re going, anticipate roadblocks up ahead, and envision the entire novel, blog post, or short story as a whole. There are lots of free writing outline templates available online. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/selfpublishingteam.com\/6-writing-outline-templates-and-3-reasons-to-use-them\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Here\u2019s one to get you started&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Check your tenses&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nOf course, you can check your verb tenses when you proofread for other spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. But there\u2019s a case to be made for checking your verb tenses first, or as you go through your writing, to help you stay organized and provide clarity along the way. If your writing is a mix of past- and present-tense verbs, reading back through your work is going to feel like jolting around in a time machine. If you check your verb tenses every few paragraphs, you\u2019ll be able to stay in the correct tense and have a much easier time editing your work later.\r\n\r\nAre you a writer?

For example:\r\nIt was his &lt;strong&gt;idea&lt;\/strong&gt; to enter the race.\r\nShe turned her &lt;strong&gt;idea&lt;\/strong&gt; of owning her own business into a reality.\r\n\r\nAs a modifier, &lt;strong&gt;ideal&lt;\/strong&gt; means optimal; being the best possibility. For example:\r\nIn an &lt;strong&gt;ideal&lt;\/strong&gt; scenario, everyone would do what they enjoy the most.\r\n\r\nAs a noun, an &lt;strong&gt;ideal&lt;\/strong&gt; is a perfect standard of beauty, intellect etc., or a standard of excellence at which to aim. For example:\r\nI want to be just like him. He is my &lt;strong&gt;ideal&lt;\/strong&gt;.\r\nGood character is important to me; I have high &lt;strong&gt;ideals&lt;\/strong&gt;. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Imply&lt;\/strong&gt; means to have as a necessary consequence; to suggest by logical inference; to hint, insinuate, or suggest tacitly and avoid a direct statement. For example:\r\nSaying that you think geometry is interesting &lt;strong&gt;implies&lt;\/strong&gt; that you would like to study it.\r\nBy rolling your eyes, are you trying to &lt;strong&gt;imply&lt;\/strong&gt; that you don\u2019t think I\u2019m funny?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Infer&lt;\/strong&gt; means to introduce something as a reasoned conclusion; to conclude by reasoning or deduction, as from premises or evidence. For example: \r\nBecause you are wearing a hat, gloves, and a scarf, I can &lt;strong&gt;infer&lt;\/strong&gt; that it is cold outside.\r\nHe rolled his eyes at my joke, so I &lt;strong&gt;inferred&lt;\/strong&gt; that he didn\u2019t like my sense of humor.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, in recent years, using imply and infer interchangeably has become quite common.

They often tell you how many, which, and what kind. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"He baked a delicious, beautiful cake.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (What kind of cake is it? It is &lt;strong&gt;delicious&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;beautiful&lt;\/strong&gt;.)\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Nine members of our group signed up for the yoga class.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (How many members signed up? &lt;strong&gt;Nine&lt;\/strong&gt;.)\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Hand me the broken radio so I can try to fix it.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (Which radio? The &lt;strong&gt;broken&lt;\/strong&gt; one.)\r\n\r\nAdverbs are descriptive words that mostly modify verbs but can also modify adjectives and other adverbs. Adverbs most often tell you how, but they can also tell you where or when. Adverbs often end in -ly. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"She walked slowly through the parking lot.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (How did she walk? She walked &lt;strong&gt;slowly&lt;\/strong&gt;.)\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Lately, I have felt like I need to make a change.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (When have I been feeling this? &lt;strong&gt;Lately&lt;\/strong&gt;.)\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"I prefer this coffee shop because it is nearer to my office.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (Where is the coffee shop? It is &lt;strong&gt;nearer&lt;\/strong&gt;.)\r\n\r\nThere are several adverbs that do not follow the regular -ly formation. The most common of these include: well, late, and straight. \u00a0Similarly there are other irregular adverbs that have evolved from adjectives. These are considered less correct, and we do not encourage their use in formal situations. These include: fast\/slow (increasingly used instead of quickly and slowly), hard\u00a0(increasingly used instead of forcibly or powerfully), wrong\u00a0(increasingly used instead of incorrectly).\r\n\r\nTo learn more about how to use adjectives and adverbs in your writing, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/grammar\/adjectives-and-adverbs\/ \"&gt;check out the Grammarly Handbook&lt;\/a&gt;.","post_title":"Two-minute Grammar: The Bare-bones Basics of Adjectives and Adverbs","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"two-minute-grammar-the-bare-bones-basics-of-adjectives-and-adverbs","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-13 16:27:19","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-14 00:27:19","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11501","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11497,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-02-13 16:25:29","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-14 00:25:29","post_content":"[media]&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bizarrocomics.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-11635\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/preposition_cartoon-670x352.jpg\" alt=\"preposition_cartoon\" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\u201cVampires!

Imagine not knowing where the danger lay!\r\n\r\nPrepositions tell us where or when something is in relation to something else. When monsters are sneaking up on you, it is good to have these special words to tell us where those monsters are. Are they behind us or in front of us; are they near or far; will they be arriving in three seconds or at midnight?\r\n\r\nPrepositions are helpful words that define direction, time, location, and spatial relationships. They tell us where or when something is in relation to something else. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"The book is on the table beside you.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;On&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;beside&lt;\/strong&gt; are prepositions of location.)\r\n\r\nPrepositions can also be used to contrast ideas.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"We went for a walk despite the rain.\"&lt;\/i&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;Despite&lt;\/strong&gt; is the preposition showing contrast.)\r\n\r\nHere are some commonly used prepositions:\r\n&lt;i&gt;about, above, across, after, against, along, among, around, at, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, beyond, but, by, despite, down, during, except, for, from, in, inside, into, like, near, of, off, on, onto, out, outside, over, past, since, through, throughout, till, to, toward, under, underneath, until, up, upon, with, within, without&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nSome common phrases used to require prepositions, but language has evolved to the point where they are now superfluous and sound silly. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Could you get that box off of the table?\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\ncan simply be written as:\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Could you get that box off the table?\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"The winner was awarded with a gold medal.\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\ncan simply be written as:\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"The winner was awarded a gold medal.\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there don\u2019t seem to be any rules that will help you determine if you should use the proposition or not. The best thing to do is read the sentence aloud or read it to a friend and ask if the preposition sounds awkward, strange, or unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFinally, is it ever ok to end a sentence with a preposition? Yes, and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/youve-been-lied-to-heres-why-you-absolutely-can-end-a-sentence-with-a-preposition\/ \"&gt;this blog post explains why&lt;\/a&gt;.","post_title":"Two-minute Grammar: The Bare-bones Basics of Prepositions","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"two-minute-grammar-the-bare-bones-basics-of-prepositions","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-13 16:25:29","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-14 00:25:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11497","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11489,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-02-11 16:20:24","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-12 00:20:24","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/President-Taft-670x352.jpg\" alt=\"write so that you can&#039;t be misunderstood\" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-11493\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThere is a time and place for complex, lyrical writing. Poetry, stylistic prose, love letters\u2026the list goes on. But when you\u2019re writing for work, school, or any other situation where your chief goal is to be understood, it\u2019s best to keep things simple. Here are a few ways to ensure that your writing is easy to understand.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Read it out loud&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nFrom time to time, all of us make the mistake of sending an email, turning in a paper, or handing a report to the boss without rereading what we\u2019ve written. Raise your right hand and say this aloud: \u201cI promise to reread my writing at least once before I consider it finished. If possible, I\u2019ll read it aloud.\u201d Now that you\u2019ve made the pledge, your ears can help you simplify any unnecessary complexity in your writing.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Review your modifiers (dangling and otherwise)&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nA modifier changes, clarifies, qualifies or limits a particular word in a sentence in order to intensify its presence within a body of work. Modifiers can be adjectives, adverbs, and phrases. Modifiers are helpful additions to a sentence, but using too many modifiers can complicate your language. \r\nTake this example from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/sentences\/modifiers\/2\/what-are-modifiers\/\"&gt;the Grammarly Handbook&lt;\/a&gt;:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe blond girl named Sarah, who was a foreign exchange student from England, quickly climbed the ladder of popularity during her junior year, smiling her way through cheerleading and an ASB presidency term she inched near the top and was a sure fit for junior prom queen.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf you remove the modifiers, this sentence could be written simply as:\r\n\u201cSarah was voted prom queen.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile the first version of the sentence provides great depth and detail, the second version is much clearer and to the point. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Let your punctuation guide you&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nTake a look back at a piece of writing after you\u2019ve completed it. If you see a lot of dashes, semicolons, parentheses, and ellipses, consider breaking those sentences up into two or more sentences. While these punctuation marks are helpful tools, they can also be indicators of complex sentences. If you\u2019re trying to simplify your writing, breaking down these complex sentences is a great way to do it.\r\n\r\nTo read more about simple, clear writing, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/rewriting-101-how-to-add-clarity-to-your-sentences\/ \"&gt;this blog post about rewriting&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n","post_title":"Follow these 3 guidelines to simplify your writing","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"follow-these-3-guidelines-to-simplify-your-writing","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-11 16:20:24","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-12 00:20:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11489","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11367,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-02-09 03:38:41","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-09 11:38:41","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-11429\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Vintage-card-who-whom-670x352.jpg\" alt=\"That refers things. Who and whom refer to people. Don't mix them. \" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThe basic rule for using &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;\/strong&gt; in formal writing is to use &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;\/strong&gt; when you\u2019re referring to a person, and &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;\/strong&gt; when you\u2019re referring to an object. For example:\r\n\r\nThis jacket was a gift from my cousin &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;\/strong&gt; buys me all my most fashionable clothes. (&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;\/strong&gt; refers to my cousin, a person.)\r\n\r\nWatch out for the crack in the sidewalk &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;\/strong&gt; always causes me to trip. (&lt;strong&gt;That&lt;\/strong&gt; refers to the crack in the sidewalk, an object or thing.)\r\n\r\nWhile the basic that\/who rule is a good guideline to follow, it\u2019s not technically a hard-and-fast rule. It\u2019s generally frowned upon to refer to an object as &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;\/strong&gt; (although there are exceptions), but using &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;\/strong&gt; to refer to a person is becoming more and more accepted, especially in informal writing and speech. For example:\r\n\r\nHe is the person &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;\/strong&gt; is responsible for tonight\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\nIn this case, using &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;\/strong&gt; is acceptable, although some might argue that it makes the person sound less than human, and &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;\/strong&gt; should be used instead.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about word pairs, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/who-vs-whom-its-not-as-complicated-as-you-think\/ \"&gt;this blog post about the difference between who and whom&lt;\/a&gt;.","post_title":"Follow this simple guideline when using 'that' and 'who' in your writing","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"follow-this-simple-guideline-when-using-that-and-who-in-your-writing","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-09 12:37:01","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-09 20:37:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11367","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11371,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-02-06 16:10:12","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-07 00:10:12","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/11234-670x352.jpg\" alt=\"confusing homophones passed past\" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-11419\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nHomophones are words that are pronounced the same, but have different meanings. Here are three pairs of confusing homophones:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Passed vs. past&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Passed&lt;\/strong&gt; is the past tense of pass, which means to move from one place to another or to change from one state to another. (There are a few other meanings of the word pass, but for this example we\u2019re using the most straightforward meaning.) For example:\r\nThe tray of cookies was &lt;strong&gt;passed&lt;\/strong&gt; around the circle until everyone had one.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Past&lt;\/strong&gt; means the period of time that has already happened, in contrast to the present or the future.\r\nDon\u2019t worry about the argument we had yesterday; it\u2019s in the &lt;strong&gt;past&lt;\/strong&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Dye vs. die&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Die&lt;\/strong&gt; means to stop living; to become dead; to undergo death.\r\n\"I could &lt;strong&gt;die&lt;\/strong&gt; for you. But I couldn't, and wouldn't, live for you.\u201d (&lt;em&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;\/em&gt; by Ayn Rand)\r\n\r\nAs a noun, &lt;strong&gt;dye&lt;\/strong&gt; means a colourant. As a verb, &lt;strong&gt;dye&lt;\/strong&gt; means to color with dye.\r\nI want to make a big change. I\u2019m going to &lt;strong&gt;dye&lt;\/strong&gt; my hair red!\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Poring vs. pouring &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Pouring&lt;\/strong&gt; means flowing, as water does. It can be used in a few ways:\r\nClowns came &lt;strong&gt;pouring&lt;\/strong&gt; out of the overstuffed car, one after another.\r\nThe rain was &lt;strong&gt;pouring&lt;\/strong&gt; down; the water rushed in the gutter.\r\nOnce I finally set up my Facebook account, notifications and requests from my friends and family came &lt;strong&gt;pouring&lt;\/strong&gt; in.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Poring&lt;\/strong&gt; means investigating or examining closely:\r\nShe spent hours reading her Biology textbook, &lt;strong&gt;poring&lt;\/strong&gt; over every little detail.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about confusing word pairs &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/three-word-pairs-that-confuse-many-writers\/ \"&gt;read this blog post&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n","post_title":"Learn the difference between these confusing homophones","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"learn-the-difference-between-these-confusing-homophones","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-06 16:10:12","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-07 00:10:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11371","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11167,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-02-06 11:28:43","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-06 19:28:43","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/14w457yughkj-copy-670x352.jpg\" alt=\"the difference between advice and advise\" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-11391\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThese two words sound very similar, but they mean different things.

For example:\r\nPlease &lt;strong&gt;advise&lt;\/strong&gt; me about what to do next. Should I move to Chicago?\r\n\r\nHere's an easy way to remember the difference: When you &lt;strong&gt;advise&lt;\/strong&gt; someone, you give them &lt;strong&gt;advice&lt;\/strong&gt;.\r\n\r\nLearn more about confusing word pairs in &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/the-basics-on-whos-and-whose\/ \"&gt;this blog post about who\u2019s and whose.&lt;\/a&gt;\r\n\r\n","post_title":"I must advise you to use these words correctly","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"i-must-advise-you-to-use-these-words-correctly","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-06-11 22:22:58","post_modified_gmt":"2015-06-12 05:22:58","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11167","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11219,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-02-04 12:29:34","post_date_gmt":"2015-02-04 20:29:34","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/a-little-voice-670x352.png\" alt=\"a little voice\" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11375\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nAlthough the overuse of periods isn\u2019t very common, the overuse of commas is. Do you know when to use a comma? Here are some example sentences:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Because I want to learn more about biology, I\u2019m going to enroll in an online class.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nShould you use a comma? Yes.\r\nThis sentence contains two clauses\u2014&lt;i&gt;I want to learn more about biology&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I\u2019m going to enroll in an online class&lt;\/i&gt;\u2014and begins with the subordinate \"because.\" When the sentence begins with a subordinate, you need a comma between the two clauses.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;I will come to your house, unless you would like to come to mine.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nShould you use a comma? No.\r\nThe subordinate \"unless\" separates the two complete sentences. When a subordinate is in the middle of the sentence, it doesn\u2019t need a comma.\r\nThe correct sentence is:\r\nI will come to your house unless you would like to come to mine.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;It\u2019s a beautiful day outside, let\u2019s go for a bike ride!&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nShould you use a comma? No.\r\nThere are two sentences here: &lt;i&gt;It\u2019s a beautiful day outside&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Let\u2019s go for a bike ride.&lt;\/i&gt; They should be separated by a period or a semicolon.\r\nThe correct sentence is:\r\nIt\u2019s a beautiful day outside. Let\u2019s go for a bike ride!\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Before we start the movie, I\u2019m going to make a bowl of popcorn.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nShould you use a comma? Yes.\r\n&lt;i&gt;Before we start the movie&lt;i&gt; is an introductory clause. A comma should follow introductory clauses and phrases.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;I need to eat a sandwich, and drink a glass of milk.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nShould you use a comma? No.\r\n&lt;i&gt;Eat a sandwich and drink a glass of milk&lt;\/i&gt; is a compound predicate. When compound predicates contain three or more predicates (verbs and any modifiers), they need commas. If there are fewer than three, a comma is not necessary.\r\nThe correct sentence is:\r\nI need to eat a sandwich and drink a glass of milk.\r\n\r\nFor more punctuation rules and guidelines, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2015\/three-things-you-need-to-know-about-semicolons\/ \"&gt;this blog post about semicolons&lt;\/a&gt; or visit the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/\"&gt;free Grammarly Handbook&lt;\/a&gt;!\r\n","post_title":"Commas might be the most overused and abused punctuation mark.

Some might say there is nothing at all is wrong with it. Others, however, will take issue with the use of \u2018they,\u2019 a plural pronoun, in place of the singular \u2018reader.\u2019 How can this sentence be corrected? Some would use \u2018he\u2019 in place of \u2018they,\u2019 with the understanding that masculine pronouns are a stand-in for proper nouns of either gender. Others would advocate \u2018he or she\u2019 in place of \u2018they,\u2019 because it includes both genders.\r\n\r\nGendered pronouns have a long history of causing grammatical confusion and debate. As far back as the 1800s, writers and linguists have proposed gender-neutral pronouns (including ze, co, hesh, thon, and zher) to solve the complicated issues that gendered pronouns cause in English. \r\n\r\nGender-neutral pronouns solve many grammatical problems, but why haven\u2019t they caught on in English? According to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.newrepublic.com\/article\/116331\/gender-neutral-pronouns-will-we-ever-replace-she-and-he \" target=\"_blank\"&gt;John McWhorter at The New Republic&lt;\/a&gt;, that\u2019s because there are two kinds of words: open-class and closed-class. Nouns and verbs are among the open-class words and can be adapted or even made up depending on necessity and context. Pronouns and prepositions are closed-class words\u2014words that we use as tools to show the relationships between open-class words. Closed-class words are harder to adapt and change since they\u2019re already representing something else (for example, \u2018he\u2019 represents \u2018Brian\u2019). \r\n\r\nMcWhorter argues that since it\u2019s unlikely that a new gender-neutral pronoun will ever gain wide acceptance in English, it\u2019s okay to use the plural \u2018they\u2019  in place of \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she.\u2019 Other alternatives include \u2018one\u2019 to mean \u2018a person,\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019 in certain contexts. \r\n\r\nMany other languages don\u2019t include gendered pronouns at all or include gender neutral pronouns in their structure. \r\n\r\nWill the English language eventually accept the use of \u2018they\u2019 as a singular gender-neutral pronoun? Will an alternative like ze gain widespread acceptance and use?

Dashes and hyphens look similar, but they\u2019re used in different ways.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;A hyphen (-) is used:&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n1. To connect two or more words \r\nFor example: Daniel Day-Lewis, twenty-one, user-friendly\r\n2. To indicate a range of values \r\nFor example: At the wedding, family members will be seated in rows 11-15.\r\n3. To continue a word onto the next line when there is a line break \r\nFor example: Because the traffic is relatively light today, we cer-\r\ntainly have time to stop at the grocery store.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;A dash (\u2014) is used:&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n1. At the beginning and end of a phrase to highlight parenthetical information \r\nFor example: An etymological dictionary is one of the few books\u2014no, it\u2019s the only book\u2014you\u2019ll ever need.\r\n2. To introduce new information, as a colon would with a list of items \r\nFor example: I opened the door, and there she stood\u2014my long-lost sister.\r\n&lt;b&gt;NOTE: Be careful to use the correct dash.&lt;\/b&gt; There are two kinds\u2014an en dash and an em dash. The em dash is the one you want to use in most writing and is the one we've used in the examples above. To make an em dash on a PC, hold down ctrl + alt + - (hyphen key). To make an em dash on a Mac, hold down option + shift + - (hyphen key). The en dash is used to separate numbers and measures. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/blog.apastyle.org\/apastyle\/2010\/09\/computer-editing-tip-en-dashes.html\"&gt;Learn more here.&lt;\/a&gt; \r\n\r\nFor more information on using dashes in writing, check out &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/learn-how-to-use-dashes-in-your-writingb\/ \"&gt;our blog post.&lt;\/a&gt; ","post_title":"Dashes and hyphens are not the same","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"dashes-and-hyphens-are-not-the-same","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-30 13:50:24","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-30 21:50:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11163","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11125,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-01-27 03:02:16","post_date_gmt":"2015-01-27 11:02:16","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/y54ergwefds-670x352.png\" alt=\"split infinitive\" width=\"670\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11283\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nAn &lt;strong&gt;infinitive&lt;\/strong&gt; is a simple verb combined with \u2018to.\u2019 For example:\r\nto sleep, to run, to fly, to hide\r\n\r\nRemember this formula:\r\nInfinitive = to + verb\r\n\r\nInfinitives can function as subjects, objects, adjectives, and adverbs. For example:\r\n\r\nTo wait for an answer seemed like a waste of time. (&lt;strong&gt;To wait&lt;\/strong&gt; is the subject of the sentence.)\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t stand it; I refuse to look. (&lt;strong&gt;To look&lt;\/strong&gt; is the direct object of the sentence.)\r\n\r\nIf you get bored easily, bring a book to read. (&lt;strong&gt;To read&lt;\/strong&gt; is an adjective modifying book.)\r\n\r\nMartin planned this event to show Diane how much he cares about her. (&lt;strong&gt;To show&lt;\/strong&gt; is an adverb explaining why Martin planned the event.)\r\n\r\nYou may have heard that 'splitting infinitives' is the worst of all grammar crimes. What does this mean? Splitting an infinitive simply means to add other words between the 'to' and the verb in an infinitive. For example:\r\n\u201cI plan to really enjoy the party.\u201d (The word 'really' is in the middle of the infinitive.)\r\n\r\nSplit infinitives are still frowned upon in formal writing situations. For this reason, split infinitives are best left out of a sentence. However, it is not wise to mangle a sentence simply to avoid splitting an infinitive. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about verbs read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/an-introduction-to-verb-tenses\/ \"&gt;this blog post about verb tenses&lt;\/a&gt;.","post_title":"To infinitive...and beyond!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"to-infinitive-and-beyond","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-29 14:16:51","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-29 22:16:51","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=11125","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11031,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-01-26 08:24:03","post_date_gmt":"2015-01-26 16:24:03","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/7ryufhewj-670x351.jpg\" alt=\"reading joy of life\" width=\"670\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11157\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nBeing the word nerds and language lovers that we are, it\u2019s no secret that we\u2019re also avid readers here at Grammarly.

Baseball is the direct object.\r\n\r\nAn &lt;strong&gt;indirect object&lt;\/strong&gt; answers the question of to whom, for whom, or for what.

The term ellipsis comes from the Greek word meaning \u2018omission,' and that\u2019s just what it does: an ellipsis shows that something has been left out. You can use an ellipsis when you\u2019re quoting someone to show that you\u2019ve omitted some of their words. For example:\r\n\r\n\u201cI wore my new silver, strapless, floor-length, silk dress and matching shoes.\u201d  \r\ncould be shortened with an ellipsis to read:\r\n\u201cI wore my new\u2026 dress and matching shoes.\u201d\r\n\r\nYou can also use an ellipsis to show a pause in speech or the 'trailing off' of a sentence. You should only use the ellipsis this way in informal writing, however. For example:\r\n\r\n\u201cAndrew, can you, um\u2026 never mind, I forgot what I was saying.\u201d\r\n\u201cSo, do you think we should\u2026?\u201d\r\n\r\nHow many dots are in an ellipsis? The answer is three, unless the omitted material includes the end of a sentence. You can think of that as a three-dot ellipsis plus the period at the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\nFor more tips on punctuation, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/the-ins-and-outs-of-using-quotation-marks-in-your-writing\/\"&gt;read this blog post about using quotation marks&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n","post_title":"What are those dots called and how many of them are there supposed to be?","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"what-are-those-dots-called-and-how-many-of-them-are-there-supposed-to-be","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-02-10 14:37:02","post_modified_gmt":"2015-02-10 22:37:02","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=10853","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10843,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-01-16 09:29:21","post_date_gmt":"2015-01-16 17:29:21","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/12313.jpg\" alt=\"Pro Tip:REread your email before sending them.\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10801\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nJanuary is the perfect time to make a fresh start. If you\u2019re interested in establishing some new habits this year, give one of these a try:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Reread your emails before you press send.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIt happens to all of us at one point or another: You dash off a quick email, hit send, and then discover an embarrassing typo too late. Even if you\u2019re confident in your spelling and grammar skills, chances are that if you reread your email before you press send, you\u2019ll find at least one sentence to rephrase for clarity. Get in the habit of rereading your emails before you send them. It doesn\u2019t take too much time, and it\u2019s bound to save you a headache or two.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Learn a new word every week (and try to use it in a sentence once a day).&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nLanguage lovers, this one is for you! If you want to expand your vocabulary, try learning a new word every week. Whether you buy a word-a-day calendar or just open the dictionary to a random page, try to use your new word in a sentence each day of the week. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much more robust your vocabulary becomes.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Be open to discovering new authors and reading new genres of books.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIf you consistently favor reading a certain genre of book, go out on a limb and try something different. If you\u2019re a sci-fi fan, try picking up a nonfiction book. Romance lovers? How about reading some historical fiction? The same goes for preferred authors. Ask friends to recommend their favorite authors and give them a try. You just might discover your new favorite book!\r\n\r\nWhat new habits do you hope to establish in 2015?

Sure, the sentence might be technically grammatically correct, but it sounds incredibly awkward.\r\nIn situations like these, it\u2019s best to step back and try to find a way to rewrite the sentence. For example:\r\n&lt;strong&gt;When you see your new friend, tell him or her that I said hello.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough using \u2018him or her\u2019 to indicate a person of whose gender you aren\u2019t aware is technically correct, the sentence above sounds formal and would likely come across as awkward in casual conversation. In this case, try rewriting the sentence:\r\n\r\nTell your new friend that I said hello. \r\nThe next time you see your new friend, say hello for me. \r\nSay hello to your new friend for me. \r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n&lt;strong&gt;She took over the family business because, due to a series of unexpected events, her mother was unable to continue the administrative work that she had done faithfully for over twenty-five years.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis sentence is overly wordy and awkward. Try removing information from the sentence or breaking it up into two sentences:\r\n\r\nHer mother was unable to continue the administrative work that she had done faithfully for over twenty-five years. Therefore, Monica took over the family business. \r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n&lt;strong&gt;People, parents mostly, who care about children should make an effort to teach their children the differences between right and wrong.&lt;\/strong&gt; \r\n\r\nThis sentence is repetitive and awkward. Try consolidating the information in the sentence:\r\n\r\nIf parents care about their children, they should teach them the differences between right and wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t tell whether or not your sentence is awkward, try reading it aloud. Your ears will often tell you before your eyes will if you should rewrite the sentence. \r\n\r\nFor more tips on clear and concise writing, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2013\/trimming-the-fat\/\"&gt;this blog post by C.S.

In an effort to help clear up semicolon confusion, we answered three common questions about semicolons.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. When should I use a semicolon?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIn formal writing, use a semicolon to connect two related independent clauses. Semicolons function like a soft period, separating the two thoughts but keeping the flow of the entire  sentence. \r\nFor example:\r\nLet\u2019s go for a drive; the weather is so beautiful.\r\nI can\u2019t find my car keys; where could I have left them?\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Should I capitalize the first word after a semicolon?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nYou only need to use a capital letter after a semicolon if the word is a proper noun or an acronym. For example:\r\nLet\u2019s plan to get together next week; Tuesday works for me.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Why are semicolons sometimes used in lists?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nYou can use a semicolon to separate short clauses in a list after a colon has been used. Using semicolons in this way helps clarify the ideas for the reader, and is particularly useful if the clauses have commas or other punctuation in them. \r\nFor example:\r\nI need the weather statistics for the following cities: London, England; London, Ontario; Paris, France; Paris, Ontario; Perth, Scotland; Perth, Ontario.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about tricky punctuation marks, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/how-to-use-a-colon-when-writing\/\"&gt;this blog post about using colons in your writing&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n ","post_title":"Three things you need to know about semicolons","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"three-things-you-need-to-know-about-semicolons","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-06 09:08:50","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-06 17:08:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=10529","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10523,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-01-05 08:08:35","post_date_gmt":"2015-01-05 16:08:35","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Vintage-card34r2-670x351.png\" alt=\"Vintage card34r2\" width=\"670\" height=\"351\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10565\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThe Oxford (or serial) comma is the final comma in a list of things. For example:\r\n\r\nPlease bring me a pencil, eraser, and notebook. \r\nThe Oxford comma comes right after eraser.\r\n\r\nUse of the Oxford comma is stylistic, meaning that some style guides demand its use while others don\u2019t. AP Style\u2014the style guide that newspaper reporters adhere to\u2014does not require the use of the Oxford comma. The sentence above written in AP style would look like this:\r\n\r\nPlease bring me a pencil, eraser and notebook.\r\n\r\nUnless you\u2019re writing for a particular publication or drafting an essay for school, whether or not you use the Oxford comma is generally up to you. However, omitting it can sometimes cause some strange misunderstandings, such as in this news notification from 2013: \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_10525\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"273\"]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/1386725553.jpg.CROP_.promovar-medium2-273x410.jpg\" alt=\"Image via Twitter\" width=\"273\" height=\"410\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10525\" \/&gt; Image via Twitter[\/caption]\r\n\r\nor in cases such as this one:\r\nI love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty.\r\n\r\nWithout the Oxford comma, the sentence above could be interpreted as stating that you love your parents, and your parents are Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty. Here\u2019s the same sentence with the Oxford comma:\r\nI love my parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty.\r\n\r\nThose who oppose the Oxford comma argue that rephrasing an already unclear sentence can solve the same problems that using the Oxford comma does. For example:\r\n\r\nI love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty.\r\ncould be rewritten as:\r\nI love Lady Gaga, Humpty Dumpty and my parents.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about Oxford comma?

For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;That is Sarah\u2019s breakfast.\r\nThat is her breakfast.\r\nThat is my breakfast. &lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nThings get more complicated, however, when you start using joint possessive nouns and pronouns. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;That is John and Sarah\u2019s breakfast.\r\nThat is Sarah\u2019s and his breakfast.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen joint proper nouns are possessive (John and Sarah), only the last noun (in this case, Sarah) needs to be possessive. While it\u2019s possible that the sentence could be interpreted as being about John himself and also about Sarah\u2019s breakfast, the reader will likely infer that the breakfast belongs to both John and Sarah. \r\n\r\nWhen using joint possessive pronouns, however, &lt;i&gt;both&lt;\/i&gt; pronouns need to be possessive. It\u2019s often best to restructure the sentence rather than using the pronouns in the same structure as you would proper nouns. For example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;That is his and her breakfast.\r\nThis sentence structure sounds odd. It would be best to rewrite the sentence this way:\r\nThat is their breakfast.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nor\r\n&lt;i&gt;That breakfast belongs to them.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n&lt;i&gt;That is Sarah\u2019s and my breakfast.\r\nThis sentence sounds awkward. It is best to restructure the sentence as:\r\nThat is our breakfast.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nor\r\n&lt;i&gt;That breakfast is Sarah\u2019s and mine.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nTo learn more about possessive pronouns, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/the-basics-on-whos-and-whose\/\"&gt;this post about who\u2019s vs. whose&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n","post_title":"Learning to use joint possessive nouns and pronouns might make you a grammar cop.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"learning-joint-possessive-nouns-and-pronouns-might-make-you-a-grammar-cop","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-05 16:00:03","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-06 00:00:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=10539","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10433,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2015-01-02 14:40:52","post_date_gmt":"2015-01-02 22:40:52","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/no-smoking-aloud-fail.png\" alt=\"no-smoking-aloud-fail\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10519\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nWords that sound similar are often confused.

(There are a few other meanings of the word pass, but for this example we\u2019re using the most straightforward meaning.) For example:\r\nShe &lt;strong&gt;passed&lt;\/strong&gt; me the mashed potatoes so I could have another serving.\r\n \r\n&lt;strong&gt;Past&lt;\/strong&gt; means the period of time that has already happened, in contrast to the present or the future.\r\nLet's leave that silly argument in the &lt;strong&gt;past&lt;\/strong&gt;.

Read more&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nNo matter how much you read on a regular basis, chances are that you can read more. Find times in your day to fit in a bit of reading, even if it\u2019s just a few minutes. Keep a novel in your bag and read while you\u2019re in line at the grocery store. Bookmark some interesting news stories on your phone and read them during your morning bus ride. Read to your kids at night before bed. Make reading a regular part of your routine.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Write regularly&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nJust as you can fit in more reading time, you can also make space in your day for writing. Try waking up 15 to 20 minutes earlier two or three days per week, and use the extra time to work on a story. Or, if you\u2019re more interested in journaling, keep a notebook and pen on your bedside table so you can jot down some notes from the day before you fall asleep. If you set aside specific times to write and stick to a schedule, you\u2019ll be amazed at what you can accomplish.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Share your passion&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIf you\u2019re a self-proclaimed book lover, share your love of books! When you finish a book, make a point to loan it to a friend or family member. If you read a great article online, email it to someone who you think might be interested in the subject matter. If you want to be really ambitious, start a monthly book club with a group of friends or coworkers and take turns choosing which book you read and discuss.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of ways to grow and expand your love of the written word in 2015. If your new year\u2019s resolution includes reading or writing, share it in the comments!

Another commonly used term for c.v. is r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \r\n&lt;strong&gt;et al.&lt;\/strong&gt;, from the Latin et alii, means roughly \u2018and others.\u2019 \r\n&lt;strong&gt;etc.&lt;\/strong&gt;, from the Latin et cetera, means roughly \u2018and the rest.\u2019\r\n&lt;strong&gt;e.g.&lt;\/strong&gt;, from the Latin exempli gratia, means roughly \u2018for the sake of an example.\u2019\r\n&lt;strong&gt;i.e.&lt;\/strong&gt;, from the Latin id est, means roughly \u2018in other words,\u2019 or \u2018that is.\u2019\r\n&lt;strong&gt;lb.&lt;\/strong&gt;, from the Latin libra, translates to scales, and is used to indicate a one pound weight of measure.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;p.s.&lt;\/strong&gt;, from the Latin post scriptum, means roughly \u2018after what has been written.\u2019\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Latin abbreviations, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/know-your-latin-i-e-vs-e-g\/\"&gt;this post about the difference between i.e. and e.g&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n","post_title":"The Latin origins of these common abbreviations might surprise you","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"the-latin-origins-of-these-common-abbreviations-might-surprise-you","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-12-26 09:50:18","post_modified_gmt":"2014-12-26 17:50:18","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=10375","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10371,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2014-12-24 08:27:06","post_date_gmt":"2014-12-24 16:27:06","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-10487\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/punctuation1.png\" alt=\"punctuation\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" \/&gt;\r\n[\/media]\r\n\r\nOne way to use dashes in your writing is to emphasize parenthetical information. Parenthetical information can also be put inside parenthesis \u2014 hence the term, parenthetical \u2014 but dashes call attention to the information, while parentheses take the emphasis away from the information.\r\n\r\nBe sure to use two dashes: one at the beginning of the parenthetical information and one at the end.\r\nHere are a few examples:\r\n\r\nWhile I was shopping \u2013 wandering aimlessly up and down the aisles, actually \u2013 I ran into our old neighbor.\r\nAn etymological dictionary is one of the few books \u2013 no, it\u2019s the only book \u2013 you\u2019ll ever need.\r\nThere has recently been an increase \u2013 though opposed fiercely by many people \u2013 in alternative education practices.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about ways to use dashes in your writing, read our &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/dash\/\"&gt;Grammarly Handbook section on dashes&lt;\/a&gt;.","post_title":"Learn how to use dashes in your writing","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"learn-how-to-use-dashes-in-your-writingb","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-12-26 14:05:39","post_modified_gmt":"2014-12-26 22:05:39","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=10371","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10359,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2014-12-23 09:13:05","post_date_gmt":"2014-12-23 17:13:05","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/686tg.png\" alt=\"rudyard kipling quote\" width=\"600\" height=\"315\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10423\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nQuotation marks are used to identify words that someone has said. When used within a sentence, quotation marks identify which part of the sentence is being quoted and which is not. Quotation marks always come in pairs; the first set \u201copens\u201d the quote and the second set \u201ccloses\u201d the quote. For example:\r\n\r\nHe said, &lt;strong&gt;\u201c&lt;\/strong&gt;I\u2019m going over to Jennifer\u2019s house for a few hours.&lt;strong&gt;\u201d&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe poster on the wall read, &lt;strong&gt;\u201c&lt;\/strong&gt;Hang in there.&lt;strong&gt;\"&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nNo matter what her professor said, Anna didn\u2019t think she was &lt;strong&gt;\u201c&lt;\/strong&gt;over-exuberant.&lt;strong&gt;\u201d&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTreat anything within quotation marks as separate from the rest of the sentence you\u2019ve written, and make sure it has its own correct punctuation. For example, if the quote is a full sentence, it must begin with a capital letter, even though it is within the larger structure of another sentence:\r\n\r\nThe little boy said, &lt;strong&gt;\u201c&lt;\/strong&gt;No matter what, I\u2019m not cleaning my room!&lt;strong&gt;\u201d&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe N in \"No\" must be capitalized because it belongs to the quote. The exclamation mark goes inside the quotation marks because it belongs to the quote.\r\n\r\nTo learn about other kinds of punctuation, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/how-to-use-a-colon-when-writing\/\"&gt;this blog post about colons&lt;\/a&gt;.

Modern Ukrainian language has seven cases. Finnish has fifteen cases. Even German, from the same language family, has four. English has three, which is about as simple as it gets linguistically. Presently, English cases are rarely taught because most native speakers are expected to develop intuitively a \"feel\" for the correct case usage. \r\n\r\nHowever, many people still make mistakes, and the lack of educational reinforcement ends up making the confusion worse. This article will be focusing on two cases\u2014subject (nominative) and object, in particular with first-person pronouns. \r\n\r\n[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/interchangeable-670x350.png\" alt=\"I and Me.

They are not interchangeable. &lt;i&gt;Why? They are different cases.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Subject Pronouns, like I&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nSubject pronouns are those pronouns that perform the action in a sentence. They are &lt;b&gt;I, you, he, she, we, they,&lt;\/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;who.&lt;\/b&gt; Any noun performing the main action in the sentence, like these pronouns, is a subject and is categorized as subjective case (nominative case). English grammar requires that the subject come before the verb in a sentence (except in questions). \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I make&lt;\/b&gt; cookies every Sunday for my co-workers.&lt;\/i&gt; \r\n\r\nIn this sentence, \"I\" is the actor (subject pronoun) performing the action of making (verb). To check for correct case, you should be able to replace &lt;b&gt;I&lt;\/b&gt; with any other subject pronoun, modify the verb according to person and number, and have a clear sentence. In a simple declarative sentence like this, it may seem unnecessary, but checking case this way is a good habit for when you are checking more complicated sentences. &lt;b&gt;Remember that subject nouns absolutely always are the actors in sentences. If action is implied, you should use subject nouns.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Object Pronouns, like Me&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nObject pronouns are those pronouns that receive the action in a sentence. They are &lt;b&gt;me, you, him, her, us, them,&lt;\/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;whom.&lt;\/b&gt; Any noun receiving an action in the sentence, like these pronouns, is an object and is categorized as objective case.* An object pronoun can also be used after prepositions, i.e. &lt;i&gt;\"I will go &lt;b&gt;with him&lt;\/b&gt;.\"&lt;\/i&gt; In this article, we will only focus on nouns as recipients as these are the most frequently confused. With few exceptions, English grammar requires that objects follow the verb in a sentence. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;give them&lt;\/b&gt; cookies every week.&lt;\/i&gt; \r\n\r\nIn this sentence, \"I\" is the actor (subject pronoun) performing the action of making (verb). \"Them\" is the noun receiving the giving; it is the object. You wouldn't ever use a subject noun after \"give\" here. To most native speakers and even English learners, the following incorrect sentence should grate on the ears:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;give they &lt;\/b&gt; cookies every week.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nEek. Now consider the following example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;She &lt;b&gt;gave Jim and I&lt;\/b&gt; extra cookies.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nCan you spot the problem? \"I\"\u2014just like \"they\"\u2014is a subject noun living in an object noun's place. The correct sentence should have \"me\" (the object pronoun) following the verb:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;She &lt;b&gt;gave Jim and me&lt;\/b&gt; extra cookies.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nTo check for correct case, you should be able to replace &lt;b&gt;me&lt;\/b&gt; with any other object pronoun and have a clear sentence. &lt;b&gt;Remember that object nouns always are the recipients in sentences. If an action is happening to a noun, you should use object nouns.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Test Sentences&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Mark the following sentences as correct or incorrect. If the sentence is incorrect, write the correct form. Check your answers &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/the-basics-on-subject-and-object-pronouns-answers\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n1) Martha and Jim are in the office. \r\n2) She is telling him a joke.\r\n3) Jim made a copy of the report for Lucy and I.\r\n4) I have to go.

How did you do on the test sentences?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n*There are two degrees of objective case that receive actions\u2014direct and indirect, which correspond to accusative and dative cases roughly.

They are not interchangeable. \" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-9963\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;The first thing that must be understood is that &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;\/strong&gt; are not the same.&lt;\/i&gt; They are not synonyms. They are not interchangeable. &lt;i&gt;Why? They are different cases.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Subject Pronouns, like I&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nSubject pronouns are those pronouns that perform the action in a sentence. They are &lt;b&gt;I, you, he, she, we, they,&lt;\/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;who.&lt;\/b&gt; Any noun performing the main action in the sentence, like these pronouns, is a subject and is categorized as subjective case (nominative case). English grammar requires that the subject come before the verb in a sentence (except in questions). \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I make&lt;\/b&gt; cookies every Sunday for my co-workers.&lt;\/i&gt; \r\n\r\nIn this sentence, \"I\" is the actor (subject pronoun) performing the action of making (verb). To check for correct case, you should be able to replace &lt;b&gt;I&lt;\/b&gt; with any other subject pronoun, modify the verb according to person and number, and have a clear sentence. In a simple declarative sentence like this, it may seem unnecessary, but checking case this way is a good habit for when you are checking more complicated sentences. &lt;b&gt;Remember that subject nouns absolutely always are the actors in sentences. If action is implied, you should use subject nouns.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Object Pronouns, like Me&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nObject pronouns are those pronouns that receive the action in a sentence. They are &lt;b&gt;me, you, him, her, us, them,&lt;\/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;whom.&lt;\/b&gt; Any noun receiving an action in the sentence, like these pronouns, is an object and is categorized as objective case.* An object pronoun can also be used after prepositions, i.e. &lt;i&gt;\"I will go &lt;b&gt;with him&lt;\/b&gt;.\"&lt;\/i&gt; In this article, we will only focus on nouns as recipients as these are the most frequently confused. With few exceptions, English grammar requires that objects follow the verb in a sentence. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;give them&lt;\/b&gt; cookies every week.&lt;\/i&gt; \r\n\r\nIn this sentence, \"I\" is the actor (subject pronoun) performing the action of making (verb). \"Them\" is the noun receiving the giving; it is the object. You wouldn't ever use a subject noun after \"give\" here. To most native speakers and even English learners, the following incorrect sentence should grate on the ears:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;I &lt;b&gt;give they &lt;\/b&gt; cookies every week.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nEek. Now consider the following example:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;She &lt;b&gt;gave Jim and I&lt;\/b&gt; extra cookies.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nCan you spot the problem? \"I\"\u2014just like \"they\"\u2014is a subject noun living in an object noun's place. The correct sentence should have \"me\" (the object pronoun) following the verb:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;She &lt;b&gt;gave Jim and me&lt;\/b&gt; extra cookies.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nTo check for correct case, you should be able to replace &lt;b&gt;me&lt;\/b&gt; with any other object pronoun and have a clear sentence. &lt;b&gt;Remember that object nouns always are the recipients in sentences. If an action is happening to a noun, you should use object nouns.&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Test Sentences&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n&lt;i&gt;Mark the following sentences as correct or incorrect. If the sentence is incorrect, write the correct form. Check your answers &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/2014\/the-basics-on-subject-and-object-pronouns-answers\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n1) Martha and Jim are in the office. \r\n2) She is telling him a joke.\r\n3) Jim made a copy of the report for Lucy and I.\r\n4) I have to go. Mark is calling for Lucy and me. \r\n5) Our co-workers love Martha's cookies. \r\n6) Jim and me are planning a surprise for Sue's birthday.\r\n7) We will give them extra cookies next week. \r\n8) Who did you give the money to?\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;How do you remember to use subject and object pronouns correctly? How did you do on the test sentences?&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\n*There are two degrees of objective case that receive actions\u2014direct and indirect, which correspond to accusative and dative cases roughly.

Now let me check that colon.\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-9557\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nColons often get confused with semi-colons, but they have different effects. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Don\u2019t look at me: look at the next guy!&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nThe colon makes the first part of the sentence unimportant. It\u2019s always the second part of the sentence that will give you the relevant information, although you need the first part of the sentence to tell you that; it\u2019s as if the first part of the sentence is the tattletale. Colons are used to make lists or to separate one idea from the one which follows.\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Colon Between Independent Clauses&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nA colon can be used to separate two independent clauses when a) the second clause is &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;\/i&gt; related to the first clause (not just vaguely related) and b) when the emphasis is on the second clause. While you can also use a semi-colon or a period between two independent-yet-related clauses, the colon is a little softer than the period, but a little harder than the semi-colon.\r\n\r\nIn British English, the first letter after the colon is only capitalized if it\u2019s a proper noun or an acronym; in American English, the convention depends on the format but it\u2019s frequently capitalized. If your writing must follow a specific format, check the rules for that format before capitalizing (if in doubt, it might be safer to use the lower case).\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Maggie wears a brimmed cap at all times: Strong light often gives her a headache.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Colon With Independent Clause Followed By A List, A Quotation, Appositive, Or Other Idea Directly Related To The Independent Clause&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nAn independent clause is followed by a colon if the dependent clause is &lt;i&gt;directly&lt;\/i&gt; related to the independent clause. The dependent clause should clarify or give more information about the independent clause. The beginning of the dependent clause shouldn\u2019t be capitalized unless it begins with a proper noun or an acronym, or it\u2019s a quote which originally began with a capital.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;We have everything we need for the baby: diapers, sleepers, toys, bottles and pacifiers.\r\n\r\nThe teacher spoke firmly to her students: \u201cPlease do not throw paper airplanes or spitballs at the back of my head!\u201d&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Other Uses Of Colon&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nWe also use a colon to separate hours, minutes and seconds when recording the time.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Come over around 8:15.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIn literature, it can be used to separate chapters and verses, or acts and scenes.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;Turn to III: iv in the play.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nColons can be used to identify the name of the speaker in a lengthy section of dialogue such as in a play.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt; Martin: Where have you been?\r\nAlan: Out. Walking.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIn a business letter, the salutation can be followed by a colon.\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;To Whom It May Concern:&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;Misuse Of Colon&lt;\/b&gt;\r\n\r\nA colon should not separate a noun from its verb, a verb from its object or subject complement, a preposition from its object, nor a subject from its predicate. If you are unsure, it would be better to leave the colon out than misuse it.\r\n\r\nIncorrect: &lt;i&gt;The four directions are: north, south, east and west.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nWhile this sentence does have a list, the colon is incorrectly used because it separates the verb &lt;i&gt;are&lt;\/i&gt; from its object &lt;i&gt;north, south, east&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;west.&lt;\/i&gt; The colon could be removed, or the sentence could be re-written to use the colon properly (with an independent clause on one side of the colon and the list on the other side).\r\n\r\nCorrect: &lt;i&gt;There are four directions: north, south, east and west.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the following, the colon should be removed from this sentence because it separates the preposition to from its objects &lt;i&gt;Rome, Israel&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Egypt.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nIncorrect: &lt;i&gt;When I graduate, I want to go to: Rome, Israel and Egypt.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\nCorrect: &lt;i&gt;When I graduate, I want to go to Rome, Israel and Egypt.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","post_title":"How to Use a Colon When Writing","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-to-use-a-colon-when-writing","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-11-14 06:45:42","post_modified_gmt":"2014-11-14 14:45:42","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=9555","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9513,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2014-11-13 16:45:38","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-14 00:45:38","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/thanksgiving-free-books_edited-1-670x350.png\" alt=\"happy thanksgiving free books online\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9547\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThanksgiving is almost here, and it can be a busy time of year.

Here are three words and phrases that aren't consistent or are just plain strange that can drive people learning the language to madness. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Teachers taught, but preachers don't \"praught.\" &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe past simple of teach is taught, but the past simple of preach is preached. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Feet smell. Noses run. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nTo smell in English has two meanings. One is the act of detecting a smell, and the other is the act of producing an unpleasant smell. \"Feet smell\" is using the second definition and is a common collocation. A runny nose is a nose that is stuffed up and is producing a lot of mucus, usually during a cold or allergies. Feet can also run, but in that case it means to literally run.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. An alarm goes off by going on.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis one is strange because, like many phrasal verbs, the combination of the verb go and the preposition completely changes the meaning of the written phrase. In this case \"to go off\" means to start working or go into action. It is often used when describing a sound, e.g. \"The timer is going off. The food is done!\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Which funny examples can you think of?

Intellectual improvement tips. \" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nFor most sapiosexuals, there are two extra words here.\r\n\r\nYour brain and the ability to use it effectively have an enormous impact on your day-to-day life. In everything from work to relationships to self-esteem, the mind matters. How we use our brains has an influence not only on how we perceive ourselves but how others perceive us. We've put together some tips to help you improve your brain function.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Do more things manually.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nOften we use tools that automate or speed up processes. Now, it is not realistic for you to go without Excel for crunching big amounts of information but regularly doing a bit of number crunching by hand sans calculator will keep you sharp. Likewise you could ditch the GPS and the task manager for a map and a good ol' handwritten to-do list, respectively. (Read more about why handwriting is good for your brain &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/productivity\/you-will-remember-information-longer-you-hand-write-notes.html\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.)\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Read. Then read some more.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nReading regularly not only improves your knowledge of a certain topic, but it also builds vocabulary, reinforces standard language conventions as well as gives you something interesting to discuss in conversation. If you are reading fiction, there is &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/novel-finding-reading-literary-fiction-improves-empathy\/\"&gt;some evidence&lt;\/a&gt; that it can actually make you more empathetic and emotionally aware.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Take care of your health.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis should be a no-brainer (pun intended). To keep your brain in top shape (and your entire body for that matter), you need to care for it. This means getting enough sleep, drinking more water, getting fresh air, exercising regularly as well as eating plenty of healthy fats, lean protein, fruits and vegetables. If this is not your strength, start with making one small improvement a week (e.g. replacing one soda a day with tea or water with lemon). If you struggle with it, keep trying. Sometimes it takes a while for a new habit, even a small one, to stick.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;4. Question everything.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is not just a skeptic's mantra. Asking questions and thinking about the responses are the products of a curious mind. Curiosity is your brain's best friend; it can lead you to discover new ideas and perspectives. It can give you healthier perspective on failure (\u201cI have not failed. I\u2019ve just found 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work.\u201d - Thomas A. Edison). Curiosity forces your brain to consider new modes of thought, and this pushing outside of one's comfort zone is a great way to build brain power.\r\n\r\nThere are many other tricks and habits that can help you build a beautiful brain. &lt;strong&gt;What do you do to improve and maintain your grey matter?&lt;\/strong&gt;","post_title":"How to Make Your Mind More Attractive","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"how-to-make-your-mind-more-attractive","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-11-04 07:53:21","post_modified_gmt":"2014-11-04 15:53:21","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=9387","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9379,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2014-11-03 10:53:01","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-03 18:53:01","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/etc-et-al.png\" alt=\"etc et al\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9381\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Etc.&lt;\/strong&gt; is short for \u2018et cetera,\u2019 which translates in Latin to \u2018and the rest\u2019 or \u2018and left over.\u2019\r\nUse etc. when you\u2019re writing a list of things:\r\n\r\nI am going to bring pumpkin pie, pecan pie, chocolate cake, &lt;strong&gt;etc.&lt;\/strong&gt; to Thanksgiving dinner.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Et al.&lt;\/strong&gt; is short for \u2018et alii,\u2019 which translates in Latin to \u2018and others.\u2019\r\nUse et al. when you\u2019re writing a list of people:\r\n\r\nHarry, Liam, Niall, &lt;strong&gt;et al.&lt;\/strong&gt; will be attending the awards show this weekend. \r\n","post_title":"Latin lesson: etc. vs. et al.","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"latin-lesson-etc-vs-et-al","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-11-03 10:53:01","post_modified_gmt":"2014-11-03 18:53:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=9379","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9329,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2014-11-03 10:41:53","post_date_gmt":"2014-11-03 18:41:53","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9331\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/autocorrect.png\" alt=\"autocorrect\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThere are many English words that people have trouble spelling.

One memory trick is this:\r\nU should vacuum twice as often as U think you should.\r\nHere\u2019s another:\r\nVacuum = vac + up + ugly + mess\r\n\r\n2. &lt;strong&gt;Refrigerator&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe spelling of this word confuses people because fridge (with a D) is short for refrigerator.\r\nWhen spelling refrigerator, make sure you leave the D out in the cold.\r\n\r\n3. &lt;strong&gt;Acquaintance&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThis word can be misspelled many ways, from dropping the Q at the beginning to swapping out the A in \u2018tance\u2019 for an E. One memory trick is this:\r\nYou will likely have many questions to ask a new acquaintance.

It is not\u2014well, not traditionally. Classically, irony (verbal) means that a phrase is used with a meaning opposite from the literal meaning or effect of the phrase. Irony (situational) means that an event or situation occurs with a different outcome or effect than what was intended. With irony, the appearance of something is incongruent with the reality of the phrase or situation.\r\n\r\nAccording to this interpretation, the above example is not considered true irony. It is a funny coincidence, however. Here are some examples of classic irony:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;The Titanic was marketed as the \u201cunsinkable ship,\u201d but the ship went under on its first voyage.\r\n\r\nThinking that Juliet is dead, Romeo offs himself to be with her in death. Juliet wakes up.&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nDespite the classical definition of irony, many people feel that the meaning is changing to include unexpected coincidences or funny juxtapositions (i.e. drawing trees on paper or complaining about Facebook on Facebook). &lt;strong&gt;What do you think?&lt;\/strong&gt;","post_title":"A quick clarification on irony","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"a-quick-clarification-on-irony","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-10-30 06:04:28","post_modified_gmt":"2014-10-30 13:04:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=9339","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9265,"post_author":"1001005","post_date":"2014-10-24 17:21:06","post_date_gmt":"2014-10-25 00:21:06","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9295\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/words-are-easy.png\" alt=\"words are easy\" width=\"670\" height=\"350\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\nThe great playwright William Shakespeare is famous for his creative way with words.

(It's complicated because we tend to write as we speak.) This is particularly common with frequently used words ending in \"ed\"\u2014regular past participles of verb\u2014especially when the present tense or infinitive verb form has a near identical intonation to the past participle.\r\n\r\nIf all this jargon is making your head hurt, just consider how difficult it is to hear the difference between &lt;i&gt;suppose&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;\/i&gt; or between &lt;i&gt;use&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;used&lt;\/i&gt;.

While putting apostrophes in unusual places is generally innocuous, leaving them out of words where they are needed can be confusing. If you still don't have a firm grasp on how to use apostrophes, it is time you learned once and for all. \r\n\r\nThere are three main rules for how to use and not use apostrophes. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Apostrophes are used to show possession. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nPossession is ownership. For many pronouns, we have special forms to show possession, e.g. my, mine, your, yours, their, etc. For all other nouns, we use an apostrophe  plus S to show possession. So to write \"The flower belongs to Jane\" using the possessive construction, we would write, \"The flower is Jane's.\" \r\n\r\nLearn more about possessive constructions &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/apostrophe\/1\/apostrophe-use-possessive-case-of-nouns\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Apostrophes signify when a letter has been removed.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nSometimes, in English, we combine words; we shorten them. We do this for ease of use and fluidity of thought and speech. A large group of these merged, shortened words are called contractions, and you are probably so familiar with them that you don't even notice them. Did you notice that one? Maybe you didn't. Did you catch that one? &lt;i&gt;Don't&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;\/i&gt; are contractions. They are mergers of two words; &lt;i&gt;do not&lt;\/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;did not&lt;\/i&gt;, respectively. You'll notice that in both examples the O in &lt;i&gt;not&lt;\/i&gt; gets cut and replaced with an apostrophe in the contraction. There are also a few common words that drop letters. When letters are dropped, you should use an apostrophe, i.e. 'til.\r\n\r\nNow the truth is that you probably aren't going to confuse too many people by \"forgetting\" the apostrophe in many contractions. (I am going to get flack for that from some of our die-hards.) However, there is a reasonable case to be made for not skipping the apostrophe in contractions and shortened forms of words. (Am I redeemed?) \r\n\r\nFirst, not all contractions are obvious without the apostrophe. &lt;i&gt;Its&lt;\/i&gt; (possessive of &lt;i&gt;it&lt;\/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;it's&lt;\/i&gt; (contraction of &lt;i&gt;it is&lt;\/i&gt;) are great examples. There is a huge difference in meaning between them and forgetting the apostrophe can result in unclear or embarrassing sentences. &lt;i&gt;We're&lt;\/i&gt; is another tricky one. \r\n\r\nSecond, properly punctuated contractions make reading easier. Consider \"Were goin to get em at the store.\" Without the apostrophes, it's not immediately clear what the intended meaning of the sentence is. Also imagine how autocorrect might treat these words. \"Goin\" may get swapped for \"gone,\" and \"em\" may get swapped for \"I'm\" or \"in.\" Now consider the correctly punctuated sentence, \"We're goin' to get 'em at the store.\" Things are just clearer with properly placed apostrophes.\r\n\r\nFor more details on contractions and omissions, read &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/apostrophe\/2\/apostrophe-use-contractions-and-omissions\/\"&gt;this article&lt;\/a&gt;. \r\n\r\nFinally, &lt;strong&gt;apostrophes are&lt;\/strong&gt; (almost) &lt;strong&gt;never needed with plural nouns.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe main reason not to use apostrophes with plural nouns (nouns of more than one) is that the apostrophe-S construction indicates possession! The meaning of \"Did you see an apples sale?\" and \"Did you go to Apple's sale?\" is clear. One is a sale of apples and the other is a sale at Apple. This rule also applies for writing numbers (as in 10s, 20s, 100s, etc.) and letters (\"Mind your Ps and Qs!\"). I'm not sure why so many people insist on writing numbers, letters, and acronyms with apostrophes, but it's unnecessary and still conveys possession.* If this is not making sense, check out &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/apostrophe\/4\/apostrophe-use-forming-plurals-of-lowercase-or-upp\/\"&gt;our article&lt;\/a&gt;. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;What tips or tricks would you add?&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n* There is one exception. When writing letters, if the standard plural form (adding S) creates a word that looks like a different word\u2014i.e. Is\u2014it is 100% OK to use an apostrophe. \"Dot your I's!\" ","post_title":"Why you absolutely should learn how to use apostrophes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"why-you-absolutely-should-learn-how-to-use-apostrophes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-21 15:13:11","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-21 23:13:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=9057","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9051,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2014-10-15 03:08:23","post_date_gmt":"2014-10-15 10:08:23","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/easy_easy_to_buy_for_card-670x350.png\" alt=\"I&#039;m easy to buy for.

Teachers everywhere should rejoice, and so should any students who haven't yet mastered passive voice. If you're still new to this and aren't sure how passive voice works or why Rebecca's work-around is so boo-tiful, let us explain. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Passive Voice&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nOdds are high that you have, at some point in your life, had passive voice marked on an essay or piece of writing. Odds are higher that you probably had no idea what in the world that meant. Basically, it is this. Passive voice is when the noun being acted upon is made the subject of the sentence. (Active voice is when the noun doing the action is the subject.) Let me explain with an example. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"The house was haunted.\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\n\"The house\" is the noun being acted upon, in other words \"house\" is the object of the verb \"to haunt\". It's clear here that the house is not doing the haunting. It is not doing the action. It is receiving the action. However, it is the subject of the sentence, which makes this sentence a passive voice sentence. (In an active voice sentence, the noun performing the action should be the subject. In this case, the active voice version would be: \"Ghosts haunted the house.\")\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Using \"by zombies\" to help identify passive voice\r\n&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nIf you are still having trouble understanding passive voice, here is where Rebecca's idea can help. Usually (but not always), passive voice can include the actor, usually following the verb. Basically, if you can add \"by zombies\" after the verb and it makes sense, you probably have passive voice. \r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"The town was attacked (by zombies).\"&lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nYes, this makes sense; therefore, it is a passive voice sentence. To make this sentence active, you will need to put the noun doing the action in the subject location of the sentence. That is: \"Zombies attacked the town.\" Now we can check for passive voice:\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;\"Zombies attacked the town (by zombies).\" &lt;\/i&gt;\r\n\r\nNo, this doesn't make sense; therefore it is active voice.\r\n\r\nThese are simple examples and not every passive voice sentence will be identifiable with this trick, but it will help for a significant number of examples. &lt;strong&gt;If you would like to help others learn how to identify the passive voice, leave your tips, tricks, and exceptions in the comments! &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","post_title":"A scary-easy way to help you find passive voice!

Which is why it's remarkable that so few people understand it. So, here it goes:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Affect\u2014with an a\u2014is a verb. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n\"The man's pleas didn't affect the judge.\"\r\n\"I was deeply affected by the film.\"\r\n\"How does that affect us?\"\r\n\"Her style of acting is too affected.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Effect\u2014with an e\u2014is a noun. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n\"The man's pleas had no effect on the judge.\"\r\n\"The film had a profound effect on me.\"\r\n\"What will the effect be?\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The exceptions (and why they almost aren't important for you.)&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe main exceptions to this rule are simple.\r\n\r\nFirst, for some reason, some medical writing (especially in psychology) uses \"affect\" as a noun.

Perhaps more critically, would you like to impress someone who values strong English skills? There are several facts about English grammar and usage that will inevitably impress those who love proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Additionally, there are certain \"acts of love\" that will be a whole quiver of Cupid's arrows for wooing a English language lover.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;1. Always proofread. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhether you're sending a text message or a thoughtful love letter, always read, revise, and\u2014when necessary\u2014rewrite.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Learn the differences between the most frequently used homophones. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nHomophones are words that sound the same but are spelled differently. Some of the most common mix-ups are &lt;em&gt;your-you're, to-too-two&lt;\/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;there-their-they're&lt;\/em&gt;. Here is &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/mechanics\/spelling\/6\/words-that-sound-alike\/\"&gt;a great list&lt;\/a&gt; of some more of the most common homophones and how they are correctly used.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Read more books. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nBookworms aren't the only ones who value books. English language lovers cherish books because reading helps build a strong vocabulary and improves thought construction in speaking and writing. (Though to be honest, most English language lovers are proud bookworms, and many proud bookworms are lovers of language.) It is always a great idea to be able to discuss passions with friends and lovers. In order to discuss books, however, you must\u2014you guessed it\u2014read books. If you are short on time, you can find some lists of quick-reads here and here.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;4. Stop misusing apostrophes. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nApostrophes are used only to show possession (ownership) or to signal missing letters, as in &lt;em&gt;we'll&lt;\/em&gt; (we will). They are never used to form the plural of a word. That is, you should never write: \"The cat's love to play.\" It is always \"The cats love to play.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;5. Learn the proper use of &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;whomever&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;Whom&lt;\/em&gt; is an objective form of &lt;em&gt;who&lt;\/em&gt;, just like &lt;em&gt;him&lt;\/em&gt; is the object form of &lt;em&gt;he&lt;\/em&gt;. Usually you should use &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;\/em&gt; wherever you would use &lt;em&gt;him&lt;\/em&gt;. \"To whom did you give the roses? To him.\" &lt;em&gt;Whomever&lt;\/em&gt; is a little more tricky but follows similar logic. &lt;em&gt;Whoever&lt;\/em&gt; is used as the subject of the sentence. &lt;em&gt;Whomever &lt;\/em&gt;is used as the object. So, for example:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever wants to go to the movies on Friday is welcome to join us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give the package to whomever is at the front desk.\"\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;6. Write more.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that English language lovers are crazy about words. There is something about the permanence of the written word that intensifies thoughts. Writing letters and thoughts down\u2014whether on paper or beautifully in a text message\u2014will win the heart of a English language nerd.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;7. Never misspell &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;\/em&gt;.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nA lot is always two words. Period.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;8. Avoid using non-words. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are some words that you should not use around language pedants. Many English language lovers are fairly traditional in their interpretations of grammar and lexicon (vocabulary). Knowing this, it is probably safer to avoid using what are often considered non-words in English\u2014irregardless, supposably (actually a real word but often used incorrectly), etc.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;9. Learn basic punctuation and capitalization. &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nYou probably learned the basics of capitalization and punctuation in elementary school but haven't reviewed them since. If you doubt the placement of that comma or the capitalization of the seasons (hint: you don't capitalize seasons), check out our writing guide on &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/punctuation\/\"&gt;punctuation&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/handbook\/mechanics\/capitalization\/\"&gt;capitalization&lt;\/a&gt;.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;10. Correctly use &lt;em&gt;less&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;\/em&gt; (as well as &lt;em&gt;much&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;many&lt;\/em&gt;).&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;Less&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fewer&lt;\/em&gt; are commonly confused. (Next time you check out at the grocery store, look for \"12 items or less.\" Oops.) The same rule for remembering which to use works also for &lt;em&gt;much&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;many&lt;\/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fewer&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;many&lt;\/em&gt; are used with countable, discrete items, like socks or coins. &lt;em&gt;Less&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;much&lt;\/em&gt; are used with uncountable, collective nouns, like milk or money.\r\n","post_title":"10 Rules for Dating an English Language Lover","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"10-rules-for-dating-an-english-language-lover","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-21 15:08:00","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-21 23:08:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=8805","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":8801,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2014-10-01 02:28:53","post_date_gmt":"2014-10-01 09:28:53","post_content":"[media]&lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/453c9cc26ba9fc75ff4046dd86c51f5b-537dcf1d4137f.png\" alt=\"grammar, nerd\" width=\"655\" height=\"342\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6412\" \/&gt;[\/media]\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;5 Signs That You\u2019re Hopelessly Addicted to Proper Grammar&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nSo you've appointed yourself the honorary proofreader for your Facebook feed?

In English, we mostly use subjunctive when we talk about desires, wishes or conditions that are not real. It usually turns up in dependent clauses. This a tough one to spot in English because the subjunctive form for many verbs looks the same as past simple tense. \r\n\r\n\"&lt;strong&gt;I had&lt;\/strong&gt; cake.\" (past simple, had)\r\n\r\n\"If &lt;strong&gt;we had&lt;\/strong&gt; cake, we would be eating it.\" (subjunctive mood, had)\r\n\r\nSubjunctive, specifically, should look just like the second-person singular past simple (past tense verb for you), which is why we should use \"were\" (second-person singular past simple) and not \"was\" (first-person, third-person singular past simple.)\r\n\r\n\"&lt;strong&gt;You loved&lt;\/strong&gt; swimming when you were a kid.\" (past simple)\r\n\r\n\"If &lt;strong&gt;you loved&lt;\/strong&gt; studying like you love swimming, you would get better marks!\" (subjunctive)\r\n\r\n\"&lt;strong&gt;She was&lt;\/strong&gt; a brilliant scientist.\" (past simple)\r\n\r\n\"I wish &lt;strong&gt;I were&lt;\/strong&gt; as dedicated to my research as she was.\" (subjunctive)\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;The good news? &lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe verb \"to be\" is practically the only verb that isn't the same for all conjugations. So that means, even if you are still struggling to understand the subjunctive, if you memorize that you should use \"were\" for unreal conditions (\"I wish\" and \"If\" phrases), you will be fine! \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;i&gt;*There are two errors here, if you speak or use British English.

Luckily for those poor, persecuted prepositions, that the rule isn\u2019t so hard and fast anymore. Here are a few preposition guidelines:\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Don\u2019t end a sentence with a preposition:&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n1. In formal writing\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Incorrect:&lt;\/strong&gt; Who were the most articles written about?\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Correct:&lt;\/strong&gt; About whom were the most articles written?\r\n\r\nIn emails, text messages, and notes to friends, ending a sentence with a preposition is informal and accepted. However, if you\u2019re writing a research paper or submitting a business proposal, using formal language is your best option. In those cases, avoid ending sentences with a preposition.\r\n\r\n2. If something is missing\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Incorrect:&lt;\/strong&gt; He walked down the street at a brisk pace, with his waistcoat buttoned against the cold and a jaunty top hat perched atop.\r\nThe preposition 'atop' is missing an object. Let\u2019s try that again:\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Correct:&lt;\/strong&gt; He walked down the street at a brisk pace, with his waistcoat buttoned against the cold and a jaunty top hat perched atop his stately head.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;It\u2019s ok to end a sentence with a preposition:&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n\r\n1. In informal writing or conversation\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Correct:&lt;\/strong&gt; To whom should I give a high five?\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Also correct:&lt;\/strong&gt; Who should I give a high five to?\r\n\r\nUnless you\u2019re a time traveler from another era, you\u2019ll probably use the second sentence when speaking. Informal language\u00a0is generally accepted in conversation and will likely allow your conversation to flow more smoothly, since your friends won\u2019t be distracted by your perfectly precise sentence construction.\r\n\r\n2. If the preposition is part of an informal phrase\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Correct:&lt;\/strong&gt; Five excited puppies is almost too many to put up with.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Also correct:&lt;\/strong&gt; A good plate of spaghetti should not be so hard to come by.\r\n\r\nBoth \u2018put up with\u2019 and \u2018hard to come by\u2019 are commonly accepted informal phrases, and it\u2019s ok to end sentences with them. Note, however, that you should avoid these phrases in formal writing.\r\n","post_title":"You've been lied to.

Whole vs. hole&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nThe &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;\/strong&gt; group of ants marched around the edge of the &lt;strong&gt;hole&lt;\/strong&gt;.\r\n\r\nThe difference:\r\nWhole means the entirety of something.\r\nA hole is a hollow place or pit that you can fall inside.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3.

Allowed vs. aloud&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nDuring silent reading time, students are not &lt;strong&gt;allowed&lt;\/strong&gt; to read their books &lt;strong&gt;aloud&lt;\/strong&gt;.\r\n\r\nThe difference:\r\nAllowed means that permission has been granted.\r\nAloud is something verbalized, or said out loud.

If you want to flatter someone you can choose either a simile or metaphor, depending on how extreme your feelings are.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2. Comparing Life&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Simile:&lt;\/strong&gt; Life is like a box of chocolates.\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Metaphor:&lt;\/strong&gt; Life is a highway, and I want to ride it all night long.\r\n\r\nThe words \u201clike\u201d and \u201cas\u201d usually distinguish similes from metaphors. Wondering if something is a simile? Just check for the words \u201clike\u201d or \u201cas\u201d and if you see them, chances are you have a simile.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. Comparing Foxes&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Simile:&lt;\/strong&gt; He\u2019s as sly as a fox\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Metaphor:&lt;\/strong&gt; He\u2019s a fox!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to similes and metaphors, a few small words can change the meaning of a sentence drastically. Choose your words carefully when you\u2019re describing someone or something using a simile or metaphor, or you just might end up saying something you don\u2019t intend!\r\n","post_title":"Rhetorical Devices for Dummies: Making Comparisons","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"rhetorical-devices-for-dummies-making-comparisons","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-19 18:02:09","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-20 02:02:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=8155","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3","filter":"raw"},{"ID":8139,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2014-09-01 07:16:40","post_date_gmt":"2014-09-01 14:16:40","post_content":"[media]&lt;img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8141\" src=\"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/eat-your-dinner.png\" alt=\"&quot;Eat your dinner&quot; is not the same as &quot;Eat .

You're dinner.&lt;\/em&gt;\r\n\r\nThat apostrophe (') is important! There are often a lot of hilarious (sometimes scary) sentences that come about when people confuse \"your\" and \"you're.\" To avoid looking like a creep, it's best to remember that &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;\/strong&gt; is the possessive form of &lt;strong&gt;you.&lt;\/strong&gt; It functions just like &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;\/strong&gt; does in relation to &lt;strong&gt;me.&lt;\/strong&gt; If you get confused by that, you can memorize &lt;strong&gt;you're as the contraction (short form) of \"you are.\"&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\nYour = the possessive form of you\r\nYou're = the short form of you are.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;2.

The comma tells the reader that Granny isn't the object of the verb \"eat.\" That is, with the comma, Granny isn't on the main course tonight. The function of the comma here is to show that the sentence \"let's eat\" is directed to an audience, Grandma.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;3. I love cooking, my dogs, and my family. vs. I love cooking my dogs and my family.&lt;\/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Normal:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I love cooking, my dogs, and my family.&lt;\/em&gt;\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Cannibalistic: &lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love cooking my dogs and my family.&lt;\/em&gt;\r\n\r\nSimilar to number two, the commas here keep the nouns \"dogs\" and \"family\" from becoming unintentional objects of the verb \"cooking.\" In general, use commas to break up the items in lists.\r\n","post_title":"3 Punctuation Mistakes That Can Make You Look Like A Cannibal","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"3-punctuation-mistakes-that-can-make-you-look-like-a-cannibal","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2015-01-19 18:01:32","post_modified_gmt":"2015-01-20 02:01:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/?p=8139","menu_order":0,"post_type":"post","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":8125,"post_author":"6","post_date":"2014-08-27 03:45:59","post_date_gmt":"2014-08-27 10:45:59","post_content":"At the 2014 Emmy Awards, Chris Hardwick humorously addresses Internet trolls and publicly clarifies the proper use of \"you're.\" #HardwickSmash\r\n \r\nAll we can say is: \"Thank you, Mr. Hardwick.\"\r\n\r\nWhat other grammar lessons would you like to have taught to Internet trolls?  \r\n\r\n[vid]\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QrXiuVMu-Fg[\/vid]\r\n\r\nFootage from NBC and the Emmy Awards.
