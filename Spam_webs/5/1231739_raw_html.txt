        "articleBody": "\u000A\u000A  See the Slideshow\u000A\u000A  Watch the Video \u000A\u000A Derrick Rose, the reigning NBA MVP, lives on the eighty-fourth floor of the Trump building in Chicago, one of the tallest buildings in the country, right up near the roof, with wall-length windows overlooking the city he rules, the only city he has ever known. The view is disorienting and all-encompassing, sort of like he\u0027s living on an observation deck of the Willis Tower, which happens to be right over there, one of the only points above us in the mess of verticals downtown.\u000A\u000A Rose also has a home in Northbrook, by the Bulls\u0027 training complex, but he says he has that place mostly for convenience, so he doesn\u0027t have to drive back into the city after practice. Someday he\u0027d like to have a house, \u0022my real house,\u0022 where he\u0027ll \u0022have kids and just live in my spot.\u0022 But he can\u0027t do that now, not even close. This condo, the one he just moved into about a month agoit is almost entirely unfurnished; two of his bedrooms have no sheets on the beds and are filled with stacks of unopened bosthis is his escape for now. Eighty-four stories up in the sky, secured away.\u000A\u000A \u0022I like living here,\u0022 he says. \u0022They just try to make you comfortable. The people here, they are mostly from out of town; they don\u0027t know who I am. That\u0027s why I picked this place.\u0022 (It\u0027s easy to understand why one would enjoy working in this building, too. When Rose orders two bottled waters for us during our chat, he hands the bellhop two $50 bills.) Presidents talk about how the White House begins to feel like a prison. Rose speaks the same way about the town that adores him. \u0022It gets on my nerves that I just can\u0027t go out,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s just boundaries now. People are like, \u0027You can\u0027t go here, you can\u0027t go there, you got to let that person know where you\u0027re going.\u0027 It\u0027s just weird. I\u0027m never alone. Ever.\u0022\u000A\u000A The afternoon I visit his condo is a rare one for Rose during this truncated, lockout-compressed NBA schedule: a day off. Last night he played his first game in almost two weeks, and in the locker room post-buzzer, everyone desperately wanted to pick his brain. Rose had missed the last five Bulls outings with back spasms, but he certainly didn\u0027t look to be too agonized, scoring twenty-three points and notching six assists in a breezy 90&amp;#x2013;79 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. In one memorable sequence, he sidewinded himself through several Hawks defenders, pulled the ball above his head, absorbed contact, and then spun it just so, kissing the backboard and splashing through. He fell hard to the floor, popped up, and sunk the free throw. The back was feeling better.\u000A\u000A Postgame, there were probably three dozen media members laser-focused on Rose\u0027s locker, from WGN to the Chicago Tribune to someone whose credentials seemed to say \u0022MARS.\u0022 Before too long the crowd grew even more robust, at least five people deep in a semicircle around Rose\u0027s chair. With the mess of Fourth Estaters spreading farther and farther out to the middle of the room, the odds I\u0027d hear a word Rose said were approaching zero. I strained, I jumped, I peered, but nothing.\u000A\u000A Just then, a Bulls rep burst into the room. \u0022He\u0027s not coming, you guys,\u0022 he said. \u0022He already left.\u0022 The media horde did this collective shoulder sag and, like the ripple from a drop of water, dispersed randomly in all directions from Rose\u0027s locker. They\u0027d been packed in so tightly in anticipation of his appearance that I\u0027d had no idea he was not, in fact, at his locker. Derrick Rose is surrounded even when he isn\u0027t there.\u000A\u000A Nick Friedell, the Bulls beat reporter for ESPN Chicago, walked toward me and looked as though he\u0027d seen some mythical creature, maybe a chupacabra. \u0022He has almost never done that since I started working this beat,\u0022 he said. \u0022I\u0027m stunned.\u0022 Friedell joined some of his regular colleagues, and the conversation turned to how Michael Jordan never pulled this, how he always made an appearance no matter what. Off to the side, reserve point guard John Lucas III, the unfortunate soul saddled with the locker next to Rose\u0027s, politely nudged his way through the morass and dropped his towel.\u000A\u000A In his condo, I ask Rose why he blew off the media the night before. He sighs and forces a wan smile. He has been expecting this question, if not necessarily so soon. \u0022It was just too much,\u0022 he says. \u0022I just couldn\u0027t do it. I just couldn\u0027t deal with it. There were so many people. I saw them there from the other room. And when I thought about having to go in there, I just couldn\u0027t work my way up to it.\u0022 He pauses and takes a sip of water. His eyes go somewhere beyond my left ear. \u0022There were so many of them. I hope they\u0027ll forget about it.\u0022\u000A\u000A A little later, Rose shifts to thinking about the twenty-four hours he has entirely to himself. \u0022This is gonna be the best day,\u0022 he says, smiling widely. \u0022Some friends may come over. I might get on the phone. That\u0027s it. It makes me superhappy to have this whole day to myself, to be a little selfish, to eat whatever I want, to not have anyone asking me to do things. When you get a chance to have a day like today, you have to take advantage of it.\u0022 But after I leave, he plans to exploit this rare opportunity by going nowhere.\u000A\u000A As the star of a top team in a league that markets individuals more than any other sport in America (a league that has long had a reputation of harboring the hardest-partying athletes in America), Rose bristles at the thought of going out. In one way, this is refreshing. He just wants to do his own thing. But the more I think about itthe more I hear Rose talk about how little he enjoys interacting with strangers, how desperately he misses being able to walk around unnoticed, how mournful he gets when the topic of \u0022attention\u0022 is breached, how obviously uncomfortable he is even in basic social situations outside his immediate circleit strikes me as unbearably sad.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s another reason his one salvation is on a basketball court, where he can focus on winning and nothing else. (\u0022He came packaged like that,\u0022 his agent, BJ Armstrong, says. \u0022That box was already packaged. That is who he is.\u0022) But even that\u0027s becoming a problem. Because the thing that Derrick Rose likes to do more than anything else in the worldwinning basketball gamesis making it more and more dicult to avoid the thing he dislikes more than anything in the world. \u0022Don\u0027t get me wrong. I don\u0027t take anything for granted,\u0022 he says. \u0022But it seems like the better I play, the more attention I get. And I can\u0027t get away from it. You play great, you get attention. But I hate attention. It is weird. I\u0027m in a bind. The more you win, the more they come.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Rose has gone from wide-eyed freshman at the University of Memphis to one of the most recognizable athletes in the world in the span of about four years. Only Jeremy Lin, who made a comparable journey in approximately ten days, can possibly eclipse that sort of rise to megafame, and even he\u0027s older than Rose. Last season, at 22, Rose became the youngest ever NBA MVP; he has played in three All-Star games in his first four seasons; he is the signature star and unquestioned leader of one of the best teams in the NBA.\u000A\u000A And he is doing all this in the city where he was born, where he sprouted his first mustache, a place he has really only ever left for away games. Chicago has a proud, historic basketball tradition, from Isiah Thomas to Dwyane Wade to George Mikan. But none of those guys ever played for the Bulls. And none of them, not even Wade, are nearly as electrifying. Derrick Rose is as much a Chicago hero today as Barack Obama.\u000A\u000A When you watch a Chicago Bulls game, your eyes immediately smash-cut to Rose, no matter what else is going on, no matter where the ball is. It\u0027s as if he\u0027s glowing. Rose has an extra, automatic step, a palpable pep that often creates the illusion that he has tiny pogo sticks in his shoes. (One suspects Adidas, which just signed Rose to a \u0022lifetime\u0022 contract reportedly worth more than $200 million, would like it if I claimed that he does.) Rose can pass and shoot and rebound (despite standing \u0022just\u0022 six-feet-three), but Derrick Rose is Derrick Rose because of the way he drives the lane.\u000A\u000A Simply put, Rose does things in midair leaps to the basket that break physical laws of accepted human behavior. To watch those moves in real time is to not do them justice. Rose\u0027s brilliance is such that slow motion is required to understand what, exactly, is going on up therethe same way you need to change frame rate to comprehend fully how a gun fires a bullet or a hummingbird flaps its wings. Rose seems able to control every muscle of his body while in midair: He\u0027s able to move past, over, and sometimes under defenders, almost always drawing contact. And he still finishes the play; Rose spins the ball on layups as if he\u0027s bowling on ice. My favorite ever was a dunk over then Knick Danilo Gallinari last season in which Rose appeared to speed up three-quarters of the way to the rim; it looked like someone dropped him from the rafters. His ability to finish is such a leap in basketball evolution that it feels like a mutation.\u000A\u000A \u0022When we used to play in the park,\u0022 he says, \u0022there were no fouls, so that\u0027s why I shoot the crazy shots I do. Because I knew I was gonna get fouled, but I still got to make the shot.\u0022\u000A\u000A Rose grew up on the South Side of Chicago, in the Englewood neighborhood, one of the most notoriously dangerous communities in the country. (In 1991, when Rose was 2 years old, Englewood suffered ninety-nine murders. It\u0027s also the childhood home of Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, whose mother, brother, and 7-year-old nephew were murdered there in 2008.) Rose is the youngest of four brothers raised by a single mother. His talent was apparent at once and, by a family in challenging circumstances, nurtured and harbored as if it were the only hope on earth. \u0022The people who are there for me have always been there for me,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A The stories of how Rose\u0027s familyhis mother, Brenda, and his three brothers, Dwayne, Reggie, and Allanprotected him and one another are part of the Rose Legend at this point. How drug dealers were often more afraid of Brenda than any rival gangs, how the three brothers made certain Derrick was never left alone with untoward outside influences, how they created their own AAU team for Derrick so they\u0027d be able to monitor all his comings and goings. The family heavily influenced his choice of both high school and college, protecting Rose against hardship and failure to such a degree that it\u0027s suspected someone else took his SATs. (Based on this charge, the University of Memphis vacated all its wins in Rose\u0027s one season with the team.) You can make a strong argument that Rose has been under protection since the moment he picked up a basketball.\u000A\u000A \u0022I was the best kid in my neighborhood at a young age,\u0022 he says. \u0022My whole life. I was always the one everyone was talking about. I\u0027ve never really wanted the attention, but it has always been there.\u0022\u000A\u000A The way the story is generally told, this attention and shelter is what saved Derrick from suffering the same sad fate as many Chicago basketball prospectsfrom Ben Wilson (a top-tier high school recruit who was shot and killed in 1984) to Ronnie Fields (the Chicago Public League legend who suffered a serious car accident, lost his shot at a scholarship, and never made the NBA) to Jereme Richmond (the former Illinois forward who pleaded guilty to unlawful use of a weapon just this year). And yet for better or worse, Rose has essentially been walled off from the rest of the planet his entire life. He has always been the person around whom pieces have revolved, but he has never been the one actively commanding those pieces to move. It has turned him into a quiet person, the one guy in any room who\u0027s always listening. This has brought its own advantages.\u000A\u000A \u0022I have said his greatest asset, his greatest quality, is that he is a phenomenal, phenomenal listener,\u0022 BJ Armstrong says. Armstrong, who played on three of those Jordan championship teams, is now one of Rose\u0027s closest mentors. \u0022He listens. He is able to take information, decipher what is important, decipher what is not important, and gets to the crux, right to the heart of what is going on right there.\u0022\u000A\u000A Rose calls this going into stealth mode. \u0022I was always the kid who didn\u0027t say too much, and people didn\u0027t think I knew that much,\u0022 he says. \u0022But I always knew everything that was going on in the room and always knew my surroundings.\u0022\u000A\u000A I suggest that this is the sort of skill that might benefit someone who plays his particular position. \u0022Oh, for sure. Paying attention to detail, that\u0027s part of being a point guard.\u0022\u000A\u000A Rose is in charge when he\u0027s on the basketball court, but not in the way Michael Jordan, or even Magic Johnson, was. Jordan was the alpha dog who willed his teammates into submission; Magic was the host of a perpetual party everyone desperately wanted to be invited to. Rose\u0027s game is that of the covert observer, the assessor, the one who sits back, takes stock of the situation, finds the holes to attack, and then pounces. His game is aggressive, but only in a reactive fashion; he waits for you to show him your hand. Every game he is reading the defense the way you might survey strangers at a party.\u000A\u000A \u0022I can read people very well just from watching the things you do, just by how people talk,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m quiet, so I\u0027ll sit here and not say anything and watch you for a couple of minutes, and I can tell what you\u0027re about.\u0022 I ask the question I think anyone would in this situation. \u0022I\u0027m not a dick, am I?\u0022\u000A\u000A Rose smiles. \u0022Oh no. Trust me: I\u0027m very good at reading people.\u0022\u000A\u000A This actually makes me feel better.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A The people of Chicago love Derrick Rose like he is family. I mean that in a literal sense. They have watched him grow up.\u000A\u000A A new feature on the Bulls JumboTron repeatedly flashes the word PoohRose\u0027s nickname as a kid. It is part Rose highlight video, part yearbook montage. Natalie Cole\u0027s \u0022This Will Be\u0022 plays in the background as we see Rose transform from local high school standout to NBA MVP. The team also plays a sequence of videos that show a history of Bulls greats before transitioning to the current stars. This allows the not-so-subtle jump to be made from Michael Jordan to Derrick Rose on a nightly basis, especially when one of Rose\u0027s highlights shows him pulling off a signature layup and the camera pans to Jordan, who\u0027s sitting courtside. Michael Jordan was never of Chicagohis goal was to be more of a global superstarbut the city loved how he essentially became Chicago\u0027s public face nonetheless. With Rose, though, it\u0027s different. With Rose, you sense that the city, like everyone else in his life, feels obliged to protect him.\u000A\u000A Unlike every other basketball player I\u0027ve ever spoken to, Rose does not shy from comparisons to Jordan. \u0022I\u0027ve run into him a couple of times, but we don\u0027t have a relationship,\u0022 he says. \u0022His titles drive me. I\u0027m not scared of him; if anything, it makes me work harder when I do train.\u0022\u000A\u000A One Chicago icon for whom Rose does genuflect? President Obama. The famously Bulls-crazy POTUS has an open dialogue with Rose. \u0022I know that if I really wanted him to come out and support an event I\u0027m going to in Chicago,\u0022 Rose says, \u0022I know it could probably get done.\u0022\u000A\u000A Last year, the president asked Rose to introduce him at a fund-raising event. Rose sweated it in a way he\u0027s never sweated a game. \u0022That was my first time ever speaking to that type of crowd,\u0022 he says. \u0022I was so nervous and scared. Just a two- or three-minute thing, but, like, thousands of people were there. I was nervous as hell...but I got it done, and it helped me being more vocal, too, by doing that.\u0022 One difference between Rose and other athletes who have palled around with the prez is that Rose has known him since back when. \u0022I remember when he wasn\u0027t our president, when I was a kid, when he\u0027d just be walking down the street, a state senator. He was just always there. I didn\u0027t appreciate it then. I was in high school and just wanted to see rappers.\u0022\u000A\u000A Anytime his Englewood days come up, we return to the matter of Rose\u0027s inner circle. He has an actual physical number of people he says he trusts mostten. \u0022There\u0027s seven of us,\u0022 he says of himself and his oldest friends, plus his brothers and his mom. That\u0027s it. \u0022Longest I\u0027ve known one of my friends is third grade. Most recent, seven years. They tell me the truth. They\u0027re not yes-men.\u0022\u000A\u000A And even though the story of where he\u0027s from is part of his lore, he estimates it\u0027s been the better part of a year since he\u0027s been in the old neighborhood. \u0022I just remember being there my rookie year, going back and being parked outside my friend\u0027s house,\u0022 he says. \u0022All of a sudden everybody within a couple of blocks just came to where I was. It was crazy. I appreciated it. I felt good. But you\u0027re not the same person, and that\u0027s what you\u0027ve got to realize.\u0022\u000A\u000A The problem now is that he\u0027s not just a child of Englewoodthe sentiment extends to the greater city, as well. \u0022Sometimes it\u0027s too much. Chicago...\u0022 He pauses. He is careful to say this just right. \u0022Chicago isn\u0027t used to stardom. Back when Michael was here, everyone was used to actors and singers and people being at the games. But there\u0027s been a drought since then, and even celebrities, they\u0027ll stop here to film a movie and then pop right back out. They don\u0027t know how to act toward celebrity. So I always have someone with me. I can have a hat on, glasses on, whatever. People still notice me. If I go outside without a hat on, I feel like I\u0027m naked.\u0022 Rose can have the entire world, as long as he doesn\u0027t leave his home. \u0022This life doesn\u0027t fit my personality.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A This year, the playoffs, particularly in the Eastern Conference, come down to two teams: the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat. They claim two of the NBA\u0027s best records, three of the league\u0027s most marketable superstars, and, most notably, an inflamed recent history: Last year, the Heat blasted Rose\u0027s Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals, the most crushing loss of Rose\u0027s nascent career. It\u0027s clear he\u0027s still not over it and that it has driven him every minute since.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s all about Bulls vs. Heat, and this\u0027ll probably be the case for the next four or five years. Both teams are young, hypertalented, and standing firmly in each other\u0027s way. Rose says he wants to win multiple championships with the Bulls. Of course, those Miami guys are thinking the same thing. \u0022They\u0027re a team that we\u0027re not going to be able to go around,\u0022 Rose says. \u0022For us to win, we\u0027re going to have to go through them every year.\u0022\u000A\u000A In January, the Bulls traveled to Miami to play their highest-profile game of the season, a precursor to the series everyone knows is destined. It was also the kind of game the NBA lives to market: superstar vs. superstar. Even better, it was Phenom Who Does It the Right Way (Rose) vs. the Black Hat of the NBA (LeBron). (This is also known as the game in which LeBron, forever looking for public-relations scores, famously rode his bike to the arena.) LeBron doesn\u0027t yet seem to comprehend why the sports world has turned on him, but Rose, who says he doesn\u0027t really know LeBron, understands the tale as a cautionary one. He grasps that it was The Decision alone that created LeBron\u0027s new reality. \u0022It happened overnight with him, and it was sad to see somebody go through that,\u0022 he says. \u0022It would hurt anyone to see your hometown turn on you like that. I don\u0027t know how I would have dealt with it. He is obviously playing great still...but everybody\u0027s different.\u0022\u000A\u000A From the opening tip, AmericanAirlines Arena was ablaze. \u0022You could just tell at the beginning that this was going to be an exciting, playoff-atmosphere game,\u0022 Rose says later. \u0022The players were into it, the coaches were into it, and the buzz of the game was crazy. That\u0027s why I love playing the sport.\u0022\u000A\u000A Rose picked up two fouls early and was forced to sit, while the first quarter was highlighted by an alley-oop in which LeBron literally jumped over poor John Lucas IIIwho I\u0027m starting to realize is a bit of an unwitting foil in this story. Rose eventually returned and took control, driving, twisting, doing those reckless-but-not-really contortions at the rim that not even LeBron (who has five inches and at least sixty pounds on Rose) can contest.\u000A\u000A It is worth noting, by the way, that Heat fans demonstratively prefer Dwyane Wade to LeBron James. James may be the best player in the league by the numbers, but he\u0027s not first (and maybe not even second) in his own fans\u0027 hearts. Fans can always tell, really.\u000A\u000A With six minutes left, Bulls trailing, an audible murmur came up from the crowd when, in a defensive switch, LeBron moved over to guard Rose. I straightened up in my own seat...\u000A\u000A And then both players managed to stink up the joint. Rose missed a couple of key foul shots, and then LeBron missed two free throws of his own. Just before time expired, Bulls down two, Rose missed a heavily guarded turnaround jumper to finish off the anticlimactic comedy of errors.\u000A\u000A After the game, LeBron signed on to Twitter to tell the world, \u0022Man what a game! So fun and blessed to be apart of it! C\u0027mon #6 make your d*mn free-throws!! Bulls are a great team!! Dog fight every time!\u0022 (Rose isn\u0027t on Twitter. \u0022One of my friends, he\u0027s on there because of girls,\u0022 he says. \u0022But I don\u0027t got Twitter.\u0022)\u000A\u000A The contrast with LeBron is one everyone loves to make, and Rose doesn\u0027t mind it himself. But Rose is as beloved now as LeBron was before The Decision. Does he worry that someday he might get LeBron\u0027d himself?\u000A\u000A \u0022I won\u0027t ever put myself in a bad position so that people can say bad things about me,\u0022 he says. \u0022I make smart decisions, and my friends and my family, they are all there for the right reason. I\u0027m very mature for 23 years old, and I know that whatever I do can hurt someone.\u0022\u000A\u000A The day before the Miami game, I talked with Rose in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel. It was the first time I met him, and he was obviously exhausted from a late-arriving flight and the endless travel of this year\u0027s NBA season. It was more an introduction than an interview, but we chatted for twenty minutes anyway. Various Bulls walked past us in the lobby, heading out for a night on the town. I asked Rose if he\u0027d be joining them later.\u000A\u000A \u0022Oh God, no,\u0022 he said. \u0022I absolutely cannot wait until I get up to that room.\u0022 This got me thinking: When was the last time that Rosea man who lives with two friends in his condo, who is constantly being told where he needs to be and whenwas actually alone in a room? He paused and frowned. \u0022I really don\u0027t know. Right now, I guess. As soon as I head up.\u0022 I ended our conversation there. It seemed like the least I could do.\u000A\u000A As I walked out onto the street, I ran into a group of about fifteen people who hadn\u0027t been there when I\u0027d walked in. While Rose and I had been talking, the gaggle of fans had run up to the window to snap camera pics and wave and scream. I\u0027d been facing Rose and had no idea they\u0027d been there.\u000A\u000A One of the fans, who actually asked for my autograph (brief proximity to celebrity being what it is on the open market), was surprisingly pissy about his \u0022interaction\u0022 with Rose. \u0022I dunno, he looked like kind of an asshole,\u0022 Jon said. (He said his name was Jon. That\u0027s all I got.) \u0022We stood there for fifteen minutes trying to get his attention, and he didn\u0027t even look at us. Guys like that never remember the fans.\u0022\u000A\u000A The next time I see Rose, in Philadelphia three days later, I ask if he\u0027d caught a glimpse of the crowd. \u0022Oh, I saw them,\u0022 he says, shaking his head. Waving and snorting, right over my shoulder, was the antagonist that makes him sometimes wonder whether basketball is worth it, the reason he\u0027s afraid to leave his home; he\u0027d been facing them the whole time. And yet he hadn\u0027t let on in the slightest. He\u0027d bottled up the anxiety and stared, stone-faced, right back.\u000A\u000A Will Leitch is a contributing editor at New York magazine.",

          Derrick Rose, the reigning NBA MVP, lives on the eighty-fourth floor of the Trump building in Chicago, one of the tallest buildings in the country, right up near the roof, with wall-length windows overlooking the city he rules, the only city he has ever known. The view is disorienting and all-encompassing, sort of like hes living on an observation deck of the Willis Tower, which happens to be right over there, one of the only points above us in the mess of verticals downtown.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.5">
          Rose also has a home in Northbrook, by the Bulls training complex, but he says he has that place mostly for convenience, so he doesnt have to drive back into the city after practice. Someday hed like to have a house, "my real house," where hell "have kids and just live in my spot." But he cant do that now, not even close. This condo, the one he just moved into about a month agoit is almost entirely unfurnished; two of his bedrooms have no sheets on the beds and are filled with stacks of unopened bosthis is his escape for now. Eighty-four stories up in the sky, secured away.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.6">
          "I like living here," he says. "They just try to make you comfortable. The people here, they are mostly from out of town; they dont know who I am. Thats why I picked this place." (Its easy to understand why one would enjoy working in this building, too. When Rose orders two bottled waters for us during our chat, he hands the bellhop two $50 bills.) Presidents talk about how the White House begins to feel like a prison. Rose speaks the same way about the town that adores him. "It gets on my nerves that I just cant go out," he says. "Its just boundaries now. People are like, You cant go here, you cant go there, you got to let that person know where youre going. Its just weird. Im never alone. Ever."
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.7">
          The afternoon I visit his condo is a rare one for Rose during this truncated, lockout-compressed NBA schedule: a day off. Last night he played his first game in almost two weeks, and in the locker room post-buzzer, everyone desperately wanted to pick his brain. Rose had missed the last five Bulls outings with back spasms, but he certainly didnt look to be too agonized, scoring twenty-three points and notching six assists in a breezy 90&#x2013;79 victory over the Atlanta Hawks. In one memorable sequence, he sidewinded himself through several Hawks defenders, pulled the ball above his head, absorbed contact, and then spun it just so, kissing the backboard and splashing through. He fell hard to the floor, popped up, and sunk the free throw. The back was feeling better.

          Postgame, there were probably three dozen media members laser-focused on Roses locker, from WGN to the
          <em>
           Chicago Tribune
          </em>
          to someone whose credentials seemed to say "MARS." Before too long the crowd grew even more robust, at least five people deep in a semicircle around Roses chair. With the mess of Fourth Estaters spreading farther and farther out to the middle of the room, the odds Id hear a word Rose said were approaching zero. I strained, I jumped, I peered, but nothing.

          Just then, a Bulls rep burst into the room. "Hes not coming, you guys," he said. "He already left." The media horde did this collective shoulder sag and, like the ripple from a drop of water, dispersed randomly in all directions from Roses locker. Theyd been packed in so tightly in anticipation of his appearance that Id had no idea he was not, in fact, at his locker. Derrick Rose is surrounded even when he isnt there.

          Nick Friedell, the Bulls beat reporter for ESPN Chicago, walked toward me and looked as though hed seen some mythical creature, maybe a chupacabra. "He has almost never done that since I started working this beat," he said. "Im stunned." Friedell joined some of his regular colleagues, and the conversation turned to how Michael Jordan never pulled this, how he always made an appearance no matter what. Off to the side, reserve point guard John Lucas III, the unfortunate soul saddled with the locker next to Roses, politely nudged his way through the morass and dropped his towel.

          In his condo, I ask Rose why he blew off the media the night before. He sighs and forces a wan smile. He has been expecting this question, if not necessarily so soon. "It was just too much," he says. "I just couldnt do it. I just couldnt deal with it. There were so many people. I saw them there from the other room. And when I thought about having to go in there, I just couldnt work my way up to it." He pauses and takes a sip of water. His eyes go somewhere beyond my left ear. "There were so many of them. I hope theyll forget about it."

         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.c">
          A little later, Rose shifts to thinking about the twenty-four hours he has entirely to himself. "This is gonna be the best day," he says, smiling widely. "Some friends may come over. I might get on the phone. Thats it. It makes me superhappy to have this whole day to myself, to be a little selfish, to eat whatever I want, to not have anyone asking me to do things. When you get a chance to have a day like today, you have to take advantage of it." But after I leave, he plans to exploit this rare opportunity by going nowhere.

          As the star of a top team in a league that markets individuals more than any other sport in America (a league that has long had a reputation of harboring the hardest-partying athletes in America), Rose bristles at the thought of going out. In one way, this is refreshing. He just wants to do his own thing. But the more I think about itthe more I hear Rose talk about how little he enjoys interacting with strangers, how desperately he misses being able to walk around unnoticed, how mournful he gets when the topic of "attention" is breached, how obviously uncomfortable he is even in basic social situations outside his immediate circleit strikes me as unbearably sad.

          Its another reason his one salvation is on a basketball court, where he can focus on winning and nothing else. ("He came packaged like that," his agent, BJ Armstrong, says. "That box was already packaged. That is who he is.") But even thats becoming a problem. Because the thing that Derrick Rose likes to do more than anything else in the worldwinning basketball gamesis making it more and more dicult to avoid the thing he dislikes more than anything in the world. "Dont get me wrong. I dont take anything for granted," he says. "But it seems like the better I play, the more attention I get. And I cant get away from it. You play great, you get attention.

          Rose has gone from wide-eyed freshman at the University of Memphis to one of the most recognizable athletes in the world in the span of about four years. Only Jeremy Lin, who made a comparable journey in approximately ten days, can possibly eclipse that sort of rise to megafame, and even hes older than Rose. Last season, at 22, Rose became the youngest ever NBA MVP; he has played in three All-Star games in his first four seasons; he is the signature star and unquestioned leader of one of the best teams in the NBA.

          And he is doing all this in the city where he was born, where he sprouted his first mustache, a place he has really only ever left for away games. Chicago has a proud, historic basketball tradition, from Isiah Thomas to Dwyane Wade to George Mikan. But none of those guys ever played for the Bulls. And none of them, not even Wade, are nearly as electrifying. Derrick Rose is as much a Chicago hero today as Barack Obama.

          When you watch a Chicago Bulls game, your eyes immediately smash-cut to Rose, no matter what else is going on, no matter where the ball is. Its as if hes glowing. Rose has an extra, automatic step, a palpable pep that often creates the illusion that he has tiny pogo sticks in his shoes. (One suspects Adidas, which just signed Rose to a "lifetime" contract reportedly worth more than $200 million, would like it if I claimed that he does.) Rose can pass and shoot and rebound (despite standing "just" six-feet-three), but Derrick Rose is Derrick Rose because of the way he drives the lane.

         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.j">
          Simply put, Rose does things in midair leaps to the basket that break physical laws of accepted human behavior. To watch those moves in real time is to not do them justice. Roses brilliance is such that slow motion is required to understand what, exactly, is going on up therethe same way you need to change frame rate to comprehend fully how a gun fires a bullet or a hummingbird flaps its wings. Rose seems able to control every muscle of his body while in midair: Hes able to move past, over, and sometimes under defenders, almost always drawing contact. And he still finishes the play; Rose spins the ball on layups as if hes bowling on ice. My favorite ever was a dunk over then Knick Danilo Gallinari last season in which Rose appeared to speed up three-quarters of the way to the rim; it looked like someone dropped him from the rafters. His ability to finish is such a leap in basketball evolution that it feels like a mutation.

          "When we used to play in the park," he says, "there were no fouls, so thats why I shoot the crazy shots I do. Because I knew I was gonna get fouled, but I still got to make the shot."

          Rose grew up on the South Side of Chicago, in the Englewood neighborhood, one of the most notoriously dangerous communities in the country. (In 1991, when Rose was 2 years old, Englewood suffered ninety-nine murders. Its also the childhood home of Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, whose mother, brother, and 7-year-old nephew were murdered there in 2008.) Rose is the youngest of four brothers raised by a single mother. His talent was apparent at once and, by a family in challenging circumstances, nurtured and harbored as if it were the only hope on earth. "The people who are there for me have always been there for me," he says.

          The stories of how Roses familyhis mother, Brenda, and his three brothers, Dwayne, Reggie, and Allanprotected him and one another are part of the Rose Legend at this point. How drug dealers were often more afraid of Brenda than any rival gangs, how the three brothers made certain Derrick was never left alone with untoward outside influences, how they created their own AAU team for Derrick so theyd be able to monitor all his comings and goings. The family heavily influenced his choice of both high school and college, protecting Rose against hardship and failure to such a degree that its suspected someone else took his SATs. (Based on this charge, the University of Memphis vacated all its wins in Roses one season with the team.) You can make a strong argument that Rose has been under protection since the moment he picked up a basketball.

          "I was the best kid in my neighborhood at a young age," he says. "My whole life. I was always the one everyone was talking about. Ive never really wanted the attention, but it has always been there."

         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.o">
          The way the story is generally told, this attention and shelter is what saved Derrick from suffering the same sad fate as many Chicago basketball prospectsfrom Ben Wilson (a top-tier high school recruit who was shot and killed in 1984) to Ronnie Fields (the Chicago Public League legend who suffered a serious car accident, lost his shot at a scholarship, and never made the NBA) to Jereme Richmond (the former Illinois forward who pleaded guilty to unlawful use of a weapon just this year). And yet for better or worse, Rose has essentially been walled off from the rest of the planet his entire life. He has always been the person around whom pieces have revolved, but he has never been the one actively commanding those pieces to move. It has turned him into a quiet person, the one guy in any room whos always listening. This has brought its own advantages.

          "I have said his greatest asset, his greatest quality, is that he is a phenomenal, phenomenal listener," BJ Armstrong says. Armstrong, who played on three of those Jordan championship teams, is now one of Roses closest mentors. "He listens. He is able to take information, decipher what is important, decipher what is not important, and gets to the crux, right to the heart of what is going on right there."

         <p data-reactid=".229art22ry8.1.1.0.0.3.q">

          Rose is in charge when hes on the basketball court, but not in the way Michael Jordan, or even Magic Johnson, was. Jordan was the alpha dog who willed his teammates into submission; Magic was the host of a perpetual party everyone desperately wanted to be invited to. Roses game is that of the covert observer, the assessor, the one who sits back, takes stock of the situation, finds the holes to attack, and then pounces. His game is aggressive, but only in a reactive fashion; he waits for you to show him your hand. Every game he is reading the defense the way you might survey strangers at a party.

          Roses nickname as a kid. It is part Rose highlight video, part yearbook montage. Natalie Coles "This Will Be" plays in the background as we see Rose transform from local high school standout to NBA MVP. The team also plays a sequence of videos that show a history of Bulls greats before transitioning to the current stars. This allows the not-so-subtle jump to be made from Michael Jordan to Derrick Rose on a nightly basis, especially when one of Roses highlights shows him pulling off a signature layup and the camera pans to Jordan, whos sitting courtside. Michael Jordan was never of Chicagohis goal was to be more of a global superstarbut the city loved how he essentially became Chicagos public face nonetheless. With Rose, though, its different. With Rose, you sense that the city, like everyone else in his life, feels obliged to protect him.

          Unlike every other basketball player Ive ever spoken to, Rose does not shy from comparisons to Jordan. "Ive run into him a couple of times, but we dont have a relationship," he says. "His titles drive me. Im not scared of him; if anything, it makes me work harder when I do train."

          Last year, the president asked Rose to introduce him at a fund-raising event. Rose sweated it in a way hes never sweated a game. "That was my first time ever speaking to that type of crowd," he says. "I was so nervous and scared. Just a two- or three-minute thing, but, like, thousands of people were there. I was nervous as hell...but I got it done, and it helped me being more vocal, too, by doing that." One difference between Rose and other athletes who have palled around with the prez is that Rose has known him since back when. "I remember when he wasnt our president, when I was a kid, when hed just be walking down the street, a state senator. He was just always there. I didnt appreciate it then. I was in high school and just wanted to see rappers."

          And even though the story of where hes from is part of his lore, he estimates its been the better part of a year since hes been in the old neighborhood. "I just remember being there my rookie year, going back and being parked outside my friends house," he says. "All of a sudden everybody within a couple of blocks just came to where I was. It was crazy. I appreciated it. I felt good. But youre not the same person, and thats what youve got to realize."

          The problem now is that hes not just a child of Englewoodthe sentiment extends to the greater city, as well. "Sometimes its too much. Chicago..." He pauses. He is careful to say this just right. "Chicago isnt used to stardom. Back when Michael was here, everyone was used to actors and singers and people being at the games. But theres been a drought since then, and even celebrities, theyll stop here to film a movie and then pop right back out. They dont know how to act toward celebrity. So I always have someone with me. I can have a hat on, glasses on, whatever. People still notice me. If I go outside without a hat on, I feel like Im naked." Rose can have the entire world, as long as he doesnt leave his home.

          In January, the Bulls traveled to Miami to play their highest-profile game of the season, a precursor to the series everyone knows is destined. It was also the kind of game the NBA lives to market: superstar vs. superstar. Even better, it was Phenom Who Does It the Right Way (Rose) vs. the Black Hat of the NBA (LeBron). (This is also known as the game in which LeBron, forever looking for public-relations scores, famously rode his bike to the arena.) LeBron doesnt yet seem to comprehend why the sports world has turned on him, but Rose, who says he doesnt really know LeBron, understands the tale as a cautionary one. He grasps that it was The Decision alone that created LeBrons new reality. "It happened overnight with him, and it was sad to see somebody go through that," he says. "It would hurt anyone to see your hometown turn on you like that. I dont know how I would have dealt with it. He is obviously playing great still...but everybodys different."

          Rose picked up two fouls early and was forced to sit, while the first quarter was highlighted by an alley-oop in which LeBron literally jumped over poor John Lucas IIIwho Im starting to realize is a bit of an unwitting foil in this story.

          The day before the Miami game, I talked with Rose in the lobby of the Four Seasons Hotel. It was the first time I met him, and he was obviously exhausted from a late-arriving flight and the endless travel of this years NBA season. It was more an introduction than an interview, but we chatted for twenty minutes anyway. Various Bulls walked past us in the lobby, heading out for a night on the town. I asked Rose if hed be joining them later.

He paused and frowned. "I really dont know. Right now, I guess. As soon as I head up." I ended our conversation there. It seemed like the least I could do.

           my
          </em>
          autograph (brief proximity to celebrity being what it is on the open market), was surprisingly pissy about his "interaction" with Rose. "I dunno, he looked like kind of an asshole," Jon said. (He said his name was Jon. Thats all I got.) "We stood there for fifteen minutes trying to get his attention, and he didnt even
          <em>
           look
          </em>
          at us. Guys like that never remember the fans."

          The next time I see Rose, in Philadelphia three days later, I ask if hed caught a glimpse of the crowd. "Oh, I saw them," he says, shaking his head. Waving and snorting, right over my shoulder, was the antagonist that makes him sometimes wonder whether basketball is worth it, the reason hes afraid to leave his home; hed been facing them the whole time. And yet he hadnt let on in the slightest. Hed bottled up the anxiety and stared, stone-faced, right back.
