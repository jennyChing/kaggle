        Gemini is the third constellation of the Western zodiac and is represented symbolically by the Heavenly Twins.  Pollux and Castor are its primary stars and in terms of brightness, are among the most luminous in the sky overall.  They are named after a famous pair of  brothers from classical mythology, because it is said that when Castor was killed tragically in battle, the god Zeus  placed them in the heavens together, always to remain side by side. Even from this mythological background then, youll deduce you're not typically solitary.  Sociability is  a big feature
            of your sign and as the first member of the air element, in common with all
            those belonging to that triplicity, you are essentially  a gregarious, companionable and communicative individual. You find social
            interaction highly rewarding and in truth, regard it as a  central part of your daily existence,
            so you could never feel happy isolated from your friends or hindered
            in pursuit of everyday contacts and activities.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Most Geminis are lively, clever and lots of 
            fun to be around. You are fond of parties and any other type of social
            gathering. Men born under this influence are not quite the social
            butterfly epitomised by the Gemini female, but nevertheless you can
            be sure that any get-together held under the aegis of your constellation will
            most likely  proceed with a swing. You easily get weary of too much routine,
            so are always happy to meet other people, to enjoy a change of scenery,
            to go somewhere different or to try out fresh ideas, situations and any new suggestions.

        However, to paint you purely as a party animal isnt really
            fair. The Twins dual symbolism also adds in a more thoughtful
            side, with deep and meaningful conversation often preferred to
            extended revelry in any case. You enjoy putting your perspective
            on all sorts of issues and then hearing an alternative viewpoint in return.
            You loathe  isolation and have a low boredom threshold, meaning
            those born under your constellation and who regularly stay  home alone are rather rare specimens indeed. The urge to communicate and to interact
            socially will always be a primary motivating factor for you
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Some Geminis find their agile minds are best occupied within the world
            of work. Writing or broadcasting are both perfect Gemini careers. So
            are journalism, anything linked with transportation, the media in general, travel,
            secretarial work, teaching, hairdressing, human resources, sales and retail plus a varied multitude of  possible jobs that necessitate dealing with the public on a regular
            basis. Other Geminis find their fulfilment within close relationships, so long as their partners
            can manage to keep them interested, entertained and engrossed.
            In all close associations the remaining air signs make the best mates for
            you, although fiery Aries and Sagittarius can prove good company as well. When intellectually fulfilled you are happy spending
            more time at home, than you would usually if other circumstances were tending to predominate.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Actually this sort of scenario  works out well, since you can end up scattering your energy and thus often benefit
            from a more stable  set-up domestically. Ideally though, you favour
            some degree of external input and feel stressed, suffocated and
            miserable if this isnt forthcoming. Your sign is especially connected
            with short journeys and your local community, so here is where
            many hours go, running around and about without straying far away from home.

        When you do find yourself back at the ranch,
            it is characteristic for you to spend hours on the telephone.
            Others write and receive letters, cards and emails, but the ongoing
            communication associated with the phone makes this especially enjoyable. Without one, youd be left  feeling bereft and would soon view such circumstances in a similar way to losing
            a part of your own body. Fortunately, the advent of the  cell phone
            has meant that rarely do you and your first true love now need to be apart. A more ideal astrological
            association  or
            birthday present, would
            be hard to source for any celestial Twin, though you almost certainly have one already anyhow. 
            Another great affinity  is usually your car.  In order to go hither and thither whenever this suits you, your vehicle is a specially valued and essential possession for you to maintain.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In fact many Geminis prefer vans
            to cars, since there is more space into which to throw the various
            belongings that youre bound to need wherever youre going.  Regardless
            of whether a car, bicycle or some other alternative is the ultimate choice,
            you are often quite demanding of you chosen mode of transport
            and  definitely use it to its utmost capabilities. Although some Geminis decide to live in rural situations, the town or the city
            suits your desire for constant and varied activity, social
            opportunity and  intellectual stimulation much better. You are happiest in the
            thick of the traffic, attempting to park in impossible situations and bashing
            your cars paintwork
            with bundles of keys and hands full of shopping. Nervousness and anxiety
            are troublesome health outcomes you usually suffer, so by ensuring that a fast
            pace of life is maintained, the negative effects of  excess nervous
            energy can be turned  over towards a more  enviable and desirable impact in the end
