       I wanted to write you to try to clear up some
       <a href="http://pando.com/2014/01/03/young-techies-know-your-place/">
        fundamental
       </a>

        misunderstandings
       </a>
       about the recent criticisms directed your way
    as of late. In addition, I felt it would be valuable to hear directly from
    somebody who is a part of the young creative community, a community that has
    helped to provide this city its globally heralded reputation as a forerunner in
    nearly every social movement of import, but that now is a bona fide endangered
    species in San Francisco. It is my sincere hope that 2014 will be a
    transformational year here, a year in which all San Franciscans remember who we
    are as well as our responsibility to the world and to each other. That hope
    cannot be realized without the tech industry, so know that I am writing this

       To start off, its important that we forget
    about the buses. They arent the problem, and putting the focus on them simply
    obscures the real issue. The truth is nobody would really be upset if the members
    of the tech community (I know you dont care for the term techies) who have descended upon San Francisco,
    paying top dollar for any available apartment, actually understood the meaning
    of San Francisco and made good on the responsibility of meeting that ideal,
    which comes with living here.

       Much has been made of your attraction to the
    cultural appeal of San Francisco as opposed to the suburban wasteland that is
    Silicon Valley, but it should now be plainly obvious that the appeal of our
    city suffers as people who contribute to that culture are replaced by people
    who want to be in proximity to it. To put it in terms you would understand, San
    Francisco is experiencing a real-life Reddit hug of death.

       While you all are hard at work bringing the
    world Farmville or polishing that elevator pitch, those of us who understand
    that San Francisco is a global beacon of social transformation are either
    desperately trying to live up to that responsibility through mounting
    challenges to our work or have already decamped to Oakland.

       Even if you dont have the time to support the
    cultural lifeblood of this city, there is one thing that some of you very
    famously do have, something that could be of tremendous help to those of us who
    are struggling to keep the flame of San Francisco lit  money. For those of us
    in the creative community who have for years been eking out an existence, it is
    very much water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.

       I can speak from personal experience. Ive
    worked for years to bring San Francisco closer to its ideal by cofounding and
    running projects like the
       <a href="http://wiggparty.org/">
        Wigg Party
       </a>
       , which makes the area around the Wiggle bike route more
    sustainable and more resilient, and the
       <a href="http://urbaneatingleague.org/?page_id=35">
        Urban Eating League
       </a>
       , an underground dinner competition featuring
    local food, costumes, and community building.

       Not only am I forced to spearhead these
    projects with minimal aid because everyone who would be a cocreator can no
    longer afford to live here, but also our entire playbook consists of tactics
    that require no money because weve never received a dime of support in nearly
    five years of work. I dont want the money for me  I want to be able to pay
    other people to work with me so we can grow the organizations and grow our
    impact (weve got, among other projects, a local currency, Wiggle etiquette
    videos, and the spread of the Urban Eating League to other cities waiting in
    the wings).

       Another project I cofounded this summer is
    called
       <a href="http://freespace.io/">
        [freespace]
       </a>
       . We convinced the owner of a 14,000-square-foot building at
    Mission and 7th Streets to let us temporarily use the space for free for two
    months. We promptly turned the building over to the community to fill it up
    with events, art, and civic innovation, and our only rule was that everything
    had to be free and open to everyone. The [freespace] project sent tremors of
    excitement through the Bay Area creative community, culminating in a front-page
    article
       <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Work-play-Freespace-4690303.php">
        in the

       Despite formal invitations from [freespace] to many
    of the big tech companies  including Twitter, whose new headquarters is
    literally three blocks away from [freespace] and who happens to be
    contractually obligated to provide benefits to the local community the big
    tech names couldnt be bothered to set foot in our building, let alone lend any
    sort of support, financial or otherwise. As a sidenote, the Mid-Market tech
    companies official community benefits agreement proposals, recently submitted
    to the city, are, with the exception of Zendesks proposal, wholly
    underwhelming. The proposals have been

       The creative community wouldnt be up in arms
    if they felt like they were being pushed out by residents who also understood
    what it means to be a San Franciscan  people who make time to connect with
    their neighbors, who dont treat our great city like a playground for the rich,
    and who understand that the rest of America and the world look to us to find a
    way forward on problems like climate change and cultural harmony. If you cant
    commit your time or skills to participate in this work, then you have an
    obligation to commit what you do have a silly amount of money, to support those who have prioritized this
    work over financial gain.

       Now I already know what youre thinking: Its
    not our fault that the rent prices are so high; its the lack of development in
    San Francisco during the last 30 years! And I must admit that the city's development
    policy has certainly contributed to the housing challenge at the moment. There
    are surely even more reasons why we currently have the highest rent in the
    country, thereby making it nearly impossible for anybody who isnt engaged in
    the full-time pursuit of a bank account infusion to live here. But I ask you,
    whats more likely to happen  the creation of a time machine to go back 30
    years to build more housing, or a culture shift within the tech community?
      </p>
      <p class="Body" style="mso-pagination:none;tab-stops:28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt">
       And how might a culture shift happen? Luckily,
    there already exists a subset within the tech community who have succeeded at
    both working in that economy and caring about things besides making money. I
    count some of them as my friends. They participate in the Wigg Party and the UEL
    and were an important part of the success of [freespace], providing both
    financial and human support. Its unfair to them that they must suffer abuse
    for the failure of the larger tech community.

      <p class="Body" style="mso-pagination:none;tab-stops:28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt">
       However, Ive detected within that tech subset
    a troubling position  that of the tech apologist. To be sure, the overall
    criticisms against the tech industry could be more nuanced. Not everyone in
    that community is fundamentally failing San Francisco, and I can understand
    feeling defensive when under attack. But I call on you, my enlightened tech
    brothers and sisters, to live up to an additional responsibility  that of
    changing the tech culture from the inside.

       You must teach your friends and coworkers that
    tech money can be spent on more than just flannel shirts, fancy restaurants,
    and traveling to Burning Man to be civically involved one week out of the year.
    You must explain to them that using new technology and data for social good is
    eminently more rewarding than the selfish pursuit of financial gain. You must
    show them what you already understand  that San Francisco is a place where
    magic is ready to burst forth, where strange and beautiful things happen and
    reverberate the world over, but only,
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       if you meet her halfway. I
    cannot perform this feat for the tech community; it must be done from the
    inside.

       But I have hope. I did not write this letter to
    chastise or vent. I wrote to you because I honestly believe you play an
    important part in keeping this city alive. I believe that some of you have
    gotten swept up in success and the next bountiful paycheck, but that perhaps
    you started out wanting to use these new technological tools to make the world
    a better place. The talents and skills you possess are absolutely vital to the solutions to some of our gravest challenges, both in San Francisco and in cities around the world.

       I honestly believe that the incomprehensibly
    wealthy companies many of you work for will come to see San Francisco as more
    than a source of tax breaks and employee dorm rooms, which will lead to actual
    investment in our city. A good place to start would be funding the regions
    fledgling bike-share program, which remains impotent because it cant seem to
    find a corporate sponsor. This tech kerfuffle, this class war, must surely be
    mere birth pains, momentary challenges that yield a greater wholeness, a
    greater San Francisco.

       San Francisco and its citizens are famously
    tolerant. But one thing that wont be tolerated is the extinguishing of the
    very spirit that made us want to be a part of it in the first place. In order
    to become a part of it, you must contribute to it. Thats the only way it
    works.

       I think I speak for all San Franciscans in
    leaving you with this: let it not be said that as the planet was literally
