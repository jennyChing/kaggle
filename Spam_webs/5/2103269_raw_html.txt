Of Israel&rsquo;s 5,000 tech companies, city planners have counted 600 start-ups in the single square mile around Rothschild. Israel has more companies on Nasdaq than any country beside the US and China, and it attracts more venture funding per capita than anywhere in the world. Its tech sector employs 230,000 people in a population of eight million, earning more than a quarter of the country&rsquo;s total exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just off the southern end of the boulevard is the Shalom Meir Tower &ndash; once the tallest building in the Middle East. A lift door in the corner of the mezzanine leads to a municipal library on the seventh floor that had been forgotten by all but its ageing clientele. In 2011, it was refurbished as a shared workspace for start-ups. The fourth group of 13 companies has just finished their four-month session, which includes meetings with potential partners, lectures by business experts, networking &ndash; not to mention a great view over the city's beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern is repeated all the way down Rothschild, where incubators and start-ups compete for space among the coffee shops and restaurants. There are similar tech hubs in many cities throughout the world, but Avner Warner, Director of International Economic Development at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/eng/GlobalCity/Pages/GlobalCityLoby.aspx?tm=24\"&gt;Tel Aviv Global City Administration&lt;/a&gt;, says Tel Aviv stands apart because of a single overriding influence on early-stage Israeli companies: the Israeli armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The military gives them their technological experience, managerial experience and networks,&rdquo; says Warner. &ldquo;For the average person, the greatest barrier to being an entrepreneur is 'Where the hell do I start? What do I do first?' Most people just get confused at this point and go get a normal job. That&rsquo;s the experience the army gives them. It&rsquo;s understanding how you actually build a product, which is the same as managing a project in the army.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big data pioneers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the HQ of the Mamram, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) technical support unit in nearby Ramat Gan, computer training course commander Capt. H (her full name is classified) says new recruits on a six-month intensive programming course study from dawn till night and are taught programming skills, teamwork, project management and &ndash; most importantly how to be creative. It&rsquo;s like a school for start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When you do a degree in computer science you study the technical things,\" she says. \"You study how to write a code, mathematics. We don&rsquo;t focus on that. We focus on how to work in a team. How to understand what your client needs and make software that fits his demands. How to write good code that you will be able to de-bug and maintain.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tal Marian, founder of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.techloft.co.il/\"&gt;TechLoft&lt;/a&gt;, a commercial shared workspace just off Rothschild, says the results of the military training are obvious. &ldquo;Some of the military units work like a civilian organisation,\" says Marian. \"They encourage entrepreneurship, the feeling that if you come up with a good idea that answers a real need of that unit&rsquo;s mission, you will get the funding and manpower and the time you need.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of helping to solve the nation&rsquo;s major security threats, the challenges of gaming and mobile apps pale by comparison, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the military technology connection is obvious. The miniaturised camera and power pack in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.givenimaging.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx\"&gt;Given Imaging camera pill&lt;/a&gt; is based on equipment in the nose of a military drone, for example. Israel raced a decade ahead in the management and use of large data sets &ndash; or big data &ndash; that drive many consumer apps because of expertise&nbsp;developed by &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200\"&gt;Unit 8200&lt;/a&gt;, the intelligence-gathering arm that is now the largest unit in the IDF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has spent nearly $1bn (&pound;640m) on four Israeli companies that all developed big data storage solutions: Storwize, XIV, Diligent and FileX. Earlier this year, Google acquired the mapping app &lt;a href=\"http://www.waze.com/\"&gt;Waze&lt;/a&gt; for more than $1 bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders of Waze received their technical training in Israeli military intelligence. The giant Israeli tech firms &lt;a href=\"http://www.nice.com/\"&gt;Nice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.comverse.com/index.asp\"&gt;Comverse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.checkpoint.com/\"&gt;Check Point&lt;/a&gt; were all created by Unit 8200 alumni or based on technology originally developed by the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youthful exuberance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the boulevard, Yaron Tal is Chief Technical Officer of 6Scan, a website security start-up he&nbsp;founded with ex-army buddies. A white-hat hacker (one that works for non-malicious motives), since the age of 12, he was running his own web security consultancy by the age of 17, before being head-hunted for Matzov, the&nbsp;army&rsquo;s cyber-security unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Entrepreneurs in Israel are unique,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Their approach to problems is different to others because the army is a huge incubator for innovation and entrepreneurship. The army gave us a few million dollars at the age of 18 and asked us to build technology and systems that address problems that only people 10 or 20 years older are dealing with in other parts of the world. That kind of pressure and challenge really brings a lot of things out of you.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tal skipped university to work at a start-up before launching his own, but another important driver of the tech scene is the fact that Israeli university students pay only about $3,100 (&pound;2,000) a year in tuition fees. They emerge from military service and three years of studying with zero debt, eager to take a year off to pursue their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That youthful exuberance, combined with the rigorous military training in technology and project management, has found a natural home among cafes running down the centre of Rothschild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting to 6Scan became easy after they opened an office on the boulevard, according to Tal. &ldquo;The street is full of start-ups. We talk together, help each other. There are no big companies here, which is great. We live very near the office. We love the vibe, the place, the other start-ups, the restaurants. It&rsquo;s easier to bring developers to the company when you say it&rsquo;s in Rothschild even though we don&rsquo;t have much money to offer.

So I&rsquo;ve used everything from geese and dogs to Roombas to drones to GPS.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright is a private investigator &ndash; and owner of the Wright Group &ndash; based in Anaheim, California. She&rsquo;s worked in the business for more than 40 years, and has seen the tools available to investigators change dramatically. Early on, stakeouts in vans were important. More recently new technology in the form of tiny cameras and social media has begun to play a role. And she&rsquo;s embraced those changes. Today, when the problem calls for it, she uses drones to do her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gives me a few examples. If two people are meeting in a public place, a drone can be a helpful way to discreetly watch them. &ldquo;We stay at about 50-75 feet [15-23 metres] above so nothing can be heard.&rdquo; Drones are also helpful for aerial surveillance of locations that are hard to access on foot. And if a school or church is worried someone might be stealing or vandalising property, drones or small off-road vehicles (&ldquo;Roombas on steroids&rdquo; as she calls them) can film the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yhk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Wright was asked to figure out whether or not a soda salesperson was crossing county lines and cheating on his contract. California is one of many states in which salespeople have regional contracts &ndash; for instance, Bob sells Pepsi in Los Angeles County and Nancy sells Pepsi in Orange County. If Nancy arrives at her usual businesses to sell her Pepsi and finds the soda supply has already been topped up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that someone (perhaps Bob) has crossed county lines and sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-tech toys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright was asked to figure out whether this was happening. To do so meant visiting every major soda wholesaler from San Luis Obispo to San Diego &ndash; about 300 miles (480km) of California coast &ndash; and checking whether any were selling soda from the wrong salesperson. When there was illegal soda on sale, she would use a drone to follow the soda delivery trucks back to their depots. In one case, the warehouse the truck led her back to was out in the desert and would have been impossible to approach by car or foot without being noticed. But the drone was able to spy on the trucks covertly. &ldquo;We could see between the warehouse door and the truck loading.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright gets her drones from high-end toy stores, for about $200 each. They&rsquo;re an expensive investment: not only do you have to buy the device, you also have to pay one or two people to pilot and spot the thing. And if you lose one during a mission, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of your budget. But it can be worth it, because for the cases in which they&rsquo;re useful, they can be very useful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yh4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright doesn&rsquo;t pilot the drones herself. &ldquo;I try to hire gamers. I go to the colleges and high schools and I find out who the geeks are, and then I hire them.&rdquo; She said that her pilots are more skilled than she would ever be &ndash; and they like the challenge. Some of them are working towards their own private investigator licences, and their hours piloting the little devices can count as hours towards their certification. (None of Wright&rsquo;s gamer pilots were willing to talk for this article. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re introverts,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Not shy, but introverts.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the idea of using drones to spy on people isn&rsquo;t something everybody is comfortable with. &lt;a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/05/chs-x-files-capitol-hill-drone-pilot-spotted-glowing-orbs-phone-thief-on-wheels/\"&gt;In a case in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a woman reported that someone was using a drone to spy on her. &ldquo;This afternoon, a stranger set an aerial drone into flight over my yard and beside my house near Miller Playfield,&rdquo; she told the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog. &ldquo;I initially mistook its noisy buzzing for a weed-whacker on this warm spring day. After several minutes, I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away.&rdquo; Her husband asked the drone operator, who was standing nearby, to move along &ndash; but the operator claimed to be acting within his legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening regulations&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t always clear. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx\"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 35 states considered adding drone bills to the books last year, and 10 states actually did add new laws. In Iowa, for example, it&rsquo;s now illegal for the state to use drones to enforce traffic laws. In North Carolina, no one can use a drone for surveillance of a person or private property. And Tennessee now specifies that it&rsquo;s a misdemeanour to use drones for surveillance of people who are hunting or fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&rsquo;s drone operations might soon become legally questionable too. Earlier this month, a California senator &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/calif-lawmakers-consider-drone-privacy-bill/31326004\"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would extend property rights into airspace, meaning that drones flying over private property would be considered trespassers. Just a few days before that, President Obama and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/15/a-brief-summary-of-the-faas-new-drone-regulations/\"&gt;announced new drone regulations&lt;/a&gt; as well, requiring &ndash; among other things &ndash; that drones must be under 55lb (25kg) and that operators must keep the flying vehicles in sight at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7xlr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the laws are murky, many private investigators steer clear of drones. &ldquo;The use of drones for surveillance is highly restricted by law,&rdquo; said Kelly Riddle, a private investigator in Texas. &ldquo;There are air space regulations as well as privacy laws that can easily be violated. Obtaining video using a drone has thus far been something that we have been advised is illegal.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because drones are often used to observe activities that can&rsquo;t be seen via a direct line of sight at ground level. Going out of your way to spy on such activities is considered an invasion of privacy, says Riddle. A lot of Wright&rsquo;s work sidesteps this privacy question, because it involves helping schools and churches monitor their own property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the use of drones will be restricted under a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations in the United States sooner than later. But in the meantime Wright will continue to use them when they can help with her work. But she also says that regardless of the legality, if someone thinks their privacy is being compromised, they&rsquo;re going to do something about it. That can mean shooting down drones &ndash; another activity that &lt;a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/man-shoots-down-drone-lawyers-scratch-their-heads\"&gt;may or may not be legal&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;I think a lot of my colleagues have lost them and realised that it is a tool, and if you invade someone&rsquo;s privacy, well, if they can hit it they will.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-18T11:27:45Z","HeadlineLong":"The private investigator who spies using drones","HeadlineShort":"I use a drone to spy on people","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Aerial vehicles are the latest tool for private detectives  but for how long?

The pair have been friends since childhood. Within the first year of their friendship, nerve damage inflicted by an inherited genetic condition robbed Haug of his sight and hearing. He was nine. But children are natural innovators. &ldquo;We started to invent languages and forms of communication just because we were kids and we wanted to play,&rdquo; says Schwengber. &ldquo;It was annoying that he couldn't hear me, and I couldn't write something down,&rdquo; she says. So the two invented their own tactile language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Haug and Schwengber grew older, they replaced their private language with one that is more widely understood: Lorm, a tactile alphabet spelled out with strokes to the hand. It was invented in the nineteenth century by Hieronymus Lorm &ndash; an anonymous pseudonym, for Austrian-born poet, journalist, and novelist &lt;a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12762.html\"&gt;Heinrich Landesmann&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; and is still used today by the deaf-blind community in German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv0k9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the importance of Lorm to Haug and Schwengber. But Lorm, and other forms of tactile signing, have their limits. A reliance on physical contact between communicators has historically constrained the social circles of the deaf-blind to those they can meet face-to-face (or more accurately hand-to-hand) on a regular basis &ndash; and even within this relatively small group of people, only those who take the time to learn and practice Lorm can really become part of a deaf-blind individual&rsquo;s social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Haug&rsquo;s social circle currently consists of about five people: his mother, Schwengber, teachers, and therapists. Once a year he spends about 10 days visiting relatives in Stuttgart in Southern Germany. &ldquo;The first five days they need to practice Lorming, so they can remember the letters, and by the tenth day when they are quite fast, it's time to go back home,&rdquo; explains Schwengber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these drawbacks might soon disappear, if a new invention by Tom Bieling is commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactile translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling, a researcher at the Design Lab in Berlin, has developed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.design-research-lab.org/projects/mobile-lorm-glove/\"&gt;glove kitted out with fabric pressure-sensors&lt;/a&gt;. By translating a tactile hand touch alphabet into digital text, the mobile glove could eliminate the necessity of hand-to-hand physical contact for deaf-blind communication. Even better, because a great deal of online communication is text-based, the glove could act as a translating device that allows people who are deaf-blind to communicate freely with anyone &ndash; and for anyone to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an invention reminiscent of the outlandish gadgets seen in James Bond movies, and it won Bieling first prize in the 2014 Falling Walls Lab competition &ndash; a kind of TED Talks meets Dragon&rsquo;s Den &ndash; held annually in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1kq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first prototype was made from Gore-Tex fabric and felt much like an ordinary glove, Bieling explains. It&rsquo;s embedded with small vibrating motors, and &ldquo;as soon as you receive an incoming message, it starts vibrating on those dots where the letters are positioned&rdquo;, he says. In the current version, users can adjust the intensity and speed of the incoming tactile messages according to their reading skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the whole hand area of the glove is now wired for sensory input, &ldquo;just like a tablet [computer]&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The system recognises both the position and pattern of the finger movement.&rdquo; So users can also spell out their own messages.If a sign isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;typed&rdquo; quite correctly, the Lorm glove system recognises the closest symbol &ndash; just like a spell checker on your smart phone. For example, a circle in the hand would be an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, explains Bieling, and even if you type a triangle or a square, the system is clever enough to recognise the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; as the closest correct symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enhancing independence&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking through Schwengber&rsquo;s translation, Haug describes the glove prototype as a bit slower than what he is used to in terms of receiving messages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his teacher or his mother Lorming,&rdquo; says Schwengber, compared with her own speedy pace. &ldquo;But he really likes it,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the glove, &ldquo;I can send and receive &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; says Haug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling&rsquo;s project is part of his doctoral studies exploring links between design and ability. He argues that feeling disabled is a question of design &ndash; a ramp, for instance, is easy for anyone to ascend, even if they are in a wheelchair. He hopes that his design will enable deaf-blind people to engage with a broader spectrum of their community and &ldquo;gain access to a broader range of information, thus enhancing their independence&rdquo;. But he also hopes that gaining knowledge about alternative communication systems can profit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1wv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haug, now 22, currently lives with his mother in Spreewald, about 100km south of Berlin. He is studying massage therapy in the hopes of pursuing it as a profession. He would like to move to Berlin, explains Schwengber, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that has thus far eluded him because of the lack of assistance available. The glove could expand Haug&rsquo;s ability to stay in close touch with those closest to him while living at a distance. But it could do more than that: it could allow him to expand his currently small social circle dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Haug, with help from Schwengber, has been having fun on Twitter, a medium enabling him to converse with people who need never know that he is deaf-blind. On social media, Haug is &ldquo;just a person behind the Twitter account saying something&rdquo;, explains Schwengber. Haug describes it as a bit like playing carnival, because &ldquo;you just mask up and say anything you want&rdquo;, translates Schwengber. &ldquo;Content matters, not the person,&rdquo; she explains. So Haug gets a kick out of the reaction from followers when he Tweets amusing things, something he&rsquo;d be able to do more easily and independently with his own Lorm glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the first thing he would say with a Lorm glove of his own, Haug says he would talk to his cousin in Stuttgart and ask him if he can remember the name of an interesting film they recently spoke about. (Schwengber and Haug often go to the cinema &ndash; where Schwengber simultaneously translates the movie for Haug via Lorm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted the digital revolution and the amazing new connections it has offered. For those constrained by a barrier of unseen sights and unheard sounds, it was once unexplored territory &ndash; but with the Lorm glove, they might just have that world in the palm of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-13T09:29:01Z","HeadlineLong":"The glove that transmits touch over the internet","HeadlineShort":"The glove turning touch into talk","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Blind-deaf people are often forced to live in a small and isolated world.

And he knew there was only one place in the world to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former professor of robotics at MIT and co-founder of the highly successful Massachusetts-based company iRobot, Brooks had spent enough time in Boston to recognise its dominance in his field. &ldquo;There is nowhere else in the world with such a concentration of academic robotics programs,&rdquo; says Brooks, whose latest company is &lt;a href=\"http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/\"&gt;Rethink Robotics&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;There also is nowhere else in the world with such a concentration of existing entrepreneurial robotics companies. Silicon Valley does not come close. New York does not come close. Pittsburgh does not come close. Nowhere in Europe comes close. Nowhere in Japan comes close.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston has always made the shortlist of US cities that excel in technology and entrepreneurship. But in recent years, the common perception is that the city has fallen behind. Silicon Valley has long since surpassed it in size, and New York City is becoming a hotbed of start-up activity. Even newer tech hubs such as Los Angeles and Boulder, Colorado, are seen by some as having more momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston, meanwhile, has become more famous for being the place where young entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook) and Drew Houston (Dropbox) started their companies, before deciding to move to California to make them bigger. Even the well-known start-up accelerator &lt;a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/\"&gt;YCombinator&lt;/a&gt; started in Boston, before picking up and moving west to become a pillar of Silicon Valley culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that view of Boston, though common in the tech press, misses both the lasting strength of the city&rsquo;s innovation scene, and its recent evolution toward urbanisation, collaboration, and risk-taking. Boston is a place with a history of expertise in science, healthcare, robotics, big data, and software. And for entrepreneurs like Brooks, it offers a tech scene unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Deep and mature&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s and 80s, Boston became a computing industry hub, home to leading companies like Digital Equipment, Wang, and Data General. But the tech cluster that grew outside the city around the &nbsp;Route 128 highway famously missed the start of the PC revolution. And so by the 1990s, Silicon Valley had left Boston firmly in its dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the ingredients that had propelled Boston&rsquo;s strength in technology remained: world-class research universities, a highly educated population, and a high concentration of venture capital. (Boston can also claim the creation of the first formal venture capital firm, &lt;a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/04/06/venture_capitals_grandfather/?page=full\"&gt;American Research and Development&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded in 1946.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Destin of Atlas Venture describes the city&rsquo;s innovation ecosystem as being deep and mature. &ldquo;It's probably the only true &lsquo;generalist&rsquo; ecosystem outside of the Bay Area,&rdquo; he says. A &lt;a href=\"http://blog.startupcompass.co/pages/entrepreneurship-ecosystem-report\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; last year by the Startup Genome, an initiative to catalogue start-up statistics globally, seems to agree. Though the report notes that Boston now trails New York in the size of its ecosystem, it highlights the former&rsquo;s diversity, concluding that &ldquo;the Boston start-up ecosystem has the same healthy mix of start-ups&hellip;as [Silicon Valley].&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breadth of the city&rsquo;s innovation can be attributed in large part to Greater Boston&rsquo;s eight research universities, including Harvard and MIT. Together, they bring in &lt;a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2003/econimpact.html\"&gt;$1.5bn (&pound;1bn) annually&lt;/a&gt; in research grants and contracts, a significant amount of which translates into innovative technologies and ideas that eventually fuel the creation of start-ups. &ldquo;Concentration of universities is a big contributor to that entrepreneurial environment,&rdquo; says Gordon Jones, managing director of &lt;a href=\"http://ilab.harvard.edu/\"&gt;Harvard&rsquo;s Innovation Lab&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;The size of the city relative to the concentration of universities makes it very palpable.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the universities have always been seen as a key source of new technologies, today their role in producing student entrepreneurs is equally important. Spurred in part by a fear of missing out on the next Zuckerberg, venture capitalists are actively courting students and their dorm-room start-ups. General Catalyst, one of the younger of Boston&rsquo;s premier VC firms, has gone so far as to formalise this effort by creating &lt;a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2012/12/12/rough-draft-ventures-general-catalyst-funds-student-startups/\"&gt;Rough Draft Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, a mini-VC fund backed by the firm but run by students. With Rough Draft, General Catalyst brought together the city&rsquo;s most talented student entrepreneurs, and tasked them with making small investments in their peers. The fund has made several such investments so far, and in July, General Catalyst &lt;a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/all-series/harvard-alum-peter-boyce-joins-general-catalyst-partners/\"&gt;hired Peter Boyce&lt;/a&gt;, a graduating member of the initial Rough Draft team, as an associate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universities are also expanding their support for entrepreneurship, with ideas like Harvard&rsquo;s i-Lab, which functions as both an incubator for student start-ups and as a single resource centre to connect entrepreneurial activities across campus. This echoes MIT&rsquo;s pioneering &lt;a href=\"http://media.mit.edu/\"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which was set up in 1985 and has long been encouraging entrepreneurship in areas ranging from wearable computing to stackable electric cars for cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic strengths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other big difference between today and the Route 128 days is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/08/how-east-coast-tech-startups-became-downtown-phenomenon/6301/\"&gt;shifting centre of gravity&lt;/a&gt; from the suburbs to the city. Kendall Square, the home of MIT in neighbouring Cambridge and a long-time start-up hub, has exploded with activity in the past several years. &ldquo;You can't walk down the street in Kendall Square, Cambridge, without running into venture capitalists, Nobel laureates, start-up CEOs,&rdquo; says Tim Rowe, founder of the Kendall-based &lt;a href=\"http://cic.us/\"&gt;Cambridge Innovation Center&lt;/a&gt;. Rowe&rsquo;s CIC, founded in 1999, is a big part of that. It has served as an early incubator for many of Boston&rsquo;s current crop of growing tech start-ups, including HubSpot, which makes marketing software. HubSpot spent four years in the CIC from 2004, growing to nearly &lt;a href=\"http://cic.us/2010/08/after-four-great-years-cic-says-thank-you-and-goodbye-to-hubspot/\"&gt;200 employees&lt;/a&gt; by the time it moved to its own office space. As of the end of 2012, the company claimed &lt;a href=\"http://www.hubspot.com/blog/bid/34205/HubSpot-Continues-Rapid-Trajectory-with-82-Revenue-Growth\"&gt;$52.5m (&pound;33.9m) in annual revenue and 450 employees&lt;/a&gt;; it is expected to go public in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kendall is not the only beneficiary of Boston&rsquo;s increasingly urbanised tech cluster. An &ldquo;Innovation District&rdquo; championed by Mayor Thomas Menino has attracted young tech companies - including Rethink Robotics- &nbsp;and more established innovators like Zipcar and EnerNOC. Many VC firms have also relocated from the suburbs, opening offices in Boston or Cambridge. And most of these mini-clusters are connected by the &lt;a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2013/07/01/branding-boston-tech-how-about-just-the-red-line/\"&gt;red line&lt;/a&gt; of the city&rsquo;s subway system, making them easy to travel to without a car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these shifts, some things about Boston&rsquo;s tech scene are unchanged. It remains comparatively strong in areas where it can flex its academic muscles, like &lt;a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/08/24/why-magnet-for-life-sciences/aGZ9zxinynXfEdDy0OfRYM/story.html\"&gt;healthcare and biotech&lt;/a&gt;, robotics, and big data. Its successes in software have been concentrated more in business solutions - Endeca, ITA Software, Demandware, now HubSpot - than the consumer technologies that tend to garner more attention. That mix is in stark contrast to New York, which is more narrowly &lt;a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2012/10/22/the-real-difference-between-boston-and-new-yorks-tech-sectors/\"&gt;concentrated in web and mobile software&lt;/a&gt; startups. But while the two cities are intense rivals when it comes to sports, their geographical closeness is creating a &lt;a href=\"http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2013/04/29/the-bolt-bus-economy-a-boston-reporters-trip-to-silicon-alley\"&gt;significant degree of collaboration&lt;/a&gt;, with investors splitting time between the two cities or opening satellite offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York&rsquo;s advantage is its size, as well as its status as a global leader in both finance and culture. As Destin put it: &ldquo;[Boston&rsquo;s] main weakness lies in the fact that it is not a great aspirational city or region, in the way that New York, London or the Bay Area can be. Young people come to study at its great institutions then leave. If Boston became aspirational in terms of culture and lifestyle it could take the next step up,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One related challenge the Boston tech community wrestles with is how to tell its own story. &ldquo;Boston doesn't hype its success,&rdquo; says Eric Paley, managing partner at the VC firm Founder Collective. &ldquo;But it is a community that has consistently built big technology companies.&rdquo; In a city with less well-known media than New York, and fewer tech-specific publications than Silicon Valley, getting the word out can be difficult&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, at least, the sheer novelty of the innovation is enough to overcome that obstacle. In September, 2012, Brooks and the Rethink Robotics team unveiled its flagship product: &lt;a href=\"http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/products/overview/\"&gt;Baxter&lt;/a&gt;, a manufacturing robot designed to work side-by-side with humans, able to be taught new tasks without any programming. By that time, Brooks had &lt;a href=\"http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2012/09/18/rod-brooks-and-rethink-reveal-an-industrial-robot-for-the-masses/\"&gt;raised $62m&lt;/a&gt; (&pound;40m) in venture capital, from both Boston and West Coast firms. The launch caught the attention of media across the country, garnering &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/opinion/sunday/i-made-the-robot-do-it.html\"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/science/a-robot-with-a-delicate-touch.html?pagewanted=all\"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; in The New York Times. For a moment, at least, the world remembered what Boston&rsquo;s tech ecosystem does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"559a5a69157e584f77e17491"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-09-04T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Boston: The start-up revolution reviving its tech cred","HeadlineShort":"Boston: Restoring its tech cred?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Boston was once Americas most thriving tech hub.

In 2010, then-president Dmitry Medvedev gave orders to create an innovative centre from scratch &ndash; this in a country where all tech parks and scientific centres have been inherited from the Soviet past. &ldquo;We have money but don&rsquo;t have our Silicon Valley,&rdquo; he said on his visit to Silicon Valley, after earlier stressing it was a project &ldquo;that should become the largest test ground for Russian new economic policy.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the moment plans for an internationally renowned tech hub a half-hour&rsquo;s drive from Red Square are still a dream. The fantasy starts with the idea that it takes half an hour to drive there through Moscow&rsquo;s notoriously heavy traffic; on a weekday it takes a few hours. When you reach there you are greeted with signs saying &ldquo;Skolkovo - we are making the future today&rdquo;, but beyond the perimeter fence lies a couple of cranes and an excavator digging the foundations of this future fantasy. Several hundred metres away stands the only finished building, called Hypercube; it is supposed to be an example of the eco-friendly principles intended for Skolkovo. Looking at the building from the dusty and polluted highway, however, makes you wonder just how green the enterprise will truly be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after its announcement by President Medvedev, Skolkovo still raises more questions than answers. Getting Skolkovo off the ground has not been cheap, with billions of oil dollars spent, and yet more to be allocated. There are doubts that the Russian government &ndash; now headed by Vladimir Putin &ndash; has the conviction to keep going. The investments are impressive though. The road to be built to Skolkovo and around the area is said to cost $2 billion. However, the biggest questions facing start-ups that have, or want to, set up shop there is where they are going to work and live. The whole site is supposed to be finished by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source close to Skolkovo said that the project is modeled on tech centres such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.sophia-antipolis.org/\"&gt;Sophia Antipolis&lt;/a&gt; in France, &lt;a href=\"http://www.cyberjaya-msc.com/\"&gt;Cyberjaya&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia or &lt;a href=\"http://www.masdar.ae/en/\"&gt;Masdar&lt;/a&gt; in UAE. While the start-ups wait for the so needed infrastructure to be finished in 2015-16, they are being sent to other scientific centres to carry on their projects. Skolkovo&rsquo;s vice-president for external communications and advertising, Alexander Chernov, has tried to assure the press everything is fine and will be finished soon. &ldquo;It is a usual trend with construction business in Russia. Two years shift is not that bad but we will welcome our residents in 2015. If not, we will look like losers.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long history of scientific and technological breakthroughs, but it is suffering from a hangover from recent decades. The Cold War and the Iron Curtain played a key role in maintaining a competitive and innovative spirit in closed science cities of the Soviet Union, such as &lt;a href=\"http://novosibirskguide.com/Akademgorodok/\"&gt;Akademgorodok&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the Cold War, everything changed. The new Russia found itself with the remnants of the once powerful Soviet scientific machine and a huge brain drain in the direction of the US. Innovative ideas started to matter very little in a new capitalist society focused on selling Russia&rsquo;s vast natural resources and cashing in US dollars. It took two decades for a project like Skolkovo to emerge from the Kremlin&rsquo;s corridors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what will Skolkovo concentrate on? There are five core areas: information technology, nuclear technology, energy efficiency, biomedical innovation, and space and telecommunications. Companies receiving resident status can work on their projects and attempt to bring them to market. Skolkovo&rsquo;s grants and construction are mostly backed up by the money from the Russian government. The investment is supposed to reach over $15bn (&pound;10bn) by 2020. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, Skolkovo has received over 10,000 online applications. Applicants range from companies and startup groups to scientific centres, universities, student groups and distinguished scientists. Most applicants fail to become residents. &ldquo;The main challenge here is either a project doesn&rsquo;t fit into the five clusters or it hasn&rsquo;t been worked through. Sometimes companies overestimate their abilities or their idea has already been developed in the market,&rdquo; says Chernov.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, more than 900 Skolkovo residents or startup companies are working on projects across the five clusters. Many of them have already received grants from the Skolkovo Fund said to expect to be worth $2bn (&pound;1.28bn) by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the grant recipients is &lt;a href=\"http://www.fruct.org/\"&gt;Fruct&lt;/a&gt; founded by Russian and Finnish universities together with Nokia. Although they won the money last year, they should receive the $300,000 (&pound;191,000) grant this autumn to develop a mobile device which monitors eight key diagnostic markers such as cardiovascular, pulmonology and endocrinologic readings, to help monitor potential health problems such as arterial hypertension arrhythmia, asthma, and &nbsp;diabetes.. Asked about how they will spend the money, the head of Fruct, Sergey Balandin, says: &ldquo;The challenge was to make investors believe in our project. We will put more emphasis on the research now. We will try to improve the weak sides of our project with the help of Skolkovo Fund&rsquo;s specialists and prepare the product to enter the market.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hopefuls have not been so lucky. &lt;a href=\"http://www.bravomotors.ru/\"&gt;Bravo Motors&lt;/a&gt; applied for the grant to finance its project for an ultra-light electric vehicle called the e-Trike. The main challenge for Bravo now is to find $1.4 m (&pound;890,000) in investment to complete the development of the e-Trike, carry out bench and field testing, and start production. But to get tax incentives, the company had to change the e-Trike&rsquo;s colour from red to green &ndash; the same colour used on Skolkovo&rsquo;s logo. Being part of Skolkovo may mean compromises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distrustful politicians &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skolkovo has not been without rumours of corruption, either. Medvedev tried to avoid corruption by appointing Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg as the President of Skolkovo. But 2013 started with several cases. &lt;a href=\"http://www.skoltech.ru/\"&gt;Skoltech University&lt;/a&gt; is being created to educate in-house innovators of tomorrow. MIT is heavily involved with the project, helping Skoltech with the structure, educational and research programs. The university hasn&rsquo;t been built yet &ndash; but already it has created a corruption scandal. The state audit office found out recently that millions of dollars allocated to Skolkovo&rsquo;s Skoltech, went, instead, to finance programs and grants at MIT. The government tried to bury the story, but &lt;a href=\"http://izvestia.ru/news/548178\"&gt;Russian newspaper Izvestia&lt;/a&gt; got hold of the case documents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the political situation to contend with. Even Skolkovo&rsquo;s biggest cheerleaders understand start-ups like the e-Trike won&rsquo;t be able to make a return on the multi-billion-dollar investments poured into the project. Russian politicians, in general, are distrustful of innovations they don&rsquo;t understand such as a recent discussion at Skolkovo on the creation perpetuum mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to Skolkovo who wished to remain anonymous, says: &nbsp;&ldquo;The success of Skolkovo should be assessed on the basis of whether it manages to create a huge and successful business like Yandex [Russia&rsquo;s biggest search engine] and Mail.ru [Russian email].&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Skolkovo is to prove it can make money, rather than just spend it. It has been created from the very top of the political spectrum - with huge investments &ndash; but the buildings remain unconstructed, and the ideas that could make it profitable remain untapped.&nbsp; The question is, will this always be the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-28T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Skolkovo: Tech city that aims to restore nation's pride","HeadlineShort":"Russia: Restoring its tech pride?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In the Soviet era, Russian science was lavished with money and resources.

Excel, I ask you! It beggars belief. But managers here like the old ways.&rdquo; When changes were suggested he was stonewalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venting his irritation on Twitter led him to a conversation about the business practices afflicting Japan&rsquo;s tech sector with a fellow malcontent. One face-to-face meeting later, he quit his job to form a company with his new comrade rebel with and created the website &lt;a href=\"http://www.paradiseware.net\"&gt;Paradiseware&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"https://app.mmth.tw/?lang=en\"&gt;helps businesses manage projects more efficiently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is typically Japanese; run on a shoestring without any of the benefits Silicon Valley start-ups might attract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has a real problem with innovation. It&rsquo;s just not very Japanese. Nor, you might be surprised to read, is originality. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing swaggering foreigners or suspect loners are thought to meddle in. So if you visit Japan and find ersatz statues of Liberty in tourist spots, or a very &lt;a href=\"http://www.cooljapan.org/\"&gt;uncool bureaucratic drive&lt;/a&gt; to promote Japanese creativity and culture ripped off from Cool Britannia - you&rsquo;ll begin to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan is \"good at technology but poor in business\" as one official puts it. &ldquo;Its high levels of basic research and superior technology are hampered by too-strict regulations, and vertically integrated administration. The gap between researchers and manufacturers, in many cases, prevents brilliant R&amp;D results from being put into practical use - the &lsquo;Death Valley&rsquo; problem.&rdquo; Japan leads in its high number of early adopters. Thanks to them, inventors can gain confidence and the initial momentum needed to push off a new idea. But it often doesn&rsquo;t last long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Unfortunately this is accompanied by a very envious, critical and vocal audience. They underline every possible reason that the product will fail and keep doing so indefatigably. They attack the innovator on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc; and they keep doing so until the innovator raises a white flag.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to this 20 year&rsquo;s economic stagnation, zero appetite for risk and eroded confidence and Japan emerges as one the toughest environments on Earth to root new ideas.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggling start-ups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are backers in Japan, his partner Shuku Tanizaki explains, but most are interested only in no-risk ventures. Start-ups have to attract crowd-funding or, as is more usual, the personal savings of their creators. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of venture capitalists here but they are only interested in games and new media,&rdquo; says Hashimoto. Even renting conventional office space can be troublesome in Japan - landlords like to see two years&rsquo; profits before they open the door. Paradiseware operates out of cheap, shared office space in central Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think starting a new business means also confronting the problems afflicting your society,&rdquo; says Mr Hashimoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being perceived as a big-hitting innovator, Japan has a tiny, struggling start-up landscape that has yet to make an impact abroad. &ldquo;This is because this sector is the most under-supported in Japan,&rdquo; says Terrie Lloyd, an Australian entrepreneur and commentator based in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the global digital economy grows in importance, this puts Japan, the world&rsquo;s third-biggest economy and one-time electronics giant, at a massive disadvantage. America and even tiny South Korea continue to come up with the gadgets and smartphone-based services that consumers want. Japan&rsquo;s sluggish megacorporations such as Sony are unable to match the swift-footed foreign competition and fall further and further behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strangles originality here, explains Tokyo-based technology consultant Nobuyuki Hayashi, is that Japanese innovation keeps to very rigid structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Most of them went to the same university, studied the same subjects and never met people from outside the group. This is because of the Japanese educational system and how Japanese recruiting is done,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Japanese companies tend to hire graduates from the same school.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spectacular failure to respond to the internet age is slowly being challenged, however, both by the country&rsquo;s new government and a few entrepreneurs. Copying ideas from Silicon Valley, top entrepreneurs and officials have tried for over a decade now to spark some life into Japan&rsquo;s hi-tech sector by increasing incubation projects and the like. Japan now has over 400 business incubators up from 30 in 1999 some of which are focused on the hi-tech sector. Most offer funding, work space and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after being held back by the entropy of their elders for so long, Japan&rsquo;s enterprising young are going it alone. An experienced user interface designer in Japan and abroad, 26-year-old Alexander Takahashi simply rents shared office space, and networks for Angel investors when he can, to develop a location-based service named &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rooftops/id552140477?mt=8\"&gt;Rooftops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understands the reservations. &ldquo;Japanese businessmen tend not to trust the younger generation. No matter how well you present yourself - young equals bad,&rdquo; says Takahashi.&nbsp; &ldquo;And honestly I can understand them. There are no really new start-ups with new ideas nowadays.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese young entrepreneurs are enthusiastic but lack crucial business know-how, says Lloyd. &ldquo;They are totally unprepared for the business world, and this is why cloistered accelerators and incubators are so popular here,&rdquo; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitoshi Masuda, who until recently headed up the government&rsquo;s small-business think tank, disagrees. He says: &ldquo;Japan is changing profoundly but dynamically in terms of who drives innovation and how innovation is being driven.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic reforms under a new government - Abenomics, named for the PM Shinzo Abe - are having some positive effects. His party has also promised to fight the corner of all innovators, risk takers and creative types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model is a bunch of maverick, by Japanese standards, entrepreneurs which include Japan&rsquo;s third-richest man, Masayoshi Son, born to a Korean immigrant family, whose mobile phone empire Softbank is funding a brave attempt at commercialising home-grown green tech innovations. His outsider outlook was a huge benefit, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If you look at successful Japanese start-ups, they are mostly run by CEOs who have applied the &lsquo;foreign connection&rsquo; in some way - be it education, money, technology, business deals, or talent,&rdquo; says Lloyd. &ldquo;In some cases, like Mr Son, he has managed to combine all five factors.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those factors seem to have inoculated such champions against fear of failure making them bold at the same time. They represent a new way of being Japanese &ndash; one the nation urgently needs to get to grips with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can Japan reboot its anti-innovation start-up culture?","HeadlineShort":"Can Japan plug its start-up gap?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Japan has long been hailed as one of the worlds most developed nations.

That set a pattern, and soon there was &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3249891.stm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Glen&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland, Kenya&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21173158\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Savannah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.silicongulf.net/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Gulf&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines, &lt;a href=\"http://www.academpark.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Taiga&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia &ndash; even the somewhat less romantic-sounding &lt;a href=\"http://www.siliconroundabout.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Roundabout&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there is Silicon Allee in Berlin (Allee, meaning alley or avenue in German, is part of many street names in the city), which to some observers evokes the atmosphere of the early days in Northern California. That was certainly the vibe at &lt;a href=\"http://toaberlin.com/\"&gt;Tech Open Air Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, a gathering held earlier this month in a ramshackle complex of wooden and stone buildings in Kreuzberg, a trendy part of the city. There was soft acoustic music and falafel, and a lot of beautiful people exuding a studied coolness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see a lot of amazing stuff coming out of Berlin,&rdquo; says Tikhon Bernstam, who came over from Silicon Valley to attend the event. &ldquo;This sort of culture that you see here, the hippy music, we had exactly the same thing in San Francisco a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve been impressed by the quality of the companies I&rsquo;ve been seeing here.&rdquo; Bernstam&rsquo;s cloud data service he co-founded, Parse, was recently bought by Facebook for $85 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Berlin is many leagues behind Silicon Valley. From Adobe through to Yahoo, via Apple, Intel, Google and Oracle, the Valley, as its occupants call it, has a combined wealth which most countries would envy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact figures are hard to come by, but Berlin came ninth in &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/06/new-global-start-cities/5144/\"&gt;a recent global ranking&lt;/a&gt; of cities with the most tech start-ups founded since 2002 that are global, or received angel funding or institutional venture capital. The top three spots were occupied by San Francisco-Silicon Valley with 201 start-ups, New York (144) and London (90). Berlin had 27, just ahead of Bangalore on 26 and Sao Paulo on 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with its reputation for doing things differently, very cheap rents, and the ambition and optimism on show at events like Tech Open Air Berlin, the hope is that its scene will deliver on the buzz that has surrounded it for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city itself is in many ways a start up. From 1945 it was shattered and split for almost half a century. The eastern, Soviet-controlled zone was hardly a seed-bed for innovation. Industry moved out from the West. Students were exempted from military service, attracting a young, artistic and politically radical alternative scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of the Wall in 1989, the city has been re-inventing itself. The vibrant alternative culture remains in place, and some see it as providing fertile ground for the creation of disruptive technologies &ndash; though others argue that a counterculture-led antipathy to money-making may hamper innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear is that property is cheap &ndash; Berlin still has rents which are so low that they make visitors from London and New York gasp. The average annual cost of a workstation in an office in Berlin, including maintenance costs, taxes and rent, was $8,410 at the end of last year, compared with $14,050 for New York and $14,620 in the City of London, according to &lt;a href=\"http://dtz.b15media.com/downloads/DTZ_Occupier_Perspective_Global_Occupancy_Costs_Offices_2013.pdf\"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published by the global property company DTZ. Renting a 120 square metre apartment in Berlin costs around a third what it does in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination has attracted many who aspire to be the next big thing in tech. In a few cases they have already succeeded, such as the social game developer &lt;a href=\"http://www.wooga.com/\"&gt;Wooga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/\"&gt;Research Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a networking website for scientists. The darling of the scene is &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/\"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, an audio sharing platform that has 200 million users every month. Alex Ljung, its co-founder and chief executive, moved the company from Stockholm to Berlin because he felt it offered a richer mix of people involved in music, and because of the ample and cheap office space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ljung admits his firm&rsquo;s new hometown doesn&rsquo;t cover all bases. &ldquo;With start-up life, there&rsquo;s never really much calmness. It&rsquo;s all jet and no lag,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In an average month, I spend about a week-and-a-half in Berlin, about a week in San Francisco and the rest of the time split between Los Angeles, New York and London.&rdquo; What Berlin lacks that San Francisco has is the sheer volume of people who&rsquo;ve grown tech companies, where Ljung says he can bump into others who have trodden the same path, and who can advise him on short-cuts and pitfalls. In New York, London and Los Angeles, he can meet plenty of people with money to invest in good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bernstam, investors from the US are scared to invest in Germany because they don&rsquo;t understand the way companies are structured and corporate regulations. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand what could happen if future investors tried to dilute us,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and investors from the States don&rsquo;t understand yet how that works abroad &ndash; and are frankly scared of investing abroad.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which created a chicken-and-egg problem in Berlin. Some entrepreneurs have stayed away because of the lack of investors, and those with the money have preferred to go elsewhere because of the greater number of companies to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this resistance is beginning breaking down, on both sides, according to David Knight, editor-in-chief of Berlin tech scene blog &lt;a href=\"http://siliconallee.com/\"&gt;Silicon Allee&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been this streak of creativity and once you got a core of people, which started round 2009, you started to get a lot of investors from the US and Europe looking to Berlin. It&rsquo;s still at a very early stage, but there&rsquo;s a lot more money now than there was two years ago.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Districts such as Kreuzberg, Neukoelln and Prenzlauer Berg, where would-be entrepreneurs congregate in the bars and cafes offering wi-fi, are now seeing the effect of this. In Prenzlauer Berg, &lt;a href=\"http://www.factoryberlin.com/\"&gt;Factory&lt;/a&gt;, which received &euro;1 million in funding from Google, has rented space to over 15 companies, including SoundCloud. The city also now has a lot more of what might be called serious business people. Florian Lanzer is trying to build a website selling green products to people who are not necessarily committed environmentalists. He said the project has attracted a lot of interest, including the involvement of a former CEO of Sony Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What Berlin gets right is that it attracts the right kind of people,&rdquo; says Lanzer. &ldquo;Young people with talent and people with long track records and massive experience are coming together.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a decade ago, Berlin was famously described as being &ldquo;poor, but sexy&rdquo; by its mayor, Klaus Wowereit. The hope is that creativity and commerce is now beginning to combine in tech in such a way that it might finally shed its poor tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Berlin start-ups: Cool and commerce coming together?","HeadlineShort":"Berlin: Can cool and capital mix?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In a new series Innovation Cultures takes an on-the-ground look at tech scenes around the world that hope in some way to emulate the successes of Silicon Valley.

His customers found it difficult to get what they needed. Some would complain; others would simply leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sell many products, I didn&rsquo;t have many suppliers, and I used to have problems with working capital,&rdquo; recalls Wainaina, the 27-year-old entrepreneur and professionally trained veterinarian. &ldquo;I would tell them to come back next time. Some used to come back, but most lost trust and disappeared.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His problem, and that of the farmers he wanted to serve, cut straight to the heart of one of sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s deepest challenges when it comes to creating a profitable agricultural sector: access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa is home to a quarter of the world&rsquo;s arable land &ndash; ripe and ready to become the world&rsquo;s breadbasket. Yet a stunning 80% of this is not being utilised. And of the 20% that is, the majority is owned by poor smallholder farmers with just one or two hectares of land, who face enormous challenges when it comes to accessing things to improve harvests and incomes that developed world farmers perhaps take for granted: credit; seeds; fertiliser; information on weather and market prices; and the markets to sell their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical overhaul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things are beginning to turn around. A wide range of innovations are being developed in Kenya to help increase farmers&rsquo; access to inputs, information and markets, and to boost their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since last July, Wainaina has been the proud owner of a &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.farmshop.co.ke/\"&gt;Farm Shop&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; store, joining a growing franchise network (locally owned and operated) of agro dealers located in rural and under-served areas of Kenya, which hopes to boost smallholder productivity by providing farmers with high-quality products, services, and information. Where once there was a haphazardly arranged set of goods hidden behind a metal cage, now his shop&rsquo;s aisles and shelves are neatly stocked with everything from fertilisers to hybrid seeds, insecticides, and micro-drip irrigation systems. The store holds demos, promotions, and free training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the keys to Farm Shop&rsquo;s radical overhaul is that it has done away with the incredibly cumbersome, slow, and inefficient process of paper ledgers and stock keeping. In each store, owners are given an Android-powered tablet with software that allows them quickly and easily order inventory &ndash; all at the touch of a button. Point-of-sale transactions are now tracked in real-time, which gives the company a unique ability to track and respond to every single sale, as well as prices and inventory levels. &ldquo;Before, we used to use cash receipts and paper record books,&rdquo; says Wainaina. We can now trace all our sales, find totals easily, and order supplies much faster.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect has been almost immediate. Business, says Wainaina, has increased nearly five-fold since he converted the store. Last month, his Farm Shop branch saw an astounding 400,000 KES ($4,500) in sales, with over 1,350 transactions. Farm Shop currently has four shops across Kenya, offering 54 products and services like soil testing, and they are planning on opening eight new shops in eight weeks, starting this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also offering to help farmers actually figure out what they need to improve their harvest. With their new soil-testing service, Farm Shop agents can collect soil samples from farmers, and within a few days send results directly to the farmers via SMS, informing them what will help improve yields. For example, if they detect a potassium deficiency, a farmer can then go to the shop and purchase more fertiliser, or get the right kind for what their soil needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Farm Shop is not an answer to all farmers&rsquo; woes. As Julio De Souza, Farm Shop&rsquo;s COO admits, &ldquo;no individual solution can solve the problems for rural farmers in Africa. It&rsquo;s an ecosystem that needs to be built.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hedging harvests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ecosystem, at least in Kenya, is slowly starting to develop. Several innovations like Farm Shop are improving the lives and income of Africa&rsquo;s struggling smallholder farmers, and across the entire value chain of rural agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, social enterprise &lt;a href=\"http://kilimosalama.wordpress.com/\"&gt;Kilimo Salama&lt;/a&gt; has been piloting a crop insurance scheme for smallholder farmers, hoping to reduce risk and serve a critical and vulnerable market that traditional insurance schemes don&rsquo;t reach. &ldquo;Nobody ever really wakes up and says &lsquo;I want insurance&rsquo;,&rdquo; confesses Rose Goslinga, Technical Coordinator for Kilimo Salama. But, it&rsquo;s become a highly valuable tool for helping farmers secure much-needed credit from banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, farmers try to reduce their exposure to risks like crop failure (from bad rains or crop parasites) by minimising their investment in farming inputs. As a consequence, farmers remain trapped in a cycle of low agricultural productivity and poverty. If the rains fail, they are left with nothing to invest in the next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using weather stations across the country, Kilimo Salama has developed a unique &ldquo;weather-based index insurance,&rdquo; which farmers can buy into at the beginning of the season, for typically around 10-20% of the amount they invest in seeds and inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather stations are equipped with small sim-cards that wirelessly transmit data every five minutes to a cloud-based server. At the end of the season, this data is aggregated and coupled with satellite data, and used to map out rain patterns. Kilimo Salama then works with agronomists to calculate the index &ndash; and find where the rain was too much, too little, or at the wrong time. Farmer payouts are automatically calculated based on their crops, location, and number of seeds purchased.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;By coupling bank loans with Kilimo Salama&rsquo;s insurance scheme, the organisation has enabled banks and microfinance institutions to be more comfortable with giving loans, making access to essential credit easier for farmers. &ldquo;We not just selling insurance,&rdquo; says Goslinga, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re enabling farmers to get a harvest.&rdquo; As of this year, Kilimo Salama has insured over 100,000 smallholder farmers across Kenya and Rwanda.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One SMS at a time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even if farmers have a great harvest, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy for them to sell their produce. Calestous Juma, Harvard Professor and author of The New Harvest; Agricultural Innovation in Africa claims that the greatest failure of Africa&rsquo;s agricultural sector is the absence of investment in rural infrastructure. &ldquo;Markets cannot function if you cannot move goods, services, information and ideas,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the problem is many of Africa&rsquo;s rural farmers can&rsquo;t get their produce to the markets in time, because of bad roads, lack of communication, and the nature of a highly fractured middle-man-dominated agricultural market. Back in 2011, when nearly 3.7 million people in northern Kenya were facing near-famine conditions, farmers in other parts of the country were either driven by swindling middlemen to sell cabbage at nearly a tenth of the price, or waste it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.mfarm.co.ke/\"&gt;MFarm&lt;/a&gt;, a Kenya-based tech startup, is trying to boost this sector, &ldquo;one SMS at a time.&rdquo; Sub-Saharan Africa has the fastest-growing mobile market in the world, increasing at an average of 44% annually since 2000, according to the worldwide mobile communications industry association GSMA. Mobile penetration in Kenya is well over 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a simple text message, MFarm allows rural farmers in remote areas of Kenya to check the latest market prices, post information on their harvest for buyers to see and purchase, and band together with other farmers in their area to make bulk purchases of expensive but needed agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilisers and equipment at discounted rates. It also allows them to join together to sell their harvests, making it easier for buyers to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MFarm&rsquo;s approach hopes to improve the agricultural sector by in a sense leapfrogging physical infrastructure troubles, and using existing mobile communications infrastructure to increase buyer/seller relationships and transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before [services like MFarm], farmers were being exploited by middlemen,&rdquo; claims Adrian Mukhebi, Chairman of the Kenya Agricultural Commodities Exchange (KACE). &ldquo;Now, with information via mobiles, farmers are better able to bargain prices against middlemen, and can in some cases increase 25-35% of their profits.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology&rsquo;s role in improving access for farmers may be exciting and hold great potential, Mukhebi claims, but as these tools and information are not yet available to all farmers it still has some way to go. But if and when they do, perhaps Africa could begin fulfilling its vast potential &ndash; feeding itself and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-04-08T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Tech fix for Africas big farming challenge","HeadlineShort":"Tech taps Africas farm potential","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Africa could help feed the world if its farmland was properly utilised.

on 400 hectares of the most expensive Russian real estate outside central Moscow, Skolkovo is intended to be one of the biggest tech innovation centres in the world. In 2010, then-president Dmitry Medvedev gave orders to create an innovative centre from scratch &ndash; this in a country where all tech parks and scientific centres have been inherited from the Soviet past. &ldquo;We have money but don&rsquo;t have our Silicon Valley,&rdquo; he said on his visit to Silicon Valley, after earlier stressing it was a project &ldquo;that should become the largest test ground for Russian new economic policy.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the moment plans for an internationally renowned tech hub a half-hour&rsquo;s drive from Red Square are still a dream. The fantasy starts with the idea that it takes half an hour to drive there through Moscow&rsquo;s notoriously heavy traffic; on a weekday it takes a few hours. When you reach there you are greeted with signs saying &ldquo;Skolkovo - we are making the future today&rdquo;, but beyond the perimeter fence lies a couple of cranes and an excavator digging the foundations of this future fantasy. Several hundred metres away stands the only finished building, called Hypercube; it is supposed to be an example of the eco-friendly principles intended for Skolkovo. Looking at the building from the dusty and polluted highway, however, makes you wonder just how green the enterprise will truly be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years after its announcement by President Medvedev, Skolkovo still raises more questions than answers. Getting Skolkovo off the ground has not been cheap, with billions of oil dollars spent, and yet more to be allocated. There are doubts that the Russian government &ndash; now headed by Vladimir Putin &ndash; has the conviction to keep going. The investments are impressive though. The road to be built to Skolkovo and around the area is said to cost $2 billion. However, the biggest questions facing start-ups that have, or want to, set up shop there is where they are going to work and live. The whole site is supposed to be finished by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One source close to Skolkovo said that the project is modeled on tech centres such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.sophia-antipolis.org/\"&gt;Sophia Antipolis&lt;/a&gt; in France, &lt;a href=\"http://www.cyberjaya-msc.com/\"&gt;Cyberjaya&lt;/a&gt; in Malaysia or &lt;a href=\"http://www.masdar.ae/en/\"&gt;Masdar&lt;/a&gt; in UAE. While the start-ups wait for the so needed infrastructure to be finished in 2015-16, they are being sent to other scientific centres to carry on their projects. Skolkovo&rsquo;s vice-president for external communications and advertising, Alexander Chernov, has tried to assure the press everything is fine and will be finished soon. &ldquo;It is a usual trend with construction business in Russia. Two years shift is not that bad but we will welcome our residents in 2015. If not, we will look like losers.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has a long history of scientific and technological breakthroughs, but it is suffering from a hangover from recent decades. The Cold War and the Iron Curtain played a key role in maintaining a competitive and innovative spirit in closed science cities of the Soviet Union, such as &lt;a href=\"http://novosibirskguide.com/Akademgorodok/\"&gt;Akademgorodok&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after the Cold War, everything changed. The new Russia found itself with the remnants of the once powerful Soviet scientific machine and a huge brain drain in the direction of the US. Innovative ideas started to matter very little in a new capitalist society focused on selling Russia&rsquo;s vast natural resources and cashing in US dollars. It took two decades for a project like Skolkovo to emerge from the Kremlin&rsquo;s corridors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what will Skolkovo concentrate on? There are five core areas: information technology, nuclear technology, energy efficiency, biomedical innovation, and space and telecommunications. Companies receiving resident status can work on their projects and attempt to bring them to market. Skolkovo&rsquo;s grants and construction are mostly backed up by the money from the Russian government. The investment is supposed to reach over $15bn (&pound;10bn) by 2020. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of years, Skolkovo has received over 10,000 online applications. Applicants range from companies and startup groups to scientific centres, universities, student groups and distinguished scientists. Most applicants fail to become residents. &ldquo;The main challenge here is either a project doesn&rsquo;t fit into the five clusters or it hasn&rsquo;t been worked through. Sometimes companies overestimate their abilities or their idea has already been developed in the market,&rdquo; says Chernov.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, more than 900 Skolkovo residents or startup companies are working on projects across the five clusters. Many of them have already received grants from the Skolkovo Fund said to expect to be worth $2bn (&pound;1.28bn) by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the grant recipients is &lt;a href=\"http://www.fruct.org/\"&gt;Fruct&lt;/a&gt; founded by Russian and Finnish universities together with Nokia. Although they won the money last year, they should receive the $300,000 (&pound;191,000) grant this autumn to develop a mobile device which monitors eight key diagnostic markers such as cardiovascular, pulmonology and endocrinologic readings, to help monitor potential health problems such as arterial hypertension arrhythmia, asthma, and &nbsp;diabetes.. Asked about how they will spend the money, the head of Fruct, Sergey Balandin, says: &ldquo;The challenge was to make investors believe in our project. We will put more emphasis on the research now. We will try to improve the weak sides of our project with the help of Skolkovo Fund&rsquo;s specialists and prepare the product to enter the market.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hopefuls have not been so lucky. &lt;a href=\"http://www.bravomotors.ru/\"&gt;Bravo Motors&lt;/a&gt; applied for the grant to finance its project for an ultra-light electric vehicle called the e-Trike. The main challenge for Bravo now is to find $1.4 m (&pound;890,000) in investment to complete the development of the e-Trike, carry out bench and field testing, and start production. But to get tax incentives, the company had to change the e-Trike&rsquo;s colour from red to green &ndash; the same colour used on Skolkovo&rsquo;s logo. Being part of Skolkovo may mean compromises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distrustful politicians &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skolkovo has not been without rumours of corruption, either. Medvedev tried to avoid corruption by appointing Russian oligarch Victor Vekselberg as the President of Skolkovo. But 2013 started with several cases. &lt;a href=\"http://www.skoltech.ru/\"&gt;Skoltech University&lt;/a&gt; is being created to educate in-house innovators of tomorrow. MIT is heavily involved with the project, helping Skoltech with the structure, educational and research programs. The university hasn&rsquo;t been built yet &ndash; but already it has created a corruption scandal. The state audit office found out recently that millions of dollars allocated to Skolkovo&rsquo;s Skoltech, went, instead, to finance programs and grants at MIT. The government tried to bury the story, but &lt;a href=\"http://izvestia.ru/news/548178\"&gt;Russian newspaper Izvestia&lt;/a&gt; got hold of the case documents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there is the political situation to contend with. Even Skolkovo&rsquo;s biggest cheerleaders understand start-ups like the e-Trike won&rsquo;t be able to make a return on the multi-billion-dollar investments poured into the project. Russian politicians, in general, are distrustful of innovations they don&rsquo;t understand such as a recent discussion at Skolkovo on the creation perpetuum mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source close to Skolkovo who wished to remain anonymous, says: &nbsp;&ldquo;The success of Skolkovo should be assessed on the basis of whether it manages to create a huge and successful business like Yandex [Russia&rsquo;s biggest search engine] and Mail.ru [Russian email].&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for Skolkovo is to prove it can make money, rather than just spend it. It has been created from the very top of the political spectrum - with huge investments &ndash; but the buildings remain unconstructed, and the ideas that could make it profitable remain untapped.&nbsp; The question is, will this always be the case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"559a5a69157e584f77e17491"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-28T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Skolkovo: Tech city that aims to restore nation's pride","HeadlineShort":"Russia: Restoring its tech pride?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In the Soviet era, Russian science was lavished with money and resources.

Excel, I ask you! It beggars belief. But managers here like the old ways.&rdquo; When changes were suggested he was stonewalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venting his irritation on Twitter led him to a conversation about the business practices afflicting Japan&rsquo;s tech sector with a fellow malcontent. One face-to-face meeting later, he quit his job to form a company with his new comrade rebel with and created the website &lt;a href=\"http://www.paradiseware.net\"&gt;Paradiseware&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"https://app.mmth.tw/?lang=en\"&gt;helps businesses manage projects more efficiently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is typically Japanese; run on a shoestring without any of the benefits Silicon Valley start-ups might attract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has a real problem with innovation. It&rsquo;s just not very Japanese. Nor, you might be surprised to read, is originality. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing swaggering foreigners or suspect loners are thought to meddle in. So if you visit Japan and find ersatz statues of Liberty in tourist spots, or a very &lt;a href=\"http://www.cooljapan.org/\"&gt;uncool bureaucratic drive&lt;/a&gt; to promote Japanese creativity and culture ripped off from Cool Britannia - you&rsquo;ll begin to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan is \"good at technology but poor in business\" as one official puts it. &ldquo;Its high levels of basic research and superior technology are hampered by too-strict regulations, and vertically integrated administration. The gap between researchers and manufacturers, in many cases, prevents brilliant R&amp;D results from being put into practical use - the &lsquo;Death Valley&rsquo; problem.&rdquo; Japan leads in its high number of early adopters. Thanks to them, inventors can gain confidence and the initial momentum needed to push off a new idea. But it often doesn&rsquo;t last long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Unfortunately this is accompanied by a very envious, critical and vocal audience. They underline every possible reason that the product will fail and keep doing so indefatigably. They attack the innovator on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc; and they keep doing so until the innovator raises a white flag.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to this 20 year&rsquo;s economic stagnation, zero appetite for risk and eroded confidence and Japan emerges as one the toughest environments on Earth to root new ideas.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggling start-ups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are backers in Japan, his partner Shuku Tanizaki explains, but most are interested only in no-risk ventures. Start-ups have to attract crowd-funding or, as is more usual, the personal savings of their creators. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of venture capitalists here but they are only interested in games and new media,&rdquo; says Hashimoto. Even renting conventional office space can be troublesome in Japan - landlords like to see two years&rsquo; profits before they open the door. Paradiseware operates out of cheap, shared office space in central Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think starting a new business means also confronting the problems afflicting your society,&rdquo; says Mr Hashimoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being perceived as a big-hitting innovator, Japan has a tiny, struggling start-up landscape that has yet to make an impact abroad. &ldquo;This is because this sector is the most under-supported in Japan,&rdquo; says Terrie Lloyd, an Australian entrepreneur and commentator based in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the global digital economy grows in importance, this puts Japan, the world&rsquo;s third-biggest economy and one-time electronics giant, at a massive disadvantage. America and even tiny South Korea continue to come up with the gadgets and smartphone-based services that consumers want. Japan&rsquo;s sluggish megacorporations such as Sony are unable to match the swift-footed foreign competition and fall further and further behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strangles originality here, explains Tokyo-based technology consultant Nobuyuki Hayashi, is that Japanese innovation keeps to very rigid structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Most of them went to the same university, studied the same subjects and never met people from outside the group. This is because of the Japanese educational system and how Japanese recruiting is done,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Japanese companies tend to hire graduates from the same school.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spectacular failure to respond to the internet age is slowly being challenged, however, both by the country&rsquo;s new government and a few entrepreneurs. Copying ideas from Silicon Valley, top entrepreneurs and officials have tried for over a decade now to spark some life into Japan&rsquo;s hi-tech sector by increasing incubation projects and the like. Japan now has over 400 business incubators up from 30 in 1999 some of which are focused on the hi-tech sector. Most offer funding, work space and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after being held back by the entropy of their elders for so long, Japan&rsquo;s enterprising young are going it alone. An experienced user interface designer in Japan and abroad, 26-year-old Alexander Takahashi simply rents shared office space, and networks for Angel investors when he can, to develop a location-based service named &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rooftops/id552140477?mt=8\"&gt;Rooftops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understands the reservations. &ldquo;Japanese businessmen tend not to trust the younger generation. No matter how well you present yourself - young equals bad,&rdquo; says Takahashi.&nbsp; &ldquo;And honestly I can understand them. There are no really new start-ups with new ideas nowadays.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese young entrepreneurs are enthusiastic but lack crucial business know-how, says Lloyd. &ldquo;They are totally unprepared for the business world, and this is why cloistered accelerators and incubators are so popular here,&rdquo; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitoshi Masuda, who until recently headed up the government&rsquo;s small-business think tank, disagrees. He says: &ldquo;Japan is changing profoundly but dynamically in terms of who drives innovation and how innovation is being driven.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic reforms under a new government - Abenomics, named for the PM Shinzo Abe - are having some positive effects. His party has also promised to fight the corner of all innovators, risk takers and creative types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model is a bunch of maverick, by Japanese standards, entrepreneurs which include Japan&rsquo;s third-richest man, Masayoshi Son, born to a Korean immigrant family, whose mobile phone empire Softbank is funding a brave attempt at commercialising home-grown green tech innovations. His outsider outlook was a huge benefit, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If you look at successful Japanese start-ups, they are mostly run by CEOs who have applied the &lsquo;foreign connection&rsquo; in some way - be it education, money, technology, business deals, or talent,&rdquo; says Lloyd. &ldquo;In some cases, like Mr Son, he has managed to combine all five factors.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those factors seem to have inoculated such champions against fear of failure making them bold at the same time. They represent a new way of being Japanese &ndash; one the nation urgently needs to get to grips with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can Japan reboot its anti-innovation start-up culture?","HeadlineShort":"Can Japan plug its start-up gap?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Japan has long been hailed as one of the worlds most developed nations.

That was certainly the vibe at &lt;a href=\"http://toaberlin.com/\"&gt;Tech Open Air Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, a gathering held earlier this month in a ramshackle complex of wooden and stone buildings in Kreuzberg, a trendy part of the city. There was soft acoustic music and falafel, and a lot of beautiful people exuding a studied coolness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see a lot of amazing stuff coming out of Berlin,&rdquo; says Tikhon Bernstam, who came over from Silicon Valley to attend the event. &ldquo;This sort of culture that you see here, the hippy music, we had exactly the same thing in San Francisco a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve been impressed by the quality of the companies I&rsquo;ve been seeing here.&rdquo; Bernstam&rsquo;s cloud data service he co-founded, Parse, was recently bought by Facebook for $85 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Berlin is many leagues behind Silicon Valley. From Adobe through to Yahoo, via Apple, Intel, Google and Oracle, the Valley, as its occupants call it, has a combined wealth which most countries would envy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact figures are hard to come by, but Berlin came ninth in &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/06/new-global-start-cities/5144/\"&gt;a recent global ranking&lt;/a&gt; of cities with the most tech start-ups founded since 2002 that are global, or received angel funding or institutional venture capital. The top three spots were occupied by San Francisco-Silicon Valley with 201 start-ups, New York (144) and London (90). Berlin had 27, just ahead of Bangalore on 26 and Sao Paulo on 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with its reputation for doing things differently, very cheap rents, and the ambition and optimism on show at events like Tech Open Air Berlin, the hope is that its scene will deliver on the buzz that has surrounded it for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city itself is in many ways a start up. From 1945 it was shattered and split for almost half a century. The eastern, Soviet-controlled zone was hardly a seed-bed for innovation. Industry moved out from the West. Students were exempted from military service, attracting a young, artistic and politically radical alternative scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of the Wall in 1989, the city has been re-inventing itself. The vibrant alternative culture remains in place, and some see it as providing fertile ground for the creation of disruptive technologies &ndash; though others argue that a counterculture-led antipathy to money-making may hamper innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear is that property is cheap &ndash; Berlin still has rents which are so low that they make visitors from London and New York gasp. The average annual cost of a workstation in an office in Berlin, including maintenance costs, taxes and rent, was $8,410 at the end of last year, compared with $14,050 for New York and $14,620 in the City of London, according to &lt;a href=\"http://dtz.b15media.com/downloads/DTZ_Occupier_Perspective_Global_Occupancy_Costs_Offices_2013.pdf\"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published by the global property company DTZ. Renting a 120 square metre apartment in Berlin costs around a third what it does in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination has attracted many who aspire to be the next big thing in tech. In a few cases they have already succeeded, such as the social game developer &lt;a href=\"http://www.wooga.com/\"&gt;Wooga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/\"&gt;Research Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a networking website for scientists. The darling of the scene is &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/\"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, an audio sharing platform that has 200 million users every month. Alex Ljung, its co-founder and chief executive, moved the company from Stockholm to Berlin because he felt it offered a richer mix of people involved in music, and because of the ample and cheap office space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ljung admits his firm&rsquo;s new hometown doesn&rsquo;t cover all bases. &ldquo;With start-up life, there&rsquo;s never really much calmness. It&rsquo;s all jet and no lag,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In an average month, I spend about a week-and-a-half in Berlin, about a week in San Francisco and the rest of the time split between Los Angeles, New York and London.&rdquo; What Berlin lacks that San Francisco has is the sheer volume of people who&rsquo;ve grown tech companies, where Ljung says he can bump into others who have trodden the same path, and who can advise him on short-cuts and pitfalls. In New York, London and Los Angeles, he can meet plenty of people with money to invest in good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bernstam, investors from the US are scared to invest in Germany because they don&rsquo;t understand the way companies are structured and corporate regulations. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand what could happen if future investors tried to dilute us,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and investors from the States don&rsquo;t understand yet how that works abroad &ndash; and are frankly scared of investing abroad.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which created a chicken-and-egg problem in Berlin. Some entrepreneurs have stayed away because of the lack of investors, and those with the money have preferred to go elsewhere because of the greater number of companies to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this resistance is beginning breaking down, on both sides, according to David Knight, editor-in-chief of Berlin tech scene blog &lt;a href=\"http://siliconallee.com/\"&gt;Silicon Allee&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been this streak of creativity and once you got a core of people, which started round 2009, you started to get a lot of investors from the US and Europe looking to Berlin. It&rsquo;s still at a very early stage, but there&rsquo;s a lot more money now than there was two years ago.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Districts such as Kreuzberg, Neukoelln and Prenzlauer Berg, where would-be entrepreneurs congregate in the bars and cafes offering wi-fi, are now seeing the effect of this. In Prenzlauer Berg, &lt;a href=\"http://www.factoryberlin.com/\"&gt;Factory&lt;/a&gt;, which received &euro;1 million in funding from Google, has rented space to over 15 companies, including SoundCloud. The city also now has a lot more of what might be called serious business people. Florian Lanzer is trying to build a website selling green products to people who are not necessarily committed environmentalists. He said the project has attracted a lot of interest, including the involvement of a former CEO of Sony Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What Berlin gets right is that it attracts the right kind of people,&rdquo; says Lanzer. &ldquo;Young people with talent and people with long track records and massive experience are coming together.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a decade ago, Berlin was famously described as being &ldquo;poor, but sexy&rdquo; by its mayor, Klaus Wowereit. The hope is that creativity and commerce is now beginning to combine in tech in such a way that it might finally shed its poor tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Berlin start-ups: Cool and commerce coming together?","HeadlineShort":"Berlin: Can cool and capital mix?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In a new series Innovation Cultures takes an on-the-ground look at tech scenes around the world that hope in some way to emulate the successes of Silicon Valley.

The melon-sized plaything consists of a tactile lattice of brightly painted beads, connected by wooden rods and elastic cords. It twists and flexes as Vytas Sunspiral and Adrian Agogino crunch it in their hands and throw it between themselves across the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One online review describes the gadget as &ldquo;great for sensory exploration,&rdquo; but Sunspiral and Agogino are considering it for something way more ambitious: planetary exploration. This bundle of beads, rods and cords, they believe, could form the basis of a new generation of planetary rovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The programme that funded this bit of research, I call it the crazy ideas programme,&rdquo; exclaims the fast-talking Sunspiral, a towering figure whose name, long blonde hair, beard and glasses suggest a &ldquo;crazy ideas&rdquo; lab in Silicon Valley is his natural environment. For obvious reasons, Nasa prefers not to use the word &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; in its research but includes the project under its &lt;a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/stp/niac/index.html\"&gt;Innovative Advanced Concepts Program&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;Here, in the intelligent robotics group,&rdquo; says Sunspiral, &ldquo;we do all sorts of advanced research on robots.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toy Sunspiral and Agogino are playing with uses what is technically known as a tensegrity system. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a system where, unlike our buildings where everything&rsquo;s held together rigidly, everything&rsquo;s held together in tension,&rdquo; Sunspiral explains. &ldquo;So you end up with a network of cables that hold rods. You will often have seen artwork that looks like this &ndash; kind of crazy weird bars, floating in space.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The components are very simple,&rdquo; adds Agogino, twisting the toy in his hands as he speaks. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just rods and cables connected together, and rods never connect to rods and cables never connect to cables. A child can hit themselves over the head with it and they won&rsquo;t get hurt. That happens to be great for what we want.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prove the point, Vytas encourages me to throw the toy on the floor. Hard. It slams into the floor, squashes together a bit and bounces. &ldquo;Think of what&rsquo;s happening when it bounces,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s absorbing energy when it&rsquo;s going down and it&rsquo;s releasing energy when it&rsquo;s going up. It doesn&rsquo;t break because the energy is distributed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Garage games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can imagine that dropping one of these on the surface of an alien world would certainly be a lot easier than landing the existing types of robotic rovers with all their precision engineered wheels, motors and instruments. Past missions, such as &lt;a href=\"http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html\"&gt;the Spirit and Opportunity rovers&lt;/a&gt;, used airbags to cushion their landings. Because of its hefty size, Nasa&rsquo;s Curiosity had to be lowered on cables &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120719-how-to-land-on-mars\"&gt;using its elaborate sky-crane system&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;Drop one of those rovers 30 feet,&rdquo; says Agogino, &ldquo;do you think it&rsquo;s going to be very happy about it?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But existing planetary rovers are shaped the way they are for a reason: they need wheels to move around, bodies to hold equipment and arms to deploy instruments or cameras. So how do you do that with a glorified bundle of beads, rods and elastic? &ldquo;We get a lot of our inspiration from biological systems,&rdquo; says Sunspiral, who suggests a mechanism that mimics how our own muscles expand and contract could offer one solution. &ldquo;You could shorten and lengthen the cables to cause the whole thing to roll and move around.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instruments would be suspended within the centre of the structure to protect them from damage &ndash; cushioned from the impact of landing and locomotion. But they would have to be very different to the sort of boxy equipment carried by existing rovers, capable of being tumbled around and with any arms or probes, safely tucked away. There could even be several of these rovers, tumbling across an alien world and communicating with each other like a swarm of bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rover Sunspiral and Agogino are currently putting their minds to is Super Ball Bot, which they are developing as a concept mission to explore Saturn&rsquo;s moon Titan. With its petrochemical atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes, Titan is a fascinating destination and one of the potential candidates in the Solar System for primitive life. The &lt;a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=45751\"&gt;European Space Agency&rsquo;s Huygens probe&lt;/a&gt; parachuted down onto Titan&rsquo;s surface in 2005 but the cookie-shaped spacecraft had no ability to move around and only managed to return data for around 90 minutes in the hostile environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something like Super Ball Bot would be ideal to survive a descent through the thick atmosphere and cope with movement on the moon&rsquo;s surface &ndash; which includes solid ground, slush and sea. &ldquo;Titan is one of the most interesting moons,&rdquo; says Agogino. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see the surface [from space] and the atmosphere is full of clouds. We really need something robust, or five or six things that are robust, to get the science done.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So will any of this actually happen or is it just another &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; insists Sunspiral. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been around the robotics industry long enough to know that you just have to throw yourself at a vision and make progress and be successful and anything&rsquo;s possible. It&rsquo;s just like Silicon Valley and all the start-ups here. You&rsquo;ve got to start with a couple of kids in a garage and eventually you have your Google.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, I suggest, they are both like those kids in the garage? &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; says Agogino as they go back to playing with their toy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:14:07Z","HeadlineLong":"Nasas crazy robot lab","HeadlineShort":"Nasas crazy robot lab","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Inside a laboratory in California, space engineers are designing a new generation of rover... and they look like nothing you have seen before.

start-up entrepreneur Masayoshi Hashimoto believes he knows where the country&rsquo;s IT industry is getting its guidance from; the Czech surrealist author and satirist Franz Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Working for a Japanese web services firm, I couldn&rsquo;t believe how badly things were done,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We had everyone managing projects using Excel. Excel, I ask you! It beggars belief. But managers here like the old ways.&rdquo; When changes were suggested he was stonewalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venting his irritation on Twitter led him to a conversation about the business practices afflicting Japan&rsquo;s tech sector with a fellow malcontent. One face-to-face meeting later, he quit his job to form a company with his new comrade rebel with and created the website &lt;a href=\"http://www.paradiseware.net\"&gt;Paradiseware&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href=\"https://app.mmth.tw/?lang=en\"&gt;helps businesses manage projects more efficiently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is typically Japanese; run on a shoestring without any of the benefits Silicon Valley start-ups might attract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has a real problem with innovation. It&rsquo;s just not very Japanese. Nor, you might be surprised to read, is originality. It&rsquo;s the kind of thing swaggering foreigners or suspect loners are thought to meddle in. So if you visit Japan and find ersatz statues of Liberty in tourist spots, or a very &lt;a href=\"http://www.cooljapan.org/\"&gt;uncool bureaucratic drive&lt;/a&gt; to promote Japanese creativity and culture ripped off from Cool Britannia - you&rsquo;ll begin to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan is \"good at technology but poor in business\" as one official puts it. &ldquo;Its high levels of basic research and superior technology are hampered by too-strict regulations, and vertically integrated administration. The gap between researchers and manufacturers, in many cases, prevents brilliant R&amp;D results from being put into practical use - the &lsquo;Death Valley&rsquo; problem.&rdquo; Japan leads in its high number of early adopters. Thanks to them, inventors can gain confidence and the initial momentum needed to push off a new idea. But it often doesn&rsquo;t last long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Unfortunately this is accompanied by a very envious, critical and vocal audience. They underline every possible reason that the product will fail and keep doing so indefatigably. They attack the innovator on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc; and they keep doing so until the innovator raises a white flag.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add to this 20 year&rsquo;s economic stagnation, zero appetite for risk and eroded confidence and Japan emerges as one the toughest environments on Earth to root new ideas.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggling start-ups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are backers in Japan, his partner Shuku Tanizaki explains, but most are interested only in no-risk ventures. Start-ups have to attract crowd-funding or, as is more usual, the personal savings of their creators. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of venture capitalists here but they are only interested in games and new media,&rdquo; says Hashimoto. Even renting conventional office space can be troublesome in Japan - landlords like to see two years&rsquo; profits before they open the door. Paradiseware operates out of cheap, shared office space in central Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think starting a new business means also confronting the problems afflicting your society,&rdquo; says Mr Hashimoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being perceived as a big-hitting innovator, Japan has a tiny, struggling start-up landscape that has yet to make an impact abroad. &ldquo;This is because this sector is the most under-supported in Japan,&rdquo; says Terrie Lloyd, an Australian entrepreneur and commentator based in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the global digital economy grows in importance, this puts Japan, the world&rsquo;s third-biggest economy and one-time electronics giant, at a massive disadvantage. America and even tiny South Korea continue to come up with the gadgets and smartphone-based services that consumers want. Japan&rsquo;s sluggish megacorporations such as Sony are unable to match the swift-footed foreign competition and fall further and further behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strangles originality here, explains Tokyo-based technology consultant Nobuyuki Hayashi, is that Japanese innovation keeps to very rigid structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Most of them went to the same university, studied the same subjects and never met people from outside the group. This is because of the Japanese educational system and how Japanese recruiting is done,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Japanese companies tend to hire graduates from the same school.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spectacular failure to respond to the internet age is slowly being challenged, however, both by the country&rsquo;s new government and a few entrepreneurs. Copying ideas from Silicon Valley, top entrepreneurs and officials have tried for over a decade now to spark some life into Japan&rsquo;s hi-tech sector by increasing incubation projects and the like. Japan now has over 400 business incubators up from 30 in 1999 some of which are focused on the hi-tech sector. Most offer funding, work space and mentoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after being held back by the entropy of their elders for so long, Japan&rsquo;s enterprising young are going it alone. An experienced user interface designer in Japan and abroad, 26-year-old Alexander Takahashi simply rents shared office space, and networks for Angel investors when he can, to develop a location-based service named &lt;a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rooftops/id552140477?mt=8\"&gt;Rooftops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He understands the reservations. &ldquo;Japanese businessmen tend not to trust the younger generation. No matter how well you present yourself - young equals bad,&rdquo; says Takahashi.&nbsp; &ldquo;And honestly I can understand them. There are no really new start-ups with new ideas nowadays.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese young entrepreneurs are enthusiastic but lack crucial business know-how, says Lloyd. &ldquo;They are totally unprepared for the business world, and this is why cloistered accelerators and incubators are so popular here,&rdquo; he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitoshi Masuda, who until recently headed up the government&rsquo;s small-business think tank, disagrees. He says: &ldquo;Japan is changing profoundly but dynamically in terms of who drives innovation and how innovation is being driven.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic reforms under a new government - Abenomics, named for the PM Shinzo Abe - are having some positive effects. His party has also promised to fight the corner of all innovators, risk takers and creative types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model is a bunch of maverick, by Japanese standards, entrepreneurs which include Japan&rsquo;s third-richest man, Masayoshi Son, born to a Korean immigrant family, whose mobile phone empire Softbank is funding a brave attempt at commercialising home-grown green tech innovations. His outsider outlook was a huge benefit, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If you look at successful Japanese start-ups, they are mostly run by CEOs who have applied the &lsquo;foreign connection&rsquo; in some way - be it education, money, technology, business deals, or talent,&rdquo; says Lloyd. &ldquo;In some cases, like Mr Son, he has managed to combine all five factors.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those factors seem to have inoculated such champions against fear of failure making them bold at the same time. They represent a new way of being Japanese &ndash; one the nation urgently needs to get to grips with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"559a5a69157e584f77e17491"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can Japan reboot its anti-innovation start-up culture?","HeadlineShort":"Can Japan plug its start-up gap?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Japan has long been hailed as one of the worlds most developed nations.

That set a pattern, and soon there was &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3249891.stm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Glen&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland, Kenya&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21173158\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Savannah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.silicongulf.net/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Gulf&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines, &lt;a href=\"http://www.academpark.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Taiga&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia &ndash; even the somewhat less romantic-sounding &lt;a href=\"http://www.siliconroundabout.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Roundabout&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there is Silicon Allee in Berlin (Allee, meaning alley or avenue in German, is part of many street names in the city), which to some observers evokes the atmosphere of the early days in Northern California. That was certainly the vibe at &lt;a href=\"http://toaberlin.com/\"&gt;Tech Open Air Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, a gathering held earlier this month in a ramshackle complex of wooden and stone buildings in Kreuzberg, a trendy part of the city. There was soft acoustic music and falafel, and a lot of beautiful people exuding a studied coolness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see a lot of amazing stuff coming out of Berlin,&rdquo; says Tikhon Bernstam, who came over from Silicon Valley to attend the event. &ldquo;This sort of culture that you see here, the hippy music, we had exactly the same thing in San Francisco a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve been impressed by the quality of the companies I&rsquo;ve been seeing here.&rdquo; Bernstam&rsquo;s cloud data service he co-founded, Parse, was recently bought by Facebook for $85 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Berlin is many leagues behind Silicon Valley. From Adobe through to Yahoo, via Apple, Intel, Google and Oracle, the Valley, as its occupants call it, has a combined wealth which most countries would envy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact figures are hard to come by, but Berlin came ninth in &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/06/new-global-start-cities/5144/\"&gt;a recent global ranking&lt;/a&gt; of cities with the most tech start-ups founded since 2002 that are global, or received angel funding or institutional venture capital. The top three spots were occupied by San Francisco-Silicon Valley with 201 start-ups, New York (144) and London (90). Berlin had 27, just ahead of Bangalore on 26 and Sao Paulo on 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with its reputation for doing things differently, very cheap rents, and the ambition and optimism on show at events like Tech Open Air Berlin, the hope is that its scene will deliver on the buzz that has surrounded it for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city itself is in many ways a start up. From 1945 it was shattered and split for almost half a century. The eastern, Soviet-controlled zone was hardly a seed-bed for innovation. Industry moved out from the West. Students were exempted from military service, attracting a young, artistic and politically radical alternative scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of the Wall in 1989, the city has been re-inventing itself. The vibrant alternative culture remains in place, and some see it as providing fertile ground for the creation of disruptive technologies &ndash; though others argue that a counterculture-led antipathy to money-making may hamper innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear is that property is cheap &ndash; Berlin still has rents which are so low that they make visitors from London and New York gasp. The average annual cost of a workstation in an office in Berlin, including maintenance costs, taxes and rent, was $8,410 at the end of last year, compared with $14,050 for New York and $14,620 in the City of London, according to &lt;a href=\"http://dtz.b15media.com/downloads/DTZ_Occupier_Perspective_Global_Occupancy_Costs_Offices_2013.pdf\"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published by the global property company DTZ. Renting a 120 square metre apartment in Berlin costs around a third what it does in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination has attracted many who aspire to be the next big thing in tech. In a few cases they have already succeeded, such as the social game developer &lt;a href=\"http://www.wooga.com/\"&gt;Wooga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/\"&gt;Research Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a networking website for scientists. The darling of the scene is &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/\"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, an audio sharing platform that has 200 million users every month. Alex Ljung, its co-founder and chief executive, moved the company from Stockholm to Berlin because he felt it offered a richer mix of people involved in music, and because of the ample and cheap office space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ljung admits his firm&rsquo;s new hometown doesn&rsquo;t cover all bases. &ldquo;With start-up life, there&rsquo;s never really much calmness. It&rsquo;s all jet and no lag,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In an average month, I spend about a week-and-a-half in Berlin, about a week in San Francisco and the rest of the time split between Los Angeles, New York and London.&rdquo; What Berlin lacks that San Francisco has is the sheer volume of people who&rsquo;ve grown tech companies, where Ljung says he can bump into others who have trodden the same path, and who can advise him on short-cuts and pitfalls. In New York, London and Los Angeles, he can meet plenty of people with money to invest in good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bernstam, investors from the US are scared to invest in Germany because they don&rsquo;t understand the way companies are structured and corporate regulations. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand what could happen if future investors tried to dilute us,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and investors from the States don&rsquo;t understand yet how that works abroad &ndash; and are frankly scared of investing abroad.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which created a chicken-and-egg problem in Berlin. Some entrepreneurs have stayed away because of the lack of investors, and those with the money have preferred to go elsewhere because of the greater number of companies to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this resistance is beginning breaking down, on both sides, according to David Knight, editor-in-chief of Berlin tech scene blog &lt;a href=\"http://siliconallee.com/\"&gt;Silicon Allee&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been this streak of creativity and once you got a core of people, which started round 2009, you started to get a lot of investors from the US and Europe looking to Berlin. It&rsquo;s still at a very early stage, but there&rsquo;s a lot more money now than there was two years ago.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Districts such as Kreuzberg, Neukoelln and Prenzlauer Berg, where would-be entrepreneurs congregate in the bars and cafes offering wi-fi, are now seeing the effect of this. In Prenzlauer Berg, &lt;a href=\"http://www.factoryberlin.com/\"&gt;Factory&lt;/a&gt;, which received &euro;1 million in funding from Google, has rented space to over 15 companies, including SoundCloud. The city also now has a lot more of what might be called serious business people. Florian Lanzer is trying to build a website selling green products to people who are not necessarily committed environmentalists. He said the project has attracted a lot of interest, including the involvement of a former CEO of Sony Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What Berlin gets right is that it attracts the right kind of people,&rdquo; says Lanzer. &ldquo;Young people with talent and people with long track records and massive experience are coming together.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a decade ago, Berlin was famously described as being &ldquo;poor, but sexy&rdquo; by its mayor, Klaus Wowereit. The hope is that creativity and commerce is now beginning to combine in tech in such a way that it might finally shed its poor tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Berlin start-ups: Cool and commerce coming together?","HeadlineShort":"Berlin: Can cool and capital mix?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In a new series Innovation Cultures takes an on-the-ground look at tech scenes around the world that hope in some way to emulate the successes of Silicon Valley.

They light a small fire by rapidly twisting a hardwood twig into a softwood stick from the local Commiphora tree. It soon smoulders and, intrigued, I have a go too. It's surprisingly difficult, but with their help, I get it to smoke eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've travelled four hours west from the city of Arusha to meet this ancient tribe of hunter-gatherers, and join them in a bow-and-arrow hunt for prey among the thorn bushes. The Hadza people may have nothing &ndash; no animals, land or possessions aside from the clothes on their backs &ndash; but they are rich in the skills and resourcefulness they need to produce everything from their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s not all that sets them apart from most societies. The Hadza are thought to be the most ancient modern humans, the first surviving peoples to have split off from our ancestral family tree, and are not closely related genetically to any other peoples. Their language &ndash; a clicking tongue, also called Hadza &ndash; is unique and unrelated even to other clicking languages. Some linguists believe Hadza may be close to humankind's first ancestral language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dying out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the language may not be around for long. The Hadza bushmen, who live in groups of around 15 people, are believed to have been living in this remote area for at least 10,000 years, but there are now less than 1,000 Hadza left. Fewer than 400 of them continue to live a stone-age lifestyle &ndash; they are among the last hunter-gatherers in a continent of farmers and pastoralists. The numbers will continue to drop, as their land is swallowed up by farmers, government-designated conservation areas and private game reserves. And their sing-song tongue, punctuated with clicks and glottal stops, and which has no words for numbers past four, is no longer being learned by all Hadza children. As the modern world encroaches, the language is in danger of being lost as Hadza make greater use of the widely spoken Swahili tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is at risk is not simply the vocabulary and grammar of this unique language, but the Hadza's &ndash; and by extension, part of humanity's &ndash; cultural heritage and expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hadza are not alone in facing the loss of their native tongue. Every 14 days &lt;a href=\"http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/langhotspots/intro.html\"&gt;a language dies&lt;/a&gt;. Over half of the approximately 7,000 languages spoken on the planet may &lt;a href=\"http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/enduring-voices/\"&gt;disappear by the end of the century&lt;/a&gt;. In the age of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120209-welcome-to-the-age-of-modern-man\"&gt;Anthropocene&lt;/a&gt;, language extinction is happening faster than species extinction. Eighty percent of the endangered languages are African, including Hadza, and the majority have no written form. Once the last speaker dies, so does the language. And for an oral culture, preserving language becomes even more important for maintaining the identity and heritage of a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that with every language you speak you gain a new soul. But 80% of the world's population now speak &lt;a href=\"http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/langhotspots/globaltrends.html\"&gt;just 1.1% of its languages&lt;/a&gt;, and universal languages, like English, dominate the internet, signage and the majority of published texts. So, is the Anthropocene becoming a duller place, in which the rich diversity of humanity's full and wonderful language abilities is reduced to a handful of tongues: English, Mandarin, and a few others? Are we in danger of losing our soul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not if some people have their way. They are fighting back to preserve rarer tongues - in some cases, with great success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlikely saviour&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most successful example is Hebrew, which was dead two centuries ago, before being revived and brought into the 20th century as a living language and the mother tongue of an entire generation of Israelis. Other languages have also been brought back from the brink of extinction through the sheer will and determination of their communities, including Welsh, Cornish, Gaelic and New Zealand Maori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language preservation works best when the language, culture and identity of minority-speaker communities are respected by national governments &ndash; rather than being banned, children are either fully taught in their mother tongue or given dedicated classes in it, in addition to learning the national or regional language. Evidence is mounting for the benefits of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/opinion/sunday/the-benefits-of-bilingualism.html\"&gt;bi- or multi-lingualism&lt;/a&gt;, and for the social and psychological importance of mother-tongue conservation, which allows conversation across multiple generations and strengthens cultural continuity and community identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some places, technology is proving an unlikely saviour. K. David Harrison, a linguist at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania is creating &lt;a href=\"http://www.swarthmore.edu/watch-linguist-k-david-harrison-describes-efforts-to-help-endangered-languages-survive.xml\"&gt;'talking dictionaries&lt;/a&gt;' of endangered languages that help users to preserve the tongues digitally though audio recordings of native speakers and pictures, and has a &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/EnduringVoices\"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for endangered languages. The languages can then be used more easily for text messages over mobile phones, for example. \"In some cases, people have created an orthography [script] for languages that have never been written down, so they can send SMS messages to each other,\" he says. So far, Harrison has created talking dictionaries in eight languages that have never previously been recorded including ones in Papua New Guinea, Siberia and Paraguay, and has six more dictionaries on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of the globalised internet, Harrison says, is that remote villagers with endangered languages can reach a global audience. For example, a hiphop duo from a village in Arunachal Pradesh in northeast India, has garnered more than 9,000 global viewers for their &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7epBWBzjjdY&amp;list=FLmbtQpU9Hd-RtiDmdRbHoUw&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plpp_video\"&gt;YouTube video in the Aka language&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; that's more than ten times the number of Aka speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hadza have now also had their language preserved in a dictionary by Kirk Miller, an American linguist who spent eight months living with them. It might be just in time. When we return from the bush hunt, a couple of the Hadza men try to sell me a bow and arrow, while some of the women string beads to sell to tourists. New cash from these enterprises is funding an unhealthy supply of alcohol that is eroding their culture as surely as the Tanzanian government's previous 'civilising' attempts. As communities cease to function productively, and individuals migrate away, fewer and fewer speakers will bear testimony to a way of life that was once practiced by the ancestors of us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can we save the worlds dying languages?","HeadlineShort":"Can we save our dying languages?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"After witnessing how one of our earliest languages is in danger of disappearing, Gaia Vince looks at efforts to preserve our oral culture.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"After witnessing how one of our earliest languages is in danger of disappearing, Gaia Vince looks at efforts to preserve our oral culture.","SummaryShort":"How technology is coming to the rescue of endangered dialects","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:13:17Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"6c9e9aeb-9e89-4bea-9d81-66feff91d4c0","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120531-can-we-save-our-dying-languages","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:13:17Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120531-can-we-save-our-dying-languages"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120531-can-we-save-our-dying-languages","_id":"559a5de4157e584f77e200f9"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":[],"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"gallery","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;As fibre optic cables continue to lay the foundations for a new era of African innovation, the continent is undergoing a dramatic &ldquo;tech-hub boom&rdquo;.

That set a pattern, and soon there was &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3249891.stm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Glen&lt;/a&gt; in Scotland, Kenya&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21173158\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Savannah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.silicongulf.net/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Gulf&lt;/a&gt; in the Philippines, &lt;a href=\"http://www.academpark.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Taiga&lt;/a&gt; in Siberia &ndash; even the somewhat less romantic-sounding &lt;a href=\"http://www.siliconroundabout.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Silicon Roundabout&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there is Silicon Allee in Berlin (Allee, meaning alley or avenue in German, is part of many street names in the city), which to some observers evokes the atmosphere of the early days in Northern California. That was certainly the vibe at &lt;a href=\"http://toaberlin.com/\"&gt;Tech Open Air Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, a gathering held earlier this month in a ramshackle complex of wooden and stone buildings in Kreuzberg, a trendy part of the city. There was soft acoustic music and falafel, and a lot of beautiful people exuding a studied coolness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see a lot of amazing stuff coming out of Berlin,&rdquo; says Tikhon Bernstam, who came over from Silicon Valley to attend the event. &ldquo;This sort of culture that you see here, the hippy music, we had exactly the same thing in San Francisco a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve been impressed by the quality of the companies I&rsquo;ve been seeing here.&rdquo; Bernstam&rsquo;s cloud data service he co-founded, Parse, was recently bought by Facebook for $85 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Berlin is many leagues behind Silicon Valley. From Adobe through to Yahoo, via Apple, Intel, Google and Oracle, the Valley, as its occupants call it, has a combined wealth which most countries would envy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact figures are hard to come by, but Berlin came ninth in &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/06/new-global-start-cities/5144/\"&gt;a recent global ranking&lt;/a&gt; of cities with the most tech start-ups founded since 2002 that are global, or received angel funding or institutional venture capital. The top three spots were occupied by San Francisco-Silicon Valley with 201 start-ups, New York (144) and London (90). Berlin had 27, just ahead of Bangalore on 26 and Sao Paulo on 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with its reputation for doing things differently, very cheap rents, and the ambition and optimism on show at events like Tech Open Air Berlin, the hope is that its scene will deliver on the buzz that has surrounded it for the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city itself is in many ways a start up. From 1945 it was shattered and split for almost half a century. The eastern, Soviet-controlled zone was hardly a seed-bed for innovation. Industry moved out from the West. Students were exempted from military service, attracting a young, artistic and politically radical alternative scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of the Wall in 1989, the city has been re-inventing itself. The vibrant alternative culture remains in place, and some see it as providing fertile ground for the creation of disruptive technologies &ndash; though others argue that a counterculture-led antipathy to money-making may hamper innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that is clear is that property is cheap &ndash; Berlin still has rents which are so low that they make visitors from London and New York gasp. The average annual cost of a workstation in an office in Berlin, including maintenance costs, taxes and rent, was $8,410 at the end of last year, compared with $14,050 for New York and $14,620 in the City of London, according to &lt;a href=\"http://dtz.b15media.com/downloads/DTZ_Occupier_Perspective_Global_Occupancy_Costs_Offices_2013.pdf\"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published by the global property company DTZ. Renting a 120 square metre apartment in Berlin costs around a third what it does in London and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This combination has attracted many who aspire to be the next big thing in tech. In a few cases they have already succeeded, such as the social game developer &lt;a href=\"http://www.wooga.com/\"&gt;Wooga&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/\"&gt;Research Gate&lt;/a&gt;, a networking website for scientists. The darling of the scene is &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/\"&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, an audio sharing platform that has 200 million users every month. Alex Ljung, its co-founder and chief executive, moved the company from Stockholm to Berlin because he felt it offered a richer mix of people involved in music, and because of the ample and cheap office space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ljung admits his firm&rsquo;s new hometown doesn&rsquo;t cover all bases. &ldquo;With start-up life, there&rsquo;s never really much calmness. It&rsquo;s all jet and no lag,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In an average month, I spend about a week-and-a-half in Berlin, about a week in San Francisco and the rest of the time split between Los Angeles, New York and London.&rdquo; What Berlin lacks that San Francisco has is the sheer volume of people who&rsquo;ve grown tech companies, where Ljung says he can bump into others who have trodden the same path, and who can advise him on short-cuts and pitfalls. In New York, London and Los Angeles, he can meet plenty of people with money to invest in good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bernstam, investors from the US are scared to invest in Germany because they don&rsquo;t understand the way companies are structured and corporate regulations. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand what could happen if future investors tried to dilute us,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and investors from the States don&rsquo;t understand yet how that works abroad &ndash; and are frankly scared of investing abroad.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which created a chicken-and-egg problem in Berlin. Some entrepreneurs have stayed away because of the lack of investors, and those with the money have preferred to go elsewhere because of the greater number of companies to invest in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this resistance is beginning breaking down, on both sides, according to David Knight, editor-in-chief of Berlin tech scene blog &lt;a href=\"http://siliconallee.com/\"&gt;Silicon Allee&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been this streak of creativity and once you got a core of people, which started round 2009, you started to get a lot of investors from the US and Europe looking to Berlin. It&rsquo;s still at a very early stage, but there&rsquo;s a lot more money now than there was two years ago.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Districts such as Kreuzberg, Neukoelln and Prenzlauer Berg, where would-be entrepreneurs congregate in the bars and cafes offering wi-fi, are now seeing the effect of this. In Prenzlauer Berg, &lt;a href=\"http://www.factoryberlin.com/\"&gt;Factory&lt;/a&gt;, which received &euro;1 million in funding from Google, has rented space to over 15 companies, including SoundCloud. The city also now has a lot more of what might be called serious business people. Florian Lanzer is trying to build a website selling green products to people who are not necessarily committed environmentalists. He said the project has attracted a lot of interest, including the involvement of a former CEO of Sony Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What Berlin gets right is that it attracts the right kind of people,&rdquo; says Lanzer. &ldquo;Young people with talent and people with long track records and massive experience are coming together.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a decade ago, Berlin was famously described as being &ldquo;poor, but sexy&rdquo; by its mayor, Klaus Wowereit. The hope is that creativity and commerce is now beginning to combine in tech in such a way that it might finally shed its poor tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"559a5a69157e584f77e17491"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Berlin start-ups: Cool and commerce coming together?","HeadlineShort":"Berlin: Can cool and capital mix?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In a new series Innovation Cultures takes an on-the-ground look at tech scenes around the world that hope in some way to emulate the successes of Silicon Valley.

Like many Greeks these days, he calls the economic crisis his country is going through \"an obsession,\" particularly for people in their mid-30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We have to fight for three generations,\" Stampoulidis tells me. \"We fight for ourselves, and for our kids. We don't want to hand over a country that's collapsing to them. And we also have to fight for our parents, because people on pensions were the first to take the heat when the crisis came.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such stories are part of the fabric of life in Greece these days. Jobs have been axed, wages and pensions slashed, and social safety nets have almost completely broken down. Homelessness and suicides are both on the increase. Young people, particularly those who are educated and talented, seem to be crowding the exits, looking for the next flight out. And despite &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17390450\"&gt;the approval of the latest bailout&lt;/a&gt;, many Greeks feel that the worst is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Stampoulidis and his business partner, Efstratios Kehayas, are bullish on Greece, especially when it comes to the role that technology might play in helping in the country&rsquo;s recovery. The two entrepreneurs, who met while completing their PhDs at Greece's National Technical University in Athens, founded a company called &lt;a href=\"http://www.constelex.eu/\"&gt;Constelex&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constelex makes light amplifiers for fiber-optic networks. Giving the light a boost and extending the range of the network, the co-founders tell me, has applications in telecommunications, remote sensing, aerospace and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Stampoulidis and Kehayas could have taken their knowledge and skills and gone elsewhere to look for work, or start a company. Like many of their friends, they could have left Greece's economic woes, its stifling bureaucracy and corruption, far behind. But they did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For us, it was a no-brainer,\" Kehayas says. \"We wanted to build something in our country, and then offer something back in the form of new jobs, and new products that can be exported.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cluster feed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is music to the ears of Vassilios Makios, Professor Emeritus at the University of Patras, and General Director of &lt;a href=\"http://www.corallia.org/el.html\"&gt;Corallia&lt;/a&gt;, the Hellenic Technology Clusters Initiative. Makios himself left Greece in the 1960s to study electrical engineering in Germany. For years after, he taught at Carleton University in Ottawa before returning to Greece in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His time in North America convinced him that he needed to kick-start technology entrepreneurship in Greece. In the ensuing years, he sent more than 600 Greek students abroad in the hope that they would return to Greece with new ideas about technology and how to do business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He watched new Greek tech companies spring up, only to fail because of funding problems, bad business plans or because they failed to patent their ideas. What these start-ups needed, Makios thought, was a little bit of a push in the right direction, and a whole lot more cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, in 2006, he joined forces with two other Greeks who had worked at the famous &lt;a href=\"http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/belllabs\"&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and asked for some seed money from the Greek government and the European Union to start Corallia. He is now at the forefront of a push to get the Greek government, and budding Greek engineers and technologists, to see the value in clustering, an idea popularized by &lt;a href=\"http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=mporter\"&gt;Michael Porter at Harvard Business School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is pretty straightforward: you put groups of complementary start-ups together in the same building, and they all start feeding off one another to develop new ideas and new products. In 2006, Corallia, with that seed money from the Greek government and the European Union, tried this clustering idea with 13 micro-electronics companies in Greece.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are now more than 60 companies and 30 universities involved in the micro-electronics cluster. Together, they are responsible for more than $260m in exports, according to Makios. The products range from sensor networks and mobile technology to solar energy equipment and micro-chips for studying DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corallia itself is a non-profit. It leases the building, and rents out spaces to start-ups. It provides these small companies with internet connections, teleconferencing facilities and meeting rooms. There are in-house experts who can give companies advice about filing patents, making business plans, and pitching venture capitalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I call it a facilitator for the high-tech sector,\" says Costas Meimitis, CEO of a small start-up called &lt;a href=\"http://www.antcor.com/\"&gt;Antcor&lt;/a&gt;, which licences wi-fi software for the chip industry. Antcor only has 12 employees, and Meimitis says that if they had to deal with IP attorneys, accountants and auditors they wouldn't have to time to work on their technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Corallia's help puts me in the right mind-set,\" he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Death warrant&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is people like Meimitis &ndash; along with help from universities and Corallia -&nbsp; that Makios believes can &ldquo;change Greece&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;\"Yes, Greece is in a difficult situation right now, a real mess, but I'm confident that we can come out of this mess because of these technology prospects,\" he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This cluster,\" Makios emphasizes, \"will create a small, but positive, Silicon Valley in Greece.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the promise of a \"Silicon Valley for Greece\" might be stretching it a bit. Economist and venture capitalist Aristos Doxiadis does, on balance, think that tech can be a viable sector in the new Greek economy, but he says that he doesn't \"see a huge number of jobs being created,\" at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The fundamentals, and by that I mean the people, are here,\" Doxiadis says. \"But the bureaucratic obstacles are still immense.\" Add to that, Doxiadis tells me, that a whole generation of Greeks is still coming to terms with the fact the decades-old system of steady, government jobs with inflated wages and generous pensions is crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There is no free lunch anymore,\" Doxiadis says. \"We have to figure out how to be productive.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that, says Vassilios Makios, is exactly the message he's giving to Greek students coming out of university these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I tell them this:&nbsp; 'If at the age of 25, you want to become a civil servant, they already have a coffin ready for you. You're dead.'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a message that resonated strongly with Constalex's Efstratios Kehayas. \"Personally, I decided that I wanted to build things, that I wanted to mingle with top researchers and entrepreneurs. I wanted the rush. If you put me in an office, and made me do the same thing over and over for 25 years, that would kill me.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constelex got its first sales, and its first patent, last year and the company is now working on a way to modify its technology to better treat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Corallia, it has started two new clusters, one for start-ups working on technologies related to space, and the other in gaming. There is no reason, Vassilios Makios says, that the same idea can't apply to other industries such as bio-engineering, or even to Greek wine-makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We can brand it all 'made in Greece,'\" he says, beaming. \"And make it a standard around the world.\"&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:15:29Z","HeadlineLong":"Greek geeks seek hi-tech recovery","HeadlineShort":"Greek geeks seek hi-tech recovery","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A band of entrepreneurs believe technology could play an important role in helping the country out of its financial woes.\n","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"A band of entrepreneurs believe technology could play an important role in helping the country out of its financial woes.","SummaryShort":"Could technology help the country out of its financial woes?","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:29Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"27c42228-fe27-45a5-a479-2cffa9075458","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120321-greek-geeks-seek-hi-tech-recovery","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:29Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120321-greek-geeks-seek-hi-tech-recovery"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120321-greek-geeks-seek-hi-tech-recovery","_id":"559a5dde157e584f77e20027"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"ib2video","AssetVideoIb2":[],"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":null,"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;David Reid went to see how the city was using technology to help everyone from skaters to start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook page&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also find the Click team on &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCClick\" target=\"_self\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBCCLICK\" target=\"_self\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@BBCClick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:14:56Z","HeadlineLong":"Turning on to technology","HeadlineShort":"Turning on to technology","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The French city of Bordeaux has been trying to turn on those who are normally turned cold by technology. \n","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":[],"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"video","SummaryLong":"BBC Click visits a French city using technology to help everyone from skaters to start-ups.","SummaryShort":"The French city using technology to help everyone from skaters to start-ups","Tag":null},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:56Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"2b8db957-62f3-4c72-98e1-daebcb74a9b0","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120405-turning-on-to-technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:56Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120405-turning-on-to-technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120405-turning-on-to-technology","_id":"559a5ddf157e584f77e2005b"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"&lt;iframe width=\"624\" height=\"351\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/9q37tXUAjDw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"customEmbed","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;One person&rsquo;s insult can become another&rsquo;s badge of pride. In religion, words like Methodist, Mormon and Quaker first appeared as disparaging terms, and were then taken up in defiance by believers. In the politics of gender and sexuality, words like &ldquo;suffragette&rdquo;, &ldquo;queer&rdquo; and &ldquo;dyke&rdquo; have been re-appropriated by those they were coined to abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &ldquo;geek&rdquo; is less ideologically loaded, but it too came from the lowest levels of society. Arriving in English from low German, a &lt;em&gt;geck &lt;/em&gt;originally described a fool or crazy person. The term probably migrated to America via European travelling circuses, where it was used first to refer to gullible punters. By the early 20th Century, the phrase referred to the most outlandish performers and exhibits in carnivals &ndash; and to an outsider even among these outsiders, a \"wild man\" chasing and biting the heads off live chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how this insult escaped carnival culture and became generic is mysterious (although William Gresham&rsquo;s carnival-set 1946 novel &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare_Alley\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and subsequent film, had a lot to do with it). But, by the 1980s, the arrival of geeks as we know them had been cemented in iconic style by the coming-of-age film &lt;em&gt;Sixteen Candles&lt;/em&gt; (1984), courtesy of a character known as &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14472/celebrating-john-hughes-sixteen-candles\"&gt;The Geek&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; whose brainy awkwardness set the mould for an era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geeks &ndash; like their cousins in etymological oddity, &lt;a href=\"http://etymonline.com/?term=nerd\"&gt;nerds&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; were the pitiable extremes of an era in which only terminally under-confident males were obsessed with computers. Yet, as the realm of computing bred its first generation of millionaires and then billionaires, the unthinkable has happened: geeks have become not only acceptable, but even &lt;a href=\"http://sogeekchic.com/\"&gt;chic&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; to the extent that YouTube is hosting its first &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/YouTube\"&gt;Geek Week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will admit to geekish tendencies, but the screens on every desk and in every pocket say differently: love or loathe the word, almost all of us have some element of geekery in our lives. Indeed, given that almost every conceivable obsession now has a presence online, &ldquo;geek&rdquo; is as much a label of enthusiasm as of expertise. You might be a &lt;a href=\"http://coffeegeek.com/\"&gt;coffee geek&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/\"&gt;board games geek&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/shop/geek+retro+t-shirts\"&gt;retro-geek fashionista&lt;/a&gt;. Or you might get your geek on for &lt;a href=\"http://www.denofgeek.com/tags/doctor-who\"&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;, following liveblogs and hashtags covering the announcement of Peter Capaldi as being the 12th doctor, or creating a whole new genre of music, &lt;a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Trock\"&gt;Trock&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to the Gallifreyan time lord &ndash; and in the process earning its originator Alex Day the opportunity to visit the real Tardis (video above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you&rsquo;re into, it seems that courtesy of modern technology you&rsquo;ll never be alone for long. Like-minded others are only a click or a search-term away. And so too are whole realms of sharing, comparison, collaboration, one-upmanship, status anxiety, and the sheer timewasting gloriousness of typing &ldquo;check this out!&rdquo; next to a YouTube link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Geekocratic moment&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, such enthusiasm &ndash; even over seemingly trivial issues &ndash; is a road towards cultural participation and creation, and perhaps other forms of engagement as well. The screen is a lot more forgiving than face-to-face first encounters, and shared enthusiasm can be a powerful binding force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, at the same time there are good reasons to be &ldquo;lovingly suspicious of geek culture&rdquo;, as the author China Mieville put it when I &lt;a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2012/05/31/an-interview-with-china-mievil.html\"&gt;interviewed him last year&lt;/a&gt; about the business of writing cult fiction in the 21st Century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wikipedia, articles about &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_wars\"&gt;Star Wars&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trek\"&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt; are often better referenced, longer and more passionately debated than those that are more important by almost any sense of worldly value, such as events during the Second World War, the lives of major historical figures, or even religions (and that&rsquo;s before you start &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_YouTube_celebrities\"&gt;listing YouTube celebrities&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ours is, as Mieville notes, a &ldquo;geekocratic moment&rdquo;. Shared passions and ideas have a curious force of their own online, and even those who adore this will admit that this can lead to warped priorities &ndash; from staggeringly brutal &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet)\"&gt;flame wars&lt;/a&gt; to trolling and &lt;a href=\"http://www.thisview.org/?p=127\"&gt;deeply engrained sexism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there&rsquo;s the triumph of the geeks themselves: not only the new hordes of enthusiasts, but the &lt;a href=\"http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AlphaGeek.html\"&gt;alpha geeks&lt;/a&gt; whose creations drive much of our online world. From Facebook&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg to Google&rsquo;s Larry Page and Sergey Brin (not to mention the late Steve Jobs, perhaps the closest thing to a &lt;a href=\"http://www.saintstevejobs.com/\"&gt;patron saint&lt;/a&gt; the cult of geek has so far enshrined), technocrats are shaping the texture of our lives as never before. And this brings its own species of hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ours is an age of big data, and even bigger surveillance &ndash; of unprecedented information freedom matched to the unprecedented dominance of a few global players who own the &ldquo;ecosystems&rdquo; through which this information flows. Each of us is free to indulge our passions and predilections as never before &ndash; yet the channels through which we do this can be perilously narrow, and our perspective on the world correspondingly warped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, this is what can happen &ndash; but it need not be an inexorable fate. Online, you&rsquo;re never alone, and perhaps the greatest gift of this fact is that you&rsquo;re never more than a few screens away from someone who has been there before, answered the question, questioned the assumption, solved the problem &ndash; or edited the &lt;a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\"&gt;Wookieepedia&lt;/a&gt;. Your passions and distractions are yours to negotiate, in tandem with whomsoever you can enlist along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, geeks were freaks in the most literal sense: humans rendered sub-human, performing in front of a baying crowd. Outposts of the internet can still feel like that today. Yet, in our geekocratic moment, something fundamental has shifted. Nobody is outside the crowd, and nothing human is entirely strange. This is far from an unqualified cause for celebration &ndash; but it&rsquo;s much too late to turn back the clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-08-05T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Social media, Doctor Who and the rise of the geeks","HeadlineShort":"The unstoppable rise of the geeks","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Thanks to the fact that like-minded souls are only a click or a search-term away, the unthinkable has happened  geeks have become not only acceptable, but even chic.

                Rothschild Boulevard has always been one of the grandest streets in Tel Aviv, with its broad tree-lined central promenade and elegant Bauhaus architecture.
               </p>
               <p>
                The cafes, kiosks and benches teem with young entrepreneurs who seem to survive on a diet of caffeine and wi-fi. Of Israels 5,000 tech companies, city planners have counted 600 start-ups in the single square mile around Rothschild. Israel has more companies on Nasdaq than any country beside the US and China, and it attracts more venture funding per capita than anywhere in the world. Its tech sector employs 230,000 people in a population of eight million, earning more than a quarter of the countrys total exports.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just off the southern end of the boulevard is the Shalom Meir Tower  once the tallest building in the Middle East. A lift door in the corner of the mezzanine leads to a municipal library on the seventh floor that had been forgotten by all but its ageing clientele. In 2011, it was refurbished as a shared workspace for start-ups. The fourth group of 13 companies has just finished their four-month session, which includes meetings with potential partners, lectures by business experts, networking  not to mention a great view over the city's beach.
               </p>
               <p>
                The pattern is repeated all the way down Rothschild, where incubators and start-ups compete for space among the coffee shops and restaurants. There are similar tech hubs in many cities throughout the world, but Avner Warner, Director of International Economic Development at the

                , says Tel Aviv stands apart because of a single overriding influence on early-stage Israeli companies: the Israeli armed forces.
               </p>
               <p>
                The military gives them their technological experience, managerial experience and networks, says Warner. For the average person, the greatest barrier to being an entrepreneur is 'Where the hell do I start? What do I do first?' Most people just get confused at this point and go get a normal job. Thats the experience the army gives them. Its understanding how you actually build a product, which is the same as managing a project in the army.

                Inside the HQ of the Mamram, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) technical support unit in nearby Ramat Gan, computer training course commander Capt. H (her full name is classified) says new recruits on a six-month intensive programming course study from dawn till night and are taught programming skills, teamwork, project management and  most importantly how to be creative. Its like a school for start-ups.

                When you do a degree in computer science you study the technical things," she says. "You study how to write a code, mathematics. We dont focus on that. We focus on how to work in a team. How to understand what your client needs and make software that fits his demands. How to write good code that you will be able to de-bug and maintain."

                , a commercial shared workspace just off Rothschild, says the results of the military training are obvious. Some of the military units work like a civilian organisation," says Marian. "They encourage entrepreneurship, the feeling that if you come up with a good idea that answers a real need of that units mission, you will get the funding and manpower and the time you need."

               </p>
               <p>
                Across the boulevard, Yaron Tal is Chief Technical Officer of 6Scan, a website security start-up hefounded with ex-army buddies. A white-hat hacker (one that works for non-malicious motives), since the age of 12, he was running his own web security consultancy by the age of 17, before being head-hunted for Matzov, thearmys cyber-security unit.
               </p>
               <p>
                Entrepreneurs in Israel are unique, he says. Their approach to problems is different to others because the army is a huge incubator for innovation and entrepreneurship. The army gave us a few million dollars at the age of 18 and asked us to build technology and systems that address problems that only people 10 or 20 years older are dealing with in other parts of the world. That kind of pressure and challenge really brings a lot of things out of you.
               </p>
               <p>
                Tal skipped university to work at a start-up before launching his own, but another important driver of the tech scene is the fact that Israeli university students pay only about $3,100 (2,000) a year in tuition fees. They emerge from military service and three years of studying with zero debt, eager to take a year off to pursue their dreams.
               </p>
               <p>
                That youthful exuberance, combined with the rigorous military training in technology and project management, has found a natural home among cafes running down the centre of Rothschild.
               </p>
               <p>
                Recruiting to 6Scan became easy after they opened an office on the boulevard, according to Tal. The street is full of start-ups. We talk together, help each other. There are no big companies here, which is great. We live very near the office. We love the vibe, the place, the other start-ups, the restaurants. Its easier to bring developers to the company when you say its in Rothschild even though we dont have much money to offer. We offer them equity and a good place to spend each day.
