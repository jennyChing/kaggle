         A Majority of Americans Support Legalization of Marijuana Now for the First Time
        </h3>
        <p>
         <strong>
          This is an Open Letter to President Barack Obama Calling on him to legalize marijuana.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         If you legalize marijuana, Mr. President, youll get the youth vote and win the 2012 Presidential election. Its as simple as that. However you do it, Mr. President, if you legalize cannabis, youll then do for the young of this country what you did for the
         <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/us-usa-immigration-idUSBRE85E0VA20120615" target="_blank">
          Mexican-American
         </a>
         and Latino populations, and then what you
         <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/obama-gay-marriage-thing-215555124.html" target="_blank">
          did for the gay and lesbian
         </a>
         communities earlier this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         How is this so?
        </p>
        <p>
         It just so happens, that here in the midst of campaign 2012, the issue of marijuana legalization and the status of medical cannabis have perhaps paradoxically both become highly charged topics. Legalization initiatives are on three state ballots, theres a whole array of other reform measures up for vote, and theres polls that show a majority of Americans support straight-out legalization of pot  all that makes this year 2012 an historic year for marijuana reform.
        </p>
        <p>
         But you wouldnt know it by watching the campaigns of Governor Romney and President Obama. Both candidates continue to

          avoid
         </a>
         talking about marijuana legalization, and Romney even

          chastised
         </a>
         a reporter in Colorado recently for bringing up the subject  its on the state ballot. Both candidates apparently believe its a non-issue. Yet they do so at their
         <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/155605/how_many_anti-pot_politicians_will_be_ousted_before_they_realize_the_will_of_the_majority" target="_blank">
          own peril
         </a>
         . As the more likely candidate to support marijuana reform, Obama, would win if he came out publicly for its legalization.

         Back to the basic premise of this Open Letter: if President Obama legalized marijuana, he would get the youth vote and win the election in November; okay, assuming that if he did that  legalized marijuana or medicinal marijuana  however he did it  and putting aside the question of whether he would then get the youth vote  isnt it just too politically risky for the President to come out for pot? Why would he risk the election on this drug issue?
        </p>
        <p>
         The answer to this query is no, an emphatic no , and heres the crux of the issue  it is now no longer politically risky for President Obama to come out publicly in favor of legalizing the herb  either for straight legalization or a more qualified one for medicinal cannabis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reasons that it is no longer politically risky coming out in support for pot are multiple; there has been a significant shift in American public opinion on legalization; state governments are more and more moving to decriminalize and enact other reforms; theres the abject failure of the drug war; the calls for legalization for personal use by many if not most Latin and Southern American leaders; theres pressure for reforms from the medical and scientific communities; and the fact that even the White House is interested in medicinal herb for returning soldiers with PTSD.

          Shift in Attitudes for Pot Legalization Reflected in Polls
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         First, Americans in recent years have gone through a
         <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/156251/there%27s_been_a_tectonic_shift_on_marijuana_across_the_us%2C_except_in_washington_--_why_can%27t_we_pop_the_beltway_bubble" target="_blank">
          tidal change
         </a>
         in how they perceive marijuana and its legal status. Theres been a dramatic turn in public opinion where now most Americans are okay with its legalization. This is first time in our modern history that there has been this kind of level of public support  massive public support  for ending the prohibition of cannabis and replacing it with a much more humane system of legalization and regulation. It could be the end is near for Americas nearly century-long prohibition of marijuana.
        </p>
        <p>
         American opinions can be viewed by what they say in polls, and the state politicians they support who are moving  many of them  on the state government level  to decriminalizing marijuana. And what do the polls tell us? There have been a number of national high profile polls that demonstrate that Americans strongly favor ending the war on weed.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/record-high-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx" target="_blank">
          Gallup took a poll
         </a>
         in the Fall of 2011, and reported that for the first time ever in all their polling since 1969, more Americans support the legalization of the adult use of cannabis than support its prohibition. This is a dramatic shift in opinion. In contrast, in 1969, in Gallups first survey on voters attitudes toward the herb, they found only 12 percent supported legalizing it. Even in the late Seventies, public support for cannabis legalization never went over 30 percent in polls, even though this was a period when a number of state legislatures decriminalized minor marijuana possession charges to fines, and reduced related felonies to misdemeanors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the last ten years, this tidal shift in American opinions has been reflected in Gallups increasingly year-to-year attitudinal increase in support. Its not just Gallup polls. Rasmussen Reports conducted polls and posted their results this past May. They affirmed the Gallup findings.
         <a href="http://norml.org/news/2012/05/24/rasmussen-poll-majority-of-voters-favor-legalizing-marijuana-like-alcohol" target="_blank">
          Rasmussen
         </a>
         found that 56% of Americans supported legalizing marijuana and regulating it like alcohol or cigarettes, with only 34% against. Rasmussen reported that this attitude was shared in every age group they polled  even those 65 or older.
        </p>
        <p>
         A Canadian poll also confirmed these trends. Polling firm
         <a href="http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/45091/americans-decry-war-on-drugs-support-legalizing-marijuana/" target="_blank">
          Angus Reid
         </a>
         reported in June that a good majority of American voters  both Democrats and independents  supported legalization. Angus Reid has conducted four such polls, all in consecutive fashion and all reported over 50% of Americans in support of legalizing pot.
        </p>
        <p>
         Theres even a recent Rasmussen Reports poll in Colorado  one of the states where legalization of marijuana is on the November ballot  that shows 61 percent of voters support cannabis legalization versus 27 percent who dont.

          State Legislators Move on De-Criminalization
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         With the current Federal crack-down and ostensible stall in Congress of pot reform, its clear that the response to this tidal shift in public and voter opinion is not being reflected in Washington, DC. But it is finding resonance among state legislators. Across the country many politicians are responding for the first time to the growing clamor to reform pot laws. Theyre figuring out that being pro-pot gets votes. Marijuana reform is in the air in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Colorado, Texas, Montana, North Carolina, Washington, Chicago, and New York City.

         <li>
          Pot legalization is on the November ballot in three states: Colorado, Washington, and Oregon. Colorados Amendment 64 is seen as having the best chance of passing; it would simply treat marijuana like alcohol in terms of regulation, requiring licenses for producers and sellers, a 21-age limit for buyers, and tax revenue for government. The first $40 million generated will go  if it passes  to public school construction.

         of politicians from both parties  including Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Barney Frank (D-MA), Steve Cohen (D-TN), James Moran (D-VA), Ron Paul (R-TX), Jarel Polis (D-CO), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and Peter Stark (D-CA)  have been supportive of marijuana reform laws. And importantly none of them have experienced any kind of substantive negative backlash from their constituencies for their pro-pot stances.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2011 Barney Frank and Ron Paul introduced the first federal legalization bill  but it hasnt gone anywhere. Another one of Franks bills on pot enforcement by the Federal government has been stalled since 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
         Congress is several years behind the general public on this, said Rep. Jarel Polis, a pro-pot reform Democrat from Colorado. But change is occurring even in Congress. When he first came to Washington three years ago, only a handful of legislators would stand up for pot reform, Polis added, but today, most Democrats support it.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other side of the Congressional aisle, many Republicans dont support marijuana reform. One of the few Republicans who does, Dana Rohrabacher from California, admitted, Ive been very disappointed with my fellow Republicans on this issue. He believes that more of his GOP buddies would vote for reform if there was a secret ballot, as many of them are small-government advocates and states-rights proponents, and think enforcing marijuana laws is a waste of tax monies, but are afraid to say so in public.

         Everyone but Washington knows that the Drug War is over  that it has failed. That Angus Reid poll cited earlier also found that two-thirds of Americans believe the

          European Countries Ignore US Pressure and Latin American Leaders Want Legalization
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         American pot smokers have long known that certain European countries  like the Netherlands  have much more open and humane policies towards marijuana. Governments on that continent proved long ago that they are
         <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/latin-america-wants-drug_b_1670365.html" target="_blank">
          independent
         </a>
         of the US with respect to drug laws and policies; they have historically ignored pressure from the US on this issue. The Netherlands, Portugal, Britain, and Switzerland have various forms of legalization.
        </p>
        <p>
         The big news, however, is from
         <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/doug-bandow/latin-america-wants-drug_b_1670365.html" target="_blank">
          leaders of Latin American
         </a>
         countries and how they now perceive the war on drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Consider the views of the leaders  past and current  of Mexico  a country that is embroiled in efforts to physically eradicate drug lords and their empires and has suffered more violence than any other country for these military actions. Former president Vicente Fox is from the most conservative main party  the National Action Party  and as head of government, years ago proposed the decriminalization of the personal use of cocaine, heroin, and cannabis. His proposal was met with such a howl of protest by  not Mexican legislators but by American ones  that the proposal went down in flames.
        </p>

         </a>
         Recently, Vicente Fox declared: Prohibitions dont work, and the last remaining frontier of prohibition is drugs, and we should question ourselves why drugs. He currently advocates legalization all the way  all drugs and in all places. In 2009 Mexico decriminalized personal possession of cocaine, heroine, LSD and pot.
        </p>
        <p>
         The current President, Felipe Calderon, stated in June that he wants the US to implement market solutions as a way to avoid the violence taking place across his country in the drug war that he himself has vigorously pushed during his administration.
        </p>
        <p>
         After his election this summer, president-elect Enrique Pena Nieto publicly
         <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/07/mexican-president-elect.html" target="_blank">
          admitted
         </a>
         that the war on drugs is not working, and while not in favor of legalization, he advocates for a new debate on how to deal with drug trafficking, as he believes there is now more drug consumption, drug use and drug trafficking than there were even after years of the fighting them. Pena Nieto criticized Washington for spending decades in attempts to curtail illicit drug use, pushing a drug war, that by almost every measurable objective he says, has failed in America.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other countries throughout Latin America have been creating drug reforms. In 2009, Argentinas Supreme Court issued a ruling that that stated punishing citizens for personal use of marijuana was unconstitutional. Also that year, current drug policies were denounced as an expensive and deadly failure by the prestigious and influential Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy. The former presidents of Mexico, Columbia, and Brazil sit on the Commission and all came out publicly advocating for decriminalizing drug use.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since then, the presidents of Costa Rica and El Salvador called for drug law reform and open discussion of legalization. And at the April Summit of the Americas attended by President Obama, the Guatemalan president who had made the fight against crime the hallmark of his campaign, helped to raise the issue of legalization during the meeting. He agrees that the drug war had failed  and more  he believes consumption and production should be legalized.
        </p>
        <p>
         Uruguays President Jose Mujica just this past June proposed legislation to legalize pot, and called on other nations to consider legalization. Under his proposal, the government would
         <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304898704577480764220930718.html" target="_blank">
          sell pot
         </a>
         to Uruguayans, and use the monies for drug treatment and rehabilitation. The president explained: We are doing this for the young people, because the traditional approach hasnt worked.
        </p>
        <p>
         Uruguays defense minister advocated for the measure, citing the violence caused by prohibition creating more problems than the drugs themselves. Heres the ministers enlightened quote:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          Financial corruption is affecting Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, on a greater scale, and now it is coming to Ecuador and Brazil. We dont want our country to follow this route.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         It is telling what is going on in Colombia right now, the site of that April Summit of the Americas. This month, their government gained authorization from the nations Constitutional Court for the decriminalization of personal use of cocaine and marijuana. Treatment would be offered, not prison. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said the goal of this proposal is to halt profits made by violent drug gangs and cartels:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          If that means legalizing and the world thinks thats the solution, I would welcome it.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         That countrys former president also weighed in:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          We cannot be condemned to live in war because Americans do not want to talk about it. No one speaks in favor of the war on drugs.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Obama of course was at that Summit of the Americas and he was embarrassed by these open calls for legalization by his Latin American counterparts. He criticized the idea of legalization, but did seem willing to look at whether US government drug policies were doing more harm than good in certain places. President Obama also added:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          Given the pressures a lot of governments are under  under resourced, overwhelmed by violence  its completely understandable that they would look for new approaches, and we want to cooperate with them.

         </a>
         One of the reasons for Obamas embarrassment is because his administration has been upping the ante in the drug war, increasing direct American participation in the anti-drug efforts. A DEA agent

          Drug Czar Says White House Is Interested in Medical Marijuana  for the Troops
         </strong>
        </p>

         Perhaps cracks are beginning to appear in the Obamas armored White House stance on legalization. Recently, his drug czar, Gil Kerlikowske, came out and

        </p>

         , the drug czar continued to emphasis that smoked marijuana has not proven to have any medicinal value. This is a perspective positively and directly in conflict with the American Medical Association. The AMA, the largest physician organization in the county, has declared that there is indeed

          The Schedule I Classification of Cannabis Is a Lie  the Science Says So
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The present classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance under federal law, means it is

        </p>
        <p>
         This mis-classification and mis-characterization of marijuana is no more scientifically accurate and tenable. The University of California did a 12-year study that was FDA-approved and cost millions of dollars; it

         that results of their study on smoked marijuana indicate that it can be useful in pain management and other benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dr. Igor Grant of UC San Diego, the program director, summarized what the UC Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research concluded in the May issue of Open Neurology Journal:

        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          Based on evidence currently available, the (federal) Schedule I classification (of cannabis) is not tenable; it is not accurate that cannabis has no medical value, or that information on safety is lacking.

         <strong>
          Response of Medical Community
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The American Medical Association, in stating in 2009 that marijuana has medical value, voted overwhelmingly in favor of calling for the reclassification of marijuana to allow for the development of new drugs, and issued a report with claims that:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          smoked cannabis reduces neuropathic pain, improves appetite and caloric take especially in patients with reduced muscle mass, and may relieve spasticity and pain in patients with multiple sclerosis.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         A recent scientific study published in
         <em>
          Open Neurology Journal
         </em>
         in June 2012 states that the placement of marijuana atop the Drug Enforcement Agencys schedule of controlled substances  a category reserved for drugs that have no medical value  is not accurate and not tenable. Scientists instead found that while marijuana has some potential for abuse, its profile more closely resembles drugs in Schedule III (where codeine and dronabinol are listed.) The continuing conflict between scientific evidence and political ideology will hopefully be reconciled in a judicious manner, they added.

         A good part of the scientific community favors legalization. Consider the following

          survey

         found 64 percent of all young voters are more likely to vote if marijuana is on the ballot. A

         </a>
         demonstrated that more young people were likely to vote for a pot-related initiative than the race for governor, up to almost one third of those polled.
        </p>
        <p>
         Getting the youth to the voting booths in November is certainly a Democratic Party national goal, as historically, young people vote for that party. But now we have their issue: pot, and if the President came out in support he would ensure their vote. Even before the 2010 elections, there was
         <a href="http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703298504575534321493828944.html?mg=reno64-wsj" target="_blank">
          mainstream speculation
         </a>
         that the Democrats were looking to the pro-pot youth vote to pull them to victory in the 2012 election. Back in 2010, Californias Proposition 19 was being held up as an example for other states to emulate in their efforts to stimulate the youth vote.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ocean Beach voters  often very youthful  came out strongly for Prop 19 in 2010, and OB precincts had some of the highest proportion of voters backing pot legalization from throughout the City of San Diego.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yet California votes rejected the herbal legalization measure in 2010, even though young people voted for it 2 to 1, according to the

          Support was strongest among voters between 18 and 24, who went for it 64% to 36%. Voters between 25 and 29 narrowly backed it, 52% to 48%. But voters under 30 made up just 13% of the electorate, about the same as is typical in a midterm election. In presidential election years, these voters are at least 20% of the turnout.

         It should be noted that more California voters supported Prop 19 than they did the Republican candidate for governor.

        <p>
         The implication is clear: if pro-pot initiatives are on the ballot, more young people vote, and they tend to vote Democratic. And if President Obama came out publicly and authorized the legalization of pot or at the very least, advocated for its legalization with definitive policy pledges, the young people would vote for him  and he would win.

          Conclusion
          <br/>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The American people have changed; the tidal turn in opinion on the legalization of marijuana has finally matured  most believe it is okay to have it legal. Pot reform laws will be on the ballots as state legislators respond to the change in voters minds on this issue. The leaders of the countries on the front lines of the failed Drug War call for legalization of personal use. The medical and scientific communities clamor for its legalization.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because it is time for Obama to live up to his 2008 campaign promise, it is time for him to get in tune with the shift in attitudes about marijuana with the public and even state legislators, it is time for the costly and largely ineffective War on Drugs to end, and it is time to allow for the public consumption of an organic herb and not allow another generation to go down the road of ugly substitutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         President Obama  legalize marijuana and you will get the vote of young people across the country  and you will win the 2012 election and achieve a second term. Its that simple.

             Probably, because they cant stand Romney or Obama.  The GOP nominating process, coupled with MSM bias is what did Dr Paul in, not the other candidates.  FWIW, both Dr Paul and Gov Johnson would make a better President than either Tweedle Dee or Tweedle Dum.

             Well, I dont see the GOP doing anything about jobs. They seem more interested in chasing after social issues, ie gay marriage, abortion and restricting the rights of minorities to vote.

               The GOP jobs plan is to extend the Bush/Obama (2010 he supported the extension) tax plan for all, build the pipeline, bring back FDRs Glass-Steagal rather then Dodd- Frank regulation, allow the trillions of corporate profits made and taxed overseas to be brought back to stimulate the economy, delay or suspend Obamacare and allow hiring without uncertainty, and end the green job fantasy program that only creates jobs overseas.  This would be a good start

           Marijuana is used by the majority of top sportspeople everywhere:
          </p>
          <p>
           * I just let him know that most of the players in the league use marijuana and I have and do partake in smoking weed in the offseason  Josh Howard, forward for the Dallas Mavericks. Howard admitted to smoking marijuana on Michel Irvins ESPN show.
          </p>
          <p>
           * You got guys out there playing high every night. You got 60% of your league on marijuana. What can you do?  Charles Oakley (Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards and Houston Rockets)
          </p>
          <p>
           * I personally know boxers, body builders, cyclists, runners and athletes from all walks of life that train and compete with the assistance of marijuana,  WWE wrestler Rob Van Dam
          </p>
          <p>
           * Some of the best cricket players of all time, like Phil Tufnell and Sir Ian Botham, have admitted to regularly using marijuana to deal with stress and muscle aches. In 2001, half of South Africas cricket team was caught smoking marijuana with the team physiotherapist. They were celebrating a championship victory in the Caribbean.
          </p>
          <p>
           *  At least a good 50 [US] Olympic athletes use marijuana regularly before they stop in time for testing. Stephany Lee

             That all makes sense to me. Think about it, when ever some athlete says they are In The Zone, how do they describe it? They say it feels like they have tunnel-vision, like everything else is moving in slow motion, etc. And guess what, whey you play sports when youre stoned, thats exactly how it is.

           Its about time our government recognized that a lot of Americans like to get high on something other than alcohol. If our legislators really cared about keeping people safe then they would legalize every recreational drug thats safer than booze.
          </p>
          <p>
           That would retain alcohol as the most harmful recreational drug legally available while at the same time give people the right to legally choose safer alternatives to alcohol.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the government really cared about keeping children safe then why is it bending over backwards to make them unsafe?

           I see so many people still referring to the use of marijuana as getting high, which is simply not the case anymore. While there are still people who use marijuana as a drug there are a much higher number of people using it as a medicine. When you see a person go from being in a wheelchair and  non verbal to walking, swimming, talking and laughing, you see how it can improve the quality of life for so many physically and mentally ill people. This is not the 1970s where people just want to have something to party with. So many Americans have actually felt the medical benefits of marijuana and without it they would be miserable and in pain. THe government knows they would make more money if it was legal so its time for them to make the change.

             While its true marijuana is a beneficial medicine, MOST people smoke marijuana to get high. They still receive medical benefits, and these benefits may be the main reason they continue to smoke instead of using other methods to get high like alcohol, but it shouldnt be insinuated that the majority of cannabis users are smoking purely medically. I am not saying marijuana should not be legal medically; on the contrary, I think if and when marijuana is legal there should be a way for people who really need it to have it paid for by insurance, but most people dont smoke marijuana as medicine, or at least not entirely. Anyone who is a part of the marijuana culture will tell you that. There are enough lies in politics as it is, and if and when a study shows that this is true, no one should be able to say we ever denied it.

             did you know people from all walks of life use cannabis regularly? Doctors to lawyers to teachers all use cannabis either a medicine or as a way to relax, multiple studies have confirmed that Cannabis is much much safer than alcohol or tobacco, so why dont you actually learn something before you start spouting misinformation.

             I think youre entitled to your own opinion, Im liberal, you arent. Thats fine. The thing you obviously dont know though, is that:
             <br/>
             1: The majority of Americans have used or regularly use Cannabis. Yet our society flourishes.
             <br/>
             2: Not has Cannabis only saved the lives of millions of Cancer and Aids patients, it has not once killed a single person in 10,000 years of recorded use by humans.
             <br/>
             3: A lot of your precious little right wing stars (Bill o Riley, (sorry if thats not the correct spelling)) have also tried Marijuana, yet you salute them.
             <br/>
             4: Many of the rumors you hear about Cannabis are very incorrect and are lies in the form of propaganda made by the government. You just fall into their trap, people like Nauss, the r/trees community, and I were the ones strong enough to climb out of that trap.

           Medical Marijuana Patients Get Their Day in Federal Court with the Obama Administration
           <br/>
           July 30th, 2012
          </p>
          <p>
           D.C. Circuit to hear oral arguments this October in lawsuit challenging marijuanas federal classification
          </p>
          <p>
           The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed to hear oral arguments in Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration, a lawsuit challenging the federal governments classification of marijuana as a dangerous drug with no medical value. The D.C. Circuit will hear oral arguments reviewing the scientific evidence regarding the therapeutic value of marijuana which are scheduled to take place Tuesday, October 16, at the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in downtown Washington, DC.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the rescheduling lawsuit is successful and marijuana is reclassified, federal defendants will then gain the basis for a medical necessity defense.

           Youre forgetting the biggest reason. Cannabis is the largest cash crop in the country. There is more cannabis grown (illegally and legally) than corn + wheat combined. If Obama were to legalize it, he could TAX it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Right now, whether he likes it or not, there is buying and selling of marijuana going on. And our country isnt making a dime off of it. Obama, you are sitting on an untapped GOLDMINE. You can tax weed as much as you want! Throw a 20% tax on it for all we care. Right now that money, which could be going to our schools and back into our community is going into the hands of criminals, organized crime, mexico, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Experts say 1% of the population spends $200/week on drugs. In NYC alone, thats 80k people. Spending $16 million a week. $832 million a year. Thats over $800 million sitting in stash houses. If there was a 20% tax on it and it was legal, thatd be $160 million dollars. in NYC alone. (Yes I realize $200/week is a lot, but thats 1% of the population. When you average in the casual cannabis users, Id say this number is seriously lowballing it)

           Were actually losing money going after the people buying and selling cannabis. Were cutting our police departments  laying off cops  because we cant afford to pay them. And the ones were keeping are spending time going after people for cannabis related crimes. Cannabis! The ONLY drug you cant overdose on. You literally cannot die from using marijuana. You can walk into a gas station, supermarket, drug store, etc., and buy enough alcohol to kill you in one sitting. You can buy one bottle of pills and not even need to take all of them to kill yourself! With a prescription (from a doctor who gets a cut from the big pharmaceutical companies), you can get roxycodone (legal heroin), adderall (legal meth), etc. You can buy a pack of cigarettes for gods sake and kill yourself with it! (Apparently smoking 20 at once can be toxic enough to kill you  there are 21 in a pack.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Lets think about what groups are going to vote for and against this. Realistically:
           <br/>
           BIBLE BELT-. Im sure the super religious folk wont be cool with it, but theyre not voting for you anyway. But then again, the bible belt is perfect cannabis growing weather. Think about the money that would pour into their economies. I think you could sell em.
           <br/>
           ARMED SERVICES-Youll get the support of the armed services too  everyone I know whos come out of the army and marines smokes, it helps with PSTD.
           <br/>
           WALL ST-Wall St will be for it  another market to invest in, plus with the amount of cocaine done on Wall St youve gotta assume theyre using marijuana to come down
          </p>
          <p>
           or by age:
           <br/>
           18-35  College kids.actually, pretty much everyone aged 18-35 is going to vote for you if you legalize marijuana. And honestly, most of those people wont feel like dragging their asses out to vote in November.. itll be cold, our one vote wont make a difference, whatever. But you can bet your ass if were voting for or against pot, were going. For most of us in the 18-35 age group, buying pot is the ONLY crime we commit. If we could legally buy and use marijuana, wed be law abiding citizens (and our ranking on the percent of citizens incarcerated list would fall from our current #1 spot).
           <br/>
           35-65  were around in the 70s. either still smoke.. wouldnt mind smoking if they could find it wouldnt mind a toke here and there.. (or think its the devils herb. hate to tell you, but you already lost these ones when you supported gay marriage). These people are hard working, and are probably stressed. Hello hurting middle class. They probably have families to support, and I bet theyd be thankful if they didnt have to worry about little Johnny getting arrested for smoking a bowl. or if Mom could grab a gram while she was out running groceries to unwind after a long week of work (wine gives her a hangover and makes her wake up in the middle of the night)
           <br/>
           65+  have health problems that marijuana helps with. Or are retired and want to relax.
          </p>
          <p>
           Plus  huge (personal) reason to legalize it  at least for medical reasons  IT CURES PARKINSONS! It replaces the missing dopamine and parkinsons patients do not have ANY symptoms. They are normal. Youtube it. My Dad has Parkinsons, and his doctor told him that marijuana is better to use than his pills (the pills eventually give you the shakes, not the actual disease) and he highly recommends he use it, he can tell my dad how much and the best way to use it (vaporizer or eat it) the only thing he legally cant do is tell him WHERE to get it. So, I have to go out every couple of months and meet up with a sketchy drug dealer and hope I dont get caught. To get my dads medicine. WTF America   how does this make sense.
          </p>
          <p>
           I could go on and on, but I think Ive proved my point. Legalize it, tax it, fix the economy, and win the election. Think of it like a high school student body election. It would be like telling your classmates if I win, no more school on fridays! and class starts 2 hours later!. Imagine as high school president you really could make that happen. Youd be the coolest kid in school. Mr President, right now you can really make that happen.

           Amazing article. I really enjoyed it. Especially the ending, Because it is time for Obama to live up to his 2008 campaign promise, it is time for him to get in tune with the shift in attitudes about marijuana with the public and even state legislators, it is time for the costly and largely ineffective War on Drugs to end, and it is time to allow for the public consumption of an organic herb and not allow another generation to go down the road of ugly substitutes.
          </p>
          <p>
           President Obama  legalize marijuana and you will get the vote of young people across the country  and you will win the 2012 election and achieve a second term. Its that simple.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you! I hope President Obama wakes up soon to the realities of the situation. He has an opportunity to make a real CHANGE. October surprise? Maybe. :)

           Legalize pot, tax it like cigarettes, and focus on drugs that are actually dangerous. California was able to raise around 6 million dollars in the matter of 3 years. Imagine how much money could be raised if it were nationally taxed and regulated. Not only by having the government tax pot, the hemp could be utilized in making other goods, such as clothing, rope, the plants could be processed and aid in making alternative fuels. Legalizing Marijuana could be the saving grace of our country! It would also put A LOT of drug dealers out of business, people would be more willing to purchase it legally at a store rather than taking a risk of buying it from some dealer.

           Please tell me how it is  in any way  the governments place to make any god given right illegal. This plant is as common as tobacco and obviously a gift given to humankind by our mother planet. I believe it should be as legal as alcohol  laws included. Human pain is a constant growing force just as medication bills are. Mother nature has offered mankind a simple solutionI give you a natural pain killer and the blessing of fire; use them wisely and with moderation. IN GOD WE TRUST.

           this is a brilliant article  one that Mr. Obama should read  and anyone eying the presidency should read as well

           included in a complete national legalization of marijuana needs to be the pardoning and clearance  of current prison sentences for those hundreds of thousands of non-violent prisoners serving time for growing, possessing, and selling pot  good people rotting in jail simply due to  pot crimes  (

           ).  hopefully the legalization of marijuana will be a get out of jail free ticket for them  with a long awaited rejoicing, and even compensation if things go well

           Well Im here to say Im in my 30s and I have never voted!!!!  And the reason that I havent ever vote is because what I do believe in they are against!!!  I grew up coming out of a American Indian family that grew to modern American family!!!  All my life my grandfather believed in Mary Jane    Now every other person hides the issue that they smoke.   And now I see the younger generation smoking incent because of the totally belief of Mary Jane.    There use of that product is really killing them as them same as liquar.    Have u ever drank vodka or gin and not making a crazy face.  It because its truly not suppose to be drank!!!!!   Drink water and tell me how refreshing that is.

           All I can say at this time is that Im really ambarassed of my USA Government.  I really dont like the idea of other countries looking at my country as  failures.  Our Gov. needs to realize that they are wrong.  Those countries show to be greater by admitting their wrong.  I would think that our politicians who are highly educated in some of our highly respected schools would be in agreement with Mexico, and all the other countries.  I dont know why our government always disagree on legalizing marijuana.  They (the gov.) are teaching our young kids what hypocricy is and are showing signs of being ignorant.  Oh, and I truely do believe that the pres. candidate that supports legalization will win this Nov.. The young and old will surely vote for that candidate.  People are tired of the present laws on drugs knowing that they have not work and that they have only destroyed many individuals.
