		Thomas Lanning likes things neat and orderly. He bought the house he grew up in and just about has everything remodeled the way he wants it. Hes happy with the house and wants a mate somedaythat day isnt today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linyah pops in to meet the Lanning Leap, she is expected, just not today. The last thing she expects to find is a huge handsome male who takes one look at her and he gets pissed off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This day just went from good to shit in a matter of heartbeats, didnt it? I dont suppose you have a mate, do you? She shook her head. Of course not. That would just make it too nice and easy. I wonder what else is in store for me. Plague? The bank go belly up?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linyah took a step back when he took one toward her. I need to touch you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas? He turned them both to his mom. Thomas, is she your mate? Is this your mate?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Linyah isnt any happier than Thomas is. She has been very successful in avoiding any entanglements with a male until now. She has even managed to avoid, Timmer, a forced arrangement brought on by her sister, their Queen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though Thomas isnt happy about Linyahs arrival, hes even less happy about Timmer. Linyahs his mate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Timmers been promised Linyahs hand by the Queen and isnt about to take no for an answer&lt;br /&gt;

			&lt;div class="pSubHead"&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/div&gt;
			Phillip moved along the inside of the cave slowly. The landslide had rendered the humans ability to get in almost impossible. But once he and his brothers were able to shift, moving between the small openings was hard but not as impossible. Plus, their innate ability to smell the hurt or sometimes the dead was making quicker work of it. &lt;br /&gt;
Before he took another step inside to shift again, someone appeared in front of him. She pressed her finger to her lips, which silenced the question hed nearly asked her about whether she was hurt or needed to come with him. She was dressed in a dark neoprene outfit that fit her skin like it had been painted on her. There were weapons all over her body, as well as a large Glock in her hand. He nodded once to it, and she smiled. Then when she lifted her hand up and spread her fingers, he watched as she brought it to her face. &lt;br /&gt;
As she looked at him through her spread fingers, he had an idea she was trying to tell him something but refrained from asking. Instead he watched as she pulled her still spread fingers from her face and put her hand in front of her mouth in a speaking motion. Phillip was still confused until she put her spread fingers in front of his face about five or six inches away. He got it then and nodded. But she still held her hand there, and he had a feeling he had to okay her touching him by putting his face in her hand. Leaning forward, for whatever reason trusting her, she curved her fingers over his face once he was there and touched him.&lt;br /&gt;
Her pinkie and thumb touched his ears. Then her fingers next to those touched his eyes as her middle finger dug into his scalp. It wasnt painful, but he could feel her probing his mind just a little. Before he could move back, even if he thought he could, she pulled her hand away and he staggered back.&lt;br /&gt;
Im not going to hurt you. He looked at her, and she smiled again. Youre not who I was looking for but youll have to do. The leader of you, where is he?&lt;br /&gt;
I think hes coming in from the north side. He and my other brothers have split up to make this faster. These people have been in here for over twenty hours. She nodded and looked to his left. Another man, dressed as she was, stood there looking at them both, and he was armed as well. When he put up his hand, as the woman had, he simply moved into it to speak to him as well.&lt;br /&gt;
Im Nic, and this is my sister. Were here to find a rogue. He might have been the cause of all this mess. Phillip didnt say anything, but did notice that while he was armed as well, the woman had put her gun away. We dont really need your help, but we can make this easier on you. Once youre doing what you need to do, we can get on with our job and you and yours wont get hurt. This is not a safe place for any of us, especially you guys.&lt;br /&gt;
Ill give you a map in your head to find all the people left in here. There are twenty-seven, not counting the one were looking for. Nine are dead; I will show you where they are as well. But the man we want for our own. Phillip was already shaking his head at the woman as she took over for Nic. You wont deal with us?&lt;br /&gt;
I will if Misha approves. But Im thinking it will take too long. What is the deal? &lt;br /&gt;
She smiled at her brother, then looked at him. Phillip had a feeling that they were communicating with each other, and he was suddenly a little nervous.&lt;br /&gt;
Misha Lanning? He nodded. He wont deal with us unless he covers every avenue and has a contract in his hand saying what will need to be given and taken. Your people dont have time for that. I can just go and get my guy, leave you guys here fumbling in the dark while others die, or you let me do what I want and you get to be a hero.&lt;br /&gt;
Im not really the hero type. She laughed in his head, and he smiled. He had no idea why he thought he could trust either of them, but he did. All right, but if he asks me what the hell youre doing here, Im going to tell him straight up you made me do it.&lt;br /&gt;
She put out her hand and smiled. Deal. Ill get my man, youll get the others out. Ill give you a way to find them, and youllwell, youre going to need help with some of the areas. There are stones falling everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
The mountain above them took a sudden jerk, and she reached for him. He was sure she was helping him, but a need to protect her had him covering her with his body. For only about two seconds. Then he found himself not only covered by her, but by the man as well. &lt;br /&gt;
When he was pulled to his feet, he could see that the huge rock that had fallen had hit her. Phillip looked at the stone and knew that had they not protected him when they did, hed be dead. Her suit was torn, and a big gash had been torn into her flesh as well. She waved Nic off, but Phillip could tell she was in pain. &lt;br /&gt;
Heres what youre going to need. She touched her finger to his head, and he felt as if hed been shocked with an electrical currentand he saw a map form in his head. The red areas are the most dangerous, the blue is where the living are, and the green is where the dead are. The places that are circled in the red are where youre going to need help. I would avoid the red areas altogether if I was you.&lt;br /&gt;
And where are you going? He didnt expect her to answer him, and she didnt. When Nic moved ahead of them, she turned back to him again. &lt;br /&gt;
You should really not tell anyone we were in here with you. Were sort ofwell, were not really a group of people you want to piss off.&lt;br /&gt;
What are you? She looked down the way her brother had gone, then back at him. She lookedwell, he thought, sad for a few moments. Then anger surged forward. Before she turned to leave him, she looked back over her shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
I am Genjar.&lt;br /&gt;
Phillip stood there for several seconds, trying to absorb what shed said. Genjar, as in the species that had been destroyed centuries ago? He had to have heard her wrong. They were all dead, he thought. But if she was telling him the truth, and he had no idea why shed lie to him about that, he thought maybe he knew why they didnt want anyone to know theyd been there. When she touched his mind again, he had to laugh.&lt;br /&gt;
Mull it over later, Phillip Lanning. There are bodies to find, and you standing there thinking things through isnt going to get them out. He reached for his brothers, looking over the map shed given him. Ill go and talk to your leader when Im sure youre not going to tell them we were here. If you do, you and your entire family will die before the next sunrise. Understand?&lt;br /&gt;
Phillip told her he did, and decided that other than telling Misha and making him understand what the hell was going on, hed never tell anyone. But damn, hed just met a Genjar.&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas reached him first, then Carter and Misha. Rider was on his way, as was Andrew, but they were making their way through the landslide looking for others as he made his way out and back around. Phillip told him he knew just where they were and to come now. He was the youngest of the brothers, but he knew when he said he had information, theyd come faster. He then reached for Misha as they stood there in the opening.&lt;br /&gt;
I have the information that we need to get them all out. Misha raised a brow at him but said nothing. I had help, and she said shed talk to you later. We cant tell anyone she and her brother were here.&lt;br /&gt;
And why is that? He didnt answer him, and Misha stopped him from moving toward the first area. And why is it you cant tell me or anyone else who she was?&lt;br /&gt;
Because if I do, shell kill us. Misha stood there for several seconds before he nodded. One thing about his brother, he could read people like a book, and he would know if anyone was lying to him. So when they got to the first area, the one that had several of the living inside, they worked together and got five of the living out, including a newborn. There was one dead among them. He was helping to pull the living ones to safer ground when he heard from the woman again.&lt;br /&gt;
Our rogue is on the move. We will protect you as best we can, but youre not to engage. If you do, he will kill you. &lt;br /&gt;
Phillip relayed the information from the woman to Misha. Misha told them to stand down. When a flash ran by them, the rogue he supposed, the man never even looked their way. But Phillip did tell the woman and Nic where he was headed. &lt;br /&gt;
Thank you. I owe you one.&lt;br /&gt;
The work was slow going in the red area. They managed to just save their asses when the earth moved again, bringing down a mountain, it seemed, of mud and mire. They were able to get out all of the living and the eight dead in a quarter of the time it would have taken without the help of the Genjar. &lt;br /&gt;
Misha was standing in front of the police officer talking to him when Nic touched Phillips mind again.&lt;br /&gt;
My sister is hurt, and it will be several days before she can see your brother. Could you have him set her an appointment for Tuesday a week from now? I know that she will say sooner, but Id appreciate it if youd simply tell her it was the best you can do. Phillip laughed and told him he was more afraid of her than him. As well you should be. If you know anything about our kind, you know the women are the strongest. You will do as she asks then, and I will see if I can hold her off. She is moststubborn.&lt;br /&gt;
Phillip thought that was an understatement but didnt say anything else. Instead he watched Misha as he walked to the news crew that was waiting for information.&lt;br /&gt;
We believe, by a counting of what the police have gathered, that all the victims are accounted for. The dead were moved to a safe location, and the injured are at the local stations set up to transport if necessary. The good news is, there was one more person within the slide than we had been told of. Misha waited for the crews to stop shouting questions, and Phillip thought for sure that he was going to tell about the rogue. One of the victims gave birth to her daughter, and both of them are doing well. They have been sent to the hospital for observation. The people with her deserve a pat on the back for not only helping her when she needed it, but also keeping them both safe until we could get to them.&lt;br /&gt;
Misha walked away and toward him. Phillip knew he was upset but not about what. When he went to the car theyd rented to get there, the rest of them followed. There was no reason for them to hang around and they rarely did. But Phillip was a little leery of getting in the big car with his pissed off brother. The rest of them got into the other two vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;
Tell me what you know of this woman and her brother. And I mean everything. Did you know that there was no listing for whoever they were looking for? For all we know they doctored the manifest up and took someone they were hired to kill. Phillip wanted to reach for Nic to tell him it was a good time to have the meeting, but the man appeared. He smiled at Phillip, then put out his hand to Misha.&lt;br /&gt;
You are the leader to this leap? Misha nodded and took his hand. Good. My sister is indisposed at the moment. We were looking for a rogue that simply would not cooperate with us. But we have him now and he is being brought to justice. Im Nic.&lt;br /&gt;
So? Nic laughed at Misha. What did this rogue do that someone had to be sent to find him now? Did you know we might have given you a hand in catching him?&lt;br /&gt;
No. You would have hindered us. Misha started to speak, but Nic continued. He was as we are, yet he had been using his magic for things that are best left unsaid. The slide was his doing to cover his tracks of a heinous murder. You were very lucky that we happened upon your family before he did. He does not play well with others.&lt;br /&gt;
Neither do I. Misha leaned back on the seat while the driver continued on as if there wasnt a new person in the car with them. What are you? And if you give me some bullshit answer, Ill make your life a living hell.&lt;br /&gt;
Nic looked at Phillip and then back at Misha. You have a very loyal brother here. I would have thought hed tell you what my sister told him. He is much more trustworthy than I first thought. We are the Genjar, and we have been hiding for many years. From the look on your face, I would say you are well aware of what we can do.&lt;br /&gt;
Youre all dead. Nic laughed, and Misha flushed. Im sorry. That came out harsh. What I meant to say is that&lt;br /&gt;
We want people to think were dead for now. It serves us better this way. Young Phillip here, he was told not to say a word and as a man of honor, I can only assume you are as well. Misha looked at him before Nic continued. Or is it your mother that rules the leap?&lt;br /&gt;
She does. As does my wife. Misha laughed when Nic did. You and your sister, are you the only ones left of your kind? &lt;br /&gt;
Nay, we are not. There are a great many of us. Not as many as we once were, but enough to make a nice showing if we needed to. Nic looked out the window. We are headed to the airport?&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. We never hang around when things are settled. It takes a great deal out of us all when we do search and rescue like this. Nic nodded. Are you coming with us?&lt;br /&gt;
Nay, not this time. My sister has been injured and I would like to make sure she rests. It will be most difficult to make her do so, but I can only try. She would like a meeting with you soon. Sooner than I would like, but soon. Misha nodded. May I ask that your family be present as well? We have formed a bond with your brother Phillip here, and would like to extend the same to the rest of the leap.&lt;br /&gt;
I think I can arrange that. Nic nodded. How will she contact me? Im assuming it wont be by conventional means.&lt;br /&gt;
Not with her. Youre not going tomy sister can be a bit of a bitch when the mood suits her. Which is most of the time. But she will contact young Phillip here. She had a connection with him that will serve until we can meet. My parents will be there as well. And I would ask that you make arrangements for them to stay somewhere close. They love to travel and have never been to this part of the world before.&lt;br /&gt;
They are welcome in our home. Nic nodded and turned to Phillip. He put out his hand again, this time in the form of a handshake, and Phillip took it. &lt;br /&gt;
Until we meet again. &lt;br /&gt;
Then he was gone. Misha stared at Phillip for several minutes before he spoke. Phillip wasnt sure what to expect but was going to take it. Hed kept something from his leader and his brother, and he knew that Misha would be pissed.&lt;br /&gt;
You knew what they were before? Phillip nodded. Then you did the right thing. Knowing what they were might have made meI dont know, but you can bet that it wouldnt have gone well for us. Or the people we were there to save.&lt;br /&gt;
She was hurt saving my ass when a slide landed on me. I dont know if she was hurt again or not, but it looked bad. Misha nodded. Are you pissed at me?&lt;br /&gt;
No. On the contrary, Im very proud of you. It must have been difficult for you not to tell me. Especially when I demanded. You did well. Misha looked at him then. But dont tell the family just yet. It would be better that we dont. Just in case Nic and his family decide not to come.&lt;br /&gt;
Phillip nodded but had a feeling theyd show up. And when they did, it was going to be fireworks. He had no idea, but he thought the mother was going to be just as stubborn as the daughter. Then he realized hed never gotten her name. Phillip had a feeling that was planned too.&lt;br /&gt;
