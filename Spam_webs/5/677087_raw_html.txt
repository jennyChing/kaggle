However, newly released sales figures for January show that the lead is bigger than many of us thought, and the PS4 still has not released in its home country of Japan." property="og:description"/>

            As time rolls on and the PS4 and Xbox One populate store shelves, the continual release of sales figures become more revealing. Thanks to Microsofts quickly reformed draconian Xbox One always-online policies  and the PS4s superior hardware  we all knew Sonys console would take a sales lead. However, newly released sales figures for January show that the lead is bigger than many of us thought, and the PS4 still has not released in its home country of Japan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both the
            <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/tag/ps4">
             PS4
            </a>
            and Xbox One released in November, with the PS4 having a one-week lead on its competitor. When 2013 was said and done, the PS4 managed to sell
            <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/174239-ps4-sells-4-2-million-units-in-2013-beating-the-xbox-one-comfortably">
             4.2 million units
            </a>
            , which was about 1.2 million more units than the Xbox One. At the end of the console cycle, if Sony only managed to sell 1.2 million more consoles than the Xbox One, Microsoft would happily take that since its basically a tie. However, those 2013 sales only had about a month and a half of shelf time, and the figures would have always ended up somewhat similar due to the rush of early adopters and limited stock. Now that the early adopter rush is over and both consoles are easier to find, the January sales figures would be more telling regarding the popularity of the consoles. The PS4s early lead wasnt a fluke, and the console has doubled Xbox One sales for the first month of 2014.

            Geoff Keighley of GameTrailers spoke with PlayStation senior vice president Guy Longworth, and while he was not able to obtain specific numbers, he was able to suss out the above information. PlayStation marketing vice president John Koller
            <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/02/13/qa-ps4-by-the-numbers/">
             confirmed
            </a>
            the report. Obviously, the only next-gen competitor is the Xbox One, as the Wii Us troubles have been
            <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/175052-the-wii-u-is-dead-in-its-current-form-admits-nintendo-but-what-now">
             well-documented
            </a>
            .The new nearly-double figure is a much better ratio than the 4.2 million to 3 million figure. Without the hard numbers, that lead could technically just be 1,000 units compared to 500 units  totally insignificant  but Koller stated that Sony has sold every single PS4 put on US shelves, so the lead is likely a large, impressive number.
           </p>
           <p>
            The
            <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/tag/xbox-one">
             Xbox One
            </a>
            actually sold better during the crucial holiday month of December, but that was attributed to PS4 stock issues, as supply for the console was limited.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next couple of months should truly foreshadow how the rest of this console war will end up. The Xbox One will finally receive its first flagship game,
            <em>
             Titanfall
            </em>
            . Despite
            <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/176599-titanfall-beta-only-runs-at-792p-xbox-one-fails-to-deliver-1080p-for-major-release">
             its odd 792p resolution
            </a>
            , this is basically the first flagship game to release for either console, and should help move units from GameStop shelves to the shelves under peoples televisions. Meanwhile, the PS4 will be releasing in its home country of Japan on February 22, which should generate a huge surge of sales for Sonys black box.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the Japanese release of the PS4 moves significantly more units than this generations first truly flagship game, then that could be representative of how the rest of the console war will play out. The Japanese PS4 release is only a week away, and
            <em>
             Titanfall
            </em>
            releases on March 11, so some prepare for some elucidating numbers releasing over the next few weeks.

                  I recall the discussion on this site when the hardware specs were brought out, and a lot of people were saying that just because this had that, it didnt mean anything because updates can increase that and this.
                  <br/>
                  Well, apparently, hardware DOES make a difference.

                    Yeah its certainly a factor.  But there were other things that MS did to mess up the launch, such as trying to force their customers to have an always on internet connection.  They really messed up the Xbox One launch spectacularly.

                      In about a week, we will be 3 months out from the launch date. I think the numbers might have evened out by now from a bad launch.

                        and a new restaurant can open its doors all they want, but if people dont coming in, buy the food in the first place let alone become repeat customers that restaurant is dead in the water.

                        a Launch is nothing if the customers dont buy it, so far MSFT has only succeeded in taking the cash from retailers, leaving them with some rotten eggs (MSFT knows this, and it hurts them as well, thus the board convening soon to take the new CEOs proposal to scrap the xbox label seriously, the xbox label has been a financial loss for MSFT since the original xbox)

                         <p>
                          1- x1 is a brick without XBL. Single player games and disk movies only.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          No browser, no streaming services, no one guide, no cross game chat, no Skype and no video capture without XBL.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          2- overpriced and underpowered hardware
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          3- no free exclusive content like PS3/PS4 Destiny, watchdogs, assassins , Metal Gear
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4- games with gold not on x1 and currently its laughable in comparison to ps+
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          5- Titanfall and project spark on PC with free online play the PC way. Just wait and watch all their other exclusives go to PC same as 360 titles did.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          6-  as a Xbox g amer you are at the mercy of Microsofts horrid customer policies and core principles. Just look at the past. Halo 2 on PC Vista only, orig Xbox service/support dropped, RROD to gain marketshare, paywall basic features on 360 &amp; x1, what they tried to do with x1 brick console drm/always online/ Kinect required or its brick.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Cable pass thru means nothing to most we been cutting cords for years. Friend spectate and take over mode means something to everyone. Longer video capture, much better hardware and for less, less expensive accessories. X1 control $60 missing blue tooth, gyroscope, batteries, touch pad, light bar and speaker. Then add $25 for battery pack making each controller $85!!! &amp; still lacking what ps4 $60 controllers have.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Oh and just look at last 4 years  HALF 360s life. Almost no exclusives despite M$ raking in 2.75 BILLION per year plus revenue from ads on homepage.

                          Cable pass thru means nothing to most? Hmm..  FYI..  Cable/Sat subscribers still make the vast majority of TV watchers.. There are 115 million households in the USA, 85 million have Cable/Sat .. 74% of America has Cable or Sat..  Even with the rate of decline.. it will be a good decade before that number even hits just 60%..  Still a majority.

                          Source? These are common numbers.. do a Google search yourself.  I was actually on the low end. Some numbers put Cable/Sat/TV subscribers at around 103 million.

                          Its not a stupid feature.. and you obviously havent used it.  Being able to snap TV, Apps and, and not have to EVERY worry about changing inputs makes your entertainment center that much better.. The MAJORITY of people who buy game consoles are NOT hard core gamers.. They are casual gamers (hence the reason that the Wii sold 10s of millions MORE then the Xbox 360 or PS3). For casual gamers the Xbox One brings more to the table.Consoles dont sell big numbers the first few year.. The Xbox 360 and PS3 both sold their most consoles in years 5 and 6 Proof again, that gamers do not buy the majority of consoles..  true hardcore gamers are on PC.

                          (1) I dont know anyone but my grandma with cable. $60/month for 4 good channels riddled with commercials. No thanks.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          (2) Cable pass through IS a stupid feature if you admit it or not.

                         <p>
                          (3) PS4 is an entertainment powerhouse but directed towards superior gaming performance, experience and game play.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          (4) Kinect is laggy misreading command garbage and even 2.0 has 3 times the latency of PS Move.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          (5) The majority of gamers that buy consoles ARE INDEED hard core gamers. You have no idea how things work so let me school you a bit.

                          Wii was so popular because (A) Cheapest next gen console (B) Innovative motion gaming (C) Retro gamers could finally put NES, SNES, Genesis &amp; N64 in storage and play old school NES games wirelessly for the first time and on a 21st century style NES controller (wii mote). (D) Wii fit came at the perfect time. Soccer moms, Retirement homes, Kid centers &amp; Gyms all purchased Wii for wii fit.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Also this last generation was the most successful generation in history for all 3 platforms. Wii is the best selling Nintendo to date, Sure PS3 is below PS2/PS1 but we still have at least 3 years for it to be on the market and its already the 4th best selling in history. 360 is right behind it as 5th in history.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Then just look at WiiU. It certainly is directed torwards casuals but its failing again. Why? Because it has none of what I listed above going for it this gen. Not much innovation, no reason to get it for retro games, wii mote isnt new and isnt improved, the price is not right and wii fit is old news.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          (6) Xbox one is the absolute WORST place to casual game. (A) everything is paywalled. Moms and pops gonna have to fork out $300 every 5 years just to access basic features. (B) Xbox live is worthless while PS+ is highly valuable. Moms and Pops are gonna be much happier paying $50/yr for huge free games. Actually giving something for the subscription (C) Xbox is not known for family friendly casual games other than laggy misreading command kinect garbage. While Sony has an army of studios pumping out quality games of all genre.

                          But hey dont take my word for it. Just look at all the polls before and after X1/PS4 launch. Then look at X1 sales after the excitement of a new console and holidays are gone and PS4 is finally in stock.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          About half way through January I saw PS4 available. I should know because thats when I got mine and I herrased all outlets I could. Checking Amazon every day, calling every retailer around and I finally got it and then all of a sudden it was mostly readily available and BAM. PS4 outsells X1 2:1 in xbox stronghold the US.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Xbox simply sucks. Sure its fun but if you measure it up to the competition it simply costs the most and gives the least and microsoft have horrid customer policies and core principles. I will never in a million years support xbox so long as they screw over the consumer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Currently they are screwing over the consumer by (A) Paywalls to basic features (B) Worthless forced xbox live subscription (C) Windows phone 7 users being forced to upgrade to windows phone 8. I add this because it is in line with Halo 2 on PC and orig. xbox both instances M$ tried forcing upgrades.

                          Just so you understand. . Facts out weigh the fact that the only person you know with cable is your grandma. I could say the opposite. Every single person I know has cable tv, Fios, or Sat .. So that must mean every single person does. But I know thats not how real life works. 85 million plus household have cable, satellite, or telco provided TV. This by the way means 222 million Americans live in a house with these services. Total population is around 316 million. That means 70 percent of ALL Americans have it. Sorry but 70 percent of Americans are not elderly people.

                          I do hate xbox but I am 100% right and you know it. Ive been at this game for a long time son and I understand how it all works. Ive been right about every single one of my predictions and I have valid points.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But thats fine. You can think whatever you want in the sad pathetic existence that is your life. Of course you are supporting the rape of the gaming industryI suppose just to leave your dirty smear mark on the world however you may. Destroying what you say you supposedly cherishgaming.

                          (B) Service/Support on orig. Xbox. Again trying to force upgrades.
                          <br/>
                          (C) RROD to gain market share. It worked and the consumer suffered.

                          (D) Paywall basic features on 360 &amp; X1.
                          <br/>
                          (E) Ads on home page
                          <br/>
                          (F) Took 2.75 billion per year from XBL + revenue from ads on home page and then didnt deliver in exclusives for half 360s life. Sony delivered all gen despite free online play, despite free exclusive content in most AAA multi plats and despite huge free games via PS+ which is also cheaper than XBL.
                          <br/>
                          (G) What they tried to do with X1 DRM, always online, kinect required or its a brick.
                          <br/>
                          (H) What they are doing right now to windows phone 7 users regarding xbox video content. Again forcing upgrades this time to windows phone 8.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Microsoft sucks in every measurable way. Supporting unreliable hardware like 360 &amp; worthless subscription service like XBL does nothing but harm the gaming industry.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We have a duty to set the expectations for the future. Well if Microsoft had it their way the future would be very expensive for gamers along with getting very little for all that money.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Just saying. Stand up for what is right. Until Microsoft makes XBL valuable and drops the paywalls to basic things no other hardware in the world paywalls (like browser, streaming, apps, cross game chat, skype, video capture ect) then do not support them.

                          You clearly never read your work through. Your argument is overly offensive, and with little reason to justify your harsh claims. Its easy to see how biased you are, rather than someone who is willing to admit (as I am) that both systems have pros and cons, but overall, Ps4 is better as a gaming console, whereas Xb1 is a better home console. Either way, the differences are minute. No reason to get so worked up.

                          Whats funny is that they always just attack me. You see no one actually has anything against playstation like I do against xbox. Anyone hating on playstation is doing it just to hate it. Pure fanboy and only hating because its not their product.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I hate xbox because it harms the gaming industry and its success would ruin the future. We must set expectations now so that the future of gaming isnt expensive, isnt dry of exclusives and doesnt paywall basic features. Force them to make xbox and xbox live valuable and the future will be a lot better.

                          Already Sony has done a good job forcing microsofts hand. Games with gold may suck in comparison to PS+ but at least its a start. Sorry for X1 owners watching PS4 gamers collect free games while they get nothing in addition to superior free exclusive content in multi plats and a more capable machine. But its a step in the right direction and all thanks to Sony.

                          Again. This shows you have no understanding of how any of this works. If you are watching TV and a friend wants to play youyou wouldnt know on any other systems. With the Xbox One you do and can jump right into the game.. that is just one if a hundred ways the hdmi pass through is useful.  Also, casual gamers are the majority of those who by consoles and these households do watch a ton of tv.

                          Nobody needs a game console. So your response is kind of irrelevant.  Its not a gimmick. It is how the Xbox One becomes the center of ones living room as it one device for gaming, tv, blu ray, NetFlix etc.  All controlled by your voice.  You can be watching TV and playing a game at the same time watch a football game and have your fantasy stats snapped on screen ..  Skype with a friend or family member while playing a game or watching TV..again Just a few of the hundreds of things that hdmi pass thru allows.

                          Nobody needs a console? Apparently 5.3 million do and counting.  Keep justifying your purchase! If youre happy with it good for you!  To bad that most people dont find that console to be THE center of a living room as you do.

                          You do realize not that is not even 1 percent of the world. In fact less then 5% of the world bought a last gen console. Console gaming is really a small industry compared to smartphones or PCs. Nobody needs a game console. It is a luxury item. It is not food, clothing, or housing.  That is what I meant.

                          I dont need to justify my purchsse. Also 3.4 million people dont either. Also. The Xbox One is only available 13 markets. The PS4 is in over 55. The Xbox One actually has a higher per market average then the PS4.  Either way I an buying a PS4 next month an always planned to. I have owned every console by Playstation and Microsoft. As well as every Sega console.

Because the Xbox One sold almost 2 times the amount the Xbox 360 during its first 45 days in North America. 2 TIMES., The Xbox 360 had NO next-gen competition as the PS3 came out a year later. So going head to head they still managed to double the amount of consoles sold out of the gate. They even doubled the amount worldwide (being in less markets). They were only at 1.5 million by the end of 2005. Xbox One was at just over 3 million.  Also. The PS4 is only slighly ahead of the Xbox One in North America because of the week earlier it came out. The consoles the PS4 outsold the X1 in January didnt make up for how much the X1 outsold the PS4 in December.  It is literally less then 100k units separating the 2 in North America.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The current units sold according to this website are 5.3 Million PS4s and 3.6 Million X1s. That is in roughly 55 markets compared to 13 Markets. That is 96k units per market for the PS4 and 276k per market for the X1. The X1 would only have to sell 40k units for the other 42 markets to match the 5.3 million.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Also.. The reason for the 13 markets has more to do with getting the TV functionality working in each market before release. Its not just as easy as releasing the console wherever they want, as the X1 has to recognize every CABLE operators in EACH market. So the roll-out of the X1 will be happening over the next year.

                          Youre blinded by the marketing The only reason they launched on 13 countries is because they dominated or ar least were competitive on those markets And because they needed to have consoles in-stock for the US-Holidays That is the only reason they launched on 13 countries because they wanted to start out strong  wherever they were strong last-genThen they will spread across! And the problem is That sony has an established market already globally with the PS4 therefore theyve got a tough job to catch up!  I doubt they will and the projections dont look good theyre being outsold dramatically in the US.  Open your eyes! ;)

                          I swear you dont read my responses, and when I factually prove you wrong on something.. you just come with a new lie.

                          FACT: The PS4 has not dramatically outsold the X1 in North America. They are only around 100k difference since release, and the PS4 was out a week earlier.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          FACT: Initially the device was to release in 21 markets out of the gate. It is NOT marketing. Again. You have no clue how an Xbox One works so you cant comment on it. Microsoft has to make sure the X1 works with ALL cable providers in the area. It also has to have the Channel guides for EVERY area to work with OneGuide. They even pushed back people who had PRE-ORDERED consoles in those 8 markets.

                          So all that rubbishness you just said means That MS has not been selling well because of cable companies not being compatible with the console yet and/or vice-versa! Youre more mentally challenged than I thought! This is a business And MS sees USA as their primary clientelle MS regardless of Sony releasing a week earlier IS BEHIND! And that IS a FACT! Losing on their home turf? Now thats just sad! They needed the extra stock on the US to meet with a fake demandI see Xbox Ones Everywhere i Go and yet i see nobody picking one up or neither do i know anybody who owns one I can literally go into a store and ask for one and those are readily available I cant say the same for PS4 People are like Piranhas everytime they find out there are a few available. Dont worry get your new PS4 and enjoy the exclussives like the casual gamer you are Btw theres nothing wrong with being a casual gamer!  PS: ive owned every single console since the jaguar All of them except the Xbox one And i didnt get it because it seems that all their meaningful exclussives are comming to PC and i own a gaming PC!

                          Again. Facts mean nothing to you.. yet you call me mentally challenged. I have never once resorted to name calling with you, so this speaks volumes about you.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I told you I have owned every single PlayStation, Xbox, and Sega systems ever made. Also owned a few Ataris.  Someone who was a causal game this would not be the case. I owned all 3 last gen consoles.. and a PSP. will be getting the PS4 and a PS Vita..   I am sorry.. But I surely do not fall under the term casual gamer.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          While in your town every store may have a Xbox Ones.. Not the case where I live..  both Walmart, Target and Best Buy often are out of both consoles where I live.  There was no artificial stocking of consoles for fake demand.. The Xbox One sold 2.23 times the amount the Xbox 360 did in its first few months..  that is not artificial demand.  It is easier to make sure you have enough consoles for 13 markets then it is for 55 markets..  Common sense if the companies are producing the same amount of consoles.. there will be much better availability spreading over 13 markets.. then 55..
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You say the Xbox One hasnt been selling well. it now is the 2nd best Console launch in HISTORY..  Another FACT for you. Right behind the PS4 which now has the best launch in history. The Xbox One is selling VERY well and just because you say it is not, doesnt make it true. The facts DO. The 3.4 million sold do. 2.2 times the amount the Xbox 360 sold.. even with being in less countries and having REAL competition.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          No one is picking up the Xbox Ones.. but yet they have still managed to sell over 2 million consoles in North America. Go tell those 2 million people they are nobodies..
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So after repeating the same FACTS several times with you maybe it will stick.

                          Wow! Microsoft is not selling well and leaving retailers with bad eggs? Thats amazing that you have facts like that especially since both ps4 and xbox one are setting sales records for consoles and sony says it has doubled xbox one sales in January but no one has Any sales numbers, but they do have sales numbers for games sold for January.  So the ps4 sold twice as many unverified consoles in January but the xbox one and 360 make up 47% of all software sold in January.  The rest were pc, ps4, ps3, wii, wii u etcso if the ps4 is selling such enormous numbers of consoles then why isnt anyone buying games for it? Either no one is buying the ps4 or they are buying it just to say they have it.  They are definitely not buying anything to play on it.  People buying the ps4 just seem to be getting the free stuff like Resogun / defender which is the ps4s top game? So Im going to buy a $400 system to get a free game that is a remake of Defender from the 80s? Sony talks about real gamers.  Hard core gamers. Real gamers arent playing Resogun

                          hey! resogun is really fun.  id argue that real gamers do play resogun because real gamers ought to be playing as many different games as they can if they truly appreciate gaming in its entirety. casual gamers, i assume, are the types that play the same few genres (FPS, open-world slasher/beat-em-up) over and over. and though they may spend obsessive hours on these games, i dont think we can label them as hardcore (unless maybe they involve themselves in tournaments).

                         <p>
                          point is, you should play resogun

                          Lol who brings previous gen into a current gen fight? if we were talking about current gen ps4 has sold every game more except for cod (xbox can have that pos for all i care). Yes xbox 360 has beaten ps3 we all know that but the disscussion is ps4 vs xbox one so leave the sales of last generation out of it. And what are real gamers playing? ur crappy zombie game or your bad racing game? Lol xbox one isnt good. Keep ur 720p 30fps pos system nobody wants that we want the gaming system that plays games not the gaming system that orders pizza from pizza hut.

                          Read much? No? Go back and read again.  Xbox one is a 1080p 60fps system.  Its up to the developers to decide how theyll make the game.

                          No it isnt. The Xbone is scaled up to 1080p thats quite the difference from native 1080p. And at best, the Xbone works at a variable frame rate that tends to spend more time in the 30fps area.

                          Also, I bought the PS4 launch and the Instant Game Collection + the games available at launch were more than enough. Now Thief is coming out, followed by Infamous Second Son. Things are only getting better on the PS4. The same cant be said for the competition

                          It you listened to Microsoft, only specific games will be displayed on 1080p. its not true like the PS4 (which means EVERYTHING IS IN 1080p). So, have fun with the 720 resolution for that gaming of yours.

                          I think it speaks volumes that there isnt much to play on the PS4, yet people are still choosing it over the Xbox.  The fact that you get free games, for at least a month(free plus trial), is also enticing.  I would like to see the specific numbers for just PS4 &amp; Xbox One games sold, as that would be more telling of this current generation.

                          well, in my own store, I have 28 xbox ones sitting on the shelf (have been there since Dec..).. and of the day one units sold (My store got 20 of those) 11 were returned (10 for hardware failure, 1 because they wanted to trade up for a ps4).. BUT, in the same shop, I filled out preorders for over 3.7k ps4s (fyi, my policy is that customers pay in full up front for an order), 1.9k of which have been delivered thus far..
                          <br/>
                          Thats just one store, but then again, the difference in the numbers might also be due to the fact we inform our customers of the products and show them in use side by side informed customers do make more rational decisions
                          <br/>
                          regardless.. the trend is similar GLOBALLY.. and for good reason.
                          <br/>
                          atm its more than 2:1 in the U.S. and up to 7:1 in other regions in favor of the ps4.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I dont expect to see a loose ps4 sitting on my shelves until after July-August..

                          I have both ps3 and 360 and playstation + give you better games every month than the 360(also they usually give 3-4 games a month). Now i dont know where you live but where i live its impossible to find a ps4. When a shipment comes in theyre sold out within 2 hours at every store. You could walk into each of those same stores weeks after and still find x1s sitting on display waiting to be sold. So youre out of touch with reality.

                          I think people are really starting to get ridiculous in their reasoning here. How is the Xbox one a failure? Playstation is predictably doing better, because of a myriad of factors, but how exactly is selling 3.5 million units in 2 months a bad thing? Lets put aside the fanboyism and get realistic here. Both systems are doing well and will continue to do well this generation.

                          selling 3.5 in 2 months wouldnt be a bad thing, but again, those are the total sales (same as shipped and sold-in) and are different from Sold-through, which would be when the actual end user, a consumer, has the product in hand and becomes part of the install base and starts buying software and services.. which is where the real money is made. The install base is directly related, and far more important. Customer purchased&gt;retailer purchased (in both cases the manufacturer got money, but only in one case will they continue to make money while the other is generally a loss and only meant to subdue the sting of that loss a bit). Xb1 actual Sold-through numbers are closer to 1.5 million, this can be seen as you go to the store and see the shelves loaded with xb1 units not moving. its only real sales came from Day one sales, usually those too fanatic and ignorant to understand, and prefer to affirm their unwritten oath to a brand name (and possibly a couple hundred who are seriously objective and want to be critical of all platforms).

                         <p>
                          Both systems in truth, are not doing well it helps to look through the pr smoke screen, and see the figures for the truth.. look for the retail key words like sold-in and sold-through, and know when they claim some amazing statistic that it is an obvious misdirection (such as xbox claims 47% of the market share for the industry in Jan 2014.. but that was sales combined on all msft platforms.. see how they fluff and mislead with loaded stats?)

                      In about a week, we will be 3 months out from the launch date. I think the numbers might have evened out by now from a bad launch.

                    Sure it does. At the end of 2014, there will be 3 times more ps4 sold.

                    The xbox one is the next Wii u: all the fans and people that wanted one, already bought it.
                    <br/>
                    Just 2 photos a friend of mine sent me, yesterday, while he was in a big Mediamarkt store, in Geneva, Switzerland, trying to find a ps4 for his brother. And of course, the ps4 is sold out everywhere in Europe, in the planet earth, in the whole milky way. Simply because everybody and his neighbour and his dog WANT and DESIRE a PS4.

                   <p>
                    And of course, as you can see on the photos, there are piles and piles of these untouched green boxes that contain an xbox 720 and a kinekt and free Skype that needs a live gold subscription, as do 99% of the features and apps. Outside some stubborn xbox fans in north america, and a few other in UK, Canada and Australia, nobody gives a fuuck about this system. Nobody.
                    <br/>
                    And for those who dont believe, look at those sad photos pitiful. Stacks of xbox 720 , waiting, somewhere in the world, that a blind or deaf victim just swallowed the microsoft, penello and pro-microsoft websites and paid off tools, like poolygon, or the great amazing professional unbiased Adam sessliar, that always come to rescue his beloved company, with a pitiful video like the one resolution and graphics arent important

                    Of course hardware makes a difference.  Some people actually bought the cloud powered crap that Microsoft was spewing.  I feel bad for them, but given that everyone who knew better spent 5 months warning them before the Xbox release, I cant say its anyones fault but their own.  Hope can be a very strong drug, but sometimes its better to face reality.  Im sure the Xbox One will still have plenty to offer them, but Microsoft needs Titanfall to do well and to move consoles to stay relevant.  If they keep selling half of what the PS4 sells in the US (theyre selling considerably worse in the rest of the world) then were looking at another PS2 generation for Sony.

                  Hardware does make a difference, but not a large one.  Id say the large minority of actual console owners dont know how much, if any, difference there is with resolution or frame rate or anything else.  Price, games and publicity are more important now.  At least thats my opinion.

                      Tomb Raider is selling close to 2:1 on the PS4 because its holding the same ratio as the system its on.  As someone who is neutral towards both systems, I still dont think graphics alone are anything more than one of many parts about why the PS4 is selling more.  Sony has just owned most everything about this launch and generation so far.

                    Its not just the hardware.when you compare the specs of the PS4 AND price (long-term as well).versus the price of the XBone AND the specs.the PS4 is the EASY winner..this is why it keeps selling out.

                  Went to my local Best Buy, Target, and Walmart (huge shopping center so all were next to each other) to buy different things and just look at the Electronics since I love everything PC/Game related and In all stores they had big stocks of Xbox Ones but the PS4 shelves were empty with only games being in that section. Luckily for me I preordered my PS4 months in advance and been happy ever since.

                      i lined up also, and they ended up having 13 ps4s and 10 xbox 1s. i was 13th in line and didnt get the ps4.people kept showing up looking for the ps4 and were told they were sold out, but they could buy the x1,they said no and looked sad and walked away.girlfriend sister asked us to buy her son the x1 so i waited and after buying it they had 8 left with no one else in line. x1 is going to suffer a slow death.

                  Went to my local Best Buy, Target, and Walmart (huge shopping center so all were next to each other) to buy different things and just look at the Electronics since I love everything PC/Game related and In all stores they had big stocks of Xbox Ones but the PS4 shelves were empty with only games being in that section. Luckily for me I preordered my PS4 months in advance and been happy ever since.

                    It tells that the XBone cant reach playable framerates at 1080p (something that the PS4, with 50% more shader units, dont have any problem with, as we have seen with the huge differences on Tomb Raider).

                      But Forza 5 did though right? I am not saying that the X1 is more powerful.  I am just saying that the difference is not massive.

                        HA. The only way Forza or any game on the box could actually reach 1080p 60 fps, is by sacrificing many things inside the game, sacrifices that the PS4 doesnt have to do. Do some research and youll find out that the Xbox One is actually a weak piece of dog crap :)

                        Forza5 its a shame. Microsoft should get sued for what they did.
                        <br/>
                        The ads are fake just like when they demoed the game at E3. They were using high-end PCs with SLI GPUs to achieve that rendering quality in real time, fact is that the actual game sucks.. in order to make it run fast or better yet run at least on the obsolete AMD APU Jaguar of the XBoxOne (same goes for the PS4 anyway) they changed everything, lowered all algorithms precision, used flat textures, lowered the number of polygons using very simple models
                        <br/>
                        That is the only trick software houses can use to have any game run on the crap hardware of the XBoxOne and Playstation4. The consoles are slower than previous generation and other than having more RAM available for loading larger textures they have nothing better.

                  Its not surprising, the PS4 is a noticeably better game machine than the XBOne (Tomb Raider running at 30fps on the XBone and 60fps on the PS4, Titanfall cant even reach 1080p on the XBone,  ).

                  We all have our media centers, Blue-Ray readers,  we dont need the Media features of the XBox sacrificing graphic power.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  PS4 : noticeably cheaper and noticeably more powerful games, make your choice is a no-brainer.

                          The point of my statement was that that the ps4 drops and is not consistently at 60fps. The xb1 drops below 30 but nowhere in the teens and it is consistently at 30 fps and drops about 8% of the time compared to the ps4 being below its claimed 60fps for more than 80% of the time.

                          even if the Order had a full launch version to play right now, and its specs were that, its still more Ps and frames than xb1 games not sure why you think you are getting anywhere in here. Try arguing about the xb1 being better with some illiterate people, perhaps they wont know the truth. Perhaps they will treat xb1 like Brondo but.. it has what the body craves!, it has electrolytes I swear.. that Idiocracy movie was made by a prophet..

                          dude.. it doesnt drop below 30.. it is capped at 30 fps and consistently drops into the teens during the entire game..

                          get over it, PS4 does it better, your delusions are only serving to isolate yourself further from the gaming community in general, and your need to attach your low self-esteem to a brand name will only serve to leave you living in regret and anguish.

                          a cg movie with prompts to make you think its an interactive game all lasting no more than 1.5 hour to complete?? it should be the best looking game for a decade. sorry.. but Ryse is a terrible example of what a good game is.

                      Tech experts have found that the Xbone version seems to use variable resolution though, dropping to 900p in some of the more load-intensive sections, added to that, tests have also clocked it dropping to 18fps, its not looking good.

                          Im so glad that you consider Digital Foundry a reliable source (ie, having expertise in this field of technology) since this is coming straight from them: Meanwhile the situation is more interesting on the Xbox One: the anti-aliasing solution remains unchanged, but we see the inclusion of what looks like a variable resolution framebuffer in some scenes, while some cut-scenes are rendered at a locked 900p, explaining the additional blur in some of our Xbox One screenshots.  Now Im using my two eyes now, and I think Im seeing your source say exactly what you disputed strange, maybe I should get another eye or two, just to be sure yknow.

                    Do your eyes work that much better than mine?? cuz I cant see a huge difference in the GraphicsPS3 had the more powerful hardware but 360 in the end won! Only non gamers bitch about graphics! id rather play the ugliest game ever with the best gameplay everkillzone looked great but it was a piece of shit that I beat in 5 hourshahaha When Sony can produced something with both great graphics and gameplay then I will defend Playstation.what are you gonna say now? what about the last of us? lol the only thing good about TLOU were its visualsthats it!! im sittin here bein charged for my ps4 online with no fuckin games to playI feel pretty stupid about that

                    I wont be buying either system for a while probably, but I can tell you that there is a 0% chance that I will buy an XBone if Netflix, etc. are locked behind their paywall.  Its just not going to happen, ever, and their attitude towards this type of thing is one of the main reasons there will never be full-scale adoption of the XBone as a generalized family home entertainment/TV/Living Room device.  People who are on the fence or who are not already hardcore committed to the device are not going to sink money into an all-in-one living room device and then have to pay for the subscription as well.  Its completely idiotic to think the general public at large would.

                      Then you wont be buying an Xbone, because those greedy bastards still have the streaming apps locked behind the Gold paywall. Seriously I dunno how they havent been sued over that!

                        I knowits sad.  Honestly, Im about 15 years past being a fanboy of any system or company in video games, but I still love them, and Im still on the wall about which one Ill end up getting.  But yeah, the principle of the matter is that locking paid-for stuff behind the paywall of XBL Gold is something Im just not going to tolerate.  Not for a family home entertainment device.  Same reason I wouldnt buy a Roku if they charged $XX per month to allow their device to allow apps that are already installed just to access the internet.

                       <p>
                        It would be different if there was some iterative reason why connecting X to Y took money over the course of millions of connections throughout their network or somethingbut no, their device just has the app installed and they keep it from accessing the internet if you dont pay them.  Its like the Mafia making shop owners pay them money to just exist on their streets.

                          Thats my philosophy too. Im not loyal to corporations or products because their one and only goal is to make money. Im just a consumer who buys what I believe is the better product. (PS4 for me because all my friends have it and I dont like kinect.)

                    hey there pal.. Sony reached the same 1 million mark in 24 hours that MSFT did, but msft launched to 13 regions at the same time to get there, Sony sold that in just NA
                    <br/>
                    secondly.. after their initial report of Sold-through 1.4 million units, msft has refained from stating the term sold-through in all other figures it has publicized for xbox one sales and this matches with the fact that while MSFT make have shipped over 3 million units, they were sold-through to retailers.. the difference being, that 100% of Sonys figures are consoles sold to the end user, an install base.. while MSFTs figures are 1.4 million sold-through, and the other 1.6+ million are Sold-in (this means it is not installed to a end user, and sits somewhere on a retailers shelf gathering dust)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    now.. about current sales. MSFT remains with the small number of regions to retail in, and the demand in ALL of them is non-existant, even in its home town of the U.S. they are not selling, and retailers are not ordering more units
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    meanwhile, the PS4 is being comfortably sold, as fast as it can be produced, to 53+ countries.. not including one of ITS largest markets.

                    atm ps4 sells in the U.S. against xb1 at more than 2:1, and in all other regions as high as 7:1
                    <br/>
                    fact is, it doubled not only for that month, but doubled the total sales (in terms of install base it is even grater at 1.5m sold-through vs. ps4s 4.2m sold-through)..

                      is it really a argument  if the statement is true? the fact is that Microsoft is only release in 13 countries while Sony is on a constant release in about 4 countries a month, so its not really argument is there

                          While lets see here
                          <br/>
                          Xbox live is a more stable services then psn
                          <br/>
                          Microsoft is delivering more exclusive content for muti-genre. Of entertainment
                          <br/>
                          Xbox one has more new games running at 1080p60fps then the ps4 (forza,FIFA,Nba2k14,madden,powerstar golf,max the curse botherhood,loco cycle,)(ps4 ,resogun,NBA,FIFA,madden,cod)
                          <br/>
                          Has some of the biggest exclusive games hitting it platform this year that PS fanboys are petitioning to get as we speak the is all true. Ps4 has free to play PC  that are 2-3 years old ok that good 85% of all the PS games are ported up from last gen from 2-3 years go like I said even tho both of our statements are true it still doesnt prove anything about sales

                          online stability= more subjective statement if anything.. if its soo stable, how is it losing 1 million users per week? why is it PSN has 5 times as many ACTIVE users? Why if it is soo stable, does a persons xbl account get hacked every 1.6 hours, to include the major high-profile employees? Stable? far from it.. not only that, but dl speeds for media is generally faster (in the U.S.) than XBL.. If its soo stable, then why does halo lag out if there is more than 10 people in a match? why is titanfall beta not even functioning atm.. soo much for those stable dedicated servers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          more exclusive content?? sorry, it comes up short here as well, in terms of games, dlc, movies, music, streaming services, etc..
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          more 1080p games? haha, you must be delusional, not only are there MORE titles in total playable on ps4, but more at 1080p now and going out seriously.. you want to talk about porting games??? 554 of the 360s massive library were original xbox titles emulated porting over?? all but 4 of the games on XB1 are ALL PC games..talk about old games? how are those free games from 2007 doing??? pfft..
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          none of your statements have even come close to the truth.. and it does have something to do with sales. console with the most support gets more customers.. the console with more customers gets more support etc etc.. they arent stupid, publishers will go to where the wallets are most abundant. EA is stabbing their eyeballs out right now having contracted all that timed exclusive content, and respawn/ea are quite miffed about their contract with MSFT over titan fall, seeing now how much more money they would have made had they not excluded the highest selling console world wide (hence, why plans are already in motion for sequels to titanfall that will not be bound by this exclusion contract targeted for the PS4).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          delusions are one thing.. but all of your subjective, wild conjecture are getting you nowhere herekeep chanting the uneducated mantra of an ignorant fanboy all you want, it wont make it true.

                          Yea your clear a fanboy to the fullest. First if you read my comment I didnt say the xboxone had more 1080p60fps games I said it has more 1080p60fps new game no ports, no games that came from PC or last gen console was stated in that statement .second Microsoft isnt losing 1 million xbl player a day are you kidding me . Third you say that 1.6 user a hour are getting hack that hilarious you must be mistaken with Sony because people xbl dont get hack they get scam by guys selling mods which is big difference. Fourth people going into retirement after 30plus years with a company yea there losing high profile employees and final ask yourself a question how many times have the psn been offline ,from hacker, bad updates,servers cashing and maintenance this year along and compare it to xbl being out for 5mins in January lol dude you seriously have some issues  your so in raged by these consoles you cant even think right or read you just reply do some research read people comment before you come off like a trolling fanboy

                          Please at least get your facts right. For 1080p on PS4, you forgot KZ multiplayer, Flower, Injustice Gods Among Us, Trine 2, Flow and Tomb Raider. Sad Xbot

                          Another person who doesnt read the comment before replying. Flower,trine 2 , injustice,tomb raider are all ports i said new games. Killzone runs 1080p 30fps in single player and 1080p 50fps in multiplayer a steady 50 at that does not make  the criteria sorry and I dont understand how Im and xbot as you guys say when hmm. I own and xb1,ps4, and a great gaming PC.

                          The change the hard drive comment is not an issue that either system wins, or maybe MSFT wins by a hair for most consumers by allowing external drives to be used instead of installing a new drive.  Other than that, youre mostly right.

                          external drives work on the ps4, you simply cannot install core components of games to them, they work for movies and music though.. as it should be.. only a tard would install games to an external and play through it
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          secondly, it is a win.. because you can easily swap the ps4 HDD (just like the ps3 AND ps2) for something not only larger, but faster for improved load times (for the few games that have load times).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          this is a massive win.. since last gen msft wanted people to purchase expensive, and small proprietary HDD kits.. this time around they simply eliminated it under the assumption that everything will be done through the power of their cloud (which might come to end if net neutrality comes through)
                         </p>

                        this is the argument, why is it that MS isnt in many of these countries? because the cable services wont work with the xbox1. every country that the two consoles are released, the xbox has been out sold double. i understand people who have the x1 want to defend there purchase, but please understand.sony is just better for gaming.fact!

                  I dont even really see the point in saying too much about the article. Its obvious that certain sites you go on are going to hype up everything about the PS4 probably until the next generation comes out. All this stuff doesnt amount to much with the little time these consoles have been out.

                    it matters, ps4 is selling double the amount that x1 is selling, why do you think that is? hmmm? lets seecheaper system with better hardware=sales, and yes 1080p is being talked about by families that spent 600 on a 1080p flat screen tv.

                  Its time for you X1 guys to quit your banter.  Seems a lot like when HD-DVD officially lost to blu-ray.   All of sudden that camp just basically shutup.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The argument about the territorries is weak.. so in which single territory is X1 selling more in?? Zero.  And its getting outsold at the current rate of 2:1 in the largest territory.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The argument about the games and game sales is weak.. Sony has the largest 1st party developers and they have kept quiet for a reason.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And the argument about X1 selling at a faster rate than 360 is weak.. Well the WiiU sold at a fast rate too.  The point is your spinning stats while ignoring other factors.  360 didnt take off until Gears 1 and when Sony annouced the PS3 is $600.

                  At the end of the day, the dominant factor behind PlayStations better sales is price.  People would have quickly forgotten about the always-connected Internet requirement once they were immersed in a great game, and the best-selling console of all time didnt have graphics as good as its competitors, but it prevailed nonetheless.

                  The PlayStation 4 does have some advantages over the XBOX ONE, but the converse is also true.  In effect, Microsoft has made the same blunder that Sony made in the last generation by pricing themselves too high in the market. But like Sony in the last gen, I fully expect Microsofts console to recover the lost ground over the next six to ten years.

                    no.. the difference is, Sony offered more powerful hardware (that was difficult to honestly code for) and a higher starting price (tbh.. $600 for $10,000 worth of computing power at the time is a deal soo much potential, but the average consumer was pretty clueless about what the original fat boy ps3 really was..))
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    this time around, MSFT has the high price point, while offering inferior hardware that is more difficult to fully utilize..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    MSFT wont recover because unlike last time, its machine has weaker hardware and can never catch up on those terms. It burnt its current customer base, and its thick tome of bad pr stunts, policies and nickle and dime scams thwart any new customer from adopting. It also wont recover simply because the new CEO of MSFT is proposing what many of the board have been wanting for a while now, the selling or ending of the xbox branded label all together as the xbox family has been a loss to MSFT since the original xbox

                  In the end, its far less about the hardware and more about the games. Right now, Sony has the advantage in terms of hardware and price, but despite that, and my strong desire to get a PS4, I ended up going for an Xbox One first. Why? Because despite my love of inFamous and how amazing Second Son looks, Im craving some awesome multiplayer action, and Titanfall fits the bill and then some. This game is more fun than Ive had in multiplayer in a very long time, and it actually has the potential to wipe out much of Sonys lead in hardware sales, if not all of it. Of course, if The Order: 1886 plays half as good as it looks, the reverse will probably be true.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Ultimately, it always comes down to the games. I hope no one regrets any of their hardware purchases, because this generation is already shaping up to be one of the best.

                    I got both consoles, so I can enjoy both companys awesome exclusives. Deciding which one to buy the multiplats for is kinda tough though lol, but Im heavily leaning towards PS4 cause of its superior hardware.

                    You can play Titanfall on PC and 360. Buying a One for that just doesnt make sense. Just think $500 for ONE GAME. Not a smart purchase. Sorry

                      To you perhaps, and thats fine. Im an old school gamer and Im an enthusiast. I have often bought a system for just one game initially. For the Wii U it was Wind Waker HD. For the PS3, it was Uncharted. For the Xbox 360, it was Perfect Dark Zero. For PS4, it will still be inFamous: Second Son. I love video games. I grew up with the Atari 2600 and NES and SMS, and Ive owned every console and portable and I have never once regretted any money Ive spent on purchasing any of those systems. Theyve all earned it back and the some, in the amount I have been entertained by each.

                        You bought a 360 for Perfect Dark Zero? Plus your examples are bad Uncharted and PDZ(LOL) are exclusives. Titanfall is on 360. You have no reason to get a One!

                    .. its actually rooted in hardware.. the device that can do the most will garner more attention by the devs, and the media, thus getting attention from the consumer, whos position on the matter will dictate with their wallets where the publisher will go leading to the end result of PS4 having a greater library than the XB1 it really is cyclic, and will continue to bring more consumers to it rather than the xb1.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    will titanfall boost XB1 sales.. probably not enough to even be noticed in a single store play it on PC, with better resolution, higher frame rates, better effects, etc.
                    <br/>
                    there is a reason Respawn/EA have mentioned already that the future titles in this series will not exclude the PS4.. they like money as much as anybody else

                      I think its way too early to tell at this point. The PS4 certainly is starting out of the gate much better and has the better momentum, but better hardware alone wont win you anything. Im not predicting a winner or loser because this competition has just started. In the end, it still comes down to games, or more importantly the exclusives.

                      We technophiles can point and snicker over the difference between framerates and resolutions between the platforms or how a mid range PC can stomp all over each consoles specs, but most consumers will neither know or care. I think well really have to wait and see. Im still planning on saving up and getting a PS4 in the next month or so, so it wont matter much to me personally, but it should be a helluva ride for ANY gamer regardless of platform.

                    Titanfall 2 will be on the PS4, most likely be better than the original AND have better graphics and performance. Why would you buy an X1 for Titanfall 1?

                    Ive been playing it.. the lighting is fantastic.. but the game itself.. lol.. no way this is the flagship title for xb1.. its terrible. poor graphics, lag, frame stutter, small maps, only a few people max in game (6v6) and they tried way too hard to throw a bunch of stuff to make things seem hectic when they really arent..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    imo.. Mech assault on the og xbox was more fun, and is pretty much the same concept.

                  This article is clearly bias regardless of facts within. However that being said technically Nintendo and Playstation have been the best selling consoles for video games for a very long time. MS has failed to move out of 3rd place in each and every generation! True they might have peaked at #2 with a year lead on Sony last gen, however in the end they lost the race and feel back to 3rd place anyways! For all the talk MS people do you would think they actually won something over Sony before but when you look at the facts in sales they clearly show they are always playing from behind.

                  This is just a testament to how broke people are. I own both consoles, and there is NO reason to purchase the PS4. The X box is superior in everyway. Save an extra $100 and get the xbox. Its worth it.

                  So this is journalism? A SONY exec says theyve doubled sales of all competitors but doesnt give a number and you run a story on what The honor code?

                    can you recall the last time MSFT SHOWED actual sales numbers? when was the last time they actually used the term sold-through? Thats right.. because sold-through numbers essentially stopped at ~1.4 million units for them.. this whole 3 million + sold fiigure is actually the Sold-in total (to retailer, not to the end user..)..

                        no.. picking sides is natural, regardless, it was apparent you are offended about something in this article whos title clearly alludes to it being a one sided piece.. would it not be just as ok to write an article about how great  is when compared to the competition.. would you then go to that article and botch and moan about it? (I doubt you would).. its clear you have sides which Airline to use, which phone is best, etc etc.. sad thing is.. you are a pure fanboy, through and through, and base your favoritism on experience, while having NOT experienced much of the competition to compare.

                       <p>
                        Just because you dont understand the retail terms of sold-through vs. sold-in, and cannot be bothered to have done enough research to either refute or validate the story doesnt mean its wrong.. its not them that is the problem, its you.

                  Um why does everyone keep talking about xbox one and 1080p? Thats not the xbox. Its the gsme developers that decide the resolution. Also I love the talk about the ps4 doubling the xbox one sales in January bit no one knows any sales numbers.  Can you verify that ps4 doubled xbox one?  Where did that info come from? Sony? I would like facts not hype. This is the same talk that jappened when the ps3 came out and that wound up being a brick. Most people just used it for movies after awhile. I still have the day one launch console.

                    the devs have dropped the resolution because they have to, at 1080p the frames per second will drop to below 20, which isnt enough to play a game comfortably so they dropped the res to get the FPS back up

                  They both suck, we are in 2014 now, in the age of almost sci-fi technology  tablets, smart phones, real home automation, computer assisted cars (even self driving cars)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  yet the ps4 cant even play stuff off a USB stick, something i could do on a 15 year old laptop with a 32mb usb drive, that in my eyes is appalling.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then we come to the xboner, the thing cant even keep up with games now and its literally just come out, everyone says just wait until they make games work more efficiently on it but that basically means the game devs have to stop expanding.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For example when GTA: SA came out for the 360, it ran pretty good, nice graphics for its time and good FPS, so instead of the devs having to try and make the game run better, they could make it bigger and better, then 5 years down the line they bring out GTA:V, the map is huge, the graphics are good and the fps is ok (on 360).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  See what im trying to say? by making games more efficient on the xb360 they were able to make huge games. By making games more efficient on the xboner, they have to up the FPS, thus losing the power they need to expand the games and make them better.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They have basically sacrificed quality for performance in the long run, and im not just talking about the xboner, the PS4 is just as bad.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hopefully this will kill the console industry, because as it stands now, consoles are holding games back massively, and have been ever since MS decided against putting a blu-ray in the 360.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  EDIT: just found out the xbone cant play from usb either, what a load of shit

                    play what exactly? games? I would hope not.. games should never be on an external drive.. music? have you tried AAC format?

                    sorry, not really sure what you are mad about, but one thing is clear, you really do not understand either of these platforms, let alone consumer electronics. Stick to following groups of sheople..

                      For a start, you could run a game off a usb3 hdd no problem, secondly I was talking about movies and music and finally, who the hell wants to convert all their high quality music to aac? Iv got a huge music collection and it isnt worth the hassle to convert it all to aac just to play it on the xbone, you shouldnt have to.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Youre right though, I dont fully understand these platforms because I dont own 1, im just going off what Ive read and have come to the decision that theyre not worth the money, I would just get stressed with it cos it doesnt have features it should blatantly have.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I wouldnt say Im mad about it, I just think it sucks how games are being held back by consoles just because the companies that own them wanna make a bit more cash.

                        no.. the instant you mentioned running a game from an external source you have successfully lost any credibility as a gamer, you clearly are not a PC user, and have in general made it clear you have yet to be knowledgeable on the subject at hand.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        while you might get away with playing the original super mario directly from a usb source.. running any modern, high definition game through even the fastest of external connection methods (including usb 3 and thunderbolt) would cause some serious issues, and the game likely wont function..
                        <br/>
                        Games like that need direct read/write through to the storage sector at blazing speeds, and many of which have to be cached in play ask any pc gamer, would they attempt playing bf4 on pc from an external USB drive? the answer will be a resounding NO.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        secondly.. AAC&gt;mp3 in fidelity, its just a fact too bad you also dont understand the differences in media codecs.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        lol.. getting  people like me, who have been in the industry for over 30 years, sales, builds/repair, coding to open our eyes coming from somebody lacking the modicum of knowledge in computer technologies. sigh..
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        the real issue is that you have a BELIEF.. which is founded on the complete absence of fact. open their eyes said the ignorant fool with blinders on

                          Sata 2 is 3gb/s. Usb 3 is 5gb/s. Im not saying I would run a game through usb, I have an ssd for that but it is more than possible.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Im not talking about mp3,  mp3 is bad quality. Its all about lossless (flac and wav) now. Anyway, that isnt the point, the point is you cant play these files and its not worth the hassle to convert everything to do something the console should already do.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          are you seriously trying to tell me that the lack of a bd drive in the 360 didnt halt the gaming industry?
                          <br/>
                          And are you seriously saying consoles are as good as or better than pc?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You clearly have no idea what youre talking about cos you wouldnt be here arguing with me if you did.
                          <br/>
                          Please go and build  a decent pc and you will know how far ahead pcs really are

                         <p>
                          The xbone and ps4 are nowhere near the level of pcs.
                          <br/>
                          anyway thats enough arguing,  iv said what needed to be said, Ill leave it up to you to take some advice from my posts.

                          Consoles have never been up to snuff with PC games. PC games just cant provide all of the other perks that consoles bring to the table.

                          reading comprehension fail much? I never said consoles were as powerful as PC.. nothing of the sort.. I stated that what holds back games is PC itself, as it is a massive field of various hardware powers..

                          Huh? You tell me I cant read then you make up some bullshit about you not saying console are more powerful?
                          <br/>
                          I never said you said consoles were more powerful in fact at what point in my last post did I mention anything to do with power, other than usb3 being fast enough to run games. Its damn obvious that pcs are more powerful, that goes without saying.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          but I get it, you couldnt think of anything to say in response to my last post so you just bend the truth to make it look like you know what your talking about.

                          lol.. youve managed to get lost in your own argument..you are now quite literally fighting yourself.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          and again.. both of you are wrong.. even in  the limiting spec of Sata II, the internal HDD &gt; external sources.. even the fastest of external HDDs, SSDs using 3.0 on the PS4.. WHY??????? because in order to transmit via USB anything, you lose to translation lag between the HDD interface with the coupling of a USB device, on both ends. and furthermore, you have the issue of command queuing, support for extended commands such as TRIM (for SSDs) and for reading SMART data which an external drive, ran via USB cannot do (and especially in the case of the PS4). Again.. sure, you can get away with something simple, but running complex state of the art code (games) will not function properly.

                          If what you are saying is correct, then youve just proven me right when i say the ps4 and xbone suck, because a PC will run most, if not all games from an external HDD. When you play a game on the PC, it just loads everything that needs fast access to the RAM, thats what the RAM is there for, and thats why we have loading screens. Im guessing the PS4 works in a  similar way.
                          <br/>
                          I dont think you are correct though, i havent read that far into it but the 360 runs games straight from a DVD, which is much slower than USB 2, let alone USB 3, most games on PS3/4 can run straight from the blu-ray, which is only slightly faster than USB 2 but still much slower than USB 3, thats without taking into account the spin up times and read errors.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Anyway, thats not my point, as i stated in an earlier post, i was talking about movies and music. or did your reading comprehension fail?

                          Mirimon, you are talking out your butt. There is absolutely no issue running games from an external hard drive. Even a 7200 rpm drive doesnt saturate USB 3.

                          Youre an idiot. USB 3 has an effective data rate 500 MB/s. Thats on par with SATA 3 and crushes SATA 2, which wasnt even being dreamed up 20 years ago. Even the best 7200 rpm hard drives max out around 120 MB/s throughput, and most commercially available SSDs would have plenty of breathing room. Next time school yourself up a bit before posting idiot comments.

                          USB 3.0 is 500 mbit/s not MB/s. Big difference.

                         <p>
                          USB 3.0 is about 120MB/s
                          <br/>
                          Ultra ATA/133 is 133MB/s

                          Ah, no genius, USB 3 is 5 Gbits/sec about 10 times what you posted. USB 2 is roughly 500 mbits/sec. Youre extremely confused. Oh and the XB1 also has ESATA by the way. Have any of you PS4 fanboys considered what it will be like to redownload 500 GB of data after you upgrade the internal hard drive? Sony has already said they will NOT SUPPORT EXTERNAL STORAGE.

                    Since you wanna recall past tech issues, I do recall that the Xbox was the first system to get hacked  back in 2008. Where the online system was down for a little more then 2 weeks. So they dealt with the same problem that Sony had to deal with but sony keep their system safer longer. Also with target just getting hacked among other companys, how is it that because this happens to Sony that they are such a horrible company? And you wanna play with your freedom by giving micro$oft the ability to watch whatever your doing in your house with their kinect? Since you wanna bring up tech stuff, did you know Harvey that mjcro$oft was the company that wrote the prism code for the NSA?? And that micro is in bed with the government? Also they bought Skype and there was just a report saying that the government was watching ppl on Skype as well as your phone messages? So harvey, how do you feel now? P.s. before you come back saying that you dont care if the government is watching u, u have nothing to hide, its the principle of the matter and they should have NO right watching what I am doing in my own house because they think they have the right. Do we have the right to watch what the president does in the white house, DIDNT THINK SO!!!!

                    1. it wasnt a tech issue
                    <br/>
                    2. ps3 was not what was affected
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    you apparently are clueless about what happened.. let me simplify the situation for you, since you are too lazy to be bothered about facts..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Sony, before the hack, had discovered linking evidence to a hacker (s) attempting to do something to the ps3 console functionality itself, they provided evidence and the hacker in question was arrested and sentenced in a court of law. The group Anonymous was wrongfully outraged to have a fellow hacker, breaking the law, get caught for it, and so they targeted Sonys PSN (not the ps3) for an illegal revenge attack. As soon as Sony learned their PSN had been compromised, they shut it down to close the access Anon had used, when reopening Anon used a secondary access point, So. Sony closed PSN again and decided to rebuild its entire network.
                    <br/>
                    Federal investigations into the situation showed a few things.. :
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    While PSN was hacked, USER ACCOUNT INFORMATION was not accessed or even looked at.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Not a SINGLE PERSON lost a SINGLE CENT due to the hack of PSN.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Despite no customers losing data or money, Soy went ahead and offered a 1 year, 1 million dollar coverage for any monetary loss to EVERY PSN ACCOUNT.. (fyi, that was about 128 million accounts at that time). NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON used it, as no money had been stolen nor had their identities. To further compensate users for the disruption of service (thanks to some angry children called anon..) PS+ was free for a time, and Sony additionally offered free games to its users.
                    <br/>
                    Sony was open with the public, they handled it with speed (3 weeks PSN was down to rebuild a new network), and did the prudent thing by covering any losses its customers MIGHT have had (but didnt).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also.. though PSN was down, one could still play several online games and use all other online features like streaming apps and web browsing on the console just fine (because, unlike MSFT, its up to the publishers if a game uses any part of PSN or not)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    conversely, every 1.5 hour another xbl account is hacked (account jumping draining real funds from linked credit cards and stealing other information vital to a persons identity and online footprint, to include the higher up staff of MSFT who has XBL accounts and if that doesnt grind your gears, more hacks occur on user level simply for the sale of cheating online, and then more importantly, major end hacks happened to xbl, shutting it down several times, in 2008, 2009, 2010, etc .. MSFT simply refuses to acknowledge this despite the public being aware of it (they go far enough as to delete any online information claiming this if they can, and use lawyers to enforce this where their IT department cannot).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Thank you for playing look at that ignorant fanboy..

                      No you are apparently  clueless about what happened. You stated NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON used it  I used the credit protection and also lost my personal data. A women tried to purchase a home with my personal data  in Georia. Thats a fact jack and stick your fan boy comment as I own both systems.

                        lol, you are soo full of shit, as it would have been pbulished in the PUBLIC finding and following reports by the FBI, Cyber crimes division as well as Sony the only money coming from it was when a part of the U.K. Government thought they needed to suit Sony for it (at $400k) under the premise of doing it for the people who btw, lost nothing, and who btw, didnt see a dime of it.. having nothing to do with the service in the first place. (also.. that is still in appeal, as it should be, the concept behind their claim is asinine).
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        again, not one single person lost their data or money from that attack by anon
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        NOW if you did lose something at all, it was likely not from the hack by anon but that you were properly phished online, and likely were stupid enough to have a passcode of spot or 12345..  That is a result of your OWN ISSUES.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        go ahead, link something contrary to that, I Dare you, as the FBI would be very interested in such information

                  Titanfall is another fps that is nothing special. bf4 looks and plays better. 6v6 is boring, bots that are stupid and boring, graphics are last gen and no environment destruction. this is what xbox fans have been waiting for?garbage!

                    Titanfall hasnt even been released yet. So how would you know? And i know for a fact a ps fanboy like you didnt play the beta. All you need to do is google titanfall beta and youll see all the rave reviews its getting. They are even saying its better than bf4! And thats just the beta! Wait until it actually comes out in March! Also, xbox one is selling way more games than the ps4 and titanfall hasnt even dropped yet! HA! What exactly are you guys doing with your ps4s? Nothing apparently.

                      doubt it.. its not even able to be played at the moment, and the little time that it was up and running was underwhelming..Steel Battalion on the original xbox was better than this.

                      and what?? xb1 is selling more games than ps4?? haha.. had you stated this first you would have been laughed at then summarily ignored for the rest of your internet life.

                        xbox one is selling many more games than the PS4. Apparently you dont like facts. And as far as the beta, dont take my word for it. Go to all the websites giving previews of playing the beta. Yeah, there are server problems, duh, its the beta. But those playing it are giving it rave reviews. Deal with it!

                          Slashgear.com/ xbox game topped game sales in january. Just one of many unbiased websites reporting that. And they didnt sell just a little more than sony , they blew them out of the water. Sorry bro your little ps fanboy blinders are in the way of facts.

                          first of all, that was reported by MSFT themselves, and is actually a combination of BOTH the 360 and the xb1 software sales the fact is, Tomb Raider alone for the ps4 outsold ALL of the software for the xb1 in January.

                          why has physical software sales dropped 20 percent for Jan 2014? could be because digital (which was not counted) is on the rise, it could also have something to do with many ps4 adopters using that free PS= membership (and those who pay for subscription) getting more than enough games to play to cover for a few months, thus no need to go out and buy games yet. either way.. PS4 outsold both hardware, AND software, not only for Jan 14, but in total since the start of the 8th gen consoles..

                          NPD group data: Xbox netted 47% of software market share in January. Lastly place? HAHAHA! If you consider that last place you got problems. Why are you still here? Shouldnt you be playing Resogun. You know, the only game somewhat decent thats exclusive to PS4. HAHAHA! Looking forward to the Titanfall drop. I bet you that game alone will dramatically pick up one sales. What are you looking forward to on the PS4..nothing?

                          can you not understand where that remainder of the market share goes if you count ALL of the sony platforms? thats 4 platforms too bad Sony differentiates these sales, and MSFT like to fluff numbers and skew things to make it sound better than it is.. again for the last time, thats 360 and xb1 combined.. most all of which came from the 360, NOT the xb1.. again, you lost.. as an xbot I thought you would be accustomed to losing every generation
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          allow me to further draw this out for you in crayon while you are taking bits and pieces of one report out of context, favoring some fluffed up statement from MSFT where they say yeah, we lost, but if you combine the sales on both of our platforms its a lot!..
                          <br/>
                          every week of January 2014, and in total for that month, PS3 was the top selling platform for software, followed by the 360, and then the 3ds and the wii in fourth.. in fact, the PS4 took 7th place, standing over XB1 who sat in 9th place..
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But ok.. Ill play your game, lets go ahead and add the different platforms under MSFTs roof.. but since we are doing that, lets add ALL of Sonys platforms currently selling games for Jan of 2014.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          total number of software sales on all platforms for the month of January-&gt;   ~33.55 Billion
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          total number of sales of MSFT console software for the month of Jan 2014-&gt;  ~8.37 billion
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          total number of sales of Sony console software sales for the month of Jan 2014&gt;  ~13.44 billion
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          so even for that month of Jan, 2014, with combined stats, MSFT was in last place.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          *recap: xb1 sold the least software of all the next gen platforms for Jan 2014 and during the entire 8th generation thus far, losing to the PS4
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          *even when combining all of MSFTs console platforms, it remains in last place for console software sales losing to Sony.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          imo.. you really should stop eating those crayons.

                          Yeah, i get what youre saying fanboy. I was commenting on consoles only. But if you want to bring other platforms into play then its only fair to also look at windows PC games and windows phone games (and i guess actual PCs too) that actually bring in more profit combined than MS consoles and console games. And if you want to take it a step further, at the end of the day Microsoft brings in almost twice the revenue every month than Sony does. So suck on that.

                          I find it amusing and ironic that you say im in middle school. Yet you are the one calling people retarded and talking about drawing pictures in crayons so they can understand. Basically attacking and berating people in a childish manner. Pretty much the behavior id expect from a immature kid in middle school. Good luck with that.

                          you lost kid, get over it. Perhaps next time you wont bind yourself to a brand name and instead simply choose the better product for what it is. Im not the one who gets butthurt about picking the wrong product, and then attempts to PR for MSFT repeating fallacies like some brainless parrot.. hook line and sinker you are a fanatic btw.. why arent you playing titanfail right now? is it because you got tared of trying to work with MSFTs superior online network and dedicated servers ?? or because the game is less than mediocre? (its no flagship title, thats for sure.. better off waiting for the next installment of Halo 343 will likely ruin

                          you stated that the XBOX ONE has sold more games than the ps4, thats a quote.All Im saying is, how can a system sell more games if its not even in the top ten for games sold? and yes if you look further down the page , you will see sales for games and the systems they are sold on. x1 didnt even break the top 10.

                    Im not a FPS player, but Titanfall looks awesome. Youre kidding yourself, really. Ill buy it on release day, and may play it a bit, but my kids are gonna be addicts. The game looks fun as heck. Oh, and you wanna talk graphics, check out Ryse Son Of Rome.

                      youre right, Ryse looks great, but were not talking about Ryse are we?
                      <br/>
                      were talking about a game that has had more awards than any other game at E3, and it wasnt even released yet? and now its out and it looks like that, and plays like every other fps? MS just loves throwing money around to buy reviews dont they..they just got caught for doing it a couple weeks ago, and probably did it in this case.

                        Have you played the game? Its not just another FPS. However, BF4 is. Titanfall is ninja, meets BF4, meets Halo. Most importantly, its really fun, I cant say the same for the tired, recycled game play of BF4. Graphics dont make games fun. You have to start with a fun idea, and add great graphic on to it.

                          bf4 is just one of the best fps games ever made. you shoot a wall it comes down, buildings fall, just the water alone is a work of art. i like seeing devs take the time to use  there art and tech to make a beautiful master piece. game play, bf4 is open and massive, not only in scope but in the detail, which by the way, gives you the feeling that even when youre behind something it can be blown away. running from a tank and hiding behind a wall, doesnt mean youre safeit keeps you on your toes. but i know that a game like titanfall will have its honeymoon, and then the Division will come outwow! now thats going to be ground breaking. i could buy titanfall for my pc but i think ill just play better free2play games like planetside 2 or mech warrior or hawken. 60$ for a last gen gaming experience that can be played on the 360. so if anyone was going to buy the x1to play this lame game, like MS is hoping..just keep your money and buy the game for the 360 or pc. that way MS cant fool you like x1 gamers were. just an ok game, for a crap machine!!!!

                      play bf4, and look at how great it is, the buildings, water ,terrain seemless. amazing game play, with real players fighting..not mostly bots..well no bots ty. jumping from a 40 story building as it falls to the ground is sick! Titanfall? Glade your kids are having fun playing the game. i have been playing fps games since Doom, and i need better for the price. they overly hyped it and i expected to much maybe.

                  Hmmmm? Funny this article has the console numbers for January considering the fact that MS hasnt released their numbers yet. It should also be noted that the PS4 is available in more countries than the one. It would be nice to compare consoles sold country by country. Low PS4 sales during holiday because of stock? HA! Thats a joke. Everyone knows both consoles claim to be low on stock to make people think they HAVE to get one now or they will never find one. LOL. An age old selling tactic. Sony got owned during the holidays, deal with it. And the nail in the coffin for this blatantly anti xbox one article is that the games and software for the one blew PS4 games out of the water. I guess they forgot to include that little tidbit of information. What exactly are people doing with their PS4s?

                  If Infamous Second Son outsells Titanfall its pretty much game over for the Xbox One.  Im not saying it will happen, but it could.  If it does, it will be incredibly indicative of consumer interest and Microsoft will lose some pretty important third party developer allies.

                  I wonder if people have taken into account the price difference of the two systems? Nope? Yeah didnt think so. I dont think it has been taken into account either that unlike Sony, Microsoft stocked up and ensured they had a abundant supply of the Xbox Ones, which is why you can still find them on shelves. Talk to the retailers on when they last got the shipment in. Microsofts doing a better job at keeping stores stocked because they went through what the original Xbox 360 and even the Wii did with the high demand but low supply. Sony didnt however account for this.
                  <br/>
                  Sonys playstation gamers are a loyal bunch and you have to give them that. Of course they will just crap on anything else that gets near their games (be it cookie-cutter or something new and different)  loyalty after all
                  <br/>
                  As always the GAMERs are the ones that win in the console wars. You are provided with different options and not just have to rely on one system. Developers are able to make a killing over the multiple consoles. Quit trying to stir up crap between the different groups.
                  <br/>
                  And bring back SEGA to the console war!!! :)

                    stopped reading when you said something about MSFT stocking up on the xb1 and then shipping, and that being why they are sitting around on retailer shelves..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    oh, you poor fool you
                    <br/>
                    the real reason xb1s are sitting on retailer shelves: they arent selling fact is.. MSFT produced fewer units than Sony did, the initial supply was, on average, 80% less than what Sony shipped, and to boot the demand for the end user to purchase is almost non-existent THAT is why they are sitting on shelves, I should know, 28 of them are collecting dust on mine, and I am pretty sure that like myself, other retailers are not ordering more units..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    again.. MSFT made less units
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    less units were available.., and yet they are still on shelves?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    the demand for the small amount that shipped is not there (aka, nobody buying them).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Its not hard to sell out of day one units when you only ship a few.. and its not hard to have plenty of stock when the customers arent biting..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    given the first 3 sentences in your post are poorly contrived drivel, the remainder doesnt even warrant my attention.
                    <br/>
                    While you may have an opinion, and something to say.. perhaps you should research more and then think clearly before posting

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          first you called me educated (that would be a general compliment) but in that your statement would go over my (an educated person) head???
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          .. perhaps you meant to say something more insulting, like the word uneducated?

                          just saying, if you are going to get childish and throw a tantrum, at least have the decency to that right. Thankfully, your insults are quips are just as thoughtless as your first post.

                          Not really sure what your problem is. I would guess that my initial post somehow hurt your feelings. Even though it wasnt directed at yourself or anybody for that matter
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You already said clear as day that you didnt even read the post past a certain point and instead decided to Troll. That right there itself is childish. However I see that from the other posts youve made here that is just what you are doing.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Maybe you just get off on trolling others. I suppose I could drop to that level and start commenting on your own posts. Such as lack of proper punctuation and capitalization just to name a few.
                          <br/>
                          But I wont. Instead I think I am just going to stop responding to this.

                          It was actually a autocorrect mishap/typo. The phone preferred the word educated over uneducated, and I didnt catch it.

                      I also have to add that so far there have been serious problems with the Xbox hardware. Theyve been so quickly put together and shipped out that theyre horrible quality. My friends controller is already bugging out. PS4s may be harder to find because theyre paying more attention to the quality and not quantity.

                    They are found on store shelves because many have returned them or not buying them. PS4 &gt; Xbox One. research it? but this generation of console belongs to Sony, once God of War 4 drops, they will pull ahead. not to mention Uncharted 4. MS will just revert to their Halo franchise for a quick fix, but not even Halo will help how badly Xbox one was designed, Kinect needs to be optional or watch it tank, sooner rather than later. to think I was a fan of the 360, but after owning 3 different ones that went RRoD (red ring of death) and having a PS3 that never failed once, Ill stay with Sony from now on for consoles. M$ will do better sticking to PC anyway.

                    Logically, doesnt it stand to reason that since Sony sold more units in the US than MS sold, that Sony stocked up at least as much if not more than MS? And since they sold almost 2 million more globally, that they stocked up more globally than MS? Of course it does. Im tired of people claiming that MS just stocked up, when the reality is that they just sold a lot less which makes it easier to keep up with demand.

                    Putting some numbers to it, 2.1 million Xbones have been sold in the US. If there were only 2.1 million people in the US that wanted a PS4, the shelves would be full of PS4s, right now. But there arent. There are 2.4+ million that have wanted to buy a PS4 in the US, since that is how many sold and its still out of stock everywhere. Given that they still teach in elementary school math that 2,400,000 &gt; 2,100,000, I dont get your point about MS doing such a much better job at stocking up than Sony.

                  Microsoft does not realize how much damage they are doing by their greed and rudeness. The whole Windows 8 fiasco, Surface fiasco and now XBox fiasco is the effect of trying to grab as much money as they possibly could from captive audience of Windows community ignoring their voices. They dont realize that backtracking later do very little to restore lost trust. When consumers have a choice, the anger is hardly forgotten and a lot of people are ready to stick it to Microsoft this time.

                  I dont find it surprising. Xbox 360 beat the PS3 because it launched a year earlier, and the major price difference with the PS3. In every other console war, PS has always come out on top. PS2 vs Xbox is not even a contest. Almost 3 times more consoles sold. It killed Sega, and Xbox never really had a chance. Compared to that the 360, only sold a a few million units more. So, I think anyway, that PS will continue to dominate the future. The PS3 was just a tiny blip.

                  Besides, its hard to imagine MS being no1 in any thing other than desktop PCs.

                    Even with that year jump start and price differential, the PS3 still caught up with Microsoft.

                   <p>
                    Mostly due to the fact that Microsoft has been Wheezing these last three years.  There have been no good exclusives.

                  i wonder how much of a bump titanfall will give xboxone, because people who are amped about it, all seem to already have their xboxone. its not like the price of the console wont still be $499 when titanfall releases. so what is the advantage to waiting till then to get it? the only thing i can see that would be worth waiting for would be the special titanfall skin. but again, i wonder how many who might want that dont already have their xboxone by now?
