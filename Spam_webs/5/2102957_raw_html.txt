        Not true: the capital city of the Netherlands is Amsterdam
(although the government is located in The Hague or Den Haag).
        <br/>
        Copenhagen is the capital city of Denmark, located some 800 kilometers away from the
Netherlands to the east north-east. For some strange reason especially Americans tend to
think that it's the capital of Holland. The reason for this misconception I didn't find so
far. Suggestions are welcome!.

        This is partly true: about one third (33 percent) of the
country is below sealevel: big dikes keep the seawater where it is supposed to be:
outside. Also sluices and waterpumps get rid of the excess water coming in through rain
and rivers. Since the sea water level during low tide is a bit below the water level at
the coastline most water can just be spilled during some hours. During heavy rainfall
periods big pumps have to assist these sluices. Before the electrical pumps were available
man used windmills to get the water out. Also most of the reclaimed land was claimed by
just pumping the water out for years. The current airport near Amsterdam called Schiphol
Airport is in the middle of a former big lake. In general the altitude varies from minus
seven meters to minus one meters from sea level. So imagine what happens if someone
forgets to close the gates in time: wet feet at the least, drowning for millions.

        Also large portions of the current country used to be sea:
Flevoland (the 12th provence, since 1985
        <font color="#FF0000">
         ?
        </font>
        ) is reclaimed from
sea and mostly 8 metres below sealevel. Of the total country about 10-30 percent is
reclaimed land, depending on the definitions. Two-third of the country would be wet every
spring-tide if man hadn't been around here and put lengthy dikes in.

        Not true: although Holland is internationally famous as the
country of wind mills and cloggies (wooden shoes), most windmills were teared down 
in the 18th and 19th century. Only some 1000 were saved, mostly for economical reasons.
From the 19th century onwards the belief in preserving history saved the remaining wind
mills. One of those is located less than a mile away from my home. Mostly it's a beacon of
history (tours are available), but also some grain is still beeing grinded here for making
some bread, but just for old-times sake.
        <br/>
        Some people do live in these windmills but it's not the general way to live in wind mills
only.

       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        And about the wooded shoes: in the old days lots of people
walked on these cloggies, since they were cheaper than leather shoes, much warmer, safe to
wear (keeping your toes from being flattened) and easy to clean. Nowadays just some people
still use them, especially while working in gardens, roadwork etcetera etcetera. These
cloggies are mostly black, blue or unpainted. The ones you normally buy in tourist shops
are mostly lacquered and yellow. The small tourist versions are more expensive compared to
the real ones. Real ones in the right shop you can buy for about 12 euros and up.

        Since English is taught at primary school starting at 10
years of age it is save to say that almost everybody has knowledge of the language. Most
schoolchildren will get English classes upto the moment they leave school. And of course:
if you don't use it, you'll loose it. But both English/American spoken movies and
TV-series keep up the language for most people. And most regions get a lot of tourists, so
English could be considered to be the third language of the country. Third? Yes, in the
north people also speak a language, different from the Dutch language: Friesian (also
written as 'Frisian'), called 'Fries' in Dutch and 'Frysk' in the Fri(e)sian language.

        True: besides English (starting nowadays around the age of
10) most people will get German and French classes. Although the ability is more like a
basic skill in the case of French, about 60 percent of the people speak four languages.
The people in the north even five (Frisian). Multi-language ability is a must for most
tourist-related and sales-related work, so anyone working in a bank, restaurant or any
kind of desk is bound to speak a language you may be able to speak. This is a major
difference with a country like Germany, where more tourists are likely to speak German, so
the need for foreign language is not so big over there. Also they dub all American series
and movies with strange German noise, where Holland subtitles them and keeps the original
sound. So picking some English up is easier for Dutch people. And the original sound of
series and movies helps you when watching TV or going to a movie..... only remember since
people are expected to read the subtitles Dutch people sometimes do not remain silent
during series (you can read the text, can't you!).

        The Frisian language by the way can also be found in parts of the north of Germany
(Ost-Friesland and Nord-Friesland), altogether spoken by some 3 million people in totally
15 different dialects. The Frisian language is related to the Angel-Saksian language
family like English:

        Mostly true, although dependent on your definition of

be found in most larger cities. And since this kind of tolerance always seems to
concentrate in the capitol cities, Amsterdam is no exception: two large red-light
districts offer all kinds of business: peep-shows, stage shows, window-shopping,
streetsales etcetera etcetera.

of the smoke-cafes or just buy some in the shop and take it home. Only harddrugs (heroin,
coke/cocaine) are illegal, but possession for just personal use is tolerated in most
cases.

        NEW: Heard this one lately? Drug trafficers spotted on Schiphol Airport
(Amsterdam) with less than 2 kilos of cocaine were released the same day in the end of
2001. Not even their pasport were taken in. This was because at the airport there are not
enough cells to hold them all. BUT: did you know they got a receipt from the Custom
officers stating their drugs were seized, so they could prove to their bosses they were
captured and did not steal the drugs themselves.

since the stuff is readily available in cofeeshops the excitement of doing

cases. Originally it is just one of the seven (nowadays twelve!) provinces that joint to
become the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Netherlands means 'lowlands', since big parts

        When looking at the map of the world it is pretty hard to
find the Netherlands. Even the map of Europe reserves only a few square millimeters for
this country. Probably that's why people from other continents sometimes misjudge one
aspect: they ask for instance whether you know their son in Frankfurt. Last time I checked
Frankfurt was in Germany by the way (probably fed by the confusion of Dutch=language of
the Netherlands and Deutsch=German for German) and located about 400 kilometers away.

        Although the country the Netherlands is very small people
tend to forget it's one of the highest populated countries of the world. Just imagine half
of the population of Canada (1999: 30 million) living in a region of 100 by 300 kilometers
(not even the size of the province of Ontario). The Netherlands is almost as as twice the
state of New Jersey, with 16 million people living here. It is quite hard to find a place
where you don't come across another town: driving on a road the nearest town is at most
some 10 or 15 minutes away. Taking your car on a quiet Sunday morning you can drive in
three to four hours from end to the other. From my village in the north it takes three
hours driving to reach Belgium and only 1.5 hours to drive to Germany. In about five hours
you will have reached the border between Denmark and Germany, of the border between
Belgium and France. Seven hours of driving will bring you to Poland, sisteem hours to Spain
or Italy to complete the picture.

        Well, though open for discussion (as everything seems to
be in Holland)I think the remark is TRUE. A certain Steve O from the
Jackass TV series came to Holland in March 2003 trying to fight censorship. He
wanted to start off in Holland and went straight from the airport to one of the
many coffeshops and made a selection of the grass offered there and smoked some.
After this he went to the TVshow he was invited to (Kevin Masters) and appeared
clearly stoned on screen (which is OK), to talk about their film (with stuff
that could not be shown on MTV).
       </font>
      </p>
      <p>
       <font face="Arial">
        He tried to get censored when he turned around and started
dropping his pants to show his butt. The host encouraged him to do that, since
it is allowed on Dutch TV. Steve was a bit disappointed and offered to use a
stun-gun on his private parts, but was pursuaded to just staple his ballsack to
his left leg. The TVshow was broadcasted without any censorship (it was not
live) and no trouble. Finally Steve O admitted he might have started off in the
wrong country in his crusade against censors.....

        Some thirtyfive years ago the first completely naked lady
appeared on Dutch public TV. Twentyfive years ago Sjef van Oekel appeared in his
series about a peepshow, with all action filmed and brought to you by PBS.
Visiting people from Canada, USA and UK have literally stated: this must
something like pay-TV or the Playboy channel, while watching 'normal'
commercials with naked ladies and sometimes males at seven nights...... Only
Danish TV appears to do a bit more (not worse!), like one commercial where males
and females in a sauna are pictured (no towels) and a guy is peeping to the
female department, later on resting the newspaper that covers all on a bodily
part.

        Together with the liberal attitude towards softdrugs and
easy policy towards harddrug users (NOT to harddrug industry), free drinking of
alcohol on streets and in cars (although limited in some areas; though
drink&amp;drive is prosecuted), free speech of mind, free flag burning if you
like (please use a non-toxic fabric), liberty seems to be one of the things
people of Holland have plenty of. BUT we have a lot of laws, in some areas way
to much, for almost every area of activity. Try opening a cafe and you will
drown in all the rules you have to follow.....

        The Netherlands were very active on the world seas during
the 16th, 17th and 18th century: with a fleet of merchant ships, a big fleet of war ships
the country went to war several times to 'protect' the economic interests. With England
there have been several major battles. Also with the Portuguese and Spanish navy, mostly
in the Far East for control over the different locations over there.

        Decades the Dutch were the only ones allowed to trade with

periods and many Africans died or were captured, transported and sold as slaves all over

        Well, when we consider the population of the
Netherlands is about half the size of Canada, at one time the Dutch empire was
from South America through the Carribean, north to New-Amsterdam (now New York),
down again to South Africa, followed by parts of Australia, back north to
Indonesia one could be tempted to think this small country had it's influence in
the world one day.

        Even nowadays some influence can still be seen: a
lot of Russian nautical names are still Dutch words, a lot of countries have a
flag nowadays that was derived from the Dutch flag. Around 1572 the Dutch 'Orangen'
flag was the first bannered flag. This bannered flag was originally
orange-white-blue. Later on the orange banner was converted to a red
banner.

      </p>
      <p>
       <font face="Arial" size="3">
        The current French flag was designed during the
French Revolution (1789) from the Dutch design. The French probably were lying
on their sides, since the have put the banners vertically. The Russian flag was
assigned by Czar Peter the Great in 1697, after many visits to Holland, where he
learned much about boatbuilding and sailing. The former Yugoslavic countries
also adapted this style of flag. The South African flag was the same as the
original Dutch flag until 1944, ever since 1652, with additions of the Orange-Freestate,
Transvaal and Great Brittain in the white banner, representing the four areas
united in the south African republic. And closer to our home: Luxembourg also
uses the same style of flag, with the blue being a slight lighter color, as a
memory to the time Luxembourg was also ruled by the Dutch kings. Only when no
king was available, the Queen of Holland was not allowed to rules over
Luxembourg, according to the Luxembourg laws.

        Nowadays the Netherlands are participating in
different peace-keeping operations through-out the world and has done so for
many years. Together with some other small countries this has been a
contribution to the world community. Not always in success, like in Bosnia
though. But still politicians are always on the look-out where a contribution is
needed, either in back-fill operations or in operations in the operating
theaters of the world.

          The Dutch were probably the worst slave
    traders in the 1700 and 1800 hundreds. Traders by birth they bought African
    prisoners from African people (most were captured and sold off als slaves by
    fellow Africans) and shipped them to the new world. The Dutch were very
    rough on the slaves and made big prfits on them, not shy from some loss :(

          The world XTC production is for more than 55
    percent based in the Netherlands. Estimates from drug fighting agencies is
    that of all XTC found in the USA more than 70 percent has come from the
    Netherlands. Probable causes of this, is perhaps the lenient punishments for
    fabrication and sale of these harddrugs (XTC = HARDDRUG!), especially
    compared to other countries. Only nowadays the extradiction of suspects to
    countries like the USA seem to scare some production facilities away again.
