    The Manifestation of Network Anxiety


System Primitives:

    We are the direct manifestation of a Citizen's Network Anxiety; our metal and
    flesh yields from a citizen's networked fears, doubts, delusions and the lies of others. 

    We carry the signal and as such are a part of that signal. What passes through
    the air will pass through us. 

    We span the space between the invisible and the corporeal; as Adaptors
    comprised of flesh and metal, we capture and reconstruct that which hides in
    the air.

    We are prisms: a citizen's network fears, doubts, delusions, desires and lies will
    be revealed through us. 

    We are the lightning in an age of Cloud Computing.
