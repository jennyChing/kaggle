         What you need to do to prepare for Oregon legalization

       <p style="text-align: left">
        Oregons recreational cannabis industry is finally on the fast track. The OLCC recently convened its rulemaking committees and HB 3400 (which implements Measure 91) appears primed to sail through the legislature.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        On January 4, 2016, the OLCC will begin accepting license applications for commercial growers, processors, wholesalers and retailers. Thats everyone. With only six months to go, its time to get organized. Here are five basic steps all industry players should take to prepare.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <strong>
         1. Get Your Team Together.
        </strong>
        As in any industry, the most successful entrepreneurs will be those with the best business advisers. Almost certainly, you will need representation from at least two professions before operations begin: accounting and law. Other business advisers,
        <em>
         e.g.
        </em>
        realtor, brand adviser, security advisor, banker and insurance agent, may also be crucial in making your business go.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        There may be some overlap in the services these professionals will provide. For example, though a CPA probably will not help you file a permit application with the OLCC, either a CPA or attorney can help you file required tax identification documents. Getting your team together early, and keeping everyone on the same page, will help ensure success.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <strong>
         2. Register Your Business.
        </strong>
        Register your business with the Oregon Secretary of State and get your corporate documents in place for the application process. With the expected avalanche of license applications, the OLCC can afford to be particular about thebusiness documentation it will require (operating agreements, bylaws, stock certificates, etc.), and which businesses will ultimately get the green light.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <strong>
         3. Get a Location Location. Location.
        </strong>
        As already shown by the 2014 roll out of Oregons medical marijuana program, storefront locations will be highly coveted and highly regulated. The famous 1,000 foot rule that applies to medical dispensaries will almost certainly apply to recreational storefronts as well. High visibility corridors will be coveted. Growers, distributors and wholesalers will be fighting for space, too. With a flood of entrants into the market, locking down good space early is critical, especially in the western part of the state.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <strong>
         4. Protect Your Business and Your Brand.
        </strong>
        Wholesalers, distributors and retailers will have proprietary information to protect from employee disclosure. A grower may have trade secrets that constitute its most valuable assets.
        <em>
         All
        </em>
        businesses will have employees with the capacity to become competitors overnight, unless the appropriate non-competes are in place. For more on this, check out
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/protecting-trade-secrets-in-the-marijuana-industry/">
         Protecting Trade Secrets in the Marijuana Industry
        </a>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        And everyone has a brand.Branding will boost the most successful businesses to the forefront. While registering marijuana trademarks is still not happening at the federal level, state registration is key in establishing early rights. Savvy players will consider registration of auxiliary trademarks in D.C., as well. For more information on this, check out

       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <strong>
         5. Learn About and Track New and Changing (State and Local) Rules.
        </strong>
        As mentioned above, the OLCC recently convened committees to write rules for Measure 91 implementation, including for growers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers. You can track the progress

        </a>
        (and HB 3400,

        ). In addition, counties and cities will have their own zoning, licensing and permitting laws. Keep a close watch on what is going on in your local jurisdiction. For more on this, check out

       <p style="text-align: left">

        So, you want to start a marijuana delivery service? Not so fast. What you want to do may or may not be legal in your state.
       </p>
       <p>
        State law varies significantly on the issue of cannabis delivery. Lawmakers have made cannabis delivery businesses illegal in some states, usually to avoid coming up against
        <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2015/01/the-feds-are-blunting-legal-marijuana-in-america/" target="_blank">
         federal enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo
        </a>
        by preventing cannabis deliveries that may be diverted out of state. However, some states allow cannabis deliveries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The below is a quick rundown on where Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington stand with respect to the legality of cannabis deliveries.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Alaska:
        </strong>
        Alaska legalized recreational cannabisin February 2015 but licenses for recreational shops will not be issued until sometime in 2016. When the Alaska market is up and running, you should expect to see delivery services right away as they are allowed under the new laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alaska previously banned MMJ deliveries outright, but the state has taken a different approach with recreational cannabis. The law that legalized marijuana in Alaska, Ballot Measure 2, expressly calls for delivering, distributing, or selling marijuana or marijuana products to consumers. One of the reasons Alaska legalized deliveries is because it has so many outposts where there may be no local source of supply.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         California:
        </strong>
        California has not directly addressed the delivery of MMJ at the state level. Instead, counties and cities decide whether to allow delivery, resultingin a patchwork of local regulations around the state. Los Angeles, one of the largest cannabis markets in the nation, may allow for delivery, but it is unclear.
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/los-angeles-marijuana-the-uphill-battle-of-proposition-d/" target="_blank">
         Proposition D
        </a>
        , seems to allow for the issuance ofMMJ licenses tovehicles, which suggests that delivery services are allowed. However, Proposition Dalso restricts licenses only to MMJ businesses that were licensed in 2007 and, at that time, no delivery services were actually licensed. Despite that ambiguity, businesses may want to steer clear as the L.A. City attorney has made it a priority to
        <a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/12/02/402-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-in-los-angeles-shut-down/" target="_blank">
         shut down
        </a>
        at least one major marijuana delivery app.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Colorado:
        </strong>
        Colorado prohibits delivery of recreational cannabis, but MMJ deliveries areallowed so long as they are not done for profit.Only a patients primary caregiver can make a delivery.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Illinois:
        </strong>
        Illinois allows delivery by a patients primary caregiver, but otherwise prohibits cannabis deliveries.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Nevada:
        </strong>
        Nevada permits the delivery of cannabis from a retail Medical Marijuana Establishment to [a]person who holds a valid registry identification card or his or her designated primary caregiver. The delivery process is
        <a href="http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/nevada-adopted-regulations-1-april-2014.pdf" target="_blank">
         heavily regulated
        </a>
        to ensure that product is not diverted while in transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Oregon:
        </strong>
        Oregons MMJ rules prohibit cannabis deliveries, but Measure 91 (the initiative that legalizes recreational cannabis) states that deliveries may be made by the marijuana retailer to consumers pursuant tobona fide orders received on the licensed premises prior to delivery. We read this to mean that if a consumer places its order in a retail store, an order can be delivered to the consumer at another location. If this portion of the measure stands, it would seem that a consumer could go to his or her favorite marijuana retailer and place a standing order for X quantity of Y strain to be delivered every Tuesday for the next year. It would even seem that this same consumer might be able to call, text message, or communicate via an app to the retailer to adjust their standing order. We fully expect the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to expand on and fully define marijuana deliveries as a result of its upcoming rule-making process.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Washington:
        </strong>
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/marijuana-delivery-is-illegal-in-washington/" target="_blank">
         Cannabis deliveries are illegal in Washington
        </a>
        , and this holds true for both medical and recreational marijuana. The State Senate recently passed
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/washington-state-overhauls-its-medical-marijuana-system/" target="_blank">
         Senate Bill 5052
        </a>
        , which overhauls the States current medical marijuana laws (which laws formerly allowed for delivery). Despite massive changes in state law,the delivery of all cannabis is now illegal.

        There has been movement on the decriminalization front in various states in 2015, with a number of bills advancing through several state legislatures in recent weeks. Lets take a look at some of the developments.
       </p>

        In
        <strong>
         Illinois
        </strong>
        , a cannabis decriminalization bill is on

         Governor Rauners desk
        </a>
        awaiting his signature. HB218 is significant for several reasons. First of all, the proposed law would make up to 15 grams of cannabis possession a civil infraction that carries a fine of $125. Secondly, and this is a unique feature of the law, the bill allows for civil offenses to be automatically expunged from a persons record so as to prevent any criminal history. Drug convictions make it difficult for individuals to obtain employment. Finally, the bill would establish a threshold of
        <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150602/news/150609698/" target="_blank">
         15 nanograms of THC
        </a>
        in a drivers blood to be considered impaired and driving under the influence. Governor Rauner has 60 days after the bill being presented to him to sign or veto it.

         SB241
        </a>
        , which does not eliminate but significantly reduces the criminal penalties for minor cannabis possession. First time offenders possessing less than 14 grams would be sentenced to no more than 15 days in jail. As it stands now, the maximum sentence is six months. Louisiana has notoriously stiff marijuana possession penalties and even if the new law is adopted, Louisianas penalties for marijuana possession would be

         eight times higher

        than surrounding states. The bill is currently in a House committee.

        Any hopes for decriminalizing cannabis in
        <strong>
         Texas
        </strong>
        went up in smoke at the end of May. HB507 would have made possession of up to one ounce of marijuana a civil infraction, not a Class B misdemeanor. The bill died in committee after it was never scheduled for a floor debate. The Texas General Assembly meets only once every two years, so there wont be a chance for a legislative decriminalization measure until 2017 at the earliest. In a related story, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill on Monday, to significant fanfare characterized as a

        In
        <strong>
         Maryland
        </strong>
        , Governor Larry Hogan recently vetoed a law that would have corrected a defect in the decriminalization law adopted in 2014. As of October 1, 2014, possession of up to 10 grams of marijuana in Maryland is subject to a civil fine of $100 for a first offense rather than criminal penalties. However, the possession of drug paraphernalia was and still is a criminal offense. Therefore, technically one may be arrested and prosecuted for the possession of rolling papers when smoking a joint, but the marijuana inside the rolling paper is subject to a civil fine. SB517 not only would have decriminalized the possession of drug paraphernalia, it would have also made the public consumption of marijuana a civil offense punishable by a fine of up to $500. Governor Hogans explanation for the veto was somewhat bizarre, claiming

         Missouri
        </strong>
        Governor Jay Nixon allowed
        <a href="https://legiscan.com/MO/text/SB491/id/1014946/Missouri-2014-SB491-Enrolled.pdf" target="_blank">
         Senate Bill 491
        </a>
        to enter into force on May 5 without his signature. Buried deep in this new law, an omnibus crime bill, are two changes in Missouris marijuana laws. The first change eliminates jail time for a first-time offense of under 10 grams of marijuana. It would be a stretch, however, to call this decriminalization since one may still be arrested and have a criminal record if caught with less than 10 grams of pot. The second change will end sentences with mandatory no parole or probation for a third felony marijuana conviction. As many as 100,000 people in the United States are serving
        <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/life-sentence-for-marijuana_n_3403504.html" target="_blank">
         prison sentences
        </a>
        for only the possession of marijuana.
       </p>
       <p>
        And finally,
        <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/06/18/marijuana-decriminalization-bill-okd-delaware/28955055/" target="_blank">
         <strong>
          Delaware
         </strong>
        </a>
        decriminalized possession of up to one ounce of marijuana last week. On June 18, the Delaware Senate passed a bill to make possession of up to an ounce subject to a civil fine of $100 and Governor Jack Markell signed the bill into law the same day. The law will enter into force six months from the date of the governors signature. Of note was the fact that voting on the bill in the Delaware Senate was exactly along party lines.
       </p>
       <p>
        By and large, these bills are long overdue. There is simply no rational basis for putting anyone in jail for cannabis possession, and we applaud the states that have taken strides towards ending drug prohibition.

        Oregons House-Senate marijuana committee unanimously approved
        <a href="http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2015/HB3400/" target="_blank">
         House Bill 3400
        </a>
        , a significant milestone in regulation of the commercial cannabis market.
       </p>
       <p>
        HB 3400 was approved after weeks of wrangling in the legislature. A primary sticking point was whether cities and counties would be allowed to ban pot sales (both medical and recreational) in their communities. Unfortunately for eastern Oregon advocates, the answer in those counties is yes.
       </p>
       <p>
        <img alt="" class=" wp-image-8829 alignright" height="297" src="http://www.cannalawblog.com/files/2015/06/high-desert-eastern-oregon-640x450.jpg" width="422"/>
        Specifically, HB 3400 allows local governments in Oregon to ban marijuana sales in counties where at least 55 percent of voters opposed Measure 91 for marijuana legalization in 2014. A total of 15 counties showed that level of opposition, all of them East of the Cascades. So, although recreational marijuana will be legal on July 1, 2015 in all Oregon counties, selling marijuana may be restricted in the eastern part(s) of our State.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thats not to say that recreational marijuana storefronts will be opening soon anywhere in Oregon. Measure 91 placed the production and sale of recreational marijuana under the control of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), which will write the rules on Measure 91. Probably because the OLCC is charged with this task, HB 3400 grants the OLCC discretion to peg the actual start date for recreational sales, as well. The commission, in turn, estimates that it wont license retailers to open until the latter half of 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now that HB 3400 has been approved by the joint committee, it must be passed by the House and Senate at large, and signed by Governor Kate Brown. In the interim, legislators say they will debate separate legislation that would allow temporary sales to recreational users. The sales would be made from medical marijuana dispensaries.Although possession becomes legal on July 1, a temporary sales program would not start before October  and consumers may have to wait until OLCC-licensed retailers open more than a year from now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Going forward, HB 3400 grants the OLCC broad police powers to monitor and investigate the industry. HB 3400 also gives a large role to the Oregon Health Authority, which currently administers Oregons Medical Marijuana Dispensary Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, HB 3400 is omnibus in scope, and covers the following: marijuana production (including a seed to sale tracking system, to curb diversions to the black market), product regulations (labeling and testing), residency requirements for marijuana business owners (two years for owners, none for investors), crime sentences (generally reduced), advertising (not allowed to appeal to minors, promote excessive use, or endanger safety), marijuana workers (whistleblower protections; right to organize). It also creates a tax force to promote energy efficiency and minimize water use.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notably, the joint committee has not yet passed a companion measure,
        <a href="http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2015/HB2041/" target="_blank">
         House Bill 2041
        </a>
        , which creates a new point of sale tax of an estimated 17 percent on marijuana products at retail. However, HB 3400 allows localities to levy a local tax of as much as 3 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will continue to update as HB 3400 moves through the legislature. Although recreational sales are still a ways out, savvy industry players already have begun to lay the groundwork for success in Oregons recreational market and would be wise to track this bill moving forward.

       <p>
        One of the things we are always stressing is how legalization just makes sense, for the following reasons, among others:
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        1. Prohibition is not working; it is a waste of money.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        2. Incarceratingpeople in some states for cannabis while allowing people in other states tosell and use it is unfair.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        3. Jailing people for cannabisgives them an education in crime and a criminal record, which makes it harder for them to make it in the non-criminal world. These things increase crime, not reduce it.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        4. Enforcement of our cannabis laws is so unfair and uneven that it has become the poster child for bad police and a bad legal system and that weakens our entire system. Again, lawyers love this argument for legalizing. See
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/marijuana-and-racism-bearing-the-blunt-of-the-problem/" target="_blank">
         Marijuana And Racism: Bearing The Blunt Of The Problem
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        5. Explain to us  using logic  why alcohol is legal (and it should be) but marijuana is not.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        6. Why when cannabis is so clearly safe should the government get to decide who uses it, rather than the individual? See
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/they-said-it-on-marijuana-quotable-saturday-part-lxiii/" target="_blank">
         They Said It On Marijuana, Quotable Saturday, Part LXIII
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        7. If you want to keep pot out of the hands of children,

         legalization and regulation is how to do it
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        8. If people are going to use cannabis anyway, and they are, should it not be taxed like any other product?
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        9. If people are going to use cannabis anyway, and they are, should it not be regulated for things like pesticides, just like any other farm product?
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/is-your-pot-safe-marijuana-pesticide-testing-standards/" target="_blank">
         SeeIs Your Pot Safe? Dont Be So Sure.
        </a>
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        10. Who would you prefer to profit from cannabis, American business owners or foreign drug cartels which then use their cannabis profits to expand their criminal empire?

       <p>
        We could go on and on.
       </p>
       <p>
        But then too there are the compassionate arguments:
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        1. Why prevent the sick from access to a safe medicine that alleviates their symptoms?
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        2. Why

        3. Why make criminals of 90 year olds who use cannabis to stimulate their appetite in their dying days?
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        4. Why

       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        5. Why allow for the firing of a disabled personwho was very much an able employeesimply because he consumed cannabis (for medicine) during his off hours? See

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Politicians of all stripes are starting to ask these same questions and the other day, one of them in one sentence summed up beautifully the absurdity and the immorality and the inefficiency of criminalizing cannabis. GOP Representative Allen Peake of Macon, Georgia, who sponsored Georgias legalization bill (for certain medical uses) stated the following after it finally passed:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         We can now begin the highly anticipated process of bringing our medical refugees back home to Georgia.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        What a great quote. In one simple sentence it seems to say the following:
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        1. Why the hell did we let good people leave our state when all they wanted was to treat their own or some family member or friends medical condition? Compassion.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        2. Why the hell did we let good people leave our state when it should be our goal to keep ourgood people? Common sense. Economics.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        3. Why the hell did we as a government intrude so deeply into peoples lives? Common sense.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        4. Why the hell did we as a government fight against the legitimate aspirations of our own people. Common sense. Civil liberties.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        5. These are our people. Government is supposed to protect its people, not send them into exile. Common sense. Compassion.
       </p>
       <p style="padding-left: 30px">
        5. Can we please stop letting reefer madness make us do really stupid things? Common sense.
       </p>
       <p>
        This unadorned quote from a little known politician in the heart of Georgia ranks as one of our all time favorites. Common sense. And compassion. Pass it on
       </p>

       <p>
        A number of state legislative sessions recently adjourned leaving several new cannabis bills awaiting governors signatures. Two states in particular
        <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/04/legalized_medical_marijuana_so.html" target="_blank">
         Louisiana
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://houston.suntimes.com/hou-news/hou-politics-government/7/76/136390/texas-governor-signs-marijuana-law/" target="_blank">
         Texas
        </a>
        made moves towards legalizing cannabis. Their bills have a lot in common. They are highly restrictive, CBD only, and allow access for a very limited number of conditions. Most importantly, they suffer from the same fatal flawthey require doctors issue prescriptions for medical cannabis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is this important? The difference between a prescription and a certification or recommendation may seem to be mere semantics. After all, they function in basically the same wayin both instances the doctors signature serves as a barrier between the patient and his or her medicine. Setting aside whether this should even be the case for cannabis, however, there is an important distinction between prescribing and certifying medical cannabis that seems to have escaped these legislators attention. In the end, this may spell big trouble for their new medical cannabis programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The prescription-certification distinction stems from the landmark Ninth Circuit case
        <a href="http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/conantvwalters.pdf" target="_blank">
         <em>
          Conant v. Walters
         </em>
        </a>
        . In this case, groups of California doctors and patients filed a class action lawsuit against the federal government, which was threatening to revoke doctors DEA controlled substances licenses for having recommend cannabis to their patients. The court held, among other things, that a physicians recommendation to use medical cannabis can constitute protected First Amendment speech and it blocked the DEA from revoking these doctors controlled substances licenses
        <em>
         solely
        </em>
        because theywere
        <em>
         recommending
        </em>
        cannabis. The Federal government could, however, revoke doctors DEA licenses if they actually sold the patient cannabis or broke other federal laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        So why is this such a big deal for Texas and Louisiana?
        <strong>
         Because getting doctors to issue prescriptions, instead of recommendations or certifications, will be infinitely more difficult.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        States like Illinois are having a hard enough time getting doctors to write patient certifications. Many Illinois doctors are reluctant even to recommend cannabis for fear that if they do sothe federal government will revoke their DEA controlled substances licenses, which for many would cripple their practices. Requiring
        <em>
         prescriptions
        </em>
        for cannabis actually increases the chance physicians will encounter federal interference because they cannot legally prescribe any Schedule I drug. This gives the federal government potential regulatory leverage against doctors and legitimizes their fears that the DEA could come knocking at their doors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ideally, state cannabis laws should strive to insulate, not expose, market participants from federal interference risk, and this is especially the case in states where the reefer madness mentality still runs strong. Though
        <em>
         Conant
        </em>
        applies in only the Ninth Circuit (
        <a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/images/CircuitMap_01.jpg" target="_blank">
         in this circuit
        </a>
        , 10 of its 11 states have legalized cannabis in some form), there is no benefit in deviating from its guidance. In other words, it makes sense for both the state laws and the doctors to talk of recommending cannabis not prescribing it. The legal lines is in some way reflected in all state cannabis laws passed in the 13 years since
        <em>
         Conat
        </em>
        was decided. Until now.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of cannabis legalization groups raised concerns with Texas and Louisiana lawmakers regarding prescribing cannabis, but theyfell on deaf ears. These arent as much drafting errors as they are policy judgmentlawmakers had the chance to avoid this complication but chose not to do so, whether out of negligence, ignorance, political expedience, or some combination of the three. In the end, this oversight will frustrate patient access to medicine and undermine these bills ostensible purposes. We commend these states for passing these laws, but they need to be fixedto have any chance of getting off the ground.

         Figuring out what to do with Oregon wholesale cannabis will not be a day at the (Oregon) beach.

       </div>
       <p>
        Oregons stand-alone license concept for marijuana wholesalers is brand new to the world of legal cannabis. Unlike other states, Oregon provides forfour separate license types: grower, processor,
        <em>
         wholesaler
        </em>
        and retailer. Oregons Measure 91 expressly allows for vertical integration, meaning that a company maypossess a license for more than one spot in the supply chain. In fact, an Oregon company could possess a license for each of the four categories, if it so desires.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though no one yet knows exactly how the new rules will read, Oregon-licensed growers and processors can be confident that they will be able to sell to one another
        <em>
         and
        </em>
        to retailers. This means that, unlike in other industries, Oregon marijuana growers and processors will not necessarily have to go through wholesalers to bring their products to market. Beyond this basic framework, Measure 91 does not go into tremendous detail on how wholesale licensees must operate, giving the OLCC very broad discretion on how it can fashion its licensing structure.
       </p>
       <p>
        You may be wondering what this means, practically. We predict that, regardless of the approach taken by OLCC, more license types will ultimately flatten the industry, ensuring diversity of business models and low barriers to market entry. Oregon will stand in stark contrast to, for instance, New York and Minnesota, which license massively capitalized, monolithic cannabis companies required to occupy the entire supply chain. These stiff regimes fail to recognize that some companies may want to focus only on growing cannabis, or baking cookies, extracting hash oil, etc., and not fuss with any other aspect of the cannabis production or distribution process.See

        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/comparing-marijuana-licensing-models/" target="_blank">
         Comparing Marijuana Licensing Models
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Another practical effect we foresee for Oregon is that its cannabis companies will be able to right size their
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/understanding-managing-cannabis-legal-compliance-no-excuses/" target="_blank">
         compliance
        </a>
        costs, a boon for start-ups in any highly regulated industry. Because Measure 91 allows fragmentation within the industry, compliance risk will naturally be apportioned per category, rather than falling squarely on a single licensees shoulders. In other words, Oregons fragmented licensing model lets businesses shift compliance risk to other licensees, who will be held independently accountable for their actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The OLCC could regulate wholesalers out of the marketplace, as wholesalers are not a necessary part of the supply chain. Moreover, Oregons recreational licensees will have to contend with competition from both home grows and from medical dispensaries. Still, wholesalers might be able to bundle some combination of ancillary services such as branding/labeling, packaging, laboratory testing, payment security, and logistics. How these services can be packaged will depend largely on the OLCCs ultimate regulatory framework. Right now the canvas is blank.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be interesting to see how the OLCC ultimately decides to craft its regulations for wholesale licenses, and I amlooking forward to advising the State on this process. How would you want to see the OLCC regulate wholesale businesses?

        A year ago we published a postabout the
        <em>
         Coats v. Dish Network
        </em>
        case titled, 
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/fired-for-using-marijuana-it-may-be-too-damn-bad/">
         Fired For Using Marijuana? It May Be Too Damn Bad
        </a>
        . This week the Colorado Supreme Court got the last word on the issue, and its answer was basically, yes, it is too damn bad.
       </p>
       <p>
        In short, the
        <em>
         Coats
        </em>
        case questioned whether Dish Network properly firedCoats
        <em>
        </em>
        for his off-the-clock (at home) use of medical marijuana. Coats claimed he did not come to work impaired, and that he was protected under Colorados Lawful Activities Statute, which prohibits employers from dismissing employees for extracurricular activities with which the employer doesnt agree, so long as those activities are lawful and do not interfere with the employees work.
       </p>

        <p class="wp-caption-text">
         In this building, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled notto protect cannabis users from their employers.
        </p>
       </div>
       <p>
        The definition of lawful ended up being the pivotal issue in this case  at both the trial and appellate levels, the court held that lawful activity must conform toboth state and federal law. Marijuana use then, even if legal under Colorados medical or recreational use laws, cannot quality for protection under the Lawful Activities Statute. The Colorado Supreme Court agreed,

         not mincing words
        </a>
        in handing Coatshis third straight loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what now? Coats was quoted by the
        <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/15/brandon-coats-medical-marijuana_n_7585832.html" target="_blank">
         Huff Post
        </a>
        as saying he hopes his case at least served to highlightthe plight of medical cannabis patients in Colorado vis-a-vis their employers, and theuncertainty surrounding the lawfulness of their use. In stating its view that nothing in Colorados Amendment 20 indicated a legislative intent to qualify MMJ use for protection under the Lawful Activities Statute,the Colorado Supreme Court has paved the way for Colorado lawmakers to step in with a legislative fix. Presumably, if the states MMJ laws were tweaked to expressly protect medical cannabis use under the Lawful Activities Statue, or the Lawful Activities Statute were amended to expressly include off-the-clock medical cannabis use, other lawful MMJ patients would be spared Coatss fate. This may only be true, however, where the employer is not exercising its right to enforce a drug-free workplace, a concession included in Colorados (and many other states) medical cannabis laws. Clearly there is tension between a patients need and right to use medical cannabis, and an employers right to create rules for its workplace. A better, more comprehensive legislative fix would consider both sides and probably also distinguish between impairment (a legitimate concern) and mere use  but those lines are not easy to draw. (See
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/the-tricky-case-of-drugged-cannabis-driving/">
         The Tricky Case of Drugged (Cannabis) Driving
        </a>
        .) Were willing to bet that patients groups, and maybe even Coats himself (who was paralyzed as a teenager and would seem to be a sympathetic champion) will lobby hard on this issue in the coming legislative session.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we noted last year, this case may be interesting to those in medical marijuana states around the country. Many states have some type of lawful activities law on their books, and in the developing area of medical marijuana law, courts are more likely to consider the analysis of courts from other jurisdictions.

         Want an Oregon Cannabis business? Get to know your local zoning.

       <p>
        We regularly get calls from clients in Oregon who are trying to figure out whether the property theyve selected for their recreational marijuana business complies with applicable zoning regulations. Unfortunately, it is not yet clearwhat zoning regulations pertaining to recreational marijuana businesses will look like, because much of this regulation is left to individual cities and counties. Aside from designating sensitive uses such as schools, parks and transit centers, and then mandating a buffer zone (likely 1,000 feet) for marijuana businesses, the state of Oregon does not tend to involve itself extensively in zoning regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/oregon-measure-91-and-its-marijuana-regime-under-threat/" target="_blank">
         Initiative 91
        </a>
        does not allow cities and counties to issue unilateral bans on recreational marijuana businesses without first putting the issue to vote, the Initiative also does not preclude cities and counties from enacting their own zoning ordinances. The severity with which cities and counties utilize zoning ordinances to regulate marijuana businesses may be inferred by their past and current treatment of the medical marijuana industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take Washington County as an example. Until just last year, Washington County had a moratorium in place against medical marijuana businesses. Effective in November of last year, the county enacted a new ordinance requiring marijuana business owners acquire a special use permit in certain zones, including the Community Business District, General Commercial District, Rural Commercial District, Transit Oriented Districts, and the Neighborhood Commercial Mixed Use District.
       </p>
       <p>
        Special use permits are another way  in addition to zoning regulations  for cities and counties to tightly regulate where marijuana businesses may locate. The criteria for obtaining these permits are contained in each city and countys code. The application process for a special use permit gives the local zoning authority discretion to ensure that a particular land use, such as marijuana production or marijuana retail sales, does not adversely affect the existing zoning scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taking regulation to the next level, as of January 1, 2015 the city of Beaverton in Washington County began issuing its own licenses for medical marijuana facilities in addition to the requisite state license. The city also established a
        <a href="http://www.cannalawblog.com/oregon-municipalities-seek-to-tax-recreational-marijuana-but-can-they/" target="_blank">
         recreational marijuana tax
        </a>
        , though that will likely be subject to limitation by the state legislature.
       </p>
       <p>
        The most common types of regulations we see from Oregon cities and counties, such as Clackamas County, are time, place and manner restrictions. These restrictions may include limitations on hours of operation, restrictions on signage or the outside appearance of a business, and restrictions on a businesss proximity to certain sensitive uses. Note that some counties, including Clackamas, have already contemplated recreational marijuana businesses in their current zoning regulations, making it easier for prospective business owners to get a good idea of where they will be able to locate.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the opposite end of the spectrum from Oregons tightly regulated cities and counties is Multnomah County, which currently has no zoning restrictions pertaining to medical marijuana. Marijuana businesses within Multnomah County are being left to be regulated city by city. The City of Portland, for example, has no current zoning restrictions, though we expect this may change with implementation of Initiative 91.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing that is clear is that marijuana zoning regulations in Oregon are all over the board. Most importantly, current and prospective marijuana business owners should be communicative with local government officials. We are finding that most members of local planning departments in Oregon are happy to help business owners (and even us lawyers) navigate local regulations. Subscribing to local government newsletters and attending city and county council meetings are key, not just for staying abreast of updates to the rules, but for ensuring that your interests are taken into account during the rule-making process.

       <p>
        Please be mindful that possessing, using, distributing and selling marijuana are all federal crimes and that this blog is not intended to give you any legal advice, much less lead you to believe that marijuana is legal under federal law. Please also note that even though marijuana is illegal under federal law, you will need to pay federal taxes just as though you are a legal entity. This is true even if you are a state law not-for-profit entity.
