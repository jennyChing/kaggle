   Fast Track to Cruising. As many coastal sailors do not enjoy oceans passages
   complete an offshore passage to ensure you do. Time spent offshore will quickly
   clarify your priorities for boat selection and equipment plus generally
   satisfies the prerequisite for obtaining offshore insurance for your future
   boat.

              Selecting a cruising boat is the most important
decision in preparing for an offshore voyage and often is a pivotal point in
the changing of dreams from "Let's take off and go cruising some time,
into the reality of "Let's get outfitted and go".
             </p>
             <p class="Paragraphspace">
              Obviously there isn't any one perfect boat for
everyone. The boat you choose should be safe, comfortable, well built, and
ideally capable of fast passages while proving to be a good investment
              <span class="GramE">
               If
              </span>
              your plans are only for coastal cruising you can consider
a winder range of suitable boats than those who are headed offshore and require
a sturdier vessel.
             </p>
             <p class="Paragraphspace">
              The process of selecting and purchasing a boat for
extended cruising usually takes a minimum of six to 12 months.
              <span class="GramE">
               Research boat types that suit your budget and cruising plans.
              </span>
              Be patient, ask questions and learn everything you can while keeping an open
mind. You'll need to locate, examine, survey, test sail, complete the purchase
transaction and possibly ship or deliver your new boat to a place convenient for
outfitting.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you make a poor choice you may be plagued with structural
problems, leaks, slow uncomfortable passages, endless repairs and a low resale
price. I mention resale price now, because the money used for purchasing a
cruising boat often represents a substantial part of people's life savings.
Although sailboats are rarely a "good" investment in monetary terms,
you'll want to recoup as much of your original purchase price as possible when
it comes time to sell.

              Size, Cost and Time
             </h2>
             <p>
              Two of the most important points to remember when
selecting a boat are size and cost. The size of boat you select directly
affects your cruising costs, not only in initial purchase and outfitting, but
also in cruising expenses once you're under way. Few people realize that
outfitting a stock new boat for long distance cruising can easily take 30% to
50% more than the initial purchase price. On a 40 new or used boat, this can
mean an additional $20,000 to $50,000 just for essential equipment including
additional sails, ground tackle,
              <span class="SpellE">
               liferaft
              </span>
              , safety
gear and tender. This amount excludes optional equipment such as refrigeration,
electronics, outboard motors, scuba gear and autopilots. On a boat 20 years or
older, replacing rigging, tanks, engine and upgrading the electrical system can
easily add an additional 50% to 100%.
             </p>
             <p class="Paragraphspace">
              Its easy and normal to overspend on the initial
purchase of the boat, spend more money on equipment that isn't essential and
then run short of funds once you've completed your initial provisioning and have
actually started cruising.
             </p>
             <p class="Paragraphspace">
              A better approach if you're working within a fixed
budget is to spend less on the initial purchase by either purchasing a wellbuilt
used boat or a smaller new boat. Purchase the priority equipment first; then
set aside money for an initial provisioning ($2,000), and funds for cruising
(an average of $1000 to $2000 for a couple per month) for the period of time
you want to cruise. Then see if there is enough money left for the expensive,
nonessential but "sure would be nice to have" equipment.

              The majority of boats cruising for a year or longer are
sailed by couples, and a boat in the 35 to 45 size range generally works out
best, particularly if the owners are new to sailing. The cost, time and energy
required to maintain a 50 to 60 boat versus a 40 boat once you're "out
there"cruising is
significantly higher.

              When I started cruising the South Pacific in 1974 on a Vega
27, there were many cruisers on shoestring budgets, multi-year open-ended
cruises on boats under 35. Today we see people cruising faster on larger
boats, visiting many countries in a shorter time. Offshore cruising is now
rarely an open-ended lifestyle choice, but one that most people experience for
one to two years before moving on to the next phase of their life.
             </p>
             <p>
              In general, the median length of cruising boats has been
increasing steadily. This may correspond with an increased budget of many
cruisers and the development and improvement of sailhandling systems
including furling mainsails and electric winches.

              Crew difficulties are one of the most
persistent and common problems on cruising boats. It's easy to find friends and
family members excited about sailing with you when you first leave your
homeport. As you get further away airfares become more expensive, it becomes
expensive and time consuming coordinating the logistics of crew arrival and
departure. You might also find that you may not be comfortable trusting your

$80,000, spend $50,000 replacing engine, sails, wiring, tanks, rigging,

the process, you end up with a 17 year old boat, probably worth around $90,000.

              A better choice might be a new boat that costs more

             <p>
              Some people use the justification that since they have
rebuilt every system on their boat, they now can fix them in some distant port.

the bilge fixing something that I overhauled a year earlier!

that exactly meets all of your criteria so be prepared to be flexible and keep
an open mind as you learn more about what makes a safe and comfortable offshore
boat. You may go into your boat search thinking that you absolutely must have a
heavy displacement double-ender with a long bowsprit and a centerline queen
berth, for example.

              The easiest way to find a quality used boat is to
locate a professional and knowledgeable broker who has offshore sailing
experience and who will work with you to find a suitable boat. Some less
knowledgeable or scrupulous brokers will try and sell you whatever boat is
easiest. Use Yachtworld.com computer-listing network and various publications
to locate appropriate boats on a regional and national basis. Spend time
clearly communicating your purchase time frame, budget, and personal priorities
with the broker. Be honest and dont waste their time. If you need to first
sell your house or wont be able to make a purchase for some time, let them
know that in your initial discussion and dont expect their full attention
until you are really ready to purchase.

              If at all possible, contact the designer before purchasing.  Relatively few boats were actually designed for ocean passage making. You will  need to learn if the boat builder followed the designer's construction criteria.  Some Taiwanese-built yachts advertised as being designed by Robert Perry or  Doug Peterson may actually be pirated designs where the designer has not been  paid a royalty and the builder may have tried to save money by reducing  structural integrity. None of the Taiwan  yards employing this practice were in business very long.

             <p>
              If the yard is still in business it can be quite helpful for  purchasing some parts and assemblies, but is by no means essential. If they are  still in business, call and ask them about the boat you're considering. Have  the hull number and date of manufacture ready.
              <br/>
              You may find that boats built by a yard that is still  in business retain higher value than boats where the builder has gone out of  business.
             </p>
             <p>
              As an example, friends of mine had a Southern Cross 35  built for them by Ryder Yachts in 1985. After a successful Pacific  circumnavigation and the arrival of two lovely daughters, they decided to move  up to a Morris 46. They related that the Morris 36 that they were considering when  they ordered the Southern Cross then cost $20,000 more but is now worth  approximately $160,000 compared to a value of $75,000 for the Southern Cross  today. Morris is still in business building excellent boats; Southern Cross  went under not long after my friends boat was completed.

              If youre considering purchasing a new boat, check the  financial condition of the company. Some builders are just barely staying in  business and may use your deposit money to complete another persons boat. This  only works as long as the deposits are coming in!

              Sailing Performance
             </h2>
             <p>
              Youll sure appreciate a design that offers good  sailing performance and ease of handling the more miles you sail.
             </p>
             <p>
              Few potential cruisers think of passage-making speed as  important criteria in choosing an ocean cruising boat. After considerable years  and miles of ocean cruising, it is now high on my personal list of priorities.  The shorter the passages, the less exposure you have to heavy weather  conditions. A boat with good sailing performance requires less motoring and  fuel, is faster, more responsive and fun to sail in the light to moderate wind  conditions so common worldwide.
             </p>
             <p>
              Windward sailing performance is nearly as important as  passage-making speed. On the other extreme, a very modern, light displacement  boat with a flat entry may tend to pound when sailing to windward and may lack  directional stability when sailing downwind with large following seas. The  ability to sail off a lee shore in an emergency is dependent on windward  performance.

             </p>
             <p>
              If the design is excessively

              This is just as important as each of the above points,  because a boat may have the best sailing characteristics in the world, but if  your partner views it as a deep, dark, damp, unattractive place to live, you'll  either be singlehanding or giving up your cruising dreams.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember most cruisers are at sea less than a quarter of the  time, so comfort at anchor is also very important.

              Space for the additional sails, tankage, food, lines, spare  parts, medical and safety supplies required for extensive cruising is  important. On some boats valuable storage space under the settees and berths is  filled with tankage that could have been designed under the cabin sole.

             <p>
              A purpose-designed cruising boat will be able to carry the  additional weight of three anchors, a windlass and several hundred pounds of  chain, as well as additional water (8 lbs. per gallon) and fuel (6 lbs. per  gallon), a liferaft, dinghy and outboard. You'll be adding several thousand  pounds of equipment, so if the boat you're considering is already on her  waterline before you start loading cruising gear you may end up several inches  below the designed waterline. On some designs this may be a dangerous problem.  Boats that handle the weight the best

              are  not real narrow at the waterline beam and have transom sterns without excessive  overhangs.

              Mulithull vs Monohull

              Multihulls
              <strong>
              </strong>
              advantages  include very little heeling or rolling and tremendous interior volume and deck  space, making them very attractive for sailing, living aboard and chartering in  tropical climes. Another distinct advantage is that multihulls don't sink if holed,  unlike ballasted monohulls. Their disadvantages for offshore cruising are that  they are more weight-sensitive to overloading; they may be uncomfortable going  upwind into a head sea and under extremely rare instances they can capsize. As  few marinas worldwide were designed for the width of multis, moorage in some  places may be difficult to find. Having said this, multi-hulls are ever  increasing in popularity and make the most sense for warm-water cruising areas.

              Underbody Design
             </h2>
             <p>
              In the past, cruisers assumed a full-keel design with attached  rudder was optimum for ocean voyaging. I have cruised on four different modern  full-keel boats, plus on a boat with a longish keel and separate full-skeg and  rudder. Our present boat has a partial skeg and for me the trade off of less  protection is worth the ease of steering and added maneuverability.

             </strong>
             detached from the keel is well suited for  long distance cruising. The skeg protects the rudder to some degree, and may increase  directional stability. Examples of this type of design: Valiants, Pacific  Seacraft 34, 37, 40, 44. There are many suitable, well-built boats of this  design type and they are a popular choice for long distance ocean cruising.

             include Morris 44, 46 and the Frers designed Hallberg-Rassys providing  some protection from logs and debris and a third rudder bearing and more  strength than a spade rudder. Having the skeg extend only partway down the  rudder means that the rudder is semi-balanced. This greatly reduces the amount  of effort required to steer the boat. It is almost like power steering and  means that not only hand steering, but also steering under autopilot or  windvane is much easier and that there is much less loading on the steering  system. The downside is that the top of the rudder balance area is prone to  catching lines and weed.

              </strong>
              , with attached rudder and moderate  displacement is another good choice for cruising in isolated areas where  groundings or scrapes are common and the nearest shipyard may be thousands of  miles away. The cutaway forefoot is a faster, more maneuverable design that  will have fewer tendencies to trip or broach when running under storm  conditions than a traditional Tahiti ketch type of full  keel boat. Having the rudder mounted slightly above and protected by the full  length of the keel and the propeller enclosed in an aperture offer the best  protection against damage from collision with submerged or floating objects.  Careening or hauling out in primitive boatyards is easy with this type of  design. Examples include: Island Packet, Mason, Cape   Dory, Freya 39, Nicholson 31,  Endurance 35.

             is the fastest and most maneuverable  design for racing and is the easiest and least expensive underbody to build.  Some designs featuring a deep, high aspect keel may exhibit a lack of steering  directional stability when ocean swells are present. The unprotected spade  rudder is vulnerable to being damaged by groundings or hard impact with  objects. There are several very 



successful cruising designs that have a longer, substantially  supported keel (not a thin, high-aspect keel) and strong rudderstocks. Some  examples of this type of design appropriate for offshore voyaging are Sabre, Sundeer,  Deerfoots, Niagara 31, 35, 42 and Cal 40. If your cruise  plans involve high latitude sailing or gunkholing in remote areas, you will  need to be more cautious with this type of design.

              is  the least maintenance-intensive material for cruising boats, but construction  quality varies greatly from one builder to the next. The majority of fiberglass  boats were never designed or built for extended ocean sailing and may  eventually start falling apart if pressed into this type of service. The other  extreme are designs that are so heavily built and overweight and do not have  the sailing performance that makes for fast and comfortable passages.
              <br/>
              Pearson Vanguards, Tritons and Alberg 35's are examples of  very well built, reasonably priced earliest production fiberglass boats. After  40 years these earliest production fiberglass boats are still going strong.

               2. Steel
              </strong>
              is an  excellent boatbuilding material, and is frequently the choice of sailors who  have done extensive offshore cruising. The impact resistance and total  watertightness of the hull, deck and fittings is an advantage over other  materials. With sandblasting and the new epoxy coatings, steel takes less time  to maintain than it used to, although it still requires more time and cost to  maintain than a fiberglass boat. Many of the steel boats on the North American  market are owner-built hard-chine designs. Although strong and stiff, they are  not particularly fast or attractive to many peoples tastes. A poorly-built  steel boat will have places on the inside of the hull that will trap water and  rust through from the inside out. Access to every part of the interior of the  hull makes checking for corrosion and painting much easier.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some attractive, modern steel cruising boats are the  Waterline Yachts built in Sidney, BC  (an excellent yard), Kanter Yachts, Brewer-designed Goderich 35, 37 and 41  built in Ontario; and the Amazon  37 and 44 which were built in Vancouver, BC.

               3. Aluminum
              </strong>
              boats  are generally lighter and faster than steel boats, have less impact resistance  and may be slightly more difficult to have repaired in remote shipyards.  Painted aluminum boats often tend to develop paint blisters after four to five  years of serious cruising, requiring an expensive repainting job if you want a  perfectly fair and shiny hull. There are hundreds of unpainted French aluminum  boats cruising the world, and although you may not find their concrete-colored  oxidized aluminum hulls attractive, they are strong and practical. Aluminum  suffers from electrolysis more severely than steel; if you're cruising on an  aluminum boat you'll need to be very careful when moored in electrically  "hot" marinas. Quality aluminum builders include Ovni and Garcia in France  and Kanter in Ontario.

               4. Wood
              </strong>
              boats  often offer a lower purchase price, although the cost and time involved in  keeping them in good shape is more than with other materials. If you have a  limited budget, and don't mind the additional work, a well-built wooden boat  could be a reasonable choice. It may be difficult to find long-distance  offshore insurance for traditionally built wooden cruising boats.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps because there are so many potential sources of  problems on wooden boats in the tropics we see fewer of them long distance  cruising each year. There is the special warmth and appeal of wood that some people  find irresistible, whether or not it takes more care and maintenance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Modern wood epoxy saturation (WEST System) technique  produces boats that are lighter, stronger and often faster than traditionally  built boats and have a better chance of being insurable for ocean cruising. The  best areas to find modern cold-molded boats are in the Northwest, New   England and New Zealand.

               5. Ferrocement

              is  the only material that has no advantages other than inexpensive construction  materials. It is the most labor-intensive material to build with, is difficult  to finance, insure or repair, and has the lowest impact resistance of any  material. Having said this, I have met two cement cruising boats that have completed  two and three circumnavigations respectively.

              attached to a substantial stub that is an  integral part of the hull absorbs groundings well. When external ballast is  used, keel bolts attaching the keel to the hull must be accessible, and keel  loading must be spread out through the floor system.

              there can be serious problems  once the boat is over approximately 8-12 years old. If the plywood core  material is not marine grade or if insufficient bedding compound used, you may  end up with the core material becoming saturated and many small deck leaks  where the screws are.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many of the less-expensive Taiwan builders of  the 70s and 80s used random bits of plywood as

               deck coring material
              </strong>
              , with filler between the wood scraps. When  water penetrates this core material, repairs are often expensive and very time  consuming. Check with any marine surveyor to verify this and avoid these boats.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would recommend having a surveyor look very  carefully at any boat older than eight years with

               balsa-cored

              Rigs
             </h2>
             <p>
              The majority of long distance cruisers are choosing sloop or  cutter rigs. Dependable furling headsails and mainsails have meant that  cruising couples are able to easily handle cutter or sloop-rigged boats in the  40 to 50 range. Many cruisers are adding a removable inner forestay on a  sloop on which they can set a storm staysail once they have furled or dropped  their working headsail.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't have any hard and fast rules that apply to my choice  of rig. I used to think that I would not like a ketch rig, but after seven  years and 70,000 miles on my previous boat that was ketch-rigged, I changed my  mind. I appreciated the flexibility of the rig and the ability to drop half the  total sail area (the mainsail) in less than a minute without having to resort  to a furling mainsail. Amel of France is one of the few yards presently  building ketches.

              Hull to Deck Joint
             </h2>
             <p>
              There are several methods of attaching the hull and deck of  fiberglass boats.
             </p>
             <p>
              The most common method utilizes bolts or screws protruding  through on the inside of the hull to the deck joint. This a mechanical clamp  joint is relying on the bond of a sealant adhesive (3M 5200 is often used) to  stop leaks. After eight to 12 years and several thousand miles of ocean sailing  the sealant/adhesive loses some of its elasticity. Due to the working of the  boat and the different climatic conditions the toerail and hull expand,  contract and flex at different rates eventually weakening the bond, allowing  water to follow the bolt or screw threads down, and drip on the inside of your  lockers.
             </p>

               Two Methods of  Solving Caprail Leaks
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Remove the teak cap rail or aluminum extruded  toerail and
              <strong>
               clean and re-bed
              </strong>
              each  bolt.
             </p>
             <p>
              Radius the inside of the joint with epoxy and  microballoons and then lay several layers of
              <strong>
               fiberglass tape
              </strong>
              over the inside of the joint, totally sealing it  and strengthening the area at the same time.
             </p>
             <p>
              A more trouble-free hull to deck joint utilizes substantial  fiberglass bonding on the interior of the joint, eliminating mechanical  fasteners and leaks.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Bulkhead Attachment
             </h2>
             <p>
              Bulkheads must be securely attached to the hull. On a  fiberglass boat they need to be substantially glassed to the hull on both sides  and to the deck with multiple layers of tape. High production builders skimp on  this, gluing bulkheads in instead, but once their boats have made several ocean  passages, bulkheads and interior wooden cabinetry frequently come unbonded from  the hull, allowing the hull to flex more than it should. The repair is complicated,  messy and expensive, involving grinding and fiberglassing in some difficult to  reach areas.
             </p>
             <p>
              Internal stiffening systems (grid floor systems, and/or  full-length and transverse glass over foam (not wooden) stringers) contribute  greatly to the stiffness and rigidity of a boat. If the interior woodwork is  just glued or lightly attached to a hull liner pan or to the hull, its not  uncommon to discover it breaking loose after a few thousand miles of ocean  sailing. Access to hull and deck areas is generally restricted when fiberglass  liners and pans are used in construction, making equipment installation and  leak stopping difficult. From a manufacturing standpoint, hull liners are  substantially less expensive than stick-built interiors, but you wont find  them on top-end ocean cruising designs. This is one of the reasons for the  large price difference between high-volume mass-produced French and German yards  and higher quality, lower production builders.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Chainplate Load Transmission
             </h2>
             <p>
              The loading from chain plates must be evenly transmitted to  bulkheads and structural members below deck to avoid lifting or distorting the  deck. Separate chainplates for forward, upper and aft shrouds provides more  stability for the mast and reduces the chance of deck loading distortion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Swept-back spreaders mean a less expensive installation for  the builder and a tighter sheeting angle for the headsail, but this presents a huge  disadvantage when easing the main out for downwind sailing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Swept-back  spreaders are not really appropriate on an ocean cruising boat.
             </p>
             <p>
              External chainplates (fastened to the outside of the hull)  look salty but have a much higher leak potential and restrict jib sheeting  angles. Chainplates must be easily removable as crevice corrosion, particularly  in warm climates can be a serious problem.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Mast Support System
             </h2>
             <p>
              Deck stepped masts work well, but only if proper structural  members transmit the load to the keel. Otherwise deflection and possibly  delaminating under the mast occur. With keel stepped masts, inspect for  corrosion at the base of the mast. Check the mast for trueness.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Steering System and Position
             </h2>
             <p>
              Some sailors prefer tillers on boats under 35 as there is  less to go wrong and installing most windvane steering systems is less  complicated than with wheel steering.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the boat youre considering has wheel steering, hopefully  the system was built by a reputable company like Edson or Lewmar/Whitlock where  youre assured of quality components and that youll always be able to spare  parts if needed. Many Taiwanese-built steering systems suffer from poor initial  design, inferior bronze castings and rudders that aren't able to hold up to the  stresses of ocean sailing. This is less of a problem on higher quality Taiwan  boats like Norseman, Taswell, Mason and Little Harbor.
             </p>
             <p>
              The location of the steering position is also important. If  the wheel is mounted at the far aft end of the cockpit, it may be very hard to  design a dodger that will provide protection to the helmsperson without  resorting to a long, potentially unseaworthy design.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Aft vs. Center Cockpit
             </h2>
             <p>
              Nigel Calder makes a clear argument as to why he prefers aft  cockpit design. I can make a reasonable argument for either design, but  personally prefer a center cockpit in boats over 40-42 as long as the cockpit  isnt unduly high off the water. Some designers try to maximize engine room and  interior volume, resulting in this problem. Some of the advantages I see to a  center cockpit include more privacy, better engine access and less danger of  the cockpit being filled from following breaking seas.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Transoms
             </h2>
             <p>
              The ideal stern for a cruising boat includes a built-in swim  step on a slightly reversed transom stern. This not only makes getting in and  out of the water and dinghy easy, but allows easy access when moored stern-to a  dock or wall, a common situation in less developed cruising areas. Double  enders may look salty, but the loss of valuable, hard-to-replace lazarette  storage area and buoyancy aft must be taken into consideration. Most double  enders have a tendency to "squat" in the stern and hobbyhorse sailing  to windward when loaded with cruising gear.
             </p>
             <h2>
              Engine
             </h2>
             <p>
              Being able to maintain at least six knots under power  will get you in most passes and channels at the time of least current. A rule  of thumb is two horsepower per thousand pounds of displacement for a  sufficiently powered cruising sailboat. Purists may say that this is excessive,  but in my experience it has been an advantage to have sufficient power to deal  with currents and the ability to motorsail to windward for short distances into  steep chop when necessary.

              Ideally the boat you are considering will have a common make  of engine that will be easy to find parts and service for in less-developed  cruising areas.

              When I bought my Hallberg-Rassy 31, I thought the 25 hp  diesel engine was excessive for a displacement of only 9,500 lbs, but the top  speed of 7.2 knots, cruising speed of 6.5 knots and maximum range under power  at 5 knots of 1,200 to 1,500 miles proved useful.
             </p>
             <p>
              My 42' ketch displaced 25,000 pounds and was powered with a  62 hp engine which proved very adequate in areas like Patagonia,  Antarctica and Alaska  where conditions dictated powering for weeks at a time, encountering strong  currents and tidal rips and fierce catabatic winds daily.
             </p>
             <p>
              My present 48, 38,000 lb boat has a 95 hp. motor which  provides an 8.3 knot top speed, and a 1,500 mile range at more economical 6  knots. I have supplemented standard fuel tankage with jerry jugs stowed in  cockpit lockers with each of these boats.

             <h2>
              Key Points to Remember
             </h2>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Make sure you really  enjoy and know how to sail. Complete an offshore passage. Realistically assess  your needs
              </strong>
              in terms of size of boat and amount of equipment. If you're  outfitting and cruising on a budget, remember the KISS formula. More  complicated systems mean more money and maintenance, repairs and spare parts to  track down. Think moderate in terms of displacement and sail area. Youll want  to hire a surveyor who has no vested interest in the transaction, other than  making sure that the boat youre considering is safe and a good investment for  you. Marine Insurance companies and banks are often able to recommend surveyors  whose opinions they trust.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Sail on  as many different designs as possible
              </strong>
              and take notes on the features you  like and dislike, noting pluses and minuses of each. Joining a sailing club or  chartering different can be helpful. If you are quite convinced that you want a  specific boat, a one-week charter on a sistership will be a sound investment.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Don't  overspend
              </strong>
              on initial purchase price; save at least 40% to 50% of your total  budget for outfitting, provisioning and cruising funds. DO NOT FORGET THIS!!!

              HR46 Review Article
             </h1>
             <p>
              Christoph Rassy started building production sailboats on Sweden's
West Coast in 1966 with the Rasmus 35, a center-cockpit, aft cabin
cruising boat designed by Olle Enderlein. Dozens of these boats
are still out cruising the world, and the designs that followed
have consistently been comfortable, attractive and reasonably
fast; very reliable cruising boats without any concession to racing
design or passing tends. Large tankage and engines and fixed windshields
with optional hardtops are common features and consistently high
construction quality has resulted in steadily increasing value
of these boats over the years.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1988 Germn Frers was hired to design a new series
of yachts. The Frers designs brought improved performance with
longer waterlines and other features such as external lead ballast,
semi-balanced rudders and a sloop rigs. Having sailed 114,000
miles on Rassy-Enderlein designed HR 31 and 42, I was eager to
test the sailing performance the new Frers-designed 39, 42, 46
and 53, and the difference in both light and heavy air performance
was surprising. The larger water plane area aft means these boats
can sail to windward in strong winds and seas with very little
pitching motion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before selecting a Hallberg-Rassy 46 to replace the older-style
Rassy-Enderlein designed HR 42 which we sailed 70,000 miles over
seven years of sail-training, Amanda and I traveled around the
world inspecting boat yards and speaking with designers.
             </p>
             <p>
              On a visit to the Hallberg-Rassy yard in Ells, Sweden
we met Christoph Rassy the owner of Hallberg-Rassy. He is an avid
sailor commissioning a personal boat every few years to cross
the Atlantic, trading off with his employees for time aboard.
Many of the 260 employees have been with the yard for over 30
years, and boatbuilding is a family tradition carried out on the
island of Orust for over 10,000 years, according to archaeologists.
The entire yard closes for four weeks each summer allowing employees
to go cruising on their own boats.
             </p>
             <p>
              We gave very little consideration to a custom design, having
watched dozens of our ex-students go through the time and cost
overruns and seemingly unending teething problems of custom boats.
Purchasing a used boat and going through a major refit was something
I had done three times previously. After careful evaluation, we
took the major step (for us) of ordering a new HR 46, exactly
the way we wanted it.
              <br/>
              I was particularly pleased to be purchasing hull #92 of the design,
and to know that the yard had completed 8,000 boats to date. Between
the time we ordered the boat and it was built, the yard incorporated
several standard upgrades which they did not charge extra for.
             </p>
             <p>
              <b>
               Construction
               <br/>
              </b>
              There are many construction details that I've found to be
excellent, and in some cases unique to Hallberg-Rassy. This list
highlights some of the most noteworthy features:
              <br/>
              Optional
              <b>
               rigid dodgers
              </b>
              with opening center windows on the
42 to 62. Once you've made a rough ocean passage with a rigid
dodger, you'll never want to go back to a canvas dodger that can
be easily carried away. Permanent sun protection is also a consideration
in these days of ozone depletion and high rates of skin cancer.
              <br/>
             </p>
             <li>
              An excellent
              <b>
               anchoring system
              </b>
              with a watertight bulkhead
and deck anchor locker for 250' of 3/8" chain and three fenders
which drains overboard, not into the bilge. Two bow rollers are
standard, and the boat handles the weight of a 75 lb. CQR and
44 lb. Delta permanently stored on the bow. The powerful 1300
watt, 24 volt Lofrans vertical windlass has worked flawlessly,
even in 90' depths.
              <br/>
              Oversize thru-bolted
              <b>
               mooring cleats
              </b>
              including midship spring-line
cleats mounted on top of the solid teak toerail in such away that
chafe is minimalized.
              <br/>
              <b>
               Hull-to-deck joint
              </b>
              that does not rely on bolts, screws,
rivets or adhesive for strength or watertightness. The joint is
heavily glassed on the inside the entire way around the boat and
solid stainless steel rods for mounting stanchions are recessed
into the bulwark thus eliminating potential leaks so common when
stanchion bases are thru-bolted.
              <br/>
             </li>
             <li>
              A
              <b>
               strong hull
              </b>
              utilizing isophtalic resin and Divinycell
closed-cell PVC insulation above the waterline. I believe this
an excellent construction technique for a cruising boat, providing
a hull with excellent torisional stability and no chance of water
absorption. I really like the fact that the yard takes the time
to grind the inside of the hull and bilge smooth, and paint it
with a gray topcoat. This means no sliced or scraped fingers from
errant fiberglass strands when installing equipment or cleaning.
All interior lockers are lined with satin-varnished mahogany battens.
This eliminates moisture and condensation problems, even when
we are sailing in Antarctic or Arctic waters.
              <br/>

              <b>
               Very careful osmotic blister protection.
              </b>
              I have spent
much of the past 22 years in tropical waters aboard my HR boats
without blister problems. This may be due in part to the fact
that the hulls are built under strictly controlled temperature
and humidity conditions.

I've seen on many boats with balsa-cored decks.

              with solid wood support
that transmits loading to the interior grid system. I have come
to prefer this deck-stepped mast design as it eliminates leaks
where the mast comes through the deck, corrosion at the mast base
and deck collar, and the inevitable water in the bilge from rain
entering around masthead sheaves. After 156,000 miles on my HR
31, 42 &amp; 46 I have never experienced any deflection or problem
with the deck-stepped masts.

              minimizing foredeck clutter.
Utilizing a reefable 130% headsail with foam luff we are able
to sail to windward in up to 40 knots. Over 40 knots upwind we
easily rig the removable inner stay on which we set a bullet-proof
hank-on storm staysail. Running backstays provide additional mast
stability. In winds over 50-55 knots, we drop the triple-reefed
main and hoist a storm trysail. We have only had to hoist the
trysail twice while in the Roaring Forties, during our 42,000
miles to date on our 46.

an optional 100 gallon tank) and 245 gallons water are mounted
above the keel, and below the cabin sole, creating roomy storage

the deck is constructed and are easily removed without having
to destroy interior joinery work.

system and filled with spares and food. A boat with a flatter
underbody would surf better downwind but have reduced storage
space and prove less comfortable going to windward in heavy weather.

was initially concerned that the design didn't have a full-length
skeg, but after 42,000 miles, the "power-steering" effect
of being semi-balanced is addictive, requiring far less rudder
input and effort. The rudder post is solid stainless steel, tapered
at the bottom and the substantial welded flanges are also tapered
stainless steel.

We find this type of transom unbeatable for active cruising. Not
only does this make getting out of the water after snorkeling
and swimming easier, it is also makes practicing the Lifesling
Overboard Retrieval system easier. Mooring stern-to floating docks
or boarding from a dinghy with this type of transom is a breeze!

               </b>
               Although few changes are allowed to the standard layouts,
the yard has several optional layouts for each cabin. We cut and
pasted layouts from the brochure until we had the combination
we thought would work best for eight people on ocean passages
in all conditions. We opted for a four-cabin layout with upper
and lower bunks in the cabin directly forward of the main bulkhead,
a traditional v-berth forward, standard L-shaped settees in the
main cabin instead of easy chairs. In the aft cabin we chose a
double to starboard and single berth to port in the aft cabin,
instead of a centerline double.

                <br/>
               </b>
               We chose far fewer options than most 46 owners: no generator,
air conditioning furling main, electric winches, hydraulic furling
systems or bow thruster.
               <br/>
               In retrospect, the
               <b>
                bow thruster
               </b>
               is a good idea on a boat
of this size and displacement, and we will probably install one
when we sail back to New Zealand in 2002.
               <br/>
               Instead of the optional generator, we installed a total of four
8-D

                gel batteries
               </b>

               with a Balmar 135 amp,
24 volt unit and retained the stock 50 amp, 12 volt alternator.
We chose not to utilize solar panels, and have found that one
hour per day of engine running in the tropics is sufficient for
battery charging.
               <br/>
               Instead of air conditioning, we had the yard install ten Hella
Turbo
               <b>
                fans
               </b>

               I had originally planned to install an expensive holding-plate

                refrigeration-freezer
               </b>
               system that would have run $10,000
installed. A friend who had just completed a three-year South
Pacific cruise aboard his HR 42 with the factory-installed Frigoboat
evaporator system convinced me to try it, saying that with over
3,000 of the units installed, the yard really knew what they were
doing. A bonus was that the cost was a fraction of the holding
plate system. We have been delighted with how well this very simple
system has worked, holding the freezer at 10 degrees F. in 82
degree water with a maximum of one hour of engine running per
day.
               <br/>
               I had the factory install
               <b>
                Autohelm ST-50
               </b>
               series instrumentation
that has worked well. I chose to install the Max prop and insulated
backstay upon commissioning in Seattle, thinking it would be less
expensive. In retrospect, I now really believe that the factory
only charges cost their cost for options and recommend that anyone
purchasing an HR have the factory install as much of the optional
gear as possible.

               In only 28 days of work from the time our Hallberg-Rassy 46
was unloaded from the freighter in Seattle, Amanda, a friend and
I commissioned the boat and were ready for our 10,000 mile shakedown
series of sail-training voyages to New Zealand. We installed the
mast, hardtop, SSB, VHF, weatherfax, INMARSAT-C, radar, watermaker,
additional batteries, inverter and high-output alternator. This
was the first huge difference in time spent outfitting between
purchasing a used boat and a new boat specifically designed and
built for ocean voyaging. The second major difference has been
how little time we have spent making repairs over the past 42,000
miles and four years of hard sailing.
              </p>
              <p>
               In six months this summer we sailed 11,000 miles in eight legs
from Victoria, Canada, through the Panama Canal, to the Caribbean,
across to the Azores, Ireland, up the west coast of Ireland and
Scotland, across the North Sea to Norway. We ended our cruise
on Sweden's West Coast at the Hallberg-Rassy yard. Many people
asked if the boat would be ready for a major refit after so many
miles, but our list was short: replace a couple of hatch seals,
re-bed the windlass and service the forced air furnace. We had
hoped to have a bow thruster installed, but with a two-year backlog
of orders on most models, this wasn't possible.
              </p>
              <p>
               The sailing performance has been very good, we are able to
comfortably sail 160-180 miles per day, even in very modest winds.
Our best 24-hour run to date is 200 miles, close-reaching in 35-45
knot winds from Rangiroa in the Tuamotus to Papeete, Tahiti. More
impressively, we have found that this design can sail to windward
into 30-40 knot tradewinds at over seven knots without pounding.
We have twice experienced winds over 65 knots and seas over 30'
in the edge of the Roaring Forties between Auckland and the Austral
Islands and have found that the HR 46 will heave-to in these conditions,
although we prefer to run or close-reach.
              </p>
              <p>
               In retrospect, I know we made the right decision. The HR 46
has met our requirements and has proven a comfortable home. It
has been a delight to spend our time teaching, hiking, snorkeling,
and meeting people ashore, instead of making repairs. Having a
boat that is fun and fast to sail has meant that we have enjoyed
going for daysails, tacking through narrow passes and into anchorages
instead of motoring.
