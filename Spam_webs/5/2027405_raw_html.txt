         We've all heard of Out of Commission's infamous mascot, The Commissioner. But, very few people know of the humble beginnings from which he rose. This will be the first installment in a series of stories about the legendary commissioner - Al CUPone.
        </pre>
        <h3>
         Al CUPone: Origins
        </h3>
        <p>
         May 2nd, 1920, Herbert and Marie CUPone were tragically kidnapped from their home and were murdered in cold blood, during a gruesome game of beer pong. Al, only a young cup at the time, had his entire world flipped onto a table. Having just lost his uncle Vinny in The Great Kegger of 18, Al was left an orphan without anyone to support him.
        </p>
        <p>
         He grieved for months; spending what little money he had left on essentials for survival. He needed to find a source of income before he would be kicked out into the cold aisles of the supermarket. After being evicted by the supermarkets manager, Al was left homeless and desperate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Al checked his pockets, only 25 cents left. He figured hed fill himself with a drink one last time before settling in an alley for a long, dark night. He approached the back entrance of a local market,which was a front for a well-known speakeasy, called Fat Tonys. He stumbled to the door, knocking with three distinct pounds. Barry Beerbong, one of Als childhood friends, opened the door with a smile,
        </p>
        <p>
         Whats up Al? Here to have a cold one?
        </p>
        <p>
         Yeah Barry, figured Id spend da last of my money on some drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
         Barry and Al sat down at the bar, and ordered two Fat Tonys Famous Brews. They reminisced of childhood memories and current misfortunes, as Barry consoled Al on the death of his parents.
        </p>
        <p>
         What am I gonna do Barry? I aint got no money, I aint got no home, and I aint got no girl.
        </p>
        <p>
         Barry reached over, softly touched Als rim, and said,
        </p>
        <p>
         Dont worry pal. I got just the guy for you to meet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Barry pointed towards a large man dressed to the 9s sporting a gold cane and a cigar. He was surrounded by the most beautiful women in the club, and it was evident that he was a man of importance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thats Fat Tony himself. If you didnt already know, he owns this joint and many others alike. Fat Tony is the richest guy in town, and if you know him, money is sure to come your way. 
        </p>
        <p>
         What would a guy like that wanna do with a cup like me?
        </p>
        <p>
         You got a lot of good qualities, Al. Youre smart, bright red, hold 16 ounces of liquid, and you sure can take a flippin. All them things would be quite useful to a man like Tony. Go over there and introduce yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
         Al nervously sauntered over to Fat Tonys table and cleared his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
         Umm, excuse me sir. My name is Al CUPone and I heard that you could potentially have some work for me.
        </p>
        <p>
         Who sent you to me?
        </p>
        <p>
         Al nervously pointed towards Barry Beer Bong, and Barry shat on the floor with a smile. Fat Tony looked at Al and said, Barrys always been scared shitless of me. But hes a good loyal kid, ya know? Al looked at his feet and sighed as he proceeded to tell Tony about his recent tragedies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fat Tony, I really need some work. I will literally do ANYTHING for you. I would even clean up after Barry for you right now!
        </p>
        <p>
         I dont know son, I dont give any jobs to cups I dont know. All I know about you is that youre red and your parents are dead. Its sad and all but pity dont get you paid. You gotta be strong, boy. Now, go clean up Barrys shit.
        </p>
        <p>
         Al stumbled over towards the pile of excrement and started to wipe it down. Moments later, chaos erupted in the front of Fat Tonys Club. The sound of police sirens filled the room and the partiers frantically abandoned their drinks and pursued the exit. In a moment of courage, Al sprinted to the bar and poured every drop of alcohol over his rim, leaving no remains. Sergeant Mike Hunt searched the bar up and down, but it was to no avail. All he found was a half cleaned pile of shit, and wrote them a ticket for a minor health code violation.You got lucky this time, Fatty, Hunt muttered.
        </p>
        <p>
         Go fuck yourself ya rat bastard, and get the fuck out my club, Fat Tony said with a victorious grin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sergeant Hunt and his gang left the club, and Tony looked toward young Al with an approving smile. He puffed his cigar, pointed at the young cup, and said, you just got yourself a job, kid.
        </p>

         The majority of people in the United States like or follow at least one sports team. Some of the most popular sports in the country include baseball, football, basketball, hockey, and more. I believe that I am one of the biggest sports fans on the face of the earth, and the main reason for this is the area that I live in. New York (especially the big Apple) is a mecca of sports and entertainment and it is home to some of the greatest sports franchises in existence. The Yankees have the most championships of any franchise in all sports with 27 World Series victories, the Giants are tied for 5th overall in the NFL with 4 Super Bowl Victories, and the Knicks and Rangers are two of the most valuable franchises in their respective sports. There have been many wonderful athletes to play for our teams throughout the years, and I have been blessed to be able to see some of them play myself. I could easily name 100 wonderful athletes to play for New York teams, but in this article I focus on the 5 that I see as the most beloved.
        </p>
        <h4>
         5. Patrick Ewing
        </h4>
        <p>
         The New York Knicks have been one of the least successful franchises in New York. However, they have the highest worth of any team in the NBA. They are now worth around $3 billion which is the highest of any team in the NBA. Playing in New York City at Madison Square Garden, the Worlds Most Famous Arena, has allowed them to reach the top of the league in terms of worth. Since the 1990s, the Knicks have accomplished nearly nothing. They have had some good players since then, such as Carmelo Anthony, but none of these players compare to the retired great Patrick Ewing. Ewing was named an all star 11 times, played on the Dream Team in the 1992 Olympic Games, and brought the Knicks to the NBA Finals in 1994 for the first time since 1973. Unfortunately, The Houston Rockets won the series. However, what makes Ewing so special is that he has been the only player since Clyde Frazier in 1973 to lead the Knicks to a finals appearance, and he will always be loved for that.

        <h4>
         4. Mark Messier
        </h4>
        <p>
         The New York Rangers are one of the most respected franchises in the NHL. They have only won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1933 and in 1994, but they still remain a very competitive team year after year. Last season, the Rangers lost in the Stanley Cup Finals in 5 games to the Los Angeles Kings. Die hard fans, such as myself, are dying for a victory this year as we are a top 3 team in the NHL. Because 1994 was the last time we won the cup, we constantly look at that team to remember what the Rangers are all about. Mark Messier, The Captain, was the best player on that 1994 squad the beat the Vancouver Canucks in the Finals. Because of this, Messier is a god to all Ranger fans and will be forever. Ryan McDonagh, the current captain, would certainly like to earn a legacy like Messiers.

        <h4>
         3. Lou Gehrig
        </h4>
        <p>
         Lou played for the Yankees in the 1920s and 1930s. His rookie season was in 1923, and he would play 15 more for the Yanks, leading them to 6 World Series Titles. At the end of his retirement, he had the record for most consecutive games played in the MLB (2,130). This record was later broken by Cal Ripken Jr. Gehrig batted .361 lifetime in the World Series, making him a hero to all Yankee fans. Unfortunately, in 1939, the Iron Horse was diagnosed with ALS. He would later give his Luckiest Man Speech which remains one of the most significant speeches in sports history to this day. In 1941, Gehrig passed away, and ALS was nicknamed Lou Gehrigs Disease.

        <h4>
         2. Babe Ruth
        </h4>
        <p>
         Even the biggest geeks in the world know who Babe Ruth is. He is arguably the most famous baseball player of all time, as well as one of the greatest. As seen in the classic movie The Sandlot, one would be willing to get attacked by a huge angry dog than to lose a baseball signed by the Babe himself. Babe is known to have been a party animal, who loved food, ladies, and hitting home runs. He hit 714 life time home runs, which was a record that was not broken until 1974. Babe played for the douchebag Boston Red Sox and won 3 Championships as their best player. However, in 1919, the owner of the Sox Harry Frazee was in desperate need of cash. The Yankees bought the rights to Babe for only $100,000. The Red Sox did not win another title until 2004. This drought is known to us today as the Curse of the Bambino which was his nickname. He ended up winning 4 Championships with the Yankees, and dominating the MLB for all of those years. Because of his stellar play, Yankee Stadium was given the nickname The House that Ruth Built. Babe remains a legend to this day.

        <h4>
         1.Derek Jeter
        </h4>
        <p>
         If you hate Derek Jeter, you are a piece of garbage. He has incredible stats and accolades, World Series Titles, and all the girls he wants, and through it all he has remained incredibly humble. Derek Jeter won the World Series as the starting short stop his rookie year in 1996, and would win 4 more after that. He is the Yankees all time hits leader and was named the first Captain since Thurman Munson in 2003. These are ridiculously impressive statistics and accolades to have, and yet, he remains incredibly humble. He is said to give the girls he bangs goody bags when they leave his home in the morning, which shows how nice the dude really is. From 1996 to his retirement this past season, Jeter did not get in any trouble with the law or with the MLB, which is very impressive for a superstar athlete. Jeter is the benchmark for all young athletes, as he serves as the role model for being a god and yet humble. This upcoming season will not be the same without him, and he will be missed dearly by all baseball fans.

Meeting these guys would be a dream come true for any sports fan, as they have accomplished so much for their respective teams. Thats all I have to say about that. Macho Man out.

         For years I was unable to concentrate on any single task or pick up new skills. It was impossible for me to sit through boring lectures, or find the motivation to excel in school. I definitely wasnt stupid, but I wished that certain aspects of life would come easier.
        </p>
        <p>
         A couple of years ago In college, I was feeling especially down and low over a horrible semester. My grades were shit, my workouts sucked, and I wasnt doing as well with the ladies as I had hoped. Its safe to say I was pretty pissed off about everything. One night, in a drunken stupor, I found a movie on late-night TV, that would change my life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Limitless. A movie starring Bradley Cooper, in which an average Joe transforms into the ultimate badass overnight. Coopers character was unmotivated, unfocused and unwilling to change his life. Then, he turned it all around, simply by taking a pill. This obviously caught my attention.

         Yeah I know its just a movie, and I know movies exaggerate everything. But it got me thinking. The next day, me and my hangover surfed the web hoping to find a pill similar to the NZT-48 from the movie. After reading countless forums and blogs, I finally stumbled upon
         <a href="http://peaknootropics.com?affiliates=312">
          Nootropics
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Being a skeptic, I researched around the web non-stop trying figure out if these supplements could be as good as everyone said. Of course, some people said they were overrated, while others praised them. After about a week of contemplating, I said screw it, and bought some Nootropics.
        </p>
        <p>
         I got
         <a href="http://nootriment.com/aniracetam/">
          Aniracetam
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://nootriment.com/alpha-gpc/">
          Alpha GPC
         </a>
         , two supplements that synergistically increase each others potency. Together they were supposed to increase HGH levels, memory, cognitive ability, mood, focus and brain health. I was stoked. The day they came was like Christmas morning. I immediately mixed the recommend doses of both supplements in my shaker, and chugged away.
        </p>
        <h4>
         What happened:
        </h4>
        <p>
         Roughly 15 minutes later, my perception started to change. Just watching TV was more pleasurable. Sounds and colors came across in a way that I had never experienced. Everything was so crisp  I loved it. The best part was that they took the edge off of studying and learning. I no longer had to try to focus. It was like I had tunnel vision, there was absolutely no daydreaming in class, when I was working NOTHING else mattered. I was also able to retain the information I learned like never before.
        </p>
        <p>
         These bad boys also carried over to other aspects of life. Conversation just came easier. There was no anxiety when talking in front of people, and words just seemed to come to me on demand.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Side Effects:
        </h4>
        <ul>
         <li>
          A few headaches in the first week that quickly went away
         </li>
         <li>
          Slight decrease in appetite
         </li>
         <li>
          Alcohol tolerance went down (may have been from eating less)
         </li>
         <li>
          A badass short and long term memory
         </li>
         <li>
          Increased reaction time
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
         Conclusion:
        </h4>
        <p>
         Id highly recommend trying Nootropics for any student, athlete, or entrepreneur; The benefits far outweigh any bad side effects. Almost every person who has tried them reports cognitive enhancement as well as improved physical ability (reaction time). As a noob, you can get a great pre-dosed Nootropic formula like
         <a href="https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain/">
          Alpha Brain
         </a>
         . Personally, I prefer to buy bulk powders at
         <a href="http://peaknootropics.com?affiliates=312">
          Peak Nootropics
         </a>
         . This enables me to pick and choose exactly what I want in my stacks. Plus Peak Nootropics is known for having the highest quality Nootropic powders around.
        </p>
        <p>
         Think Nootropics are all hype? I did too; dont knock em till you try em.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you have any further questions on Nootropics, or want to tell me about your experience, feel free to comment.

         This Colombian Princess has been in the music scene since Nam. As a young kid, I always liked her for her catchy music and unique yodeling voice. However, I eventually hit puberty, became a horny bastard, and no longer liked her for her music. My liking for her became all about her perfectly shaped athletic booty, that all girls yearn for. Her hips do not lie.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 9: Scarlett Johansson

        <p>
         This dime piece has come a long way from one of her first acting roles in the shitty Home Alone 3. She played an ugly teenage older sister that did not even show any potential for the future. Holy fuck. That all changed so quickly. Now, it is nearly impossible to not get at least a half chub just looking at her.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 8: Sofia Vergara
        </h4>

        <p>
         Modern Family is a quality show, but in all honesty, half of its viewers are horny men looking to see Sofias hooters bouncing around California. Those titties are always exposed in the show, but the booty is a hidden gem that is only revealed once in a blue moon. Tan, shapely, and quite plump. Who the fuck knew?
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 7: Adriana Lima
        </h4>

         The only reason I watch the Victorias Secret Fashion Show every year is to see this babe walking down the runway in lingerie. She is a diamond in the rough, as many of the other VS models are 62 and built like 12 year old boys. Although her rump isnt gonna overwhelm you with size, its perfection cannot be ignored. I see her Brazilian Booty in my dreams. Hallelujah!
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 6: Jennifer Lopez
        </h4>

        <p>
         Jenny from the block has been in the game since I was in the womb. This Puerto Rican Mama remains a smoke show at age 45, but in her prime, she was blowing people away with her buns. Although it has shrunk in size since her heyday, these cheeks rival the best in the game.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 5: Iggy Azalea
        </h4>

         </a>
        </h4>
        <p>
         When she raps, it sounds like a mule being raped by an elephant. Her music literally gives me fuckin ear infections, yet, I put up with it for DAT ASSSSSS. This Australian Kangaroo hops around the US shaking her booty for all to see. Change my name to Joey, because I wanna live in that pouch.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 4: Coco Tea

        <p>
         Fake as fuck. However, I am fappin to that as we speak. Ice-Tea hits that with authority on the daily, and mixes his milk with her Coco Puffs for a delicious and nutritious breakfast. I would love to be a Special Victim to that booty.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 3: Nicki Minaj
        </h4>
        <p>

         If you didnt think this would be on the list, you were sadly mistaken. She takes a lot of heat for being fake, but nevertheless no real man would deny a face sit. I would eat her ass like a cupcake Saturday through Sunday Monday, Monday through Sunday, yo.
        </p>
        <h4>
         Number 2: Amber Rose
        </h4>

         Clearly, both Kanye and Wiz are on Team Ass for the legendary debate. Amber Rose: she may not be a household name, but her ass surely is the size of one. The twerking era is slowly dying down, but Ambers videos are always a nice treat.

         And last but certainly not least

         Oh my. New record Talentless. Annoying. Slutty. Who the fuck cares. This booty is not human. She is a goddess walking amongst mortals.

         If there are any funny comebacks that you think I missed (which there obviously are) feel free to comment and tell me about them. Until next time, stay classy bros.

         Smolov, the Russian squat routine that is the secret weapon in the arsenal of every serious lifter. In a mere 13 weeks people have boosted their squat by up to
         <strong>
          100
         </strong>
         pounds. Thats basically a body metamorphosis from this:

         Smolov was designed by legendary Russian sports master Sergey Smolov. And just like everything else Russian: Smolov is HARDCORE. I do not recommend this routine for the novice lifter; Smolov is created for serious lifters who need to take their game to the next level. A minimum of one year of dedicated training is a prerequisite for this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Smolov is PAINFUL, brutal even. This program is not for the faint of heart. It is for individuals absolutely determined to get results, even at the cost of agonizing mental pain. Surviving Smolov is for more than just the insane results, its for the unflinching confidence that comes along with it; the satisfaction of knowing that you are mentally and physically tougher than 99% of the population. Smolov is truly a test of ones manhood If you think youve got what it takes, read on and give Smolov a go.
        </p>
        <h4>
         How it works
        </h4>
        <p>
         Smolov is split into 4 separate phases totaling 13 weeks of brutal work.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Phase 1 (weeks 1-2):
         </strong>
         An introduction into the hell that you will soon be facing. In the intro phase you will squat every other dayslowly working up to a heavy singleand stretching a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Phase 2 (weeks 3-6):
         </strong>
         Now the fun begins. This is the base cycle where you will be squatting FOUR times a weeks for the next three weeks. Monday: 4 sets of 9. Wednesday: 5 x 7. Friday: 7 x 5. Saturday: 10 x 3. The weight you use will increase each workout and each week. Following these three weeks you will have a semi-rest week, where you will only squat once with the goal of setting a new PR.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Phase 3 (weeks 7-8):
         </strong>
         By this point your body is done. Your legs have basically reached their human limit. Smolov plans for this. In phase 3 you will get 2 well-deserved deload weeks. Here you will focus on recovery, while keeping your legs in prime shape. But dont get too comfortable, were about to unload the dog shit.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Phase 4 (weeks 9-13):
         </strong>
         The intensity cycle. Henceforward your definition of pain will forever be the image of you squatting. God may come down and ask you if he can work in a set. Here you will squat 3 times a week at high percentages of your max. Click

        </p>
        <h4>
         Things to avoid
        </h4>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Dont be an idiot. Listen I live for partying, but Smolov is a commitment. Its not for the weekend warrior whos gonna go out and drink four nights a week. Youll just piss your
          <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gains">
           gains
          </a>
          right away.
         </li>
         <li>
          Not sleeping right. Having a solid sleep schedule will be crucial to your success with Smolov. This routine will be the center of your life for 13 weeks; you must shape everything else you do around your squatting. Without proper sleep you will be destined for failure.
         </li>
         <li>
          Not eating enough. This is one of the only times I will tell you to engage in the see food diet. Literally eat whatever you can get your hands on, your body will need it. Dont even worry about picking up a few ounces of fat, your body will be in such a carnivorous state that everything will be picked up as fuel. Ive talked to people whove told me that the only thing that got them through Smolov was a tub of ice cream each night.
         </li>
         <li>
          Absolutely no deadlifting, your lower body will not be able to handle it. And dont even worry about your deadlift numbers going down, Ive seen many people who have actually increased their deadlift by 50+ pounds during Smolov. Ideally, I would recommend almost no other training during Smolov, it takes THAT much out of you. That being said, you can benchand do other upper body workat your own risk.
         </li>
         <li>
          Missing workouts. It will suck. There will be days when you have no desire to squat whatsoever, but you will have to. Blast some music, slap yourself silly, scream, whatever you have to do, do it.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
         Things to do
        </h4>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Squat (duh)
         </li>
         <li>
          Eat
         </li>
         <li>
          Drink lots of milk (preferably whole)
         </li>
         <li>
          Stretch/ foam roll
         </li>
         <li>
          Get a partner  you may need a bro (preferably a stud) to motivate you on those days when you feel like you cant walk.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
         What to realistically expect
        </h4>
        <p>
         Bigger guys will usually gain more than smaller guys. A 100 pound gain is not realistic for someone weighing 165, squatting 315. But gains in the 60 pound range are surely possible. If you cannot yet squat at least 300, I would seriously recommend doing a routine like
         <a href="http://stronglifts.com/5x5/">
          Stronglifts 55
         </a>
         first. Since Smolov works off of percentages, someone with a squat under 300 pounds is in danger of working with numbers extremely close (or even above) their max. Plus if you cant squat in the 3s yet you still have a lot of room to grow with a linear program, no need for this advanced shit yet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another lovely side effect of Smolov is how it will make your bod look. Many people doing Smolov gain muscle while losing fat, so expect a huge transformation.

         Remember Smolov is not for the average dude, it is for the strong-headed, tough-as-nails type  who refuses to quit. If you survive Smolov, you will be part of a select group of hard

         What exactly is a stud? Who qualifies to be called one? How do I become one? All great questions. Mr. Studly is here to help
         <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stud">
          Urban Dictionary
         </a>
         defines a stud in the following ways:
        </p>
        <p>
         1) a small piece of metal, often bolt shaped (seen often on belts and such). 2) a small earring with a rounded top often used for piercing and worn by both men and women. 3) a male animal desirable for breeding (like a racehorse). 4) a guy who is popular with the ladies and has no trouble getting laid, and who may also be attractive-looking, but not always. 5) a butch lesbian.

         4: Dan Bilzerian
        </h3>
        <p>
         This man needs no introduction. Dan Bilzerian is the multimillionaire, Navy Seal trained, poker playing King of Instagram. Bilzerian is a gift from God to all non-studs who get to live vicariously through him. His Instagram is an endless fountain of sexy girls, guns, and mula.

         3: Hugh Hefner
        </h3>
        <p>
         We all knew this was coming. Hugh Hefner is an urban legend, the godfather of all modern playboys (and of course the magazine). The lifestyle he lives is absurd; but a fairy tale to us mere mortals. Hugh has changed the world for the better, and for that, we thank you old buddy.

         2: Genghis Khan
        </h3>
        <p>
         The war lord, the pillager, the ancestor of .5% of all men. Yes, you heard that right. Genghis khans seed has spread so far that over 16 million men can trace their lineage to his dong. You thought Wilt Chamberlain slayed a lot? Impregnating women was Genghis day job.

         Mr. Studly can not be defined. His

          steeze
         </a>
         is unreal. His swagger is off the charts. His number of conquests are unfathomable. He is the stud of all studs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now it is your job to further your research into these legendary figures, and hopefully, follow in their footsteps.

         Comment and tell me if I missed someone who shouldve made the list.
