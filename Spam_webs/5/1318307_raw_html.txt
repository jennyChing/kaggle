                        PREAMBLE: We believe that these questions will lead to final answers and help uncover the real events that occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary on 12/14/2012. We hope that these fair questions will lead to either corroborating or exculpatory evidence that will provide a clearer picture of the events surrounding that tragic day. We believe all these questions should be thoroughly investigated and dispositioned until final determination can be made as to whether any further criminal charges should be made in this citizens investigation of the Sandy Hook Event.

                       What if someone other than Adam Lanza is responsible for the death of 20 innocent children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook- wouldnt you want to know who the evil, lying perpetrators are so that justice can be served as soon as possible? We invite you to ask these questions so that we can prosecute the real killers and bring justice to those who were sacrificed.

cut out and edited without placing the redactions notices on the vids\74br /\76As they just got tired as there were so many times the crew got on camera \74br /\76So they just did cuts instead and

                             This is absolutely stupendous compendium Tony, magnificent work.  But note there's yet other questions: why are the officials committing criminal offenses, REFUSING to make public otherwise harmless info, and why are they not being prosecuted, and why isn't the mainstream media reporting upon it?  Thanks again.

                             <br/>
                             I think the redactions and the redacted fbi report texts not written yet
                             <br/>
                             So that is why you cannot see them yet.
                             <br/>
                             And  I think they will come out when they have finished collecting all the data on sandy hook hoax researchers questions that hold water
                             <br/>
                             So they can say look it really did happen
                             <br/>
                             as they answer all the points we make
                             <br/>
                             Lol
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Also it occurred to me the redaction blackouts on video
                             <br/>
                             Were when a producer walks into view or a parent extra
                             <br/>
                             walks into view
                             <br/>
                             While they are organising telling people what to do next
                             <br/>
                             You walk over and get the pizzas and then walk over towards the cam
                             <br/>
                             You two come in from the left
                             <br/>
                             Lol
                             <br/>
                             This was use of blackout with the words redacted was only the case with the earlier redaction video blackouts covering up the crew organising it all from getting on police cams
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             But the later parts after 12 pm, they stop bothering with covering up these edits with the blackout and word redacted
                             <br/>
                             as you see that people and officers  just start popping out of nowhere which shows edits cut and
                             <br/>
                             Splices were made in the video footage
                             <br/>
                             And that was also for the same reason as before
                             <br/>
                             but they just cut out and edited without placing the redactions notices on the vids
                             <br/>
                             As they just got tired as there were so many times the crew got on camera
                             <br/>
                             So they just did cuts instead and spliced because they were sick of the laborious job of putting the blackout screen with the word redacted on them into view.

                             You point on the mainstream media obeying Vnaces order
                             <br/>
                             Is TOTALY WRONG
                             <br/>
                             They DID the exact opposite and should have been prosecuted like HE , Lt Vance said anyone who posts information reportedly coming from us that does not come from us , will be prosecuted!
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             As the information the media was getting contradicted Vance and was not coming from His people
                             <br/>
                             But from people claiming to be delivering official information and from people claiming to be close to the investigation
                             <br/>
                             When evidently their information contradicted what vance said
                             <br/>
                             As Vance knows,  when he had to correct the so called official sources
                             <br/>
                             giving  the numerous disinformation to the media
                             <br/>
                             That were reporting it wilfully ignoring Vance's warning NOT TO DO SO
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             So Vance's s threat was made towards just what the media did
                             <br/>
                             The media
                             <br/>
                             Gave out  disinformation that was claiming to come from Lt Vance's  department but was contradicting him and was proven by him to be false information .
                             <br/>
                             What the media engaged in Was
                             <br/>
                             Exactly what Lt Vance said would be punished and prosecuted
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             So in short your point about the media in your article
                             <br/>
                             Of the media obeying Vance s incorrect
                             <br/>
                             They set about to wilfully disobey his warning
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             And the various media  responsible for the stream of constant disinformation from sources claiming to be from Vance's department , should be in jail, as should the so called official sources that gave them the constant numerous never ending feeds of disinformation .

                             Erik your theory that the Parkers moved 15 times all over the USA
                             <br/>
                             For witness relocation is I am afraid to say not logical
                             <br/>
                             Because if the Parkersburg were in witness relocation why on earth would they be showing their faces all over the tv to the entire nation ad nauseom
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             And if you then say, well maybe the parkers we see on tv and not the same parkers
                             <br/>
                             Why then would the fake Parker mother make a point of saying they have moved 15 times to lead people to think like you have? That they are in witness relocation?
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Sorry that really does not make logical sense and it is the big hole that pops up in your witness relocation theory
                             <br/>
                             Makes no sense to me that any of these families would go on tv if they are trying to protect their identities from people who might want to kill them.
                             <br/>
                             Or even if they have actors playing them on tv
                             <br/>
                             Why draw ANY and I mean AnY attention to themselves at all?!!!
                             <br/>
                             It defeated to the whole point of witness protection and protecting the ids of those in witness protection!!
                             <br/>
                             And surely everyone can agree with one thing, these alleged families of victims  certainly made their names and faces known and their stories!
                             <br/>

                             It is important to properly analyse the story of Ryan lanzas arrest
                             <br/>
                             The New Jerseyolice are meant to be shocked to see Ryan Lanza
                             <br/>
                             And by accident took him into custody
                             <br/>
                             Now it is important to understand the story, they are meant to be shocked to see Ryan Lanza
                             <br/>
                             Because we are meant to believe the New Jersey police were either
                             <br/>
                             1 told that the dead body in the school had been ID as Ryan Lanza and they had a picture of what he looked like
                             <br/>
                             Or
                             <br/>
                             2 the police got this information by watching the media reports
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Now this is where and why this is important.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             1 there is no evidence that the police either in New Jersey or Newtown recovered any ID next to the body in the school that led them to believe the body was that of Ryan Lanza
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Why?
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Well because the media story only came out After the New Jersey police had arrested him
                             <br/>
                             The media story which stated that Ryan lanzas was ID mistakenly as the killer
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             But and this is the clincher
                             <br/>
                             No where is there any official record of the police stating as fact that Ryan lanzas ID was found in the school
                             <br/>
                             And most importantly
                             <br/>
                             The information that the ID of Ryan Lanza was found next to the body
                             <br/>
                             Came from Ryan Lanza himself after his arrest and release from questioning
                             <br/>
                             When, the media asked him WHY he had been arrested
                             <br/>
                             Ryan Lanza said maybe they found my ID in the school
                             <br/>
                             This is soooooo important
                             <br/>
                             As it is I believe a mistake they made
                             <br/>
                             What you have to realise is that there was no reason from the New Jersey police to be looking for the dead body in the school walking around in New Jersey
                             <br/>
                             And there was no reason for them to at that time believe that dead person was Ryan Lanza and also there was no reason for them to know what Ryan Lanza looked like so they could ID him him in a fluke that was his fluky arrest just walking down a road
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             You see?
                             <br/>
                             The media reports only came after his arrest
                             <br/>
                             And the ID story
                             <br/>
                             Came  after the arrest!
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             So how and why were they shocked to see Ryan Lanza
                             <br/>
                             And what reason did they have to think he was the dead body in the school?
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             There is no reason at allllll!!!!!!!
                             <br/>
                             Also there is no excuse and no reason at all
                             <br/>
                             For any mistake in identifying the body in the school
                             <br/>
                             As there was no ID to make that mistake
                             <br/>
                             That would lead them to that mistake!!,

                             It is beyond me why people continue to focus on sketchy theories, when they should should first focus on the CSP Report, which completely contradicts the official story:
                             <br/>
                             1) Suppl. DNA report excludes Lanza's DNA from trigger, stock and pistol grip of the weapon;
                             <br/>
                             2) Suppl. DNA report identifies an envelope left on Nancy's body addressed to the Students of Sandy Hook elementary - the DNA matched a NY state felon, whose inmate number was included;
                             <br/>
                             3) Lanza supposedly shot himself directly in the "BACK" of his head!!!!!  Have you ever heard of someone committing suicide this way???
                             <br/>
                             4) Witness descriptions of shooter clearly identify at least 3 different individuals
                             <br/>
                             5) gun that killed Nancy was completely wiped clean
                             <br/>
                             6) Officer who heard Nancy HYammond's description of a med build/5'8" shooter with a black mask, immed. stated he knew there was a second shooter b/c this did not meet the description of Lanza who's body he had just seen in room 10...
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             There are many more.  Stop speculating!!!!!!!  Stick to the facts identified in the OFFICIAL report which specifically contradict the official story.  The speculation is the reason no one pays attention...

                                   Also. Per the report
                                   <br/>
                                   That each family had a police man living with them 24 hours in their houses
                                   <br/>
                                   I just thought of something that could explain this
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>
                                   What if the real fathers of the victims were infact all The assigned police men?
                                   <br/>
                                   And that is why they were said to have movies into the families homes?
                                   <br/>
                                   And the tv dads were actors?

                                   The story of Ryan's arrest is included in the official report
                                   <br/>
                                   And therefore is crucial
                                   <br/>
                                   The story of the ID was in the media and came from Ryan after he was released from arrest
                                   <br/>
                                   It was entirely Ryan's speculation as to the reason he was arrested
                                   <br/>
                                   But the fact is Ryan's ID was not found in the school
                                   <br/>
                                   So the question remains why did the police think Ryan was the body in the school
                                   <br/>
                                   If they could not ID the face because of injuries?
                                   <br/>
                                   And if they could ID the face, the. Why release a phot of Ryan to the New Jersey police as say this is the dead man we have here in the school
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>
                                   The New Jersey police did not get this story from the media as the media only reported on it after Ryan's arrest
                                   <br/>
                                   The New Jersey police were told Ryan was dead in the school
                                   <br/>
                                   They had no reason to believe he would be casually walking down the street
                                   <br/>
                                   That is why hey describe being shocked to see him and called the FBI to take him in, as they thought it so important they didn't even want to take him back to their station themselves
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>
                                   The whole story is bullshit
                                   <br/>
                                   But it's in the report
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>
                                   There is no credible reason for the misidentification or transposing of the name of Ryan for Adam
                                   <br/>
                                   None whatsoever
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>
                                   And if they did think it was Ryan
                                   <br/>
                                   Why hadn't they first gone to Ryan's house
                                   <br/>
                                   To seal the scene?
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>
                                   They did not
                                   <br/>
                                   As far as I know
                                   <br/>
                                   They arrested him by accident thinking he was dead!
                                   <br/>
                                   <br/>

                             People talk about money laundering by all the funds
                             <br/>
                             Millions in funds
                             <br/>
                             I think seeing as the Catholic Church is broke
                             <br/>
                             This could be a way of them either getting money back
                             <br/>
                             Or paying out damages for abuse covertly
                             <br/>
                             And the fact they can kill a million birds with one stone is just luck
                             <br/>
                             They can do politics on gun control which is actually a cover for gun advertising
                             <br/>
                             And also do mental health stuff
                             <br/>
                             But all with the covert backing of the catholic Diocise , that feature ad the heart of CT NEwtown sandy hook New Jersey , and all the other shootings , Santa Barbra , Las Vegas, you name it
                             <br/>
                             Whoever, they have these things in every city, town, hamlet, village on earth, the vatican is everywhere
                             <br/>
                             And you have the top vatican lawyer defending abuse claims involved
