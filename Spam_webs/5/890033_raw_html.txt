   No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    They replicate quickly - okay, Windows does that.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system as they do so - okay, Windows does that.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk - okay, Windows does that too.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with valuable programs and systems. Sigh... Windows does that, too.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. Yup, that's with Windows, too.
   </li>
  </ul>
  Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental differences: Viruses are well supported by their authors, are running on most systems, their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.
  <p>
   So Windows is not a virus.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's a bug.
