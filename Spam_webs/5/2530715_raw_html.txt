      <p>
       Did you know that a coven of witches, means a gathering of 13 witches. Unfortunately, for some of us, a coven of witches can gather not just at Halloween, but at any time of the year. 
	Wife, mother-in-law, sister, niece, aunties, .... hmm that's a lot of witch power.
      </p>
      <p>
       English has many nouns which apply to either gender for example, child, spy, or even angel. Originally witch was one of these neutral 
	nouns, but increasingly, witch is a female preserve, and the equivalent male 
word became warlock.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other older words for witch, and they do have gender specific endings, wicca (male) and wicce (female). Curiously, the plural of wicca and wicce is wiccan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The oldest pre-Christian meaning for wicce and wicca includes fortune-teller as well as creator of sorcery, medicine and black magic. As with many ancient cults, most of the wiccan secrets were passed on 
by word of mouth. Then just when information started to be written down, witches were literally hunted down and killed, thus not much incentive for them to write things down! Indeed, the 't' first appears 
in the word wiTch in reference to witch hunts in the 16th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another 
		Anglo-Saxon documents have the spelling as 'Wica'. Many Saxon 
		tribes had a 'wise man' or a 'wise woman', who were consulted for potions 
		to cure illnesses. It was a natural development of human nature to 
		produce magic potions, which may (or may not) act as love charms, or 
		spells to satisfy peoples' desires.

       <li>
        Member Edna was a dog trainer by day, then by night she went

        When the coven travelled to an out-of-town gathering, Martha

        Celia tried to fly to the coven meeting, but her broomstick

        Celia asked Edna why she carried a pencil sharpener. 'It's to

      </h3>
      <p>
       Here is a true story; the Pendle Witches actually existed back in 
		England in 1612. The coven of thirteen Pendle witches even have names: Magaret 
		Pearson, Elizabeth Southerns, Jennet Preston, Alizon Device, Elizabeth 
		Device, James Device, Anne Whittle, alias Chattox, Anne Redferne, Alice 
		Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock and Isobel Robey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pendle Witches' modus operandi was to create an effigy of the victim, often 
		out of clay.They stuck pins in the effigy, and then 
		burnt it. The witches believed this would cause the victim to fall ill 
		and die. More importantly, the subject of their witchcraft 
		also believed in the power of the 'picture of clay'.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least 9 of the Pendle coven were hanged at the jail in Lancaster, 
		England in 1612. But before the women were hanged their accusers obtained 
		confessions. Here is an enlightening extract of how the coven of 
		witches went 
		about their evil trade in witchcraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anne Whittle, alias Chattox sayth, that one Robert Nutter, late of 
		the Greene-head in Pendle, was bewitched by this examinate, the said 
		Demdike, and widdow Lomshawe, (late of Burnley) now deceased. And she 
		further sayth, that the said Demdike shewed her, that she had bewitched 
		to death, Richard Ashton.

       Bloody Liz - Summon the Spirits
      </h3>
      <p>
       For this legend to work you need a darkened room with a big mirror. 
	When you are sitting comfortably light a candle, look into the mirror and 
	chant 'Bloody Liz' 13 times. (The number of witches in a coven.) 
	As you chant 'Bloody Liz' for the 13th time over your left shoulder you will 
	see a dark figure in a cloak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note 1: There were two 'Lizes', or Elizabeth's, amongst the coven of 
	Pendle Witches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note 2: Modern versions of the summons of the spirits use 'Bloody Mary' 
	instead of 'Bloody Liz'.

      </h3>
      <p>
       The bare facts are these, from June to September of 1692, nineteen 
		witches were hanged at the aptly named Gallows Hill, near Salem in 
		Massachusetts. 13 of those hung were women, coincidentally 13 is 
		the number of witches in a coven. The other 6 were men, but do 
		remember that at this time men were called witches rather than warlocks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us bear in mind that the Witchcraft trial took place against a 
		back-drop of 17th century Puritanism. What happened was that 
		6-year-old Betty Parris became ill in Salem. There is speculation 
		that she was poisoned by bread containing a fungus called ergot of rye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tituba, an Indian slave was a central figure in the saga. 
		Following pressure at her trial, Tibuta told tales of Satan instructing 
		her to do his work. At this distance, one has to speculate on 
		whether there was a language barrier here, did Tituba speak in English, 
		or were her words translated from a Native American dialect? The upshot of Tituba's 
	sensational confession was that the voices of those seeking to play down the 
	affair were drowned by those who thirsted after a good old Puritanical witch 
	hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       A feature of the Salem 
		Witchcraft Trials is how ordinary(ish) actions could be attributed to 
		witchcraft if that was what was in the accuser's mind. Once they rounded 
		up a few likely suspects, frail old women who liked to drink and acted 
		strangely, there was no holding the hunt for witches. In four 
		separate hanging parties, 19 men and women were sent to the gallows 
		between June and September 1692.
      </p>
      <p>
       It surprised me to learn that over 30 more suspects were rounded up 
		and tried for witchcraft, but these 30 were acquitted, thus the 
		Massachusetts Puritans seem to be true to their beliefs - even if those 
		beliefs were flawed as judged by history.

       Oudewater Witches
      </h3>
      <p>
       South of Utrecht in Holland is the infamous town of Oudewater, where some of the 
		world's strangest witch trials were held in the late 1500's. The accused 
		women 'were weighed on scales in the Heksenwaag (Witches' Weigh House), 
		Leeuweringerstraat 2, to determine whether or not they were witches' (Frommers). Why? Because it was widely believed at the time that witches had no 
		souls and weighed nothing, thus they could fly on brooms through the air 
		effortlessly. If you visit this town today you can be weighed and 
		receive a certificate (if you weigh enough) that states you are Not a 
		witch!

       Evesham Witches 1410
      </h3>
      <p>
       Afterwards, perhaps one of these ladies, wishing to get some spite 
	against one of the gentlemen, will ride away in a heavy riding-cloak, the 
	hood over her head and a peaked hat on that, and she will call upon a witch. 
	The witch will answer the rapping at her humble door, and will come out, 
	dressed in a country dress - just an ill-fitting gown and hood, with some 
	attempt at classical ornament on the gown, or a cloak sewn with the sacred 
	initials thrown over her back. These two will bargain awhile for the 
	price of a leaden image to be made in the likeness of the ill-fated 
	gentleman, or, rather, a rough figure, on which his name will be scratched; 
	then the puppet will be cast into the fire and melted while certain evil 
	charms are spoken, and the malicious accident required to befall him will be 
	spoken aloud for the Devil's private ear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly some woman sought a witch near Evesham, England in the year 
	1410, and bought certain intentions against a tailor of that place, Badby by 
	name; for this much is certain: that the tailor was burnt for Lollardy ten 
	years after the first victim for Lollard heresy, William Sawtre.

       Modern Day Witches and Witchcraft in India

       Will and Guy were horrified to learn that witchcraft is still practiced 
		in India in the 21st century. What seems to happen is that when 
		disaster strikes, as it often does, there is something in the human 
		nature that wants to blame someone. In 'civilised' societies the 
		finger of blame is usually, and often rightly, pointed at a politician. 
		However, in rural and 'uncivilised' areas of India and Africa, people 
		vent their anger at an aged crone. As a result elderly, helpless 
		and often friendless woman are accused of witchcraft and held 
		responsible for all manner of local tragedies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately blame and finger pointing escalates into attach and even 
		murder of the poor unfortunate old woman. In 2008 one attack in 
		Assam resulted in two 'witches' being killed, beheaded and their skulls 
		paraded in the streets. In a neighbouring area other 'witches' 
		were stoned and buried alive for cursing someone who was a friend of the 
		village chief.
      </p>
      <p>
       As ever the way forward is education. And this is why the syllabus 
		for Indian schools has been altered to change perceptions of 
		witch-hunts. One surprising argument is that witch-hunts are 
		little more than a justification for culling the older women because 
		they can no longer bring anything to the community. This is why 
		the same study proposes that old women should be given bigger pensions 
		because would make them valuable to their families thus they would 
		protect rather than persecute old women.

       The significance of a witches broomstick, or should it be witches' 
		broomsticks, is a fusion of several ideas.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        There is the plant fertility ritualwhere the women who plant the 
		crops and vegetables jump over the broomstick to urge the plants to grow 
		tall and strong.
       </li>
       <li>
        Linked to jumping over the broomstick is the idea that handfasting 
		couples would jump over the broomstick as part of a betrothal ceremony. 
		Hence the phrase 'living over the broomstick', meaning living together 
		but married.
       </li>
       <li>
        Witches are supernatural beings who need to fly, thus the broomstick 
			becomes the perfect vehicle for travelling to and from the 
			after-life.
       </li>
       <li>
        Allied to this mystic idea is the use of the broomstick for a 
			witch's spells and other mischief.
       </li>
       <li>
        A more mundane use of witches broomsticks is for leaping over 
			streams and other rural obstacles.
       </li>
      </ol>

       While witches traditionally ride broomsticks, the male 
			equivalent, warlocks, ride pitchforks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The raw material for fashioning broomsticks is witch-hazel. 
	Witches prefer besom brooms with their circular arrangement of bristles. 
	Modern brooms with their flat alignment of bristles maybe good for sweeping 
	leaves, but they are no good for witchcraft.

       A Witch's Familiar
      </h3>
      <p>
       Explaining a witch's 'Familiar' is a complex topic. It can mean an 
	assistant, who could help the witch by keeping a lookout, and give 
	warnings of interlopers. A familiar can also mean an alter ego that a 
	witch could change into and thus move around un-detected. In both of 
	these roles you could think of familiars as evil spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cats, particularly black cats, are the most form of a witch's familiar. 
	However, they could be other animals such as toads, owls or even mice. 
	The uglier the beast the more suitable is to be a familiar.

       </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Wookey* Hole, a cave near Wells in Somerset, England needed a new witch. 
	The Cottle family, who own the cave advertised for a witch. Over 3,000 
	witches applied, but it was Carole Bohanan who got the job and from now on 
	the she will be known as Carla Calamity, the Witch of Wookey Hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       The broomstick was passed by Jane Brenner, Wookey's witch for the past 
	six years. Mrs Brenner said: "We didn't want anyone who would scare the 
	children. We wanted a good witch to meet and greet people and act as an 
	ambassador for the attraction. This isn't just a cushy job." The contenders 
	were whittled down from 300 to a final 15 who included a photographer, a 
	dive master, an aromatherapist, a local journalist, a tattooist and a 
	stonemason.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Turner, another of the judges, was understandably nervous at the 
	consequences of failing to pick the right candidate. He said: "One candidate 
	is carrying around a bottle of her own urine. She drank half of it before we 
	could stop her."
      </p>
      <p>
       The original witch of Wookey Hole was an old woman who lived in the caves 
	with only a goat for company. According to legend the she was turned to 
	stone with a splash of holy water after a monk from Glastonbury came to 
	investigate complaints that she was casting spells on farm animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       * Guy thought that Wookey meant witch, but no he is wrong. Some 
	locals say that Wookey means a trap, while others claim that it's an old 
	word for a cave.

        Witches at Halloween
       </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Halloween is the witches favourite time of year. On the night of 
		Samhain, 31st October, witches gather in their coven. The purpose 
		of this meeting is to weave spells; for examples witches 
		cast spells to sever sour relationships and end bad situations. If 
		possible witches should create such destructive spells during the waning 
		phase of the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the three witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth were concerned with 
		predicting the future (Double, double toil and trouble). At Halloween, a coven of witches 
		traditionally focuses their attention on the spirits of the dead. 
		Indeed, this is where the black cat comes into the legend, for it is 
		believed that a witch can turn into a black cat and thus freely enter 
		the spirit world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Witches use the powers of the waxing moon to improve the efficacy of 
		good luck spells. For example, they use white candles for positive 
		energy and green candles for healing. Here is a witches spell to 
		cure nightmares: repeat this incantation 13 times:
      </p>
      <p>
       'Red leaves, gift from earth,
       <br/>
       Birth to death and death to birth,
       <br/>
       Keep all evil far away,
       <br/>
       Day to night and night to day.'
