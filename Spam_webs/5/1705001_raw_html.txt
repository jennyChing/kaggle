             - remembering who we have told things to. It turns out that our destination memory is weaker than our source memoryremembering the person from whom we have received information. That's why we repeat our stories to the same audience.
            </p>
            <p>
             The researchers explain that our poor destination memory may be due to the fact that we focus more attention on ourselves and the delivery of the message than our audience.

              "Story? Unforgettable. The Audience? Often Not"
             </a>
             by Benedict Carey discusses the findings of their experiments:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               In one experiment, they had 60 University of Waterloo students associate 50 random facts (a shrimps heart is in its head; 8 percent of men are color blind) with the faces of 50 famous people, like Madonna, Wayne Gretzky and Oprah Winfrey. Half of the students "told" each fact to one of the faces, reading it aloud when the celebritys picture appeared on a computer screen. The other half read each fact silently and saw a different celebrity moments afterward.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The students then took a memory test. They chose from face-fact pairs: those which they remembered from learning a fact, and those they remembered from reading facts out loud in the first phase of the study. The students who simulated telling the facts did 16 percent worse on the test than the students who were fed the facts while seeing celebrity faces.
              </em>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Understandably, our destination memory becomes even worse when we tell intricate and detailed stories that require more focus. However, if we want to improve the accuracy of our destination memory, we can remind ourselves whom we are addressing by saying the recipient's name.

             Media multitasking is increasingly common in this day and age. If all this flow of information makes it hard for you to pay attention and stay focused, you are not alone. According to new research by EyalOphir, Clifford Nass, and Anthony D. Wagner at Stanford University, people who multitask suffer from a weaker self-control ability. The following excerpt is from the
             <em>
              Scientific American
             </em>
             article
             <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=multitasking-mind" target="_blank">
              "Portrait of a Multitasking Mind"
             </a>
             by Naomi Kenner and Russell Poldrack:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               The researchers asked hundreds of college students fill out a survey on their use of 12 different types of media. Students reported not only the number of hours per week that they used each type of media, but also rated how often they used each type of media simultaneously with each other type of media. The researchers created a score for each person that reflected how much their lifestyle incorporated media-multitasking.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               They then recruited people who had scores that were extremely high or low and asked them perform a series of tests designed to measure the ability to control one's attention, one's responses, and the contents of one's memory. They found that the high- and low- media-multitasking groups were equally able to control their responses, but that the heavy media-multitasking group had difficulties, compared to the low media-multitasking group, when asked to ignore information that was in the environment or in their recent memory. They also had greater trouble relative to their counterparts when asked to switch rapidly between two different tasks. This last finding was surprising, because psychologists know that multitasking involves switching rapidly between tasks rather than actually performing multiple tasks simultaneously.
              </em>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             On the positive side, heavy media multitaskers may be better at reactive control when they are quick to respond to the relevant cues from the external world. This ability can be useful in the environments where things change fast. It also helps to build habits more easily in response to common situations.

             Various studies have explored the link between the ability to use more than one language and improved cognitive function and thinking. Now, for the first time, the research team appointed by the European Commission conducted an analysis of scientific literature, European and international, on this subject during the period of May 2008-June 2009 across all 27 EU Member States plus Norway and Turkey. The findings are described in the report

               One of the central cerebral areas highlighted in the research report is the one responsible for memory function. People rely especially on the short-term memory when thinking, learning and making decisions.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               "It is obvious that enhanced memory can have a profound impact on cognitive function, says David Marsh. -- This may be one reason why the multilingual shows superior performance in handling complex and demanding problem-solving tasks when compared to monolinguals. They seem to be able to have an advantage in handling certain thinking processes," March continues.

               It was assumed earlier that differences in the brain would only occur if a person is bi- or trilingual, that is with a very high command of different languages. The recently published research suggests, however, that changes in the brain's electrical activity may occur already in the beginnings of learning a new language.

             Perhaps, it's time to add learning a new language to your 2010 resolutions. It seems that the benefits are there regardless of whether you learn to speak it proficiently.

             What comes to mind if I ask you to imagine that you are at the following places:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              a bakery,
             </li>
             <li>
              a candle store,
             </li>
             <li>
              a hospital,
             </li>
             <li>
              a rose garden,
             </li>
             <li>
              a perfume counter?
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             One of your associations is likely to be the sensation of smell because all of the places above have strong aromas. Does it feel like you can almost smell them? Those aromas can quickly change your moods and emotions, and evoke memories. Why do odors play such a significant part in our emotional regulation?
            </p>
            <p>
             The sense of smell is the only one of the five senses directly linked to the limbic system  the center of emotions in the brain. According to
             <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0943685494?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thsehebomu-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0943685494">

             when we inhale a fragrance, the odor molecules travel up the nose where they are trapped by olfactory membranes, protected by the lining inside the nose. Each odor molecule fits into specific receptor cell sites. Each one of these hundreds of millions of nerve cells is replaced every 28 days. When this lining of nerve cells is stimulated by the odor molecules, it triggers electrical impulses to the olfactory bulb in the brain. The olfactory bulb than transmits the impulses to the gustatory center, responsible for our perception of taste, the amygdala, where emotional memories are stored, and other parts of the limbic system of the brain.

              What makes the sense of smell unique among the senses is that the brain reacts positively or negatively to an odor before identifying the source of the odor. That is, a person encounters a pleasing smell and his or her reaction is one of pleasure. Then, a second later, the person figures out that he or she had smelled lilacs. Visually, one sees a picture of a tree or a cow and first identifies the subject, and then determines whether or not he or she likes the picture. This is the opposite of the sense of smell; with smell emotional reaction comes first.

             As we all know, smells can also transport us into the past. In one of his studies, Dr. Hirsch discovered the number-one odor to evoke childhood memories. Can you guess what it is?
            </p>
            <div class="blockquote" style="margin-left: 40px;">
             <em>
              We looked at 989 people from 45 states and 39 countries, and found that the number-one odor that made people nostalgic for childhood was baked goods. After that, it depended on when and where they grew up. If they grew up on the East Coast of the United States, the smell of flowers made people nostalgic for childhood. In the South, it was the smell of fresh air; in the Midwest, the smell of farm animals; and in the West it was the smell of meat cooking or meat barbecuing.

             It turns out that environmental smells affect our behavior. In the same interview, Dr. Hirsch reports that people drive more aggressively on days when there is bad smell of air pollution, causing an increase in motor-vehicle accidents. Bad environmental odors tend to promote aggression, impede learning, and encourage school kids to misbehave.

             meeting? While others could interpret it as a sign that your mind was meandering aimlessly instead of paying attention, neuroscientists now provide us with the evidence to the contrary. It turns out that the daydreaming mind continues to solve problems, and doodling actually helps remember things better. The advice to 'sleep on it' isn't a bad idea either.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to a recent
             <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090511180702.htm" target="_blank">
              University of British Columbia study
             </a>
             , activity in numerous brain regions increases when our minds wander. Daydreaming activates both the brain's "default network," which is linked to easy, routine mental activity and the "executive network" - the brain areas associated with high-level, complex problem-solving. The findings support the notion that daydreaming, which can occupy as much as one third of our waking lives, allows us to shift our attention from routine tasks to work through more important problems in our lives. You may not be able to accomplish an immediate goal if you daydream, but you can come up with a creative solution to a life challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you feel the urge to daydream during a boring presentation and want to improve your concentration, try doodling. It may seem contradictory to the common perceptions, but doodling while listening can keep you on track with a boring task and help you remember details better. In a recently published
             <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090226210039.htm" target="_blank">
              study
             </a>
             , subjects given a doodling task while listening to a dull phone message had a 29% improved recall compared to their non-doodling counterparts.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, nighttime dreams can also help you solve problems.
             <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/01/050111183922.htm" target="_blank">
              A study conducted by the University of Alberta and the University of Montreal of 470 psychology students
             </a>
             revealed that dreams that occurred six to seven days after the remembered event often reflected "interpersonal interactions, problem resolution and positive emotions." These findings suggest that people continue to work through personal difficulties in dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sleep psychologists claim we have about six dreams each night during rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep). We often forget our dreams, but there are things we can do to recall dreams better and capture any creative ideas that emerged in the dream state:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              If you've been working on a problem for a while, bring it back into focus right before you fall asleep. Think about a question related to your problem that you'd like to get an answer to in your sleep.

              When you awake, don't get up immediately. Instead, lie quietly as you reflect on your dream. If you have trouble remembering your dreams, try waking up thirty minutes earlier.
             </li>
             <li>
              Have a dream journal next to you bed so that you could promptly record
any thoughts that came to you after you woke up. Don't censor, just
write down anything that comes to mind. Your ideas are often triggered
by your dream even if you can't remember the dream exactly. After all,
the contemporary scientific method was first reveled to Ren Descartes
in his dream, which he promptly recorded in his dream journal.
             </li>
             <li>
              You can later go over your dream journal again to see if any patterns, ideas, or insights emerge from your dream entries.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Finally, if you want your dreams to be more positive, try smelling something pleasant while you sleep.
             <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080921162021.htm" target="_blank">
              German researchers used specific volatile odorants with a negative or a positive smell ("rotten eggs" versus "roses") to stimulate subjects during sleep.
             </a>
             When the unpleasant odor was used, the subjects reported that the emotional coloration of the dream was predominantly negative. When they smelled the pleasant odor, their dreams had a positive coloration.

              "Now scientists have begun to examine how the city affects the brain, and the results are chastening. Just being in an urban environment, they have found, impairs our basic mental processes. After spending a few minutes on a crowded city street, the brain is less able to hold things in memory, and suffers from reduced self-control. While it's long been recognized that city life is exhausting -- that's why Picasso left Paris -- this new research suggests that cities actually dull our thinking, sometimes dramatically so."

              "Recent research by scientists at the Santa Fe Institute used a set of complex mathematical algorithms to demonstrate that the very same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory -- the crowded streets, the crushing density of people -- also correlate with measures of innovation, as strangers interact with one another in unpredictable ways. It is the 'concentration of social interactions' that is largely responsible for urban creativity, according to the scientists."

At the end of each training, researchers tested the participants fluid intelligence again. To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills, the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training.

               were striking. Although the control groups also made gains, presumably because they had practice with the fluid intelligence tests, improvement in the trained groups was substantially greater. Moreover, the longer they trained, the higher their scores were. All performers, from the weakest to the strongest, showed significant improvement.

              <em>
               advances in neuroscience suggest that there is no reason why your brain at 60 cant be as competent as it was at 25. That would not have been news to thinkers such as Socrates, Copernicus, and Galileo, who were all still at the peak of their intellectual powers in their sixties and seventies. Nor would it surprise business leaders such as Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffett, and Sumner Redstone. These icons and others like them have intuitively understood that the brains alertness is the result of what we call cognitive fitnessa state of optimized ability to reason, remember, learn, plan, and adapt that is enhanced by certain attitudes, lifestyle choices, and exercises. The more cognitively fit you are, the better you will be able to make decisions, solve problems, and deal with stress and change. Cognitive fitness will allow you to be more open to new ideas and alternative perspectives. It will give you the capacity to change your behaviors and forecast their outcomes in order to realize your goals. You can become the kind of person your company values most. Perhaps more important, you can delay senescence for years and even enjoy a second career.

            <p>
             The article goes on to suggest steps you can take to stay cognitively fit and discusses some implications of the brain research to learning. For example, the study of mirror neurons, which "aid the speed and accuracy of our perception by mentally simulating objects and actions in our environment," helps us understand how we can learn better through observation and indirect experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             The authors encourage play at work because play "engages the prefrontal cortexnourishing our highest-level cognitive functions  those related to incentive and reward processing, goal and skill representation, mental imagery, self-knowledge, and memory, just to name a few." They suggest playing games, such as bridge, chess, sudoku, solving challenging crossword puzzles, doing improvisation, reading funny books.
            </p>
            <p>
             Searching for patterns is another way to maintain your cognitive fitness: "First and foremost, challenge your existing mind-set, enlarge it, and make it more complex." The authors encourage executives to "[l]isten to different viewpoints, read new kinds of articles and books, and visit places with a focused set of learning objectives."
            </p>
            <p>
             Those who seek novelty and innovation through continuous learning benefit from neuroplasticity, the brains ability to change and enhance its performance. The article suggests learning a new language, musical instrument, or new technology.

             Even in this day and age when a lot of information is at your fingertips, memorization is still an essential component of learning. We just have to remember certain things, there is no way around it. The memory acts like a glue allowing us to put various pieces of information together and transform them into usable knowledge. So it is only appropriate to review various techniques that may help us remember things better. Some of them are well-known, others are more unique and often overlooked.

              when you need to memorize a sequence of items. First, you choose your memory palace, which can be any place or route that you remember well. Next, you place your thoughts or images that you want to remember next to the distinctive points in the rooms of your palace or along your route. Those points serve as memory hooks. When you need to recall the material, you mentally walk through the palace and collect the pieces of information that you left at each distinctive point.

              is a popular method of working with text to remember it better. PQ4R stands for Preview, Question, and four R's: Read, Reflect, Recite, Review. You begin with a preview of the text to get an idea of how the material is organized and what it is about. Next, you come up with questions about the text. Then, you read the text with your questions in mind and reflect on it, looking to connect the new material with what you already know. Later, you put away the text and recite the main points out loud in your own words. The final step is to review. Summarize the main points and test your comprehension with more questions.

The adrenal glands respond to the initial dose of stress by immediately releasing adrenalin, which can help your performance. Long-term stress, however, has the opposite effect. If the stress is severe or persistent, the adrenals release cortisol, which damages the neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is central to memory and learning.

              Question:
             </em>
             <br/>
             Oliver conveys Mountainacre to Jane and Todd as joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common. What estate has been created as a result of this transaction? Describe the four unities test at common law.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Answer:
             </em>
             <br/>
             The language of this conveyance created the joint tenancy with right of survivorship. To create the joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the four unities test must be met. The four unities are time, title, interest, and possession, meaning that the cotenants had to acquire their interests at the same time, under the same instrument and be entitled to the equal interest and possession of the entire estate.

             Is it possible to overlearn? How often do you need to take study breaks and how long should those breaks be?

              Wray Herbert at Were Only Human
             </a>
             reports on a study by Doug Rohrer and Harold Paschler that measured how well the participating students remembered the material tested at different times depending on their studying patterns:
            </p>
            <blockquote dir="ltr">
             <p>
              <em>
               University of South Florida psychologist Doug Rohrer decided to explore this question scientifically. Working with Harold Pashler of the University of California, San Diego, he had two groups of students study new vocabulary in different ways. One group drilled themselves five times; these students got a perfect score no more than once. The others kept drilling, for a total of ten trials; with this extra effort, the students had at least three perfect run-throughs. Then the psychologists quizzed all the students, once one week later and again three weeks after that.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               The results were interesting. When the students took the test a week later, those who had done the extra drilling performed better. But whatever edge the more effortful students had at one week had completely disappeared by four weeks.
              </em>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The scientists also researched the effect of the study breaks on memory:
            </p>
            <blockquote dir="ltr">
             <p>
              <em>
               Rohrer and Pashler also wanted to see if the scheduling of study breaks might make a difference in learning. It did. When the students took breaks ranging from five minutes to two weeks, those who had taken a one-day break performed best when they were tested ten days later. But if they were tested six months later (the laboratory equivalent of long-term learning), the optimal break time was a full month. In other words, as reported in the August issue of Current Directions in Psychological Science, massing all the study on a single topic together diminishes learning. Its better to leave it alone for a while and then return to it, and indeed the longer you want new learning to endure, the longer the optimal break between study sessions.
              </em>

             for Preview, Question, and four R's: Read, Reflect, Recite, Review.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Preview:
             </strong>
             <br/>
             You begin with a preview, in other words, you skim the table of contents, headings, subheadings, graphs and pictures to get an idea of how the material is organized and what it is about.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Question:
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Next, you come up with questions about the text. Look at the headings and decide what information you want to know.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Read:
             </strong>
             <br/>
             The next step is to read the text with your questions in mind. Did you get the answers?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Reflect:
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Reflect on what you just read. How is the new information related to what you already know? Think of the ways to test and apply your new knowledge. What kinds of problems could you solve with this information?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Recite:
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Next, put away the text and recite the main points, talk out loud about the material, try to use your own words to explain things and at the same time, incorporate new terms and definitions.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Review:
             </strong>
             <br/>
             The final step is to review. Summarize the main points and test your comprehension with more questions and hypotheticals.
            </p>
            <p>
             The PQ4R method is not a quick trick, but the benefit may be well worth the invested time.

             is a web site that provides information and resources about working memory, just like its title suggests. The term working memory refers to our ability to hold information in memory temporarily (for a few seconds) while we are solving a problem or performing a task. The site has a

             </a>
             . You do two exercises with progressively increasing levels of difficulty. The first exercise tests your ability to remember visual patterns. The second exercise focuses on the auditory information. Once you are done, you can compare your score with other peoples scores on similar working memory exercises. Are you ready to push your working memory to the limits?

             If you need to memorize a complex concept, try creating a memory collage. Heres how
             <a href="http://lawsagna.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/06/collage.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=325,height=372,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">

             </a>
             it works. Pick the key elements and relationships that describe the concept. Then, find images that you associate with those elements. You can browse magazines if you want to make it low tech or find images on the web if you want to create your collage in a digital format, or maybe, you can sketch them yourself. After you are done collecting your visuals, arrange them in a collage trying to reflect the relationships among the underlying elements. The benefit of a memory collage is that it allows you to see the concept as a whole whereas the verbal description can only be sequential.

             Thats because the adrenal glands respond to the initial dose of stress by immediately releasing adrenalin, which can help your performance. However, long-term stress has the opposite effect. If the stress is severe or persistent, the adrenals release cortisol, which damages the neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is central to memory and learning. Make sure you take

             them are there for pure entertainment. But fictional characters can do work for your memory as well. Heres how  with the story of the Crow.
            </p>
            <p>
             <u>
              Hypothetical:
             </u>
             <br/>
             One day, the Fox was sleuthing around the Foxacre when he saw the Raven perched in a tree with a piece of cheese in his beak. The Fox was hungry and came up with a plan to get the cheese from the Raven. The Fox deeded the Foxacre to the Raven so long as the Raven does not sing in his ugly voice on the Foxacre. The Raven, anxious to refute the criticism of his voice, set up a loud caw and dropped the cheese. Determine the types of interest conveyed and retained in the transaction. Who owns the Foxacre now?
            </p>
            <p>
             <u>
              Answer:
              <br/>
             </u>
             The Fox conveyed a fee simple determinable to the Raven and retained a possibility of reverter. When the Raven began to caw, the limitation stated in the conveyance occurred and the estate automatically reverted back to the Fox.
            </p>
            <p>
             The following phrase will help you remember the estate and the corresponding future interest:
             <br/>
             <span style="color: #ff0000;">

             everter.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you are familiar with
             <a href="http://www.aesopfables.com/cgi/aesop1.cgi?2&amp;TheFoxandtheCrow">
              the Aesop fable The Fox and the Crow,
             </a>
             this hypothetical can do a few things for you:
            </p>
            <p>
             The familiar scenario when the Crow (Raven in my hypo because the letter R stands for Reverter) caws and drops the cheese, which the Fox immediately gets, reinforces the idea that the fee simple determinable is automatically terminated once the stated condition is broken. The sneaky Fox gets both the cheese and the estate in my hypo.
            </p>
            <p>
             An additional benefit is the phrase that helps you to memorize the estate and the future interest.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you think of any scenarios from books or movies that inspire you to create your own memorable hypothetical for a flashcard?

              in a landmark paper, researchers announced that they had coaxed the human brain into growing new nerve cells, a process that for decades had been thought impossible, simply by putting subjects on a three-month aerobic-workout regimen. Other scientists have found that vigorous exercise can cause older nerve cells to form dense, interconnected webs that make the brain run faster and more efficiently. And there are clues that physical activity can stave off the beginnings of Alzheimer's disease, ADHD and other cognitive disorders. No matter your age, it seems, a strong, active body is crucial for building a strong, active mind.

              In fact, many memory complaints have nothing to do with the actual ability of the brain to remember things. They come from a failure to focus properly on the task at hand, many times due to emotional and stress-related distractions. If you want to learn or remember something, concentrate on just that one thing. The harder the task, the more important it is to tune out distractions. Make more of an effort not to let yourself get distracted until youve finished what you have to do.

             Today I offer yet another approach to reviewing  Ill call it transformations. The idea is to transform the material presented in one format into a different format and engage your

              multiple intelligences
             </a>
             in the process. Here are some examples:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Linguistic intelligence.
             </strong>
             Make a list of the most challenging concepts and then write a coherent paragraph on each of them as if you are explaining the concept in an article. Find the most efficient ways to describe legal tests, rules, standards, so that you dont have to waste time and words when you take an essay exam.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Logical-mathematical intelligence.
             </strong>
             Play with fact patterns and causalities. Start by analyzing a hypothetical, and once you have your solution, change the facts. Ask what if and observe how the changes in the fact pattern influence the outcome. List all the assumption you make as you are analyzing the situation. Verbalize every step in your argument.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Musical intelligence.
             </strong>
             Create musical jingles or rhymes to aid your memory. Record yourself speaking on the subject: your voice will reinforce the retention.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Spatial intelligence.
             </strong>
             Pick a topic in your outline and rearrange it into a flow chart or a table. Create a

            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>

              follow-up
             </a>
             , Scott Young describes holistic learning and its benefits:
            </p>
            <blockquote dir="ltr">
             <p>
              Learning holistically is not done by trying to remember information by using repetition and force. Holistic learners instead organize their minds like spider webs. Every piece of information is a single point. That point is then consciously related to tons of other points on the web. There are no boxes with this form of learning. Science becomes literature which becomes economics. Subject distinctions may help when going to class, but a holistic learner never sees things in a box.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The interconnectedness of ideas, concepts, experiences, disciplines is at the heart of holistic learning. Whether or not you practice holistic learning regularly, I think you are likely to experience the magic of holistic learning when you research and write a paper, work on a case in a clinic, or work on a project as an intern. You dont try to memorize the material, but the engagement and thinking involved in the process will cause you to remember it even years later.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holistic learning is synthesis on steroids. You establish connections not only between the legal concepts you study, but also link to other disciplines and areas of life in general. Law is fertile ground for this as it permeates almost everything around us. In addition, law is constantly evolving, so to understand where a legal standard stands in relation to other rules and doctrines on the grand scheme of things is more important than to know its current interpretation (that doesnt apply to the bar exam). It is like star gazing when you identify the stars by their relative positions in the constellation. Issue-spotting is another context where the holistic approach will serve you well because you have to take the characteristics of the familiar pattern and extend it to a new situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             So how do you approach the study of law holistically? Next time when you struggle to understand a legal concept, consider the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <strong>
               What is this concept like?
              </strong>
              Think of any association that comes to mind. Go further and analyze the essential characteristics that make this association work. Is there a point where the association breaks down?
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               What does this concept remind you of?
              </strong>
              Think of what you already know and how it can help you understand this concept better. Does it involve a process similar to X? Can it be applied just like Y? Does it produce outcomes much like Z?
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               How does this concept relate to the previous material?
              </strong>
              Here you engage in synthesis.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               How do you think the doctrine will develop from this point on?
              </strong>
              Make some predictions about whats to come.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Do you know of any concrete, real-life scenarios where you can practice applying the theory?
              </strong>
              When you encounter or read about various controversies, think of what you know and how it applies to the situation in question.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               What other disciplines influence the evolution of this concept?
              </strong>
              For example, technological developments affect patent law. Ethics come into play in the regulation of biomedical research. As you read papers and listen to the news, think of the ways the law may change in the future.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               What areas of life are affected by this concept?
              </strong>
              Think of the results and consequences. Do you like them?
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

              Mind-mapping

             can be a great tool to visualize these multiple levels of connections.
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you think of holistic learning? Is it worth the time and effort? Does it really eliminate the need for the traditional cramming right before the exam? Have you experienced those "Aha! moments" when
             <br/>
             things just "clicked" for you? How did you get there?

             you would first have to memorize 99 names and faces in 15 minutes and recall them in 20 minutes. Next, you would memorize an unpublished 50-line poem in 15 minutes, followed by a series of random digits, an arbitrary list of words and a shuffled deck of playing cards. How do you think you would do? It turns out that best competitors in the world can memorize a deck of cards in less than a minute. Joshua Foer describes these exciting memory battles in

             <a href="http://mappa.mundi.net/cartography/Palace/index.html">
              In his historic overview of the "science of memory" in Mappa.Mundi Magazine, Carl Malamud tells the story of the poet Simonides of Ceos, who witnessed the destruction of the banquet hall where he sang his poem just minutes before the collapse.
             </a>
             Simonides was able to reconstruct the guest list by visualizing the exact location of every guest at the table. This visualization technique became known as the memory palace. First, you choose your memory palace, which can be any place or route that you remember well. Next, you place your thoughts or images that you want to remember next to the distinctive points in the rooms of your palace or along your route. Those points serve as memory hooks. When you need to recall the material, you mentally walk through the palace and collect the pieces of information that you left at each distinctive point. You can use this technique to memorize a presentation or a legal argument, for example.

             your head for years without any effort on your part to memorize it, but an important legal rule may elude you right when you need it most? Can legal concepts be presented like ads in a magazine? Consider how certain notions applicable to advertising can be used to make the content of your outline more memorable.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Function.
              </strong>
              Ads inform, persuade and call for action. What are the objectives of your outline? Your entries must inform: state a rule, accurately describe a legal test, provide a holding in a case, etc. The persuasion part translates into legal reasoning. Your outline must reflect the reasoning behind the laws. Finally, it should address the application of the rules and standards. What can you do with this rule? Thats your call for action.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Positioning.
              </strong>
              In advertising, positioning means identifying the right target audience for your message. When applied to outlining, positioning signifies the big picture. When you outline, think about how each of your entries relates to other entries.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Message.
              </strong>
              Memorable ads usually convey a single clear message. When you outline, make sure you break down complex concepts into smaller components. Take time to distill the main idea from the legal mumbo-jumbo.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Truthfulness.
              </strong>
              Ads must not mislead the customers. The same is true for the outlines. The content must be accurate.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Language.
              </strong>
              Advertising phrases are short and punchy, but they remain coherent. Coherence allows you to reconstruct the full meaning despite the simplified syntactic structures and lack of connectives, such as
              <em>
               "and," "so," "therefore
              </em>
              ," which mark relationships between sentences. When you outline, get rid of needless words. At the same time, whatever is left must be sufficient to bring back the full concept.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Sings and symbols.
              </strong>
              Ads often use signs and symbols that are commonly recognized by the audience, like McDonalds Golden Arches. One of the interesting things about sings is that the relationship between the sign and the object it signifies is arbitrary. Common signs are a matter of convention. The good news is that you can be creative and invent your own symbols and signs to remember the information better.

              For example, to remember the charity-to-charity exception to the Rule Against Perpetuities (acronym RAP), which applies when both the present and the future estates are created in favor of charities, I use the following phrase:
              <em>
               Red Cross does not RAP, but it takes two to tango.
              </em>
              This saying is my memory clue.

              The elements of an ad, such as text and images, are organized in a certain way to reinforce the message. Most students outlines are bland. While adding pictures and colors may seem like extra work, it pays off when you need to recall the information. Youve probably heard that the process of outlining is more beneficial than the final result. You aid your memory when you engage your multiple senses and

             . It illustrates the way in which a cook marks the orders. For example, a tub of jelly placed upside down at the 6 o'clock position on a dinner plate indicates scrambled eggs and a wheat toast. It made me wonder if a dinner plate could be used to memorize, lets say, the filing deadlines for pleadings in the civil procedure rules. One minute of a clock can represent one day so to remember the deadlines, you would need to visualize the positions of the clock hands. Then, you can come up with foods for different stages of the process, and you are ready to arrange your action-plate. Is it too much work for what its worth? I dont know. Sleep on it.

             Do you know what stands in the way of your learning? There are many barriers to learning. Difference people face different challenges. As you are trying to identify yours, consider the following common enemies of learning:

             <li>
              <strong>
               Prolonged stress or depression can affect your memory.
              </strong>
              <a href="http://intelegen.com/nutrients/memory_loss_it_is_always_age.htm">
               People who are under a lot of stress or suffer from depression show elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that appears to shrink the hippocampus, a part of the brain associated with memory and other cognitive functions.

             <li>
              <strong>
               Negative attitude towards learning can sabotage your efforts.
              </strong>
              Maybe, school was hard for you and you convinced yourself that you were not up to the task. Perhaps, you study only for external recognition, such as a degree, certification, or promotion, and you dont value the process itself. Or you feel guilty that you have been a student for far too long instead of making money in the real world. What are your mental roadblocks to learning?
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Irrelevance derails the learning process.
              </strong>
              Would you rather learn one hundred made-up words that have no use in real life or one hundred words of Italian if you know that you will go to Italy in a month? There are lots of things that compete for our attention at any given moment. The information that is relevant to us and that we can apply in the real world has a higher chance of making it into our long-term memory. Sometimes, the trick is to figure out how to make the material that you are studying relevant to your goals.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Too much explanation or too little explanation can inhibit learning.
              </strong>
              Learning happens in stages. When you are given lots of detail up front when you have not had a change to get the basics, you are likely to feel overwhelmed. In addition, our brains are wired to solve problems. We tend to remember things better if we have struggled to find the answer ourselves. Thats why it may be counterproductive to start reading treatises and outlines before you have had a chance to grapple with the issues on your own. On the other hand, the lack of explanation can leave us confused because we havent found a way to link the new information to what we already know. As many things in life, it is a matter of balance.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Poor time management jeopardizes your learning objectives.
              </strong>
              Learning requires the time commitment not only to acquire new information, but also to review regularly the old material. You must develop a

              </a>
              and stick to it.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Lack of feedback hinders learning.
              </strong>
              If you dont get feedback, you cant learn from your past actions and you cant measure your progress.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Lack of support creates anxiety thats not good for learning.
              </strong>
              We learn better in collaborative environments than in highly competitive ones. If you are afraid of making a mistake or being ridiculed, you wont take risks and you wont learn.
             </li>

             least, thats what performance gurus and self-help books tell us. Is there a lazy way to perfection? The answer may be a surprising yes, according to Dr. Sara Mednick. Dr. Mednick studies how napping can improve human performance. In our busy, sleep-deprived world, taking a nap in the middle of the day sounds like a luxury we dont have time for. But Dr. Mednick says that in reality, it is wasteful not to nap because we rob ourselves of such essential elements of productivity as endurance, alertness, attention, energy, creativity. I first heard an interview with Dr. Mednick through
             <a href="http://www.kellyhowell.com/podcasts/dr_sara_mednick_and_the_power_of_napping.html">
              The Theater of the Mind podcast
             </a>
             , in which she described her research and her recent book
             <em>
              <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-Nap-Change-Your-Life/dp/0761142908">
               Take a Nap! Change you life
              </a>
             </em>
             . Her studies show that you can target different aspects of performance by varying the time and duration of your naps. Morning naps can boost creativity, while afternoon naps help to absorb large quantities of information and improve memory. You can learn more about the power of napping and read sample chapters at
             <a href="http://www.saramednick.com/index.html">
              Dr. Mednicks website
             </a>
             . A Nap Wheel on the website will help you design your customized nap schedule for optimum results. Mine is showing that its time for my nap. Efficient napping requires practice, so I better go. Wouldnt you like to be good at napping?

              Raymond Ward

             for letting me know about this site. Smell-coding intrigued me so much that I decided to visit
             <a href="http://www.senseofsmell.org/index.php">
              The Sense of Smell Institute
             </a>
             to investigate the olfactory function further.
            </p>
            <p>
             It turns out that the smell-coding technique involves associative learning  a process by which you link one item, in this case the subject matter you are studying, to another item  a particular aroma. Later, when you need to recall the material you were studying, you help your memory by smelling the aroma associated with that material.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've also found out that
             <a href="http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/30/suppl_1/i250">
              people form strong associations between odors and emotions that they experience when they are exposed to the odors
             </a>
             . The odor can elicit the corresponding emotion, so be aware of the effect of aromas on your mood. This effect can be either positive or negative. For example, if you experienced frustration while learning how to swim in a swimming pool, you may have associated the smell of chlorine in the water with the emotion of frustration. Later, if you are exposed to chlorinated water, the smell can make you feel frustrated. On the other hand, if you have personally meaningful smells that make you happy, relaxed, focused, etc., you can use those smells to trigger the desired emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Essential oils can also enhance performance. For instance, citrus smells promote mental awareness and concentration, so try using orange or lemon oil when you study.

              Peppermint improves the performance of clerical tasks by increasing attention.
             </a>
             Lavender will calm your nerves, smell it when you need to make a presentation in front of a large group. The perfume of cacao activates the production of endorphins that make us happy, so we can pass on that chocolate bar (wellI am not sure about that, the more the merrier). Rose essence gives the sense of harmony and security. Check out the

             to find out more about the meaning of various aromas.

             If you find it hard to remember how and when certain legal rules apply in a sequence, you can try pegging the application of those rules to a system that is more memorable and familiar to you. Here is an example from the area of trusts and estates. Lets say that I want to remember that the Rule in Shelleys Case and the Doctrine of Merger can apply sequentially in certain conveyances. I will illustrate it with the following hypothetical:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              O
             </em>
             deeds the property to
             <em>
              A
             </em>
             for life, then to
             <em>
              As
             </em>
             heirs. Describe the interests conveyed and retained in this transaction in a jurisdiction where the Rule in Shelleys Case applies. (Most states have abolished the Rule in Shelleys case by statute.)
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Answer:
             </em>
             <br/>
             In form,
             <em>
              O
             </em>
             intended to create a life estate in
             <em>
              A
             </em>
             and a contingent remainder in
             <em>
              As
             </em>
             heirs (it is contingent because living persons have no heirs). However, under the Rule in Shelleys Case, the remainder interest that is created in favor of
             <em>
              As
             </em>
             heirs is deemed to be limited in favor of
             <em>
              A
             </em>
             . Therefore,
             <em>
              A
             </em>
             has both the life estate and the next vested remainder. At this juncture, the Doctrine of Merger applies, merging the life estate and the next vested estate to give
             <em>
              A
             </em>
             a fee simple absolute.
            </p>
            <p>
             To help me remember the application of the Rule in Shelleys Case and the Doctrine of Merger, I am going to invoke a traffic theme. Since the letter A is often used in hypotheticals to refer to a grantee, I will call the application of the Doctrine of Merger after the operation of the Rule in Shelleys Case the
             <span style="color: #990000;">
              AAA Rule
             </span>
             after the well-known emergency road service:
             <br/>
             <span style="color: #990000;">
              <em>
               As
              </em>
              life estate +
              <em>
               As
              </em>
              vested remainder =
              <em>
               As
              </em>
              fee simple absolute.
             </span>
            </p>
            <p>
             I will also use the merging traffic sign to reinforce my recall of the
             <a href="http://lawsagna.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/merge_sign.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=228,height=320,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false">
              <img alt="Merge_sign" border="0" height="280" src="http://lawsagna.typepad.com/lawsagna/images/merge_sign.jpg" style="FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 0px 0px 5px 5px" title="Merge_sign" width="200"/>
             </a>
             Merger Doctrine and the fact that the Merger Doctrine applies only when A has both the life estate and the vested remainder that immediately follows the life estate (only two roads next to each other can merge).
            </p>
            <p>
             Continuing with my traffic theme, I will also remember that the Rule in Shelleys case is a rule of law just like a rule of the road, and not a rule of construction, and therefore, it applies even if the grantor intended otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this example, I pegged less memorable legal rules and applications to familiar traffic concepts to assist my memory.

             open anything without cutting my fingers. Yesterday, I fought a plastic wrap on a tea box for much longer than such a simple task should take. Do you know that they sell CD and DVD openers now? I expect to see the following message on a box soon: Batteries included. Box opener sold separately to prevent tampering. Then again, maybe I should look for the clues more carefully: a red string to pull or a scissor line to tear. I am afraid, I am too impatient for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             It got me thinking about how information is packaged these days. In our fast-pace life, how much time and effort are we willing to spend on acquiring knowledge we need? Internet makes it very easy to access information. We are accustomed to punching in a few words into a search engine and getting hundreds of pages of stuff. Wealth of information is at our fingertips. But does it make us more impatient and less inclined to dig deeper in our search for meaning? Are we relying too much on the sources whose credibility we cannot verify?
            </p>
            <p>
             The other side of the spectrum is the knowledge that we have to struggle to receive. You cant become a lawyer just by surfing the net. You have to read cases, brief them, endure the Socratic questioning, outline. Sometimes, it seems easier to pick up a study aid instead. There is an abundance of commercial outlines, hornbooks, nutshells. Even students briefs and outlines are available online. The thing is, though, that even if you read all of them, it wont make you a lawyer. Dont get me wrong, I think study aids have their place and purpose in legal education. I have personally used some. But their purpose is to aid, not to substitute for the real work. Our brains dont like to be spoon-fed information. We are wired to solve problems. Our brains like challenges even if it feels like your head is about to split. We remember things better if we had to struggle to understand them. We have to own the material to turn it into the ready-to-use knowledge. Otherwise, we lose it. I guess, sometimes, we just have to fight through the bubble wrap because it is there for a purpose.

             I dont know about you, but I like to give some texture to my text. A simple change in the layout or format of the text can boost comprehension and recall. It's like providing your brain with navigation tools. I dont like the densely-typed sameness that goes on and on for pages. I get lost in such notes like in certain suburban neighborhoods where every house looks alike.  A few days ago, I read an interesting article on
             <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/9710a.html">
              How Users Read on the Web
             </a>
             . It turns out they dont. Most people just scan websites, looking for key words and ideas. I see some similarities with student notes. Students diligently take notes, but they dont really want to read them again. Perhaps, the following tips for web writing can be applied to note-taking to improve readability and retention:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Highlight keywords.
             </li>
             <li>
              Use meaningful subheadings.
             </li>
             <li>
              Use bullet points or numbers to list items.
             </li>
             <li>
              Start a new paragraph for each new idea.
             </li>
             <li>
              Be concise.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             For note-takers, I would add:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Develop a system of abbreviations and symbols for frequently used words and concepts.
             </li>
             <li>
              Use visuals, such as tables, time lines, concept trees, mind maps whenever you can.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Perhaps, if you jazz up your notes, you are more likely to go back and review them after all. What do you think?

             Youve probably heard the saying: if you dont like the results, do something different. Well sometimes, things that you least expect to help you produce surprisingly positive outcomes. Ive recently read two posts that seem to support this phenomenon.

             . It discusses how sipping coffee motivates the author to begin a task that is not very appealing otherwise. The positive emotion generated by the coffee spills over to the project at hand. So, next time you need to start on something boring, trick your brain first by doing something that gets you excited. Your attitude towards the task may improve as a result.

             . Experiments show that we remember swear and taboo words better than neutral words. More importantly, the emotional words enhance memory of the context in which they are used, so it appears that we remember the boring stuff better if it is sprinkled with words that trigger shock or surprise. If there is any study group out there that decides to try this one out, let me know if it works.

              An effective way to aid your memory is to connect the new information to something you already know that has some similarities with the subject matter you study.

              When a tenant wrongfully remains in possession (holds over) at the end of the lease, a tenancy at sufferance is created.

              Mind-mapping is a creative technique to organize information, highlight the key elements and link related concepts in a treelike fashion.

              The mind map includes a hypothetical to introduce the relevant fact pattern to the right of the main node, the mnemonic for the elements that need to be satisfied, as well as the pictures to anchor these elements.

             Its that time of the year when students start paying more attention to outlining. Are there any tips for creating a more effective outline? One tip is to use mnemonics to synthesize the material. Mnemonics help the long-term memory by linking and organizing the information in a compact and efficient way. They work even better if they are fun or bizarre. To boost the effect, create a vivid image to go with the word. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, well, maybe not a thousand, but 1.5 words at least, according to
             <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2006/10/actually_a_picture_is_worth_15_1.php">
              Cognitive Daily

            </p>
            <p>
             Here is an example from Property, Rights of Founders Against the Owners of Land. Let's say you need to remember the following rule.
            </p>
            <p>
             The claim of the owner of the land on which the property was found can generally prevail over the claim of a finder of the lost property:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              if the property is classified as "mislaid";
             </li>
             <li>
              if the finder was a trespasser on the land when finding the property;
             </li>
             <li>
              if the finder was an invitee and the land was not generally open to the public;
             </li>
             <li>
              if the finder is an employee and an agent of the landowner.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

             <em>
              Answer:
             </em>
             Yes. The finders claim to the found property can prevail against the owner of the land where the property was found if the land was open to the public.
