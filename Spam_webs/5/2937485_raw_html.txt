      I know this is a Spider-Man comic but this issue has me smitten with a member of the Host -
					the lady called Chakra.
     </p>

      Just look at that move. There's more where that came from . . .

     <p>
      Wow.
     </p>
     <p>
      After all the tension, we find Peter and Ben in a more relaxed setting.
     </p>

      Welcome to 1996.
     </p>
     <p>
      Look at this panel
     </p>
     <br/>
     <center>
      <img alt="watercolor style" src="../../images/fourteen/spider-man-amazing-417-colors.jpg"/>

     <br/>
     <p>
      The colors. I don't know if Bob Sharen and Graphics Colorworks meant it, but this issue 
					has a distinctly watercolor-like feel to the coloring.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few issues back, Peter was in danger of losing everything - including his life. It's nice
					to know that he will retain the Peter Parker name and that his powers, though unreliable, seem
					to be coming back. It must be off at this point because he's forced to ride piggyback on
					Ben.
     </p>

					on ben reilly" src="../../images/fourteen/spider-man-amazing-417-piggyback.jpg"/>
     </center>
     <br/>
     <p>
      I know Peter is Ben's clone but there is too much bromance on this panel. You know what 
					would have been more interesting? If Peter was cloned from a girl - so Scarlet Spider would
					be a girl and this piggyback panel would be just fantastic. Just think about it. Missed opportunity.

      When they both finally catch up to Chakra, she gets another great panel.

     <p>
      She just looks good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ron Garney did a great job on the layout of this panel.

     <p>
      The title of the issue is "Secrets" and here's one of them: Scrier isn't an individual. Scrier
					is the name of an international organization much like Hydra or Aim. How does that explain the
					gigantic size and nearly god-like powers of Scrier in his appearances before this issue? I don't know.
					This is one clumsy retcon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Peter goes into battle answering the question: What if Spidey decided to wear his costume AND
					his civvies?
     </p>
     <br/>
     <center>
      <img alt="peter fights in costume and in
					civvies" src="../../images/fourteen/spider-man-amazing-417-civvies.jpg"/>
     </center>
     <br/>
     <p>
      An even more important question is: Why didn't he just wear the costume?
     </p>
     <p>
      And that's the issue. Oh yeah, Judas Traveller was successfully freed by Chakra and they are both
					on the run fron the Host.
