    NECST formally launched in early 2006 with the first full Members-only meeting    in May of that year on the MIT campus. We are pleased to be partnered with      ANSYS, Boeing, EADS/Airbus, Embraer, Lockheed Martin, Saab AB, Composite      Systems Technology, Hexcel, and Toho Tenax. The NECST industry Consortium      is IP-generating, and Members have specific rights to both background and      new IP. A      Consortium Prospectus is available upon request.
   </p>
   <p>
    The NECST Consortiums technology focus is to improve the performance of advanced    aerospace materials/structures through strategic use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)    combined with traditional advanced composites to form hybrid architectures. Two    primary 3D nano-engineered architectures are being explored and developed, both    polymer-matrix based, and a third is under development. The fabrication strategy    involves novel synthesis of high-quality, long (several millimeters), aligned CNTs placed    strategically within existing advanced composite systems. Results have demonstrated    that high-quality CNT/traditional hybrid composite laminates can be architected    and fabricated at rates and scales that can be used in full-scale aerospace    structures.
   </p>
   <p>
    The unifying focus of the Consortium is improved performance of advanced      aerospace structures and, as such, it is centered in MITs
    <a href="http://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/" target="_blank">
     Department      of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics
    </a>
    , and we continue to collaborate with    Dr. John Hart at the
    <a href="http://www.mechanosynthesis.com/" target="_blank">
     University      of Michigan's Mechanical Engineering Department
    </a>
    on CNT processing and      characterization topics. The involvement of the
    <a href="http://pergatory.mit.edu/" target="_blank">
     Precision      Engineering Research Group
    </a>
    in MITs
    <a href="http://meche.mit.edu/" target="_blank">
     Department        of Mechanical Engineering
    </a>
    provides expertise in developing equipment        and processes for high-rate manufacturing and large-scale integration        of nano-engineered composites. The research of the Consortium spans topics        from fundamental science (
    <em>
     e.g.,
    </em>
    catalyst characteristics for        CNT growth) to more applied research such as laminate-level manufacturing        and sub-structural strength testing, to such topics as environmental        health and safety of nanostructured materials.
