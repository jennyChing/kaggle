        <p>
         A thunderous blast heavily damaged the Italian Consulate in Cairo and killed one person early Saturday, an attack that appeared to deviate from a pattern of strikes by Islamic militants against Egyptian military and security installations.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was not immediately clear whether the explosion was meant to harm diplomatic personnel or merely embarrass Egypts security establishment. The powerful detonation took place soon after dawn on a weekend day; the consulate was closed at the time, and relatively few people were out on nearby streets.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         An Islamic advocacy group has called for Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz to replace a former head of the Williamson County GOP as his Tennessee campaign chairman.
        </p>
        <p>
         Kevin Kookogey, who chaired Williamsons Republican party from 2011 to 2013, is an outspoken critic of Sharia, the law of the Islamic faith.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Washington, D.C.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations on Tuesday issued a news release calling for Cruz to remove Kookogey from his campaign because of the former county GOP leaders support for anti-Muslim causes.
        </p>
        <p>
         If Senator Cruz chooses to keep Mr. Kookogey on his campaign staff, it would serve as an endorsement of anti-Muslim hate, CAIR Government Affairs Manager Robert McCaw said.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past few months, Senator Cruz has attended several conferences featuring notorious Islamophobes like Robert Spencer and Frank Gaffney. Despite calls to distance himself from such anti-Muslim bigots, it seems that Senator Cruz is only drawing closer to hate-mongers.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The name Sequoyah is synonymous with education and progress. Sequoyah, the great legendary Cherokee figure, worked towards these goals and preserved his native language by creating the first Cherokee alphabet, eventually propelling it to be the strongest surviving indigenous American language. In the spirit of his name, the Sequoyah Elementary School also takes great strides towards education and progress. In working to make a more open and accepting environment for its students, the school is creating a more productive learning environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Tuesday morning, upon invitation by school officials, Adam Soltani and Veronica Laizure of the Council on American Islamic Relations Oklahoma Chapter held a diversity-training program for the schools educational staff. In this diversity-training program, the two CAIR officials made presentations outlining some of the basics of the Islamic faith and the challenges faced by Muslim Students, and they answered questions in an environment which was truly open and inviting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Veronica, CAIR Oklahomas Civil Rights Director, gave an outline of some of the basic tenets of Islam and showed the teachers how these would affect their students in their school. Her topics ranged from the significance and procedure of prayer and proper religious attire, to the meaning and scheduling of Islamic holy days. She and Adam also answered questions on how these religious matters would affect the students in during the school day and how to have an open, comfortable dialogue with Muslim families to facilitate a productive environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Executive Director Adam Soltani gave the next presentation on how Islamic Extremism is perceived in the public and in the media. He also inspired an insightful discussion on how miscommunication and misunderstanding can cause problems for the overwhelming majority of Muslims who do not prescribe to this extremist ideology. These problems can be especially harmful to young students, which can affect the way that society continues to develop in the future as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
         The diversity-training program at Sequoyah Elementary School was a positive step forward in the cause of making our community more inclusive and open for all. From my own perspective, as a white-American-born-Muslim convert, I often find myself living in the midst of a common identity crisis among Muslim converts: that of living in two different worlds at the same time. This identity crisis is often exacerbated by feelings of abandonment and isolation because of personal choices, and it often results in an individual feeling as if they must abandon everything about one of these identities in order to be accepted in one of these worlds. Educational events like this go a long way as to help encourage inclusiveness in our society and ensure that these worlds do not become mutually exclusive.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         More than 100 people have been arrested in a large-scale, two-county operation that targeted cyber crimes and prostitution, authorities said Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
         The two-week joint sting, known as Operation L and P, netted 101 arrests in both Lake and Polk counties. The investigation concluded late last week.
        </p>
        <p>
         A news conference was held Tuesday morning in Tavares to release the details of the sting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of the people arrested had jobs working with children, including theme park workers at Universal Orlando and SeaWorld, and a former Walt Disney World cast member who left that job before his arrest.
         <br/>
         SeaWorld also said the men charged were no longer employed at the theme park.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are very dangerous people and they are after our children, said Grady Judd of the Polk County Sheriffs Office.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were two phases of the operation: During the first week, investigators say, 22 people traveled to Clermont thinking they were going to have sex with a child between ages 10 and 14.
        </p>
        <p>
         Seventy-nine others were arrested on charges connected to prostitution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ahmed Saleem, a Muslim youth coordinator, was also one of the men arrested. Investigators said the men all traveled to a home in Clermont with the hopes of having sex with a child.
        </p>
        <p>
         The car Saleem traveled in had a license plate that said, Invest in children, according to investigators.
        </p>
        <p>
         Saleem is also the founder of the Saleem Academy, an organization empowering Muslim youth globally and also served as the Orlando coordinator for CAIR, the Counsel On Islamic American Relations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hes well known as a community outreach leader interacting with teens in and around the Orlando area, said Judd.
        </p>
        <p>
         Judd, who was at Tuesdays news conference, said the operation sends a strong message to anyone in Internet chat rooms that sex with minors wont be tolerated.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         For the nomads of the world, the presence of the Holy Bible in a hotel room nightstand feels about as ubiquitous as a tabloid at the supermarket checkout  an item we expect to see quietly lingering on the sidelines, whether we want to read it or not.
        </p>
        <p>
         But with 1.5 million Catholics expected to flood the region for the World Meeting of Families later this year, might it be a problem that many Philly hotels are stocked with those Bibles  that is, Protestant Bibles? []
        </p>
        <p>
         While the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is happy to go along with the Greater Philadelphia Hotel Associations initiative to distribute Catholic Bibles, its steering clear of any concerted effort to have Protestant Bibles swapped out, telling PhillyVoice only that the World Meeting of Families aims to be inclusive of all people regardless of their faith tradition or lack thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Council on American-Islamic Relations Philadelphia, meanwhile, said its not exactly up in arms over Bibles in hotel rooms, though it would like to see a Quran placed next to it.

         At that time, Fox News reported that Morgan decided to ban Muslims after two customers she deemed suspicious showed up in September. Since that time, she has excluded those she believes to be Muslim based upon their names. She said, We are dealing in lethal firearms.

        </p>
        <p>
         CAIRs Jennifer Wicks said, We welcome this positive development and hope it leads to a thorough investigation of clear violations of the civil rights of American Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim by the gun range owner.
        </p>
        <p>
         In January, A South Asian father and son accused Morgans business of turning them away. They claimed Morgan assumed they were Muslim because their skin was brown. The identities of the two are not known because they demanded anonymity out of safety concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         Morgan rejected their claims, stating it was their behavior, not their skin color, that led her to think they might not be safe handling firearms in [her] range. Morgan made clear that her range does not discriminate based on skin color, and explained her belief that the South Asian father and son applied to shoot with an agenda. She said their actions were clearly designed to create the situation that occurred.

          (WASHINGTON, D.C., 4/2/15)
         </a>
          The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nations largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today called on Republican Party leaders to repudiate an Islamophobic newsletter distributed by a GOP county committee in Idaho.
        </p>
        <p>
         CAIR said the newsletter, which was distributed Monday, included a article called Islam in Idaho warning that Muslims are infiltrating the state and have been taught to be ready to rise up and kill and to be two-faced to deceive people of other faiths.
        </p>
        <p>
         [NOTE: The newsletter was distributed by the Bonneville County Republican Central Committee, while the Islamophobic article was written by Bonneville Republican Central Committee Becky Prestwich.]
        </p>
        <p>
         It read in part: So when someone brings to our attention that Muslims are infiltrating even in places like Idaho, we must pay attention. Readers were asked to demand that our lawmakers and law enforcers pay attention and ascertain whether or not there is a potential threat.[]
        </p>
        <p>
         This is just the latest example of Islamophobic falsehoods being promoted by Republican Party officials, said CAIR Government Affairs Manager Robert McCaw. If the party truly wishes to reach out voters of all faiths and backgrounds, it must repudiate this type of extremist hate rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
         He said American Muslims have repeatedly expressed concern about Islamophobic positions and actions by GOP leaders at the state and national levels.

        One of the coachs former Muslim players came to his defense saying, I dont agree with [the coachs] opinion, but that doesnt make him a bigot. CAIR and the diversity enforcers beg to differ.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.conwaydailysun.com/newsx/local-news/119826-lees-out-of-fa-lacrosse-coaching-job-over-neagative-post-on-muslims" target="_blank">
          FRYEBURG
         </a>
          After four years at the helm of Fryeburg Academys lacrosse team, Scott Lees of Conway said he was forced by academy officials to resign as head coach after sharing on Facebook an open letter to President Barack Obama that was unflattering to Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
         The letter, written by An American Citizen, was about Obamas speech given in Cairo in 2009. In that speech and in another made last month, the president said Islam has long been a part of American history.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the first part of the letter, it wonders whether anyone has have ever seen a Muslim hospital or heard a Muslim orchestra. The writer goes on to charge that Muslims are still the largest traffickers in human slavery, that they were allied with Adolf Hitler in World War II and that they were either pleased with or silent on the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The writer adds that the Barbary pirates were Muslims.
        </p>
        <p>
         I just thought it was an interesting article, said Lees, who added hes a politically minded independent conservative. I thought it was an interesting letter to President Obama and his current administration who are not paying attention to Israel and focusing on Iran.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lees, 48, shared the letter on his personal Facebook page on March 17. Two days later, he was handing in his resignation as Fryeburg Academys lacrosse coach. He said that although he was supposed to meet with Head of Schools Erin Mayo and Dean Charlie Tryder on March 19, Athletic Director Sue Thurston told him a decision to fire him had already been made.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to Lees, a property manager who is married and has two children, said he did not want a firing to go on his record. He asked Thurston if they would consider a letter of resignation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ive never been fired in my life, said Lees, who also coaches hockey locally. Ive been coaching kids since 1992. []
        </p>
        <p>
         Lees said the post didnt get much response. No students liked the post though it was liked by four adults, one of whom commented on it. Its not like it went viral, said Lees. Its not like everyone and their brother saw it.
        </p>
        <p>
         But according to Mayo Fryeburg Academy has a number of Muslim students as well as students of numerous other faiths.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lees said he is not a bigot. In fact, he said that two years ago he invited a former Fryeburg student from New York City named Mohammed Islam to stay at his house for nine days. At the time, Islam had a court date in the area for a minor offense.
        </p>
        <p>
         If I had a problem with people who are Muslim, then why would I have allowed a Muslim to stay in my home? asked Lees.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a phone interview, Islam, who now attends Drexel University in Pennsylvania, confirmed that his former coach had opened his home to him.
         <br/>
         I never saw him as a bigot, said Islam, who played under Lees for three years.
        </p>
        <p>
         When asked of the posting, Islam said he spoke to Lees about it. He didnt think it should have cost Lees his coaching job. Islam said Lees seems to take issue with Obamas handling of the Middle East.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          I dont agree with Scotts opinion, but that doesnt make him a bigot, said Islam.
         </strong>

          School administrators for a high school in the Hudson Valley are apologizing for having the Pledge of Allegiance recited in Arabic. []

        <p>
         Ibrahim Hooper is a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a grassroots civil rights and advocacy group.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would ask what he would be apologizing for exactly. Was his apology directed at those who have spread anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bigotry with hostile comments about this Pledge of Allegiance? says Hooper. I mean, what could be more quintessentially American than offering the Pledge of Allegiance no matter what language its in.

        <p>
         A rally by hundreds of American Muslims at the Oklahoma Capitol on Friday to promote religious tolerance was interrupted by anti-Islamic protesters holding signs proclaiming the United States a Christian nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         While an American Muslim girl sang the Star Spangled Banner inside the statehouse in Oklahoma City, about two dozen anti-Islamic protesters outside hurled insults at the group, mostly students, as they visited the Capitol to speak with lawmakers. There were no reports of violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         If they had a sword, theyd cut your head off, protesters shouted. Some carried signs saying Islam equals Death.[]
        </p>
        <p>
         The Oklahoma Muslim Day at the Capitol was organized by the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and supported by the Interfaith Alliance of Oklahoma, whose members helped escort attendees into the Capitol and past the protesters.[]
        </p>
        <p>
         A few lawmakers in the socially conservative state have previously made statements against Muslims, including Republican Representative John Bennett, who has said Islam is a cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out.
        </p>
        <p>
         He posted on Facebook that he was attending the organized protest in response to the rally.

        <p>
         Hussein bin Mahmoud, a jurist of Sharia law for the Islamic State, said in an article published on February 17 and appearing in various jihadi websites that all Christian churches in Cairo must be demolished.
        </p>
        <p>
         Titled the Ruling on Egypts Christians, the article, written like a fatwa, asserts that
        </p>
        <p>
         The ruling concerning the churches that are in Cairo is that they be destroyed, according to the consensus of the righteous forefathers [Salaf], because they are new under Islam, and Cairo is a new city whose original inhabitants were Muslim; there were no churches in it previously.
        </p>
        <p>
         As for churches in Upper Egypt, which may have been in existence before the Islamic conquest of Egypt, these may remain but may never be renovated or fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Islamic state cleric cited medieval jurist Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328), some of whose fatwas deal with Islams views on churches which are described as worse than bars and brothels.

          (WASHINGTON, D.C., 2/20/15)
         </a>
          The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nations largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today welcomed reports that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will issue a new intelligence assessment on the threat posed by domestic right-wing violent extremists.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to CNN, [T]he report, produced in coordination with the FBI, counts 24 violent sovereign citizen-related attacks across the U.S. since 2010. Sovereign citizens believe that federal, state, and local laws do not apply to them and violent extremists within the movement have targeted law enforcement officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         We welcome this new intelligence assessment on the threat posed by domestic right-wing violent extremists. It is the governments responsibility to address all forms of violent extremism  regardless of ideology  and in proportion to the criminal threat posed by those groups. Releasing this report demonstrates a renewed focus at DHS to address all forms of violent extremism.
        </p>
        <p>
         We now call on the DHS and FBI to release an intelligence assessment addressing the spike in hate crimes targeting Muslim, Arab, Middle Eastern, Sikh, Hindu, and South Asian communities throughout the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Without an awareness of the threat posed by all forms of violent extremism, our national security will remain at risk.

        <p>
         Assemblywoman Melissa Melendez, R-Lake Elsinore, was under fire Friday from a Los Angeles-based Muslim advocacy group that called her use of the phrase Islamic savages in a tweet hate rhetoric.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statements like these cause mistrust and fear of Islam and Muslims, said Haroon Manjlai, with the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Greater Los Angeles, or CAIR-LA. It is unbecoming of a public elected official to issue such bigoted statements.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Tuesday, Melendez posted a tweet saying:
        </p>
        <p>
         Gut wrenching news today. American Kayla Mueller murdered by Islamic savages. There MUST be consequences. MM.
        </p>
        <p>
         She ended the Twitter post with the hashtag #standupagainstIslam. []
        </p>
        <p>
         Manjlai criticized Melendez for seeming to associate all Muslims with terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hate rhetoric can and does lead to hate crimes against people, the CAIR-LA spokesman said. We call on Assemblymember Melendez to retract and apologize for her anti-Muslim comment and for smearing the faith of more than 1.6 billion people.

        <p>
         As the White House prepares to host a three-day summit next week on countering violent extremism, many high-profile Muslim and religious groups argue that the administrations efforts have unfairly singled out Muslims and the Islamic faith.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the days leading up to the summit, Muslim Advocatessaidit has serious concerns about the governments track record of treating extremist violence as though it were an exclusively Muslim problem. The prominent civil rights and legal advocacy group said that sends a dangerous signal to members of the public that their Muslim neighbors are a threat.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, whichhas been in the works since last fall, will begin on Feb. 17. TheWhite House press releaselast month said the summit would focus on domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing, recruiting, or inspiring individuals or groups in the United States and abroad to commit acts of violence. The statementpointed to recent attacksby radicalized Muslims in Ottawa, Sydney and Paris.
        </p>
        <p>
         But leaders of the largest Muslim organizations in the U.S. have said they are disappointed they werent invited to attend. Top officials from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Islamic Society of North America and the Islamic Circle of North America wont be at the table next week. Several attendees of a high-profile meeting the president held with Muslims last week  including Farhana Khera, president of Muslim Advocates, and Kameelah Rashad, Muslim chaplain at the University of Pennsylvania  have also not been invited.
        </p>
        <p>
         We recognize there are people of ill intent trying to recruit American Muslims into their cause. But I think the community needs to be the one that leads on that front, said Corey Saylor, director of the Department to Monitor and Combat Islamophobia at CAIR.

        <p>
         On February 18, 2015, the White House will host a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism to highlight domestic and international efforts to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from radicalizing, recruiting, or inspiring individuals or groups in the United States and abroad to commit acts of violence, efforts made even more imperative in light of recent, tragic attacks in Ottawa, Sydney, and Paris. This summit will build on the strategy the White House released in August of 2011, Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States, the first national strategy to prevent violent extremism domestically.
        </p>
        <p>
         Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) efforts rely heavily on well-informed and resilient local communities. Boston, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis-St. Paul have taken the lead in building pilot frameworks integrating a range of social service providers, including education administrators, mental health professionals, and religious leaders, with law enforcement agencies to address violent extremism as part of the broader mandate of community safety and crime prevention. The summit will highlight best practices and emerging efforts from these communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the same time, our partners around the world are actively implementing programs to prevent violent extremism and foreign terrorist fighter recruitment. The summit will include representatives from a number of partner nations, focusing on the themes of community engagement, religious leader engagement, and the role of the private sector and tech community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through presentations, panel discussions, and small group interactions, participants will build on local, state, and federal government; community; and international efforts to better understand, identify, and prevent the cycle of radicalization to violence at home in the United States and abroad. Additional information regarding participants and the agenda will be provided at a future date.

          (WASHINGTON, D.C., 2/3/15)
         </a>
          Later today, representatives of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and other national and local leaders of the American Muslim community will hold a news conference at the Muslim civil rights organizations Capitol Hill headquarters in Washington, D.C., to condemn the terror group ISISs unspeakable and anti-Islamic brutality in the burning alive of a Jordanian air force pilot.
        </p>
        <p>
         We join the world community in mourning the death of yet another victim of ISISs brutality. This unspeakable and anti-Islamic act must be condemned by anyone with even a spark of humanity, said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. Such inhuman acts are designed to provoke hatred and to create divisions, and we must not fall into this trap laid by the terrorists.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Approximately 150 women gathered at an interfaith center in Los Angeles for what may be the first all-female Mosque in the United States on Friday afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
         Male imams traditionally lead prayers and Quran teachings but the Womens Mosque of America, which claims to be the countrys first female-only mosque, aims to present an alternative by creating an all-female space for prayer, lead by a female imam.
        </p>
        <p>
         Word of the event spread to Muslim women across the country through social media sites, such as Facebook and twitter, and leadership retreats. Some women from New Jersey and Nevada decided to travel and be a part of what they consider a historical event.[]
        </p>
        <p>
         We just wanted to have a safe space where women could come and get inspired and hear from a female khatiba or someone who delivers the khutbah or the sermon and thats an opportunity that we dont get in other mosques. The speaker is always a male imam and not only that, its very hard to access the imam because of the way the mosques are structured architecturally. Sometimes the men and women are completely cut off from one another. This mosque gives us a chance to connect with our leaders and also with one another in a way that we wouldnt in another environment, said Maznavi.
        </p>
        <p>
         The traditional Friday prayer, or jummah, is currently only scheduled to take place once a month but the founders of Womens Mosque of America, as well as some attending worshipers, hope the prayers can be held every Friday.
