         Conventional political analysts see the revolutions of 1989 as a spontaneous, once-in-a-lifetime swelling of popular discontent. Their description of the wave of uprisings in Eastern Europe mirrors the assertions they make virtually every time an outbreak of mass mobilization erupts on the political stage: They tell us that these moments of peak activity are rare and unpredictable.
        </p>

        <p>
         On November 9, 198925 years agohuge crowds of East Germans descended on the Berlin Wall. The restless citizens were responding to an announcement by authorities suggesting that the government would loosen travel restrictions. In truth, those in charge intended to make only limited alterations in visa requirements. But these intentions quickly became irrelevant. Mass numbers of people flocked to the wall, overwhelming the border guards. Soon, along with allies from the West, the crowds began dismantling the hated barrier for good.
        </p>
        <p>
         Remarkably, although the fall of the Berlin Wall was an iconic moment, it was just one of the highlights in a flurry of activity that was sweeping through the Soviet Bloca series of uprisings that would become known as the revolutions of 1989.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every so often, we witness a period of mass insurgency that seems to defy the accepted rules of politics: Protests seem to begin popping up everywhere. Organizers see their rallies packed with newcomers who come from far outside their regular network of supporters. Mainstream analysts, taken by surprise, struggle for words. And those in power scramble as the political landscape around them dramatically shiftssometimes leaving once-entrenched leaders in perilous positions.
        </p>
        <p>
         If ever there was a time in modern history that exemplified such a moment of peak public activity, it was the second half of 1989.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the crowds at the Berlin Wall on November 9 assembled in impromptu fashion, their gathering was not altogether spontaneous. It came after months of growing demonstrations and escalating pressure on the country's Communist Party. Throughout the fall, weekly rallies in Leipzig called for freedom of travel and democratic elections. Demonstrations in that city began with just a few hundred protesters, but they grew exponentially until, by early November, they were attracting as many as a half million people. The contagion reached other cities as well: Mass protests started erupting in Dresden, East Berlin and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
         Demonstrations in East Germany did not feed only off each other; they also drew energy from what had become a region-wide revolt. Earlier that year, in the spring, historic marches in Hungary set an example of how popular pressure could propel forward negotiations with a reformist government. That summer, in Poland, the union-based opposition party Solidarityhaving led a series of crippling strikes the year beforewon a stunning and decisive victory in the country's newly liberalized elections. By autumn, rebellion was in full bloom. Hardly more than a week after the November 9 revolt in East Germany, students in Prague undertook the first demonstration of the Velvet Revolution. By the end of the month, social movements would call a general strike and force the end of one-party rule in Czechoslovakia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Looking back now, what can we learn from these extraordinary mobilizations?
        </p>
        <p>
         Conventional political analysts see the revolutions of 1989 as a spontaneous, once-in-a-lifetime swelling of popular discontent. Their description of the wave of uprisings in Eastern Europe mirrors the assertions they make virtually every time an outbreak of mass mobilization erupts on the political stage: They tell us that these moments of peak activity are rare and unpredictable. They contend that mass protest is the product of broad historical forces. And they suggest that no one could consciously engineer events that trigger such upheavals.
        </p>
        <p>
         On each of these points, the political tradition known as civil resistance offers a contrary interpretation. Those who listen will take very different lessons from the momentous ferment of 25 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         Civil resistancethe study and practice of nonviolent conflictis a tradition that traces its lineage through the campaigns of Gandhi, the U.S. civil rights movement, the works of scholars such as Gene Sharp, and contemporary revolts such as the Arab Spring. Immersed in the study of how unarmed uprisings work, analysts in this tradition put forth several propositions that challenge conventional wisdom about 1989: They contend, first, that extraordinary mobilizations are not as rare as they might seem; second, that there is an art to organizing around them; and third, that activists willing to embrace a strategy of nonviolent escalation can often set off historic upheavals of their own.
        </p>
        <h6>
         Uprisings large and small
        </h6>
        <p>
         Prior to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, the idea that the Iron Curtain would fall not primarily through coups and military maneuvers, but through the mobilization of mass, unarmed resistance would have seemed improbable at best and quite possibly deluded. But what has been remarkable in recent decades is how frequently new examples of successful civil resistance have presented themselves. From the Philippines, to Chile, to South Africa, to Serbia, to Tunisia and Egypt, and beyond, the repertoire of civil resistance has ushered in remarkable changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certainly, the revolutions of 1989 were exceptional in their breadth and impact. Yet, viewed in another way, mass uprisings are a more regular part of our political lives than we often acknowledge. Once you are looking for them, popular mobilizations start to appear constantlymaterializing with little notice in diverse countries, drawing new participants out of the woodwork, and upending politics as usual. The Arab Spring of 2011 is an obvious example, one which evoked memories of Eastern Europe. But momentous disruptions need not be so sweeping and international to be significant. Nor need they take place in undemocratic contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just in the United States, and just in the past 15 years, we have seen disruptive outbreaks emerge with shocking frequency, capturing the spotlight at a wide range of levels, from the national to the local. Nationwide, landmark protests against the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund in Seattle and Washington, D.C., at the turn of the century were followed by massive anti-war mobilizations in New York and San Francisco in 2003. Historic immigration marches that materialized in 2006 were followed by the multiplying encampments of the Occupy movement in 2011. State-level mobilizations such as the Wisconsin uprising, citywide protests against police brutality in Oakland and Ferguson, and campus living wage sit-ins, while taking place on more modest scales, have all had outsized impact in galvanizing public debate. For intensive spurts, each drew in unusual numbers of participants, activating people in ways that are mysterious and foreign to conventional politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         That mainstream commentators are taken by surprise, again and again, by such mobilizationslarge and smallspeaks more to their own biases than to the contours of how social change happens.
        </p>
        <p>
         And yet their biases are not unique. A predisposition toward gradualism extends even into social movement circles. The school of community organizing pioneered by Saul Alinsky has traditionally viewed mass mobilizations with suspicion. Organizers in this lineage charge that outbreaks of protest are flashes in the pan, too unpredictable and unsustainable to be relied upon. They stress that their goal is to build organizations not movements; they seek to create institutions that can leverage grassroots power on an ongoing basis. Interestingly, Alinsky himself
         <a href="file://localhost/applewebdata/::705A18A9-EF3E-4F1A-85A1-84A7E15135C7:%2522http/::wagingnonviole">
          was more open
         </a>
         to extraordinary potential of peak moments than many of his ideological descendents. Seeing the rush of civil rights activity that followed the 1961 Freedom Rides in the segregated South, Alinsky and his protg Nicholas von Hoffman dubbed it a moment of the whirlwind. The two agreed on the need to temporarily set aside their normal organizing methodologies in order to tap into the energy of the extraordinary uprising.
        </p>
        <h6>
         The politics of the unusual
        </h6>
        <p>
         In contrast to conventional politicians, and even to many organizers, Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King carefully studied the dynamics of creating moments of the whirlwind. They were specialists in the politics of the unusual. Through the use of nonviolent conflict, they sought to produce ruptures in the normal functioning of the political system, and thus to propel previously ignored injustices to the fore of public consciousness. It was their talent for doing so that secured their places in history.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his
         <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu:5801/transcription/document_images/undecided/630416-019.pdf">
          famous 1963 letter from the Birmingham city jail
         </a>
         , King explained that the purpose of direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation with otherwise intransigent adversaries. Early in his career, King had been reluctantly thrown into crises created by other activists and organizations. But by the time of the Birmingham campaign, he had developed a savvy understanding of how to manufacture nonviolent conflicts that could stir national indignation and move foot-dragging politicians.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his 1968 book,
         <em>
          Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?
         </em>
         , he described civil rights organizations using militant direct action as specialists in agitation and dramatic projects, creating explosive events that attracted massive sympathy and support. He self-critically noted that these events were no substitute for building institutional structures that could sustain the fight for the long haul. Still, the uprisings he helped create in places like Birmingham and Selma had shaken the American public like few other efforts and had become defining peaks in the push for civil rights.
        </p>
        <p>
         Decades before, Gandhi had likewise articulated how nonviolent conflict could be used to consciously provoke social crises. Those who have to bring about radical changes in human conditions and surroundings, he wrote in 1932, cannot do it except by raising a ferment in society.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the earliest studies of Gandhi's method, Krishnalal Shridharani's 1939 text
         <em>
          War Without Violence
         </em>
         , elaborates on this theme. It notes that unarmed uprisings often have more in common with war than with routine interest group politics. Underlying  both violence and non-violence, Shridharani writes, is the basic assumption that certain radical social changes cannot be brought about save by mass action capable of precipitating an emotional crisis, and that the humdrum everyday existence of human life needs shaking up in order that man may arrive at fateful decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 1930, when the time came for a decisive confrontation with the British Raj, the Indian National Congress entrusted Gandhi as the sole strategist in charge of crafting its direct action challenge. Congress members did so not because they were his spiritual disciples  in fact, many distrusted his otherworldly faith in the power of redemptive sufferingbut rather because Gandhi had gained a hard-won reputation for being able to create disruptions of historic proportions. In this case, the result was the famous Salt March of 1930, one of the landmark events in the drive for Indian self-determination.
        </p>
        <h6>
         An undetermined future
        </h6>
        <p>
         When social movements are able to provoke political crises that prompt dramatic change, they are not always given much credit for their efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Looking at the revolutions of 1989, some political scientists hardly discuss popular movements at all. Instead, they focus on economic and geopolitical developments. They stress how the long-term strain caused by competition with the West and the perpetual economic crises in the Eastern Bloc fomented unrest. They highlight Mikhail Gorbachev's signals that the Soviet Union would tolerate reform rather than replicating the Chinese crackdown at Tiananmen
         <em>
          .
         </em>
         These stances are part of a wider trend: political analysts commonly describe the timing and fortunes of mass uprisings as the product of historic conditions rather then the decisions of citizens themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Analysts in the field of civil resistance do not deny the importance of economic and political context. But they
         <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/hardy-merriman/trifecta-of-civil-resistance-unity-planning-discipline">
          emphasize
         </a>
         the interplay of such
         <em>
          conditions
         </em>
         with the
         <em>
          skills
         </em>
         of social movement participantsthe agency of activists, as reflected in their strategic choices and on-the-ground execution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Historians have the luxury of looking back after the fact of an uprising and identifying the structural forces and historical peculiarities that contributed to a successful effort, or that helped to sink an unsuccessful one. Activists on the ground, in contrast, never have the benefit of hindsight, and they must make the most of whatever conditions they encounter. As Hardy Merriman, an analyst and trainer in nonviolent conflict,
         <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/hardy-merriman/trifecta-of-civil-resistance-unity-planning-discipline">
          writes
         </a>
         , agency and skills make a difference, and in some cases have enabled movements to overcome, circumvent or transform adverse conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to note that, overwhelmingly, the same experts who would later credit historical conditions for the momentous shifts of 1989 did not foresee the potential that existed at the time. Writing for the leading journal
         <em>
          Foreign Affairs
         </em>
         in 1987, a former U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia argued that, despite signs of openness from Gorbachev, there is no prospect of fundamental change in relations between [Warsaw Pact] countries and the USSR. In the face of such discouraging prognoses, it took a daring and skillful leap of faith for activists to challenge the entrenched and repressive regimes that ruled over them.
        </p>
        <h6>
         From trigger to explosion
        </h6>
        <p>
         Ultimately, neither skills nor conditions are enough on their own. At any given time, history might offer up a trigger event that provokes widespread outrage and sends people into the streets. But it takes determined escalation on the part of social movements to keep the issue in the spotlight, to compel greater participation and sacrifice, and to repeatedly reinforce the sense of public urgency.
        </p>
        <p>
         A final lesson that we can draw in looking back at the revolutions of 1989 is that, when a whirlwind truly begins churning, it is not the result of one incident. Rather, it is the product of multiple, compounding crisesmany of which are the result of deliberate effort.
        </p>
        <p>
         In his book
         <em>
          Doing Democracy,
         </em>
         Bill Moyer, a long-time social movement trainer and theorist of the nonviolent direct action tradition in the United States, describes the concept of a trigger event. A trigger is a highly publicized, shocking incident that dramatically reveals a critical social problem to the public in a vivid way. These events, Moyer argues, are an essential part of the cycle of every social movement. They create vital windows in which activists can rally mass participation and sharply increase public support for a cause.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prominent examples of trigger events include the accident at the Three Mile Island power plant in 1979, which suddenly made nuclear safety a hot button issue. Just days after the accident, a previously planned anti-nuclear rally in San Francisco that ordinarily might have attracted hundreds of participants instead drew a crowd of 25,000. Similarly, the 1955 arrest of Rosa Parks for refusing to move to the back of a segregated bus prompted a community-wide boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. And the self-immolation of Tunisianfruit seller Muhammad Bouazizi set off the revolts of the Arab Spring in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trigger events, however, are only the beginning; they provide no guarantee of change. There are countless instances of oil spills and school shootings, for example, that spark outrage but ultimately have little impact on political life. Likewise, there have been many other self-immolations that did not have the effect ofBouazizi's.
        </p>
        <p>
         In truth, the triggers that do morph into explosive revolts are often less accidental than they first appear. Civil resistance works when groups are willing to seize an opportunity and escalaterallying the power of mass participation and personal sacrifice in order to produce ever more ambitious acts of resistance. Before Rosa Parks, there had been previous arrests on Jim Crow buses, but civil rights groups consciously chose to make Parks' arrest into a test case for segregation, in part because she was a committed activist herself. In other instances, from the Salt March, to Birmingham, to Occupy, movements created their own trigger events, using disruptive actions to make headlines, prompt a reaction from authorities, and begin a cycle in which new participants could join in to ever-larger actions.

         On November 17, 1989, a week after the Berlin Wall fell, students in Prague held a march to mark the anniversary of a university activist who had been killed during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia.Sociologists Lester Kurtz and Lee Smithey
         <a href="file://localhost/applewebdata/::705A18A9-EF3E-4F1A-85A1-84A7E15135C7:%2522http/::books.google.com:books%3Fid=rlIH-NQbFQgC&amp;dq=Nonvi">
          describe

         how, when the students encountered security forces, they offered flowers to police and waved their bare hands in the air.The police attacked nevertheless, indiscriminately bludgeoning the students with their truncheons.
        </p>
        <p>
         This was the spark that set Czechoslovakia alight, one writer later remarked.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certainly, the students were responding to the swelling of revolt in countries all around them. But it was their decision to brave the threat of repressionknowing the dangers, but not the consequencesthat launched the Velvet Revolution. And it was the decision of countless others to join them that gave the revolution its force. Today, few things about the whirlwind uprisings of 1989 are more relevant to remember than this choice: to rise up in the face of uncertain outcomes, to risk escalation, and to create the possibility of setting a movement ablaze.

           The Russian military wasn't de-Communized right AFTER the collapse of the USSR. Since then, via attrition, secret Communist party members are still in control, as I've already proved, and which you should know if you have relatives in the Russian military.

           So, when you reply "are you kidding" to my question, I don't know if that means that you have never been there or that you have been there quite a few times.  However, your last comment clearly shows that you have never been there.  The changes are far from "superficial".

           The USSR is over.  However, your writing indicates that you do not agree with that statement.  Have you ever been to Russia?  Recently?  It has changed a lot over the last 25 years.

           Reagan and Gorbachev Didnt Tear Down the Berlin Wall, but it looked good politically for grand standing  while  the get rich quick opportunists helped sell parts of the wall to the highest bidders and collectors? Yes everything has a price for collectors and the wealthy, even walls and Democracy while the victims of the wall oppressors are left with their memories.

           Communist governments dont react, they are proactive, hence the events that culminated in the demolition of the Berlin Wall were staged. In fact, the demolition of the Berlin Wall was already predicted by KGB defector Major Anatoliy Golitsyn.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1984, Golitsyn published the book New Lies For Old, wherein he warned about a long-term deception strategy of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States. Among other amazingly precise predictions that came true, predictions that could only have been made by inside knowledge of the nature of the Communist ruse, Golitsyn stated:
          </p>
          <p>
           "The 'liberalization' [in the Soviet Union] would be spectacular and impressive. Formal pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's role; its monopoly would be apparently curtailed."
          </p>
          <p>
           and
          </p>
          <p>
           "Liberalization" in Eastern Europe would probably involve the return to power in Czechoslovakia of Dubcek and his associates. If it should be extended to East Germany, demolition of the Berlin Wall might even be contemplated."
          </p>
          <p>

            https://archive.org/details/Go...
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           How about that! The real shocking prediction Golitsyn makes in the second quote doesn't involve the Berlin Wall, however, it concerns Dubcek, who was elected back into power after the fake collapse of Communist Czechoslovakia...
          </p>
          <p>
           "Dubek was elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly (the Czechoslovak Parliament) on 28 December 1989, and re-elected in 1990 and 1992." --

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Well, since publication in 1984 of Golitsyn's book (or earlier), Communist strategists decided to amend the "liberalization" ruse for a "collapse" ruse.

           Golitsyns observations on Tiananmen Square
          </p>
          <p>
           The Chinese crackdown occurred on the eve of the changes in Eastern Europe. It sent (and may have been intended to send) a clear signal to the East Europeans that too much unrest in the course of 'perestroika' could lead to military intervention, and to the Chinese that the forthcoming changes in Eastern Europe could not be agitated for in China. It may be that the Chinese also saw a need to take advance precautions to stabilise their regime politically and to give it a clearer socialist direction after their introduction of elements of 'capitalism' - a Chinese tactic of taking one step forward with one foot, then one step forward with the other.

           And who were the demonstrators? Golitsyn reveals
          </p>
          <p>
           SELECTIVE KILLING OF THE UNORGANISED ELEMENTS IN TIENANMEN SQUARE On 13 June 1989, 'The New York Times' published a report by Nicholas D. Kristof, its Peking correspondent, disputing the report published on 12 June and asserting that, while troops were shooting and killing victims in the area around the square, there was no firm evidence that students were killed in the middle of the square itself. If Kristof's version is correct, it would support the suggestion that the crackdown was aimed, not
          </p>
          <p>
           at the original pro-democracy demonstrators who, by Kristof s account, left the square together singing the 'Internationale', and who had been carrying placards supporting the Communist Party, but at the unorganised elements who sought to join them or otherwise to take advantage of the demonstration.
          </p>
          <p>
           The pro-democracy Communist students had already left the square when the massacre commenced. So much for civil resistance in Communist nations. Meet controlled opposition instead.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, the collapse of the USSR and East Bloc nations couldnt have taken place unless the political parties of the West hadnt already been co-opted by Marxists. Notice that not one political party in the West demanded verification of the collapse of the USSR, and the media failed to alert your attention to this fact, including the "alternative" media. When determining whether the "former" USSR is complying with arms control treaties, what does the United States do to confirm compliance? Right, the United States sends into the "former" USSR investigative teams to VERIFY compliance, yet when it's the fate of the West that's at stake should the collapse of the USSR be a ruse, what does the United States do to confirm the collapse? Nothing!
          </p>
          <p>
           It gets worse--the "freed" Soviets and West also never (1) de-Communized the Soviet Armed Forces of its Communist Party officer corps, which was 90% officered by Communist Party members; and (2) arrested and detained the 6-million vigilantes that assisted the Soviet Union's Ministry of the Interior and police control the populations of the larger cities during the period of "Perestroika" (1986-1991)!
          </p>
          <p>
           The fraudulent "collapse" of the USSR (and East Bloc) couldn't have been pulled off until both political parties in the United States (and political parties elsewhere in the West) were co-opted by Moscow &amp; Allies, which explains why verification of the collapse was never undertaken by the West, such verification being (1) a natural administrative procedure (since the USSR wasnt occupied by Western military forces); and (2) necessary for the survival of the West. Recall President Reagan's favorite phrase, "Trust, but verify".
          </p>
          <p>
           There can be no collapse of the USSR (or East Bloc nations) without...
          </p>
          <p>
           Verification, De-Communization and De-mobilization.
          </p>
          <p>
           The West never verified the collapse of the USSR because no collapse occurred, since if a real collapse had occurred the West would have verified it, since the survival of the West depends on verification. Conversely, this proves that the political parties of the West were co-opted by Marxists long before the fraudulent collapse of the USSR, since the survival of the West depends on verification.
          </p>
          <p>
           The above means that the so-called "War on Terror" is a USSR &amp; Allies-tasked operation being carried out by the co-opted governments of the West, the purpose being to (1) destroy the prominence of the West in the eyes of the world, where the West is seen (i) invading nations without cause; (ii) causing chaos around the globe; and (iii) killing over one-million civilians and boasting of torture; (2) close off non-Russian supplies of oil for export, thereby increasing the price of oil, the higher price allowing oil exporting Russia to maintain economic stability while she modernizes and increases her military forces; (3) destroy the United States Armed Forces via the never-ending "War on Terror"; the ultimate purpose of the aforementioned to (4) bring about the demise of the United States in the world, opening up a political void to be filled by a new pan-national entity composed of Europe and Russia (replacing the European Union), a union From the Atlantic to Vladivostok"; which will (5) see the end of NATO.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now you know how Bolshevik Russia survived in 1917; how the West "lost" China to the Communists in 1949; why the Eisenhower administration turned a deaf ear to the anti-Communist Hungarian uprising in 1956; why the Eisenhower administration in 1959 was indifferent to the Castro brothers' Communist fidelity, actually used the CIA to overthrow the Batista government; why the Nixon administration abandoned Taiwan for Communist China, and signed treaties/provided economic aid to the USSR; why the Nixon administration refused to tell the American People that over 50% of North Vietnamese NVA regiments were actually Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers (attired in NVA uniforms), thereby (1) ensuring the Vietnam War would be lost; (2) destroying the prominence of the United States abroad and at home; (3) breeding distrust between the American people and their government; and (4) securing Communist victories in Southeast Asia. Working in the background within the political parties of the United States and Great Britain were Marxist agents doing their best to (1) ensure the survival of Communist nations when they popped up; and (2) sabotage any policies that would bring down a Communist nation. That's why after the fake collapses of the East Bloc nations and USSR there was no mandatory Western verification process to ensure the Communists weren't still in control.

           What romantic nonsense. German reunification only occurred because Russia, Europe, and the U.S. agreed that NATO would not build any bases in former SSR countries. Once reunification occurred that promise was forgotten and NATO started building bases ever closer to Russia (which is why we have the present situations in the Ukraine and in Georgia-South Ossetia-Abkhazia). Tearing down the Berlin wall was an anticlimactic expression by the people.
          </p>
          <p>
           Nor was any other popular expression for reunification a direct cause of reunification.
          </p>
          <p>
           The authors, in referencing Tiananmen Square, provide the evidence that their theory of civil disobedience resulting in positive political change  is incorrect.

          <p>
           They extol the results of  the  Arab Spring of 2011 without acknowledging that zero freedom was gained and that Tunisia as well as many other Arab countries have merely exchanged an autocrat for gangs of radical Islamists or criminal cartels.

           In These Times and the authors of this article need to stop believing the myths of American popular freedom. That tired cliche isn't even working in the U.S.
