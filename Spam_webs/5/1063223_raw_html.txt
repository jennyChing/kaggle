             . Theyre correctly pointing out how bereft Marks column is of history, research,  practical awareness, racial sensitivity, or the sheer realities of hunger or even  homelessness that low-income children face. Marks seems to suggest that kids from impoverished backgrounds  all too many of whom are African American  can simply access computers and lift themselves up by their digital bootstraps to use free websites and enter elite prep schools or colleges. Maybe a handful of motivated  kids will manage a heroic feat like that despite all the odds, but is this going to work for the majority of poor kids?

             Statement from Secretary Sebelius on becoming the new Chair of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Yesterday, I was pleased to take on the role of Chair of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness. I look forward to building on the hard work of this years Chair, Secretary Solis, whose accomplishments include: developing a plan to increase access to mainstream benefits and launching Opening Doors-the nations first-ever comprehensive strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The implementation of Opening Doors over the last year has given our federal agencies an opportunity to work together on an issue we all care about. Each member of the Council brings a unique approach to this problem and through this collaboration were laying the groundwork for future successes with better data collection, better reporting, and better use of mainstream resources. By engaging states and local communities in the plans goals and strategies, were making sure everyone is in agreement as we move forward.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             While Im proud to say we are making progress, homelessness remains a serious issue and there is more work to do. As I take on the role of Chair for the year ahead, I am looking forward to building on our current foundation as we work to end homelessness altogether. In these tough economic times, continued cross-agency collaboration is more important than ever to help those who are homeless.
             <br/>

             The government will not shut down -- hurray! And the Most Wonderful Time of the Year is here -- hurray! Both are cause to celebrate (or something). Congress may like to hoist a$1 trillion-plus catchall budget bill, but here at MOMocrats for special occasions we like to hoist a very classy martini or glass of wine or tankard of ale or...you get the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today's Pursuit of Happiness Hour suggests a very tasty martini:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Danish Christmas Cookie Martini
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             one shot Vanilla vodka
            </p>
            <p>
             half shot DiSaronno
            </p>
            <p>
             shot (or so) of Ginger Ale to taste
            </p>
            <p>
             It's best to mix this with chilled ingredients versus shaking with ice, but in the event you haven't got them chilled, shake briefly and gently with ice and serve only slightly chilled versus cold.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pour into chilled martini glass.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you want to get really fancy, rim the martini glass with powdered sugar.
            </p>

             will be hosting an historic twitter chat sponsored by the women at Moms Clean Air Force featuring EPA administrator Lisa P Jackson.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is an amazing opportunity for MOMocrats readers to actually ask first questions about one of the issues that effects all of us, air quality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Currently, there are no national limits on the amount of mercury and other toxic air pollution released from power plant smokestacks. The toxic air pollutants from the coal and oil fired plants have numerous and serious health effects, especially on children. Research has shown that Mercury harms children's developing brains, including effects on memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other toxic metals found such as arsenic, chromium and nickel are known to cause cancer. Not to mention the damage Mercury and many of the other toxic pollutants causes our nation's lakes, streams, and fish.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is just a handful of the reasons why the EPAs proposed Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule will have a huge impact on our health, the air, the economy and even jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The EPA estimates the value of the improvements to health alone total $59 billion to $140 billion by 2016 by preventing thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of heart attacks, bronchitis cases and asthma attacks. Meeting the standards created by the rule would also create new jobs such as building, installing and operating the equipment to reduce the harmful emissions of mercury and other toxics.
            </p>
            <p>

             As  for Obama -- as upset as this decision makes me, I do feel that by  becoming President at this time in our country's history, he simply can  never win with us -- let alone the vast right wing conspiracy that is  making it impossible to do even the simplest things. Every tiny little  victory is won with the greatest effort -- just look at how impossible  the GOP has made it to get the Federal government fully staffed (or the  CFPB, which Slate said they are "nullifying" by refusing to even vote on  Cordray).
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  think it's correct for those of us on the left to point out bad policy  decisions -- but we also need to strengthen our support more than ever.  2012 is going to be an epic fight on every level of government and we  need to be vigilant against all the misinformation the Fox and CNN  machine and superPACs are going to throw at us. MOMocrats is filling a  real vacuum by disseminating facts that are going to be drowned out by  all the right wing noise.

             Donna,  for the most part, I agree that Obama needs to win 2012 election, but  what kind of choice is that, really? All that he and Sebelius had to do  was let the FDA do its job. No HHS Secretary has ever overturned an FDA  decision, so why not just let it ride and let the zealots do the dirty  work? I think that this may have a chilling effect on future decisions  that might benefit womens health.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I'm  not giving money to Obama or fundraising for him this time. Sorry, I  just can't do it. I'll vote for him, but any funds I have will go toward  down-ticket women and advocacy groups. I will vote for him, but that's  it.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  haven't had much to say about politics lately because I am disgusted by  the whole scene. I can't watch or listen to anyone from either party  anymore.

             I think that's a perfect strategy -- that the usual "coattail riding"  effect this year will be reversed, with Obama doing well only if the  Democrats do in state and local elections (and we need them there!)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The down-ticket women and advocacy groups are going to need all the money they can get.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  wonder what will happen in a second term, when there is no pressure to  be re-elected. I know I would love a President who did what was right  and didn't worry about re-election -- but I would be just as angry at  him for doing a Jimmy Carter and making it impossible to elect another  Democrat for another dozen years.

             I  understand the strategy and to a large extent, agree with it. But I  confess, I'm a little bit confused over the whole PlanB thing. I have  basically been told I'm not a liberal because I don't think it should be  available to younger children so easily. I also understand the  arguments for making it available. It is a difficult, complex, emotional  issue. I'm not sure there is an absolute wrong or right in this case.  Only gray, murky areas. For example, Yaz was sold to younger women as  the best birth control ever. After the fact, it emerges that it carries  some pretty severe and even deadly side effects for some. PlanB is a  hormone. I don't think it should be dispensed without some minimum  instruction and oversight. That's just me. I also understand the  arguments on the other side and respect them. But in the end, is this  really a black and white, cut and dried issue?
             <br/>

             <strong>
              Cynematic:
             </strong>
             Karoli, one of the more effective arguments for keeping Plan B OTC,  aside from the fact that studies on pubescent girls under 17 showed they  understood how and why they would use Plan B, is that when it's under  the pharmacist's lock &amp; key to dispense, women 17 and older are now  effectively prevented from buying it when the pharmacy desk is not open  but the rest of the drugstore/supermarket is. (That's setting aside the  "conscience clause" -- for CONTRACEPTIVES!!! -- that some pharmacists  might exercise, and might extend to Plan B. Like seriously, we're all  Roman Catholics now??!?!? Rhetorical question.)
             <br/>
             <br/>
             So  in effect, young teen girls are being used as the excuse to curtail  access for the older women who in all likelihood are the ones needing to  use it. This fear of pregnant 12 year olds is being put forth at a time  when
             <a href="http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2011/12/01/index.html " target="_blank" title="Guttmacher: Teen Pregnancy &amp; Contraceptive Use">
              teen pregnancy rates are actually declining, as are abortions in  that age group
             </a>
             . The same study shows that girls are using more effective contraceptives more frequently:
             <br/>
             <br/>
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
             There  are currently no direct data available to tell us why teens are  changing their contraceptive practices. However, anecdotal reports  indicate that recent changes in medical recommendations that allow teens  and young adults to access hormonal contraceptives without a pelvic  exam or Pap test have made it easier for them to startand  continueusing these methods.
            </p>
            <p>
             <br/>
             Given  the timely nature of Plan B's effectiveness, 12-24 hours delay in  purchase and use could make a big difference to the woman who needs it.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Im  glad were talking about this on MOMocrats because there are no doubt  many pro-choice women, especially moms of daughters, who feel this issue  keenly both in disappointment with Obama *and* on another side with  relief that he may have put his thumb on the scales by voicing his  opinion on disallowing it to girls 17 and under.

              Glennia:

             I think what set me over the edge was the fact that the administration  put itself out in front of an FDA decision when it has not on any number  of things that benefit pharmaceutical companies. Why this? Why now? was  what I first thought. The answer seemed clear: at risk teenage girls  are an easy target to throw under the political bus because they have no  political clout. The second thing that irked me was the fact that the  decision was not based on science, but politics.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  guess we all have a line, and this was it for me. I think one of the  things that I love most about this group is the fact that we don't  always agree and that we can discuss things.

             <br/>
             And  I can only stomach so much of it, too -- I take frequent breaks from  the news, because it's depressing when it's all so bad. That's why I'm  grateful that there is a large group of us to populate the MOMocrats'  blog, Facebook page, podcast, Twitter stream, et al with material.

             The  Plan B, abortion for teens with out parental consent, etc is a fight I  have with my husband daily ... ok not daily but a lot.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             He  thinks anything to do with giving a drug to his daughter or doing a  procedure on his daughter, who is a minor, requires his consent. HE  doesn't care what other families are like. He doesn't care what could  happen to some other girls, he just see it through the eyes of HIS  daughter. And I think that's what happens with this issue. We're dealing  with a President who had two young girls so I have ZERO doubt this is a  discussion he and Michelle have had. Why the admin went this route, I  am SURE has something to do with what they are going to get on the other  end- which very well may be part of the upcoming battle over Affordable Care Act repeal  and decisions and discussions. At least, that's what I hope. That there  is some damn good reason we are unaware of. Of course, like in most  cases, there is no good 'enough' reason and teenage girls certainly  can't vote...so.... sigh.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  don't think anyone can see logically on this one. Regardless of how  hard we try. If it were up to me abortions would be like flu shots right  now -- at every CVS and Rite Aid and advertising out the wazzooIoo -- I  have taken the morning after pill 'just in case. Once. And it  admittedly was not the greatest experience and I was too embarrassed to  ask my OBGYN questions. It would be typical of our society that any guy  could easily grab a condom but for women it must be complicated --  drugs, hormones, etc.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  can see both side of this argument, and I live in a liberal household, I  guess is what I'm trying to say. And the President has never been shy  about how moderate he can be and there is a crap load going on behind  the scenes as they deal with what is the most ignorant bunch of  Republicans ever assembled.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  just hope everyone keeps their eyes on re-election. Because knowing he  won't have to campaign again in his second term makes me very hopefully  he'll be tougher on somethings he can't be tough on now.
             <br/>

             I hear [Erin's husband's] point here. I'm uncomfortable with abortions for a lot  of reasons. I know you guys know this. But I strongly believe its a  personal decision so I support the right to choose. And when it comes to  this, I see babies in school bathroom trash cans. It is 2000 times more  important to me to prevent, to prevent a greater tragedy or trauma. And  sure babies are blessings and sure many teen moms see it as a great  making of their lives. I'm glad for that. But sometimes it is just  better for some people if things had not gotten to that point. I do  carry a bit of a que sera sera belief, but when asked to choose, I always prefer prevention.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <strong>
              Donna:
             </strong>
             I  take solace in the fact that Plan B is available to all but minors  without a prescription -- especially since the anti-Choice crowd did not  want it on the market in this country at all.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             If  my daughter should need it before she turns 18, I'll get it for her --  no questions asked. Unfortunately, I don't think she would come to me.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In  the UK, almost all the meds we are used to getting over the counter  must be obtained through consultation with a pharmacist. It threw me for  a loop the first times I needed decongestant or a cortisol cream -- but  I got used to it.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             When  I was a teen, condoms were also kept behind the counter. I worked at a  drugstore when I was a teen; I don't recall it being a deterrent for  those who wanted to buy. Just something to get used to, I suppose.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             And  when you remember what a fight it was to get Plan B approved in any  form, I am just glad that most of us can get it without a prescription.  If my daughter needs it before she's of age, I'll gladly purchase it for  her (that is, if she feels comfortable enough to ask me - but that's  another matter).

             You never know Donna. It was hard but when I was 14 I asked my Mom to  take me to get the pill. She told me over, and over, and over again that  she would take me and not say a word when I wanted. And she was true to  her word. I asked her, nearly puking I was so scared, to take me. She  made the appointment, we sat in the waiting room (God I will never  forget) and said very little ...we went in. I asked the doctor to go on  the pill and got my pap smear...and that was that.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             She  filled it for me every month and left it on my dresser top. Eventually  we talked a lot more about it and stuff but that initial visit was her  in my head, promising me over and over and over again. Had she not done  that, I never would have asked.

             Well as I said I'm sure they have discussed it because they have two  daughters. Consulting her in an official capacity is entirely different.  They have two daughters -- we have one who is 6 and we've discussed it  already at our house. If they have any sort of marriage and speak about  their daughters futures, I can't imagine this hasn't come up.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I'm  curious if you actually doubt he and Michelle discuss matters that  affect their daughters or if you mean he consulted her in an official  capacity as decisions on this were being made?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Because  that leads to a larger question of what sort of father and husband you  think he may or may not be as opposed to what sort of President. Which  is entirely different.

             And  that doubt may speak to what some voters are feeling- that he's an  overall jerk who doesn't even talk to his wife about matters concerning  their daughters OR if he simply wouldn't talk to his wife about matters  on his desk about women and girls.

             Considering  the type of woman our First Lady is, I doubt very highly she is not  involved. Much like First Lady Clinton. But Michelle has to be even more  careful as the entire world seems to pounce on every word she says,  which of course is a country not ready for a strong black woman. But  that's another story. I wish she could be as outspoken as Hillary was  when First Lady...but sadly our country isn't ready for it. And hasn't  been, and made that VERY clear during the last election.

             As  for whether Obama consults Michelle, of course we can't really know  what their marriage is like. But having interacted with her quite a bit  and, as Erin mentioned, knowing the type of woman she is -- I think  she'd fit in nicely here, I can't believe she wouldn't offer her counsel  whether solicited or not. She is definitely a women with strong  opinions and a fierce mama bear. I've heard from some people in the  administration that she has been very firm with her husband (and his  administration) about what they need to do to help military families.  But then, that's not terribly controversial. And that's the thing, I  think it's hard to guess what Mrs. Obama's personal opinions would be  about Plan B. She's been very diplomatic about not delving into  controversy. For all we know, she fully supported his decision for the  same reason Erin's husband does.

             I get it that reasonable pro-choice parents can be deeply squicked by  the idea that their daughters could be 1) sexually active before all  family messages have deemed it wise 2) pregnant and then
             <em>
              not
             </em>
             without  parents ever knowing and 3) that my abstract position of "yes teen girls  including some very young early-onset puberty pre-tween and tween girls  should have access to Plan B" is AN ABSTRACTION for me as the parent of  a son. I do not have skin in the game directly with a daughter to think  of in the way that I do as a grown woman.

             But  I am still troubled that by making the pharmacist the gatekeeper, women  older than 17 will be potentially subject to someone else's  "conscience" about the taking of what otherwise would be OTC medication  with the same status as other OTC medications. And scared young teens won't have access when they need it most.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Is  the regulation standing in for what should be parental vigilance,  especially parental vigilance in helping pre-tween and tween girls  develop healthy sexualities, as well as older teens? Should or can an  FDA/HHS regulation do that? It seems were freighting a regulatory  decision with more than it can reasonably handle.

             Digby has a post up reporting that there is ZERO political upside to  this decision. So stop for a minute and think about why a man who is as  smart as he would have made it. I have two thoughts. First, as Erin  says, he came at it as a father. That's certainly one possibility. The  other is the possible concern that it would create issues with Sibelius'  directive that BC be free under the Affordable Care Act. If Plan B  lands in that classification it would not be covered 100% as OTC.

             It's true that Plan B may be tied to the overall battle to get  contraceptives covered for free under health insurance. There was noise  about the latter last week, then radio silence. There's also been radio  silence from many trusted pro-choice legislators who we'd ordinarily  expect to have kicked up a fuss.

             I  had postulated on Twitter that perhaps it was horse trading: appearance  of "capitulation" to the religious right/US Conference of Catholic  Bishops on this one very circumscribed issue surrounding Plan B in  exchange for their yielding on contraceptives as preventative care and  therefore free under all health plans.

             I just doubt he [Obama] would have thrown at risk teen girls under the  bus if he had talked with her [Michelle]. Just as I wonder about whether  he consults with her on things like Paycheck Fairness Act. He's had  Jarrett out front for years telling people -- including us -- that it's a  priority. Yet nothing. Part of my doubt stems from Michelle's own  accounts of how little he consulted her on big decisions before he was  President, which makes me wonder -- if he cared so little about the  opinion of his worldly &amp; highly educated wife, why should I believe  he cares about women in general ?

             Let's not forget that the decision-maker was Sibelius, a woman. Also  intelligent and thoughtful. I thought her public reasoning was thin, it  felt like an excuse. As Glennia rightly pointed out, she overrode the  FDA for the first time in history. I keep asking 'why', and I keep  coming back to her also-unprecedented decision to require 100% coverage  of BCP. I believe they're related to each other and she may have  sacrificed one for the other. I have no hard evidence of that, but I  simply don't believe it was a 'throwing under the bus' moment without  nuance and possibly some other undisclosed circumstances.

             I'm leery of ascribing decisions to POTUS not caring about women that  can just as easily be ascribed to him having male privilege, and women's  and girls issues being an issue he can afford to table (again, because  of male privilege). Similarly to what Jay Smooth says about  conversations about racism, I think the conversation is more  productively focused on what someone has done rather than who they are  as a person. I doubt that POTUS doesn't care much for the opinion of  women, but even caring about women's opinions wouldn't make him immune  to male privilege in his decision-making.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I've  been thinking of writing up a post for MOMo about POTUS's comments  about his daughters from the perspective of having grown up  Republican/pro-life and having a lot of friends who were convinced  Senator Obama was the "most radically pro-abortion presidential  candidate in history." One reason cited for this was his comments that  he didn't want his daughters "punished with a baby" or STDs if they  made a mistake, which pro-lifers pounced on as evidence that he thinks  all babies are burdens. It's interesting to juxtapose that comment with  the one re: Plan B and his daughters, because it shows how paternalism  can go both ways when it comes to rights, but even when "benevolent" is  no basis for real equality.

             The linkage between the contraception debate as a basic benefit
             <br/>
             (opposed  by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops) and emergency contraception/Plan B might seem like a  natural one but they don't bear on each other. The decision to include  contraception in the basic benefit package follows a recommendation by  the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the

              US Preventative Services Task Force
             </a>
             (USPSTF). It covers drugs and devices approved  by the FDA. As emergency contraception is an OTC medication, its status  is unchanged. The basic benefit package will only concern itself with  prescription medication.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             I  do think this was an incredibly cowardly act. When I was ranting to my  husband over his shaky internet connection, he was especially taken by a  quote from
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ 2011/12/08/health/policy/sebelius-overrules-fda-on-freer-sale-of- emergency-contraceptives.html?_r=3&amp;ref=us)" target="_blank" title="NYT: Sebelius Overrides FDA on Freer Sale of Emergency Contraceptives">

             And  that's what it boils down to for me. I am not a political token. My  reproductive freedom is not a political bargaining chip. I am REALLY  tired of being told to wait. Give in on abortion in the health reform  bill, give in as the administration waffles and plays nice with the  United Conference of Catholic Bishops over contraception as a basic  benefit (even though a Guttmacher survey found that 98% of Catholic  women used birth control methods not approved by the Church) and over  "conscience clause" wording in federal programs. I am TIRED of this  administration assuming that because -- to paraphase Pat Schroeder --  because I have uterus and brain and they both work I'm just an automatic  "yes" in their 2012 battle. I won't vote for any of the crazy GOPers.  But that doesn't mean I'll spend this election season working for Obama  either. It doesn't mean I'll open my wallet or checkbook. It doesn't  mean I'll stand out in the cold for GOTV. It doesn't mean I'll put up a  lawn sign. It doesn't mean I'll put a bumper sticker on my car. It  doesn't mean I'll go to town halls. It doesn't mean I'll offer to  volunteer as an election judge or drive people to the polls. It means  I'll sit on my hands.

             Except  it has become so. Sure, sure, the argument is about the under 17 crowd  and I'm just about twice that age. But can someone tell me what  differentiates a 16 yr old from a 17 yr old? And if we can't make that  distinction, how does a young woman magically change from not-studied to  well-studied in a year? After all, we allow young people to access  sensitive health services without parental consent in many states. Not  just repro services, either; mental health and substance abuse  counseling and treatment are protected in 20-odd states. We allow them  to buy tylenol which, when mixed with alcohol, can be deadly.

             I  get the parental consent issues. I look at Ruth, just shy of 4, and of  course I'd want her to come to me but here is what I ask myself: If she  didn't want to come to me, felt she couldn't, does my desire for  parental involvement outweigh the potential consequences? The answer is  no. My desire for parental oversight is not great enough to  overcome my dread at her becoming pregnant and having to make a much  harder decision. We have a very open house -- my father-in-law practically turned  purple when Ruth asked at breakfast one morning "How do babies come  out?" and I answered "They come out of their mommy's vagina." (A  friend's mom just had her 2d baby so we'd had a lot of questions about  how the baby breathes in the tummy, how it eats and pees and poops,  etc.) I would love it if every household had open and honest discussions  around sexual health, pleasure, reproductive rights, biology, etc. I  know that isn't realistic and so again, I weigh my desire for parental  oversight against the potential consequences.

             </strong>
             Here is the thing. The group of us sit here and discuss this. Were  educated women who work hard to provide good, safe, supportive, open  homes for our kids. Im a daughter, a woman, sister, friend, and also  mother of daughters. My life is filled with females of all ages. But how  typical are we? And how typical are some of our experiences, such as  Erin getting such unconditional support from her mother?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             My  mother tried to be comfortable with this conversation but she wasnt,  and as a result, I never felt comfortable talking with her. Maybe it was  a style difference, I dont know. But I am trying to do differently  with my girls. I want to talk with them, be open and honest, supportive,  while still sharing my values. Its most crucial to me to teach my  girls that they own their own bodies -- and how can I not be  contradictory and hypocritical when the government is naysaying this and  saying it owns the girls bodies?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Well,  yes, girls, you own your bodies and can say no and make your own  choices, until it comes to reproductive health care, in which case, the  government -- predominantly the very people who keep advocating for LESS  government -- think they get to choose for you and me and your doctor,  and let themselves and other health care practitioners get in between  you and the medical decision you believe is best for you all around  because of their opinions, not fact, but OPINIONS. Its maddening.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             How  can I teach my girls they get the choice of when and how and what for  their bodies when all around us is the constant message about everyone  else owns a piece of them -- from the government and reproductive care,  to commercials using female form to sell, to popular media that drills  the message that girls exist to pleasure, and on and on.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As  a parent of girls how can I not believe that the best and safest thing  is to let the individual and her unbiased doctor (who keeps her or his  moral choices in her or his own life and lets individuals guide their  lives by their own morals and ethics -- otherwise, hello, major boundary  issues) choose the best course of medical action? And thats the point,  right? Plan B keeps it from getting to a tougher place. A trickier  wicket. Plus, when it comes to so many cases, kids have to feel safe to  take care of themselves and not all do. Not all grow up in safe homes,  or homes where dealing with sexuality and bodies and self care is safe  and supported. Many girls grow up like me and need respectful support  from people who are supposed to provide it. Like pharmacists. And  doctors.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Melissa,  your point is so on point. 1 in 3 girls are molested. I think rape  stats are about the same. And that is what is based on reports. Those  who need respectful support the most -- these victims -- are the least  likely to get it. I'm also going to say I know very few women who were  happy and ready when sex began in their lives. So many had times when  they felt pressured beyond comfort and unsure of how to "be nice" like  girls are supposed to be and please the boy, like girls are supposed to,  but still care for their own needs. I really don't think we get enough  healthy sex and sexuality in the world and the last thing we need is to  create more of a culture where girls get more and more boxed in --  forced to sex, forced to parenthood. I love being a parent. I feel  blessed by my children, who are so amazing. I am glad that my life  worked that I was able to fulfill my plan of college, work, adulthood  then parenthood. Had I been unable to do that....what would my economic  and life prospects be now?

              I  dont think we came to a single conclusion as a group, but I do know many of  us tempered our initial reactions -- I know I did, feeling that my  outrage over how anti-choice politics seemed to win out over what would  otherwise be a simple recommendation from the scientific community would  now have to take into account the numerous other real-life and very  messy factors affecting this one ruling by the HHS, political and  personal. I continue to wrestle with both the emotional sides of the  argument (what good is knowing that teen pregnancy rates are down if  its *your* teen daughter who is pregnant?) and the rational sides that  say, Wait a minute, what *are* the numbers of at-risk girls specifically  who are affected by this? Should access to Plan B by very young women  set the bar in practice for all women? Is this really the case or is  this my own bogeyman Ive invented, and what are the moral implications  of protecting young women and also needing to ensure that single adult women as well as women with kids have access -- because theyre some of the people most in need  of Plan B because of their obligations to their existing children? So  here it is, behind the scenes at MOMocrats. We wrestle with tough  questions and have differences of opinion and yet are all at our core  profoundly committed to pro-choice as part of reproductive justice.  --Cyn

            <p>
             Disappointed, angry, dismayed -- these are only some of the emotions I am feeling this afternoon after hearing President Obama's poor excuse for restricting access to Plan B One Step.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am also scared.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scared about the health of my daughters. As the mother of two daughters, just like President Obama, I try to use "common sense" as much as possible. But, also like President Obama, I am not a doctor; I am not a scientist. I use my own judgment when it comes to things I am confident I can handle -- a case of the sniffles, a little cold.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, I also understand that it is my responsibility as a parent to know when I don't know all the answers and its time to turn to experts. And that, apparently, is where the President and I disagree.
            </p>
            <p>
             When my daughters pediatrician gives me medical advice, I listen. Carefully. American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society of Adolescent Health and Medicine make recommendations about my daughters' health, that matters to me. A lot. And I believe it should.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, President Obama has made the irresponsible  and nearly incomprehensible -- decision to support HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius move to block the FDA from expanding access to Plan B One-Step emergency contraception. Whether the Presidents decision was motivated by well-intentioned ignorance or political cowardice is beside the point. Either way, this move will adversely impact millions of women, particularly young women, across the country.

             I think Congresswoman Bachmann saved President Obama some legwork, don't you?

            <p>
             And something tells me she won't be on the GOP nominee's dance card to fill the seat for Vice President after pointing out all the Presidential nominee's inconsistencies like that.

             I was able to attend an event for Sharmin Bocks campaign for San Francisco District Attorney, and when I arrived on Chestnut Street on Saturday afternoon she welcomed me with open arms. We talked briefly about how things are progressing and how close the race is. Shes up on television with an ad about her experience as a prosecutor and her success rate putting criminals behind bars.

            </p>
            <p>
             The more we can tell San Francisco about Sharmin, the more people see shes the best choice.While we met, Sharmin was jumping up every few minutes to talk to voters about her experience and what she hopes to do to keep up the good work in the District Attorneys office. Supporters arrived and they talked about the importance of this race, not just locally but across the country, because strong women in office help create better public policy and ensure our values are represented.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sharmin talked about what it means for her to run for office. She said women running help set an example for her 13 year old daughter Fiona who told her that more women need to be serving in government.  I couldnt agree more!

             I originally read
             <a href="http://www.offthesidelines.org/blog/kirsten-gabby-debbie-in-friendship-we-trust" target="_blank">
              this at the great site, Off the Sidelines.
             </a>
             I appreciate an organization that encourages and supports women to becomes active in public policy and more, but more than that, I appreciate seeing examples of when Washington (that dehumanized amorpohous entity) works: because
             <em>
              people
             </em>
             work with other
             <em>
              people
             </em>
             to accomplish important acts that improve how our country functions.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             It seems as if we forget all too often that Washington, citizenry, constituencies, companies, everything...is made of people. Because I've always been people-focused and because I'm reading this mind-blowing book called
             <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Humanize-People-Centric-Organizations-Succeed-Social/dp/0789741121" target="_self">
              Humanize
             </a>
             (which is so good I actually put a review up on Amazon), it's really on my mind, and that's probably why this post so spectacularly resonated with me that I was moved to shift from reader to poster.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I see action coming from Congress that is true grassroots beneficial legislation, time and again it seems to come from
             <a href="http://gillibrand.senate.gov/" target="_self">
              Senator Kirsten Gillibrand
             </a>
             . What makes some politicians so accessible, their actions so transparent, and their efforts so targeted to what citizens want...and how, in a House (and Senate) divided, are these politicians such as Gillibrand able to consistently succeed in their efforts?
            </p>
            <p>
             Connections with people. Connections
             <em>
              to the people
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Those bonds of connection--of being people-centric (as
             <strong>
              Humanize
             </strong>
             explains it)--are crucial to actually accomplish and be productive, successful. That's because it enables the person to hear the people, talk to other people, and enlist people to help get what needs to be done, done.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gillibrand has spent her tenure (and she's one example) building connections with people in and out of Washington. In Washington, in particular, she has connected withGabby Giffords and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. This article, which I was graciously given permission to repost, showcases exactly how these bonds and connections have not just supported Giffords, Gillibrand, and Wasserman Schultz, but have encouraged and empowered them to succeed---despite tragedy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most importantly, it shows that women can work well together (despite a lot of media and culture rumors to the contrary), can encourage each other's success, and can, by connecting, accomplish what this country needs now most.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Here's the article:
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The new issue of
             <a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/family/inspirational-people/gabrielle-giffords-kirsten-gillibrand-interview">
              Good Housekeeping
             </a>
             has an inspiring article about the bond Kirsten has had with Gabby Giffords and Debbie Wasserman Schultz ever since they all served in the House together and became fast friends and a tight mutual support system.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Early in their careers, they met, bonded, and became one anothers champions, helping one another through crises ranging from minor to major to unimaginable. All young by Washington standards (Gabby is 41, Kirsten is 44, and Debbie is 45), the three represent a significant part of the roughly 20% of the Congressional voice that is femaleof 535 Senators and Representatives, only 93 are women and the average age is 53.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             As the article makes clear, their bond is unique in Washington, D.C. not just because of the dearth of women serving in the Congress, but also because of the unique way women work together.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The reasons behind the trios friendship are the reasons why women are so valuable in Congress, and the clout that they embody is changing the way business is done on Capitol Hill. They have committed not only to meaningful alliances with Republican Congresswomen, but also to a concerted effort to get more women involved in politics and elected at every level of government. [...] The women who enter the battlefield that is Capitol Hill have to be warriors, and couragemixed with a decidedly female bent toward consensusis at the heart of not only this friendship, but also a new generation of women leaders, Republican and Democratic, that is emerging across the country.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The article also explores another key part of the relationship among the women: the mentor role that Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- who had been elected to Congress in 2004 -- served for both Gabby and Kirsten as they considered their runs for Congress in 2006. For example, in 2005, as Kirsten weighed the decision to run, she, as Good Housekeeping puts it: "was able to ask [Debbie] the kinds of questions she couldn't ask a Congressman:"
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              How did you juggle a newborn, an election, your husband, and your childwith the two homes a Congress member needs to keep? [...] During these talks, Kirsten recalls, Debbie was very inspiring. She said, to both Gabby and me, Not only does your voice matter, but, as women, you can weigh in in ways that can help move an issue. Because were womenbecause were motherswe have a different perspective, a different lens. Were able to bring people together, to consensus-build. 
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And then when Kirsten and Gabby were elected and arrived in DC in January 2007, that bond only grew tighter.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There were events for the freshman Congressional class, but the two women had their own orientation with Debbie. The three of us became immediately close, Kirsten says. Were all fighters. Were all policy wonks. Were all consensus builders. They would talk about substantive issuesand make private jokes about Congress still being a Good Ol Boys Club all the time, all the time, Kirsten says...They had so much in common, but the deep trust and loyalty that blossomed among them, in a town where the term friend is thrown around lightly, felt like nothing short of a gift. As Debbie puts it, Our friendship is a refuge.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The entire article is well worth reading. It explores not only the relationship among these three extraordinary women but also their individual journeys both throughout their careers in Congress and as they've dealt with the attack on Gabby and her miraculous recovery. Through the prism of Kirsten's, Debbie's and Gabby's friendship, the article really delves into what makes women unique in public service and why we need more women to get off the sidelines. But it also highlights one of the most important aspects to what will make women successful once they do embark on that journey off the sidelines: the support, mentorship and guidance that only other women can provide.

             by white liberal columnist Gene Lyons in response to Melissa Harris-Perry's

              writing
             </a>
             for
             <em>
              The Nation
             </em>
             on racism as a factor in declining white liberal support for the President. Rather than disagreeing thoughtfully and respectfully with Harris-Perry's argument, Lyons chose not to focus on criticizing the substance of her articles but instead on attacking her as a black female intellectual.
            </p>
            <p>
             The short version: Lyons dismissedHarris-Perry as a "fool" and "
             <strong>
              a left-wing Michele Bachmann, an attractive woman seeking fame and fortune by saying silly things on cable TV
             </strong>
             ." He claimed her argument that white racism may be a factor in liberal disillusionment with POTUS is a "
             <strong>
              photonegative of KKK racial thought
             </strong>
             ," and dismissed her writings on race as
             <strong>
              "useful for intimidating tenure committees staffed by Ph.D.s trained to find racist symbols in the passing clouds
             </strong>
             ." On top of all that, Lyons mocks black experiences of racism and our right to speak out about it thus: "Furthermore, unless you're black, you can't possibly understand. Yada, yada, yada. This unfortunate obsession..."
            </p>
            <p>
             There's absolutely no question that this is an outright attack on Prof. Harris-Perry's race, gender, and professional accomplishments. Even more disturbing, it's an attack onall black people and all other people of color who dare to study or publicly raise the issue of racism on the left.

               Should we be concerned about produce that originated in a laboratory? Or the results of cross-pollination from a GMO crop into the food chain?

             Recently, I was privileged to be able to attend a part of the
             <a href="http://www.apec.org/Groups/SOM-Steering-Committee-on-Economic-and-Technical-Cooperation/Task-Groups/Policy-Partnership-on-Women-in-the-Economy/apec-wes.aspx" target="_self">
              Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Women &amp; the Economy Summit
             </a>
             in San Francisco. The conference brought together women  leaders,  government officials, diplomats, and corporate innovators to  discuss  actions to improve the lives of women in the Asia-Pacific  region, and  by doing so, the world's economy. Recognizing that women are  a vast,  largely untapped resource for change and growth, the group  spent a week  in San Francisco working on plans for change. This was one  of several  meetings around the Pacific Rim leading up to the APEC  Summit in  Hawaii in November that President Obama will attend.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Conference Keynote was delivered by US Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton. Secretary Clinton has inspired a generation of women to enter  political life to try to dismantle the political barriers that keep  women from fully participating in economic growth. Her speech was a call to action, for all nations to tap the power,  creativity, and drive of women to help elevate all people, across all  regions.

             Although characterized by some in the media as a "call for equal  rights," Clinton's vision was much broader than that. In her speech,  she stated,
            </p>
            <blockquote>

               Now  there will be a temptation on the part of those observing or  covering  this summit, perhaps on the part of those of us attending it as  well,  to say that our purpose is chiefly to advance the rights of  women, to  achieve justice and equality on womens behalf. And that is,  of course,  a noble cause to be sure and one that is very close to my  heart. But  at the risk of being somewhat provocative at the outset, I  believe our  goal is even bolder, one that extends beyond women to all  humankind.  The big challenge we face in these early years of 21

               century is how to grow our economies and ensure shared prosperity for   all nations and all people. We want to give every one of our citizens,   men and women alike, young and old alike, greater opportunity to find   work, to save and spend money, to pursue happiness ultimately to live up   to their own God-given potentials.
              </em>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Secretary Clinton went on to give specific examples and data illustrating the issues that Summit attendees  hoped to offer specific, concrete actions to resolve. She went on to note that her husband is fond of saying that "we don't have a person to waste" in this effort, and she added, "We certainly don't have a gender to waste."

             The Plenary Session was called "Women at the Top: How Diverse  Leadership Benefits Everyone." It featured a candid discussion among these high-powered  women of issues surrounding workplace diversity, being a woman leader in  male-dominated industries, and work-life balance for women. The panel enthusiastically endorsed nurturing a work-life balance to promote creativity and productivity in the workplace. Romi Haan noted that she didn't want workers who were just successful on the job, but "successful in life" as well. On  the need for work-life balance and the issue of childrearing, Blanca  Trevino commented, "Someone can always fill in for you at a meeting, but  no other mom can fill in for you to help your daughter get ready for  her first date."
            </p>
            <p>
             Cherie Blair's foundation is leading the way  in impoverished nations in encouraging women-owned businesses and  entrepreneurship. Their approach is to offer women in developing  nations the tools needed to start and maintain their own businesses  through "confidence, capacity and capital". One of the innovations her  foundation has initiated is a Skype-based mentoring program for women in  developing nations to be paired with successful women around the globe,  so they are not limited to the resources available locally.
            </p>
            <p>
             The week-long Summit featured a number of other plenary sessions and workshops with equally impressive leaders in discussions on how to solve some of the most pressing problems and opportunities of our time. The message of the Summit was that in a time of global economic crisis and concern, women may be the key to unlocking a new era of prosperity. The underlying message was "when women are successful, the world benefits."

             When women sit at the table, the conversation includes topics that are near and dear to us: Education. Healthcare. Eldercare. Living Wages. Work-Life Balance. Reproductive Rights.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it's a shame that so few women have seats in our nation's legislatures: According to the

             , we'reranked 87th in the world for the number of women in our national legislature. Even Cuba and Afghanistan have more female representation than us!

              She Should Run Inaugural National Conversation
             </a>
             , a conference designed to address the "urgent need for women to advance in leadership across all sectors." We'll be hearing more about that on tomorrow's edition of MOMocrats MOMochat, when our special guest is Women's Campaign Forum President Siobhan "Sam" Bennett.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bennett has served as the President and CEO of the Womens Campaign Fund (WCF) and its affiliated programs The She Should Run Foundation and WCF PAC since March 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sam has lent her unique perspective as a candidate at the local and federal levels to broaden WCFs impact on women leaders at all levels of government who support reproductive choices and options, and women who may run for office in the future.
