   The
Iceni were
a Celtic tribe living in Norfolk and Suffolk in eastern Britain. Due to
flourishing trade across the English Channel with the Roman empire,
their
merchants and rulers prospered, issuing their own coinage between about
65
BC and AD 61. Near the end of this period, following the Roman invasion
of
Britain under Claudius in AD 43, king Prasutagus (AD 50-60)
became
a rich and powerful client of the Romans. After his death, however, the
Roman
administrators in Britain made the Iceni a subject population.

   Boudicca, widow of Prasutagus, now became queen of the Iceni. After she
and
her two daughters were subjected to grave humiliations by the Romans,
she
led a revolt of the Iceni and several other tribes which lasted for
several
months in 60-61. The Boudiccan forces burned and destoyed the three
major
towns of Londinium (London), Verulamium (St. Albans), and Camulodunum
(Colchester), killing many thousands of citizens.

   The revolt was eventually suppressed in AD 61 by the Roman military
governor,
Suetonius Paullinus. The story is told in the
   <i>
    Annals
   </i>
   of
Tacitus,
written about AD 110-120. Tacitus had a special interest in Britain
because
his father-in-law, Agricola, became governor of the Provincein AD
77-85
after a successful military campaigninWales and the north.
This campaign, together with some details on the native Celtic
tribes,
is described in the book
   <i>
    Agricola
   </i>
   by Tacitus, written in AD 98.

   The silver Iceni coin shown above was buried in a hoard along with
hundreds
of similar coins during the Boudiccan revolt. These were minted in
great
quantitiesin order to finance the rebellion. After their defeat
in
AD 61, the Iceni were resettled in a civitas capital at
Caistor-by-Norwich
(also called Caistor St.Edmunds), located along the River Tas.
The
site may be visited today, along with related exhibits at the Norwich
Museum.
