       One of The Entertainment Capitals of the  World has a rich history that dates back to the beginning of the 20th  century. This young city of Nevada Sin City has a past and culture so  entertaining and fascinating that it will capture your imagination and drag you  into another world, where everything that happens stays to enrich the existing  and breed new stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  city of Las Vegas began like many of the other western cities in the late 1800's  and early 1900's. The area was filled with small hotels and business that were  strategically located to serve the needs of migrators who were moving west  during the California Gold Rush and development of the railroad system. In the  early 1930's, the face of Las Vegas, Nevada was set on a historic course.

     </header>
     <p>
      In mid-1930,  President Herbert Hoover approved legislation that would fund the building of  what is known today as
      <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/hoover-dam" target="_blank" title="Hoover Dam Facts">
       Hoover Dam
      </a>
      . With the Great Depreciation having devastated  the job markets and economy throughout the country, thousands of migrant  workers headed to the Las Vegas area to land one of the proposed 5,000 jobs  available working on the dam project. As the area's population swelled to  25,000 people, mostly males, Las Vegas business owners, Mormon investors and  mob bosses in the area sought ways to keep these men entertained. In 1931 with  influence from these groups, the Nevada legislature legalized gambling and  showgirl entertainment in several areas of Nevada, including Las Vegas.

       The Beginning
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      The  first casino to receive a gambling license was the Northern Club that was  located in what is now the downtown area. Along a gravel road named Fremont  Street, several other casinos quickly joined the fray. They included the Las  Vegas Club and the Apache Hotel. In order to accommodate the traffic, Fremont  Street became the first paved road in a city that was poised to explode in  growth. Hoover Dam was completed in 1935, and by 1937, it was ready to begin  supplying power to local cities like Vegas. With the addition of free-flowing  electricity,

      owners propped up big signs and the bright lights of Las  Vegas began to burn.

       The Las Vegas Strip
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      In 1941, the  first resort hotel to be opened on what would become the famous "Las Vegas  Strip" was the El Rancho Vegas. The hotel was owned by Thomas Hull and is  credited for establishing the very first buffet in town. It wasn't long before  the El Rancho had a companion on the lonely strip when the Last Frontier popped  up in 1942. As gambling operations continued to expand all over the area,  organized crime took note and made its move on the city. Since hotel and land  owners of the era were unwilling to sell to mafia figures, leading gangsters  like Bugsy Siegal and Meyer Lansky went through Mormon owned banks under  legitimate corporate names to purchase land in the city. In 1946, Siegal's  dream of building the ultimate Vegas resort became a reality with the opening  of the
      <a href="http://www.flamingolasvegas.com/" target="_blank" title="Flamingo Hotel &amp; Casino">
       Flamingo
      </a>
      . Because of budget overruns and casino losses, Siegal lost his  life the mafia way, in a hail of bullets. Soon to follow were other mafia owned  casinos such as the Sands,
      <a href="http://www.troplv.com/" target="_blank" title="Tropicana Casino Hotel Resort">
       The Tropicana
      </a>
      and the Sahara. At a time when  segregation and civil rights were becoming big social issues throughout the  country, Jewish gangsters defied other hotels by building the Moulin Rouge,  which became the first integrated hotel in the city. When entertainers like  Frank Sinatra used their considerable drawing power to force hotels to allow  access to blacks, segregation ended in Las Vegas long before any civil rights  laws were to be enacted. Of course, things were not always rosy in Vegas.  Despite the fact that state legislatures were trying to combat organized  crime's influence on the city, the city and state were flourishing and bribe money  kept lawmakers in check and gangsters ruled the city.

       A Facelift for the City
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      By  the mid-1950's, Las Vegas had become the adult entertainment of the world. Aside  from the gambling, the city was now featuring 5-star restaurants and top  entertainers like Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Elvis Presley. It was a  formula that was bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars and dumping it  right into the pockets of America's most famous criminals. As the city's people  and legislature became increasing uneasy with the involvement of the mafia, a  new breed of investor, Howard Hughes, moved into the city. He set up shop at  the Desert Inn in 1966. When hotels owners tried to get him to vacate his hotel  room, which Hughes had commandeered, the social recluse solved the problem and  bought the hotel. With considerable resources earned from his aviation business  endeavours, Hughes began buying up as much property in the area as he could get  his hands on. As his power base grew, keeping Hughes happy began to take  precedent over keeping organized crime happy for city officials. Sensing its  run in Vegas was nearing an end, mafia hotel owners gave way and began selling  their properties to Hughes and other legitimate business interest. With  organized crime's influence in the city diminished, a new day was dawning for  Las Vegas.

       The 1970's
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      There were two  major changes that occurred in Las Vegas during the 1970's. With the opening of  the Circus Circus Hotel in 1968, the city began a push to offer more forms of  family entertainment. As the city became a safer environment for kids with the  vanishing of mafia owned properties, casino owners began to realize the time  was right to start courting a new kind of customer, the family. The
      <a href="http://www.circuscircus.com/" target="_blank" title="Circus Circus Las Vegas">
       Circus Circus
      </a>
      offered circus acts, carnival games, an arcade and a buffet just for  kids, and parents were now able to bring their kids with them on their weekend  junkets. It wasn't long before other casinos were adding arcades and a variety  of attractions to keep kids entertained while their folks stayed in the casino.
     </p>
     <p>
      Something else was taking hold in the city. It  was during this time that the city began to experience population growth  unrelated to the casino industry. With a new University and major businesses  sprouting up all over the city, Vegas was becoming more that a place to  vacation and gamble, it was becoming a legitimate place to live. The soaring  prices throughout California sent thousands of residents to Nevada. Tract home  sites, strip malls and major shopping centres popped up all over the Las Vegas  Valley. While the casino industry maintained its position as the leading  employer for the city, Las Vegas became a legitimate place to live if an  individual could handle the desert heat.

       The Quiet 1980's
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      The  1980's could be characterized as a period of quiet growth. The casinos  maintained the status quo as people continued their migration into the city. In  1981, one of the worse disasters in Nevada history struck when some of the  upper floors of the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino caught fire. Eighty-five people  were killed and another 750+ were injured. In the mid-1980's, The Frontier  Hotel's food concession labour group went on strike. The strike lasted more  than five years before the hotel was finally sold and issues were resolved.  While these were the most important stories during the 1980's, there were new  plans in the works that would again change the face of the city.

      in 1990, Las Vegas began the process of changing  its culture yet again. These new Mega-resorts had elite shopping malls, giant  casinos, Broadway-style productions replacing headliners, and dozens of  restaurants along with thousands of elegant rooms. In 1993,

      and Luxor brought more of these huge theme-based resorts to  the strip. By the end of 1999, there were 12 mega-resorts located on the strip.  With everything a customer could want located under one roof, smaller casinos  along the strip and downtown began to close due to the competition. One after  one, older casinos were imploded and beautiful billion dollar properties began  springing up. Water parks and amusement parks were added for the kids and Las  Vegas began its transformation into the ultimate family vacation destination.  This trend continued into the mid-2000s with the addition of

       New Challenges for the Gambling Capital of the World
      </h2>
     </header>
     <p>
      As the 2000's  evolved, Las Vegas was faced with a variety of new challenges. Huge gaming  destinations started sprouting up in other parts of the world such as Singapore  and Macau, which has overtaken Las Vegas for annual revenues. Most states began  offering some form of casino gambling that challenged the local base of  customers who used to flock to Vegas. Also, the proliferation of

      gambling allowed gamblers from all over the world to sit at home and play their

       favourite games
      </a>
      without a plane ticket or room reservation. All that said, the worst  was yet to come. As casinos owners were figuring out how to continue competing  on the new world market, one of the worse worldwide recessions in history dealt  Vegas a huge blow. Several

      </a>
      that were under construction sat dormant  and massive layoffs forced employees to consider other options, including  moving away from the city. The city went dry, but this is Las Vegas, the city  with a history too rich to deny.
     </p>
     <p>
      In recent years,  the downtown properties have been given a facelift to the delight of the old  school players. Dormant constructions sites are re-awaking and people are  moving back to the city. The reality is that Las Vegas was built to endure, and  endure it has. The city has survived the desert, gangsters, fires, strikes and  numerous facelifts. If someone is looking for a sure bet, the surest bet in the  world is that Las Vegas will always stand proud as America's beacon in the  desert.
