        It is probably fair to say that Muhammad did not 
approve of the intentional killing of children. A verse from the Quran laments 
the pre-Islamic Arab practice of infanticide against baby girls. Other evidence 
from the Hadith suggests that he instructed his men not to kill children in 
battle, if it could be avoided, but to capture them for slavery.

        Children were 
often given a specific reprieve from the mandate to "kill those who disbelieve 
in Allah":
        <br/>
        <blockquote>
         [Muhammad said]
         <i>
          Fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who 
disbelieve in Allah. Do not be deceitful with the spoils; do not be treacherous, 
nor mutilate nor kill children.
         </i>
         (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 992)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         But Muhammads definition of a child was not the same as our modern 
understanding. Following the surrender of the
         <a href="myths-mu-qurayza.htm">
          Qurayza
         </a>
         stronghold, he ordered the 
execution of
         <i>
          every
         </i>
         male child who had reached puberty. His men had the boys drop 
their pants so that they could chop the head off of anyone with pubic hair (Abu 
Dawud
         <a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/038-sat.php#038.4390">
          4390
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         Keep in mind that many Muslims often insist that Aisha reached puberty at age 
nine, since that is the age that Muhammad
         <a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3309">
          began
         </a>
         having sex with her. If so, then 
the age for manhood among boys might have been considered around twelve.
        </p>
        <p>
         Muhammad also played a bit loose with the lives of women and children during 
wartime. As recorded in both Bukhari and Sahih Muslim:
         <br/>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <i>
          It is reported on the authority of Sa'b b. Jaththama that the Prophet of Allah 
(may peace be upon him), when asked about the women and children of the 
polytheists being killed during the night raid, said: 
          <b>
           They are from them.
          </b>
          
         </i>
         (Sahih 
Muslim
         <a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/019-smt.php#019.4322">
          4322
         </a>
         , 
	see also Bukhari

         </a>
         )
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         This does not justify the
         <i>
          targeted
         </i>
         killing of women and children per 
se, but it does prove that collateral damage is entirely acceptable if it 
accomplishes the military goal of spreading Islamic rule.
        </p>
        <p>
         Muhammad used a catapult against he city of Taif, which kills 
		indiscriminately. The only crime the citizens were guilty of was 
		evicting him are rejecting his claims of being a prophet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Muhammad drew a distinction between Muslim and non-Muslim children 
and implied that it would be permissible to kill a child who has no prospect of accepting 
Islam:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <i>
          The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used not to kill the children, so 
thou shouldst not kill them
          <b>
           unless
          </b>
          you could know what Khadir had known about 
the child he killed, or
          <b>
           you could distinguish between a child who would grow up 
to he a believer (and a child who would grow up to be a non-believer), so that 
you killed the (prospective) non-believer and left the (prospective) believer 
aside.
          </b>
         </i>
         (Sahih Muslim
         <a href="http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/019-smt.php#019.4457">
          4457
         </a>
         )
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         After capturing Mecca, the prophet of Islam also ordered the execution of two 
singing girls who had mocked him in verse:
        </p>
       </font>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <i>
        two singing-girls Fartana and her friend who used to sing satirical songs 
about the apostle, so
        <b>
         he ordered that they should be killed
        </b>
        
       </i>
       (Ibn 
	Ishaq/Hisham 
819)
