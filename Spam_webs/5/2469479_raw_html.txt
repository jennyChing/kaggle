      No Apparent Reason is bound to be a common phrase muttered by those reviewing their search engine rankings this sad time during October 2014, a month full of demise for those aiming to game the Google ranking system. Similarly, and most painfully saddening, for those who arent
     </p>
     <p>
      In the context of Google results pages, it may mean that there really doesnt seem to be a valid reason for events of such a negative nature. (Valid in the sense of; not humanly possible to determine without an algorithmic formulation the size of Einsteins.blackboard).
     </p>
     <p>
      It may mean there is a very valid and tangible reason, but traditional marketers and employees who lack advanced knowledge of the web and digital tools simply cant put their finger on it. Heck, even SEOs and online specialists get stumped by these happenings. And thats WITH the knowledge.

      Why have I lost my Google rankings?

     <p>
      The chances are, you have been hit with a manual Google penalty (not a football, a punishment) OR the latest algorithm updates have negatively impacted you because:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       You have close to zero content on your website, or lots and lots of shoddy content which doesnt help anyone
      </li>
      <li>
       You have tons of duplicated content, or you are scraping someone elses
      </li>
      <li>
       You have bought links in the past
      </li>
      <li>
       You are attempting to manipulate search engines in some form or another
      </li>

       You have many dodgy

      <strong class="dark-red">
       To bring your website back from the dead, the main tools to use are:
      </strong>
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Google search (waheyyy)
      </li>
      <li>
       Google Analytics
      </li>
      <li>
       Google Webmaster Tools

      </li>
      <li>
       Ahrefs
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Id highly recommend that you allow sufficient time to check your rank monitoring software each week. (If you havent attained access to any ranking tools at present, Id recommend purchasing
      <a href="http://authoritylabs.com/" target="_blank">
       Authority Labs
      </a>
      or
      <a href="http://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank">
       SEMRush
      </a>
       these will help you to review progress during the recovery process.)
     </p>
     <p>
      There are also plenty more useful tools to come:
     </p>
     <p>
      Initially, the primary point of call is the
      <a href="http://moz.com/google-algorithm-change" target="_blank">
       Moz Google Algorithm History
      </a>
      . From this handy content chart, you can cross-match the points where you lost search traffic (Google Analytics &gt;&gt; Channels &gt;&gt; Organic) with the times of deployment of new algorithms. Clever, huh?
     </p>
     <p>
      Id also recommend taking the following actions to future-proof your website and keep in-the-know

     <p>
      You probably dont need to know every single Google update in history. But do keep these two animals in mind: Panda and Penguin.
     </p>
     <p>
      If youve been hit by the Panda Update, the chances are you have annoyed Google with thin content, duplicated pages or by giving your affiliates the same product descriptions as on your website. Yes, that would be a massive
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dO37Ql91qqM" target="_blank">
       Homer DOH!
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      If the almighty Penguin Update has caught you out, you may have annoyed Google with spammy links (inbound as well as outbound), paid links or a spammy anchor text profile filled with exact-match anchor text.
     </p>
     <p>
      i.e. You sell yellow shoes. 95% of your links point to you with the text yellow shoes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hmmmm. Slightly suspect! Off to the crematorium you go.

     <h3 class="gypsy">
      Initial checks
     </h3>
     <p class="subtitle">
      1. Domain search
     </p>
     <p>
      Head on down to your favourite page in the world:
      <a href="http:www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">
       www.google.co.uk
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Type
      <strong>
       site:yourdomainhere.co.uk
      </strong>
      into the search box
     </p>
     <p>
      Do any results appear? Are just a portion of your pages appearing? If the answer to the first is no, this really isnt good. Your domain has been completely de-indexed from Google. If the answer to the second question is yes, not so bad news. But still pretty bad.
     </p>
     <div class="image-border">
      <img alt="Google domain search" src="img/google-domain-search.jpg"/>
     </div>
     <p>
      If the above returns no issues, you can also try searching for your brand name in Google. If nothing appears, this is another tell-tale sign of a hit.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can also check Webmaster Tools: Left hand navigation &gt;&gt; Google Index &gt;&gt; Index Status which gives an indication of how many pages were previously indexed in comparison to recent times.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p class="subtitle">
      2. Duplicate content discovery
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong class="dark-red">
       Content within a page
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      To perform a duplicate content check for on-page wording, copy a paragraph of text directly from a few pages of your site and paste into Google. Id try at least 15 paragraphs from varying pages to be ber sure.
     </p>
     <p>
      If multiple results from your own site or other sites appear with the same or very similar text, you may well be in the scope of Googles algorithm gun if you havent been hit by Panda already.
     </p>
     <div class="image-border">
      <img alt="Google result page" src="img/google-results.jpg"/>
     </div>
     <p>
      A secondary tool to use for identifying duplicated content across Google and Yahoo is
      <a href="http://www.copyscape.com/" target="_blank">
       Copyscape.
      </a>
      Simply pop in your URL and hit Go!
     </p>
     <p>
      Of course, if you have been removed from Googles search engine index, results wont show regardless. So in this instance, the only way to determine duplicate content is manually. (I can hear the sighs).
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have been the victim of content scraping, you can
      <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/93713?hl=en" target="_blank">
       inform Google here.
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong class="dark-red">
       Page meta titles and descriptions
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      For an extremely quick retrieval of all your meta descriptions, my favourite no-frills tool of the day is
      <a href="http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html" target="_blank">
       Xenus Link Sleuth.
      </a>
      Whats more, the brand logo is perfect for the occasion!
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Xenu Link Sleuth logo" class="border" src="img/xenu-logo.jpg"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Once you slap your domain URL into this bad boy, you can sort the results by title and description, which makes it easy to immediately spot any duplicated content.
     </p>
     <p>
      Theres a whole wealth of information that can be gained from Link Sleuth including size of page, server responses and subfolder levels. I wont go into detail here, but State of Digital have
      <a href="http://www.stateofdigital.com/how-to-use-xenu-for-the-basis-of-a-seo-campaign/" target="_blank">
       a really handy guide for quick SEO checks.
      </a>
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle">
      3. User-friendly content
     </p>
     <p>
      Next, a more qualitative study to determine if your content provides value to the visitor. Read through your pages. Put your pride aside. Does the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UpHIL6XOT4" target="_blank">
       tone bore you
      </a>
      ? Would you get excited about these pages? If not, then changes need to happen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heres a perfect example of a website asking for a penalty:
     </p>
     <div class="image-border">
      <img alt="Example of a website asing for a penalty" src="img/hire-best-seo.jpg"/>
     </div>
     <p>
      I really dont need to comment any further!
     </p>
     <p>
      To gain a better understanding of how your content is interpreted, reach out to others and request reviews. Does everything on your website make sense? Is everything easy to find? Are your visitors interested in staying on the juicy pages for more than a minute? Attention span is everything.
     </p>
     <p>
      Useful on-site survey tools such as
      <a href="https://qualaroo.com/" target="_blank">
       Qualaroo
      </a>
      (paid) and
      <a href="http://www.sogosurvey.com/" target="_blank">
       SoGoSurvey
      </a>
      (free) are imperative tools for metrics of this nature.
     </p>
     <p>
      Your bounce rate calculations in Google Analytics will only aid this process. Analyse the most important pages with a high bounce first. (Bear in mind the type of content on these pages. A bounce is calculated by an exit without any physical interaction  which could mean the visitor had a fun time reading every word on the page, concluded what they searched for, then left.
     </p>
     <p>
      To aid this process, you can implement some cool heat mapping software on your pages using tools like
      <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/" target="_blank">
       Crazy Egg.
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to gain a real picture of the success of your content serving, piece the jigsaw together using a combination of methods and a dash of common sense. No single tool will tell you everything.
     </p>
     <p class="subtitle">
      4. Spammy links
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong class="dark-red">
       Using Webmaster Tools
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Thats content basics out of the way. Now to discover any culprit links.
     </p>
     <p>
      Open up Google Webmaster Tools and use the left-hand navigation to find Search Traffic &gt;&gt; Links To Your Site.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can see anything of mass proportion from here. If there are domains with site-wide links pointing to your site, it will be evident under Who links the most.
     </p>
     <div class="image-border">
      <img alt="Google webmaster tools screenshot" src="img/webmaster-tools-links.jpg"/>
     </div>
     <p>
      So, if you have 51,000 links from domain.com, you will most certainly be better off rectifying this issue as soon as possible by contacting their webmaster!
      <a href="http://www.buzzstream.com/" target="_blank">
       Buzzstream
      </a>
      is an ideal tool for finding contact information. It works by crawling and locating such details from each domain, so you dont have to!
     </p>
     <p>
      Failing that, if no response is received after extensive exploration, use the
      <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/disavow-links-main?pli=1" target="_blank">
       Google disavow tool
      </a>
      to render these links unassociated. (You can find out exactly how to follow this process with this
      <a href="http://midasmedia.co.uk/definitive-guide-google-manual-link-penalty-removal/" target="_blank">
       Google Penguin Penalty Recovery Guide
      </a>
      )
     </p>
     <p>
      Another spot check: your impressions for queries in Google. Navigate to Search Queries &gt;&gt; Search Traffic and take a peek at the graph. Are you seeing a big drop? Is that blue line steeply falling into the pits of hell? If so, your visibility in Google has dramatically decreased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong class="dark-red">
       Bonus Webmaster Tools check
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      While youre in Webmaster tools, it is a good idea to do a spring clean on any 404 errors to maximise your inbound link juice. Otherwise it will all be going to waste. This will only be of benefit after bad links are cleaned up (either
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nofollow" target="_blank">
       nofollowed
      </a>
      or removed).
     </p>
     <p>
      Navigate to Crawl &gt;&gt;  Crawl Errors and view the tabs. You will usually see the tabbed selection as below:
     </p>
     <div class="image-border">
      <img alt="URL errors" src="img/url-errors.jpg"/>
     </div>
     <p>
      Click each tab to uncover your problem URLs.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have a few mild server error spikes showing timeout, this is usually nothing to worry over. However, frequent spikes will warrant an email to your host to gauge any underlying issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Soft 404 and Not found tabs are juicy sections. If you see a large number as above, get clicking on that tab!

      If the links are showing from your own domain, they are internal. It will be beneficial to change the actual broken link on the containing page rather than do a bone idle redirect.
     </p>
     <p>
      If they are from external domains, congratulations! You can now claw back some link juice (providing they are from worthy domains  do check).
     </p>
     <p>
      301 redirect these links from trusted URLs to a relevant, alternative piece of content on your website which relates to the original (or as closely matched as possible).
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternatively, create a whole new page focused around this subject matter. Id especially recommend this if the source link is highly reputable.

      You can achieve a more granular view of each individual link by visiting the Links section:

       Use Social Bookmarking websites Reddit*, Digg and StumbledUpon for out there content which is certain to receive interest. If you can make it big on these, you will receive instant spikes in traffic. Although this is not always the easiest method, it pays

       Use Twitter for outreach. Use Facebook for competitions. Use Google+ for emotion-provoking posts. Use LinkedIn for growing your network and personal kudos

     <p>
      Okay, your website has lost its rankings. You arent going to gain as many eyeballs on your stuff for the time being, but you CAN make the most of the eyeballs of those you already know.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seems simple enough, but this is all too often an area which is missed by marketers. Instead of focusing on new custom, reach out to those existing!
     </p>
     <p>
      Your brand will have connections to other brands. Your company will have current customers or bloggers. Your employees will have relationships spanning further than the office. Maximise this potential and delve into opportunities for joint promotion, content marketing and yesSocial Media cross-promotion!
     </p>
     <ul class="clear">
      <li>
       Make use of the authority of referrers. Their traffic is your traffic
      </li>
      <li>
       You scratch my back... is the theme here. What mutual benefit is there of cross-promotion? Outline these benefits and feed them
      </li>
      <li>
       Pick up the dog and bone. This is the bread and butter of healthy relationships and will forge a lasting impression. Not only will the recipient of the call feel special, they will be willing to help you out more often than not

     <p>
      Particularly lucrative for B2C ecommerce websites, affiliate programs can assist your online marketing with great effect. You only pay affiliates when they make a sale of your product. They dont even need to physically hold your stock! A tracking cookie is placed on each product link on their website. When the sites visitors click the products to buy, they are redirected to your product page. Purchases are made, you earn money, they earn a percentage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whats more, the potential for exposure is boundless. Thousands of your products on hundreds of websites which rank..? Bonus.

      4. Launch a pay-per-click campaign
     </h3>
     <img alt="" class="center floatleft" src="img/pay-per-click.png"/>
     <p>
      Yes, this will initially cost you money. But if done right, you will earn everything back and more. Optimised PPC accounts can bring respite to difficult periods of low revenue as a result of lost organic visibility. Serving secondly as a short-term boost for your exposure, PPC is undoubtedly a quick win (however much we hate ploughing more money in Googles direction).
     </p>
     <ul class="clear">
      <li>
       Analyse areas of your website which are most profitable BUT have lost most organic traction. Pump PPC spend into these pages
      </li>
      <li>
       Remember, a visitor attained through PPC is not always going to be seeking the same call-to-actions which an organic visitor seeks. Consider page redesigns or new landing pages created solely for paid traffic
      </li>
      <li>
       If you have a blog (which you certainly should), point some spend towards this. Focus on big, attractive social share buttons on each post and aim to provide the visitor with some key insider knowledge and information which is hard to find anywhere else. This is your chance to show authoritative value, brand distinctiveness and knowledge - which eventually leads to sales.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <h3>
      5. Delve into email marketing for high ROI
     </h3>
     <p>
      Get your messages out there with a well-planned email drip-feed. Nurture existing databases and attract new custom by exporting your LinkedIn contacts. Use the CSV file to send your campaign to each contactclever, huh?
     </p>
     <p>
      P.s. If youre not on LinkedIn, refer to point 1! Consider a Premium account to enable you to perform deep-dive searches and discover potential leads and customers.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       Sort your campaign audience into groups and tailor your emails to suit each segment
      </li>
      <li>
       Use clear, concise call-to-actions and a smart subject line
      </li>
      <li>
       Hire a reputable email marketing platform provider. You should know your open and click-through rates in order to review and refine
