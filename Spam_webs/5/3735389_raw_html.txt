    I believe in high-intensity aerobics. In
    <em>
     <strong>
      Ripped 3
     </strong>
    </em>
    ,
for bodybuilders, I recommended "a variety of relatively
short and infrequent aerobic sessions interspersed with explosive
muscular effort." In
    <em>
     <strong>
      Lean For Life
     </strong>
    </em>
    ,
published six years later, I emphasized high-intensity aerobics
even more
    <strong>
     ;
    </strong>
    I reduced the frequency of aerobic
sessions to two times a week (in
    <em>
     <strong>
      Ripped 3
     </strong>
    </em>
    I recommended up to four) and substantially increased the
intensity. But it wasn't until recently, when my friend Richard
Winett, Ph.D., publisher of
    <em>
     <strong>
      Master Trainer
     </strong>
    </em>
    ,
called my attention to new research findings, that I came to
fully appreciate the superiority of high intensity aerobics
compared to the usual prescription that heart rate be maintained
between 60% and 80% of maximum.
   </p>
   <p>
    As explained in the nearby
    <strong>
     FAQ
    </strong>
    (Low intensity
aerobics?), high intensity aerobics burns the same amount of fat
as low intensity, but the expenditure of calories is
substantially greater
    <strong>
     ;
    </strong>
    plus, intense aerobics
produces a higher level of fitness. Importantly, the more fit you
become, the more likely you are to use fat as fuel for any given
activity. And now, research in Japan and in Canada shows that
short, very intense aerobic sessions are amazingly effective for
both fitness and fat loss.

    Maximal oxygen uptake, or V0
    <font size="2">
     2
    </font>
    <font size="3">
     max, is generally regarded as the best single measure of
aerobic fitness. As the rate of exercise increases, your body
eventually reaches a limit for oxygen consumption. This limit is
the peak of your aerobic capacity, or your V0
    </font>
    <font size="2">
     2
    </font>
    <font size="3">
     max. As intensity increases
beyond V0
    </font>
    <font size="2">
     2
    </font>
    <font size="3">
     max, your
body must shift to anaerobic (without oxygen) energy production.
An oxygen debt begins to build at this point and blood lactate
levels climb. In general terms, one's ability to continue
exercising in the face of rising oxygen deficit and lactate
levels is called anaerobic capacity.
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font size="3">
     This is important because many high-intensity
sports (including basketball, football, soccer and speed skating)
require a high level of both aerobic and anaerobic fitness.
Clearly, total fitness involves both high V0

used by major members of the Japanese Speed Skating team for
several years

training programs for its intensity and brevity.

    <font size="3">
     A second group followed a high-intensity
interval program. Seven students, also young and physically
active, exercised five days per week using a training program
similar to the Japanese speed skaters. After a 10-minute warm-up,
the subjects did seven to eight sets of 20 seconds at 170% of V0

terminated when rpms dropped below 85. When subjects could
complete more than 9 sets, exercise intensity was increased by 11
watts. The training protocol was altered one day per week. On
that day, the students exercised for 30 minutes at 70% of V0

     <strong>

     Dr. Tabata and his colleagues believe this is
the first study to demonstrate an increase in both aerobic and
anaerobic power. What's more, in an e-mail response to Dick
Winett, Dr. Tabata said, "The fact is that the rate of
increase in V0
    </font>
    <font size="2">
     2
    </font>
    <font size="3">

[14% for the high-intensity protocol - in only 6 weeks] is one of
the highest ever reported in exercise science." (Note, the
students participating in this study were members of varsity
table tennis, baseball, basketball, soccer and swimming teams and
already had relatively high aerobic capacities.)
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font size="3">
     The results, of course, confirm the well-known
fact that the results of training are specific. The intensity in
the first protocol (70% of V0
    </font>
    <font size="2">
     2
    </font>
    <font size="3">
     max) did not stress anaerobic components (lactate
production and oxygen debt) and, therefore, it was predictable
that anaerobic capacity would be unchanged. On the other hand,
the subjects in the high-intensity group exercised to exhaustion, and peak blood lactate levels indicated that anaerobic
metabolism was being taxed to the max. So, it was probably also
no big surprise that anaerobic capacity increased quite
significantly.
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    <font size="3">
     What probably was a surprise, however, is that
a 4 minute training program of very-hard 20 second repeats, in
the words of the researchers, "may be optimal with respect
to improving both the aerobic and the anaerobic energy release
systems." That's something to write home about!

      <u>
       What About Fat Loss?
      </u>
     </strong>
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    Angelo Tremblay, Ph.D., and his colleagues at the Physical
Activities Sciences Laboratory, Laval University, Quebec, Canada,
challenged the common belief among health professionals that
low-intensity, long-duration exercise is the best program for fat
loss. They compared the impact of moderate-intensity aerobic
exercise and high-intensity aerobics on fat loss. (
    <em>
     <strong>
      Metabolism
     </strong>
    </em>
    (1994) Volume 43, pp.814-818)
   </p>
   <p>
    The Canadian scientists divided 27 inactive, healthy,
non-obese adults (13 men, 14 women, 18 to 32 years old) into two
groups. They subjected one group to a 20-week endurance training
(ET) program of uninterrupted cycling 4 or 5 times a week for 30
to 45 minutes
    <strong>
     ;
    </strong>
    the intensity level began at 60%
of heart rate reserve and progressed to 85%. (For a 30-year-old,
this would mean starting at a heart rate of about 136 and
progressing to roughly 170 bpm, which is more intense than
usually prescribed for weight or fat loss.)
   </p>
   <p>
    The other group did a 15-week program including mainly
high-intensity-interval training (HIIT). Much like the ET group,
they began with 30-minute sessions of continuous exercise at 70%
of maximum heart rate reserve (remember, they were not accustomed
to exercise), but soon progressed to 10 to 15 bouts of short (15
seconds progressing to 30 seconds) or 4 to 5 long (60 seconds
progressing to 90 seconds) intervals separated by recovery
periods allowing heart rate to return to 120-130 beats per
minute. The intensity of the short intervals was initially fixed
at 60% of the maximal work output in 10 seconds, and that of the
long bouts corresponded to 70% of the individual maximum work
output in 90 seconds. Intensity on both was increased 5% every
three weeks.
   </p>
   <p>
    As you might expect, the total energy cost of the ET program
was substantially greater than the HIIT program. The researchers
calculated that the ET group burned more than twice as many
calories while exercising than the HIIT program. But (surprise,
surprise) skinfold measurements showed that the HIIT group lost
more subcutaneous fat. "Moreover," reported the
researchers, "when the difference in the total energy cost
of the program was taken into account..., the subcutaneous fat
loss was
    <strong>
     ninefold greater
    </strong>
    in the HIIT program
than in the ET program." In short, the HIIT group got 9
times more fat-loss benefit for every calorie burned exercising.
   </p>
   <p>
    How can that be?
   </p>
   <p>
    Dr. Tremblay's group took muscle biopsies and measured muscle
enzyme activity to determine why high-intensity exercise produced
so much more fat loss. I'll spare you the details (they are
technical and hard to decipher), but this is their bottom line
    <strong>
     :
    </strong>
    "[Metabolic adaptations resulting from HIIT] may lead to a
better lipid utilization in the postexercise state and thus
contribute to a greater energy and lipid deficit." In other
words, compared to moderate-intensity endurance exercise, high-
intensity intermittent exercise causes more calories and fat to
be burned
    <u>
     following
    </u>
    the workout. Citing animal studies,
they also said it may be that appetite is suppressed more
following intense intervals. (Neither group was placed on a
diet.)
   </p>
   <p>
    The next time someone pipes up about the fat-burn zone, ask
them if they are familiar with the Tabata and Tremblay research
reports.

    . Keep in mind that VO2max can only be measured in the
laboratory; you'll have to estimate 170% of VO2 max. Don't try to make it too
complicated. Simply chose a pace that brings you near exhaustion on the
final 20-second rep; you should become more fatigued with each rep. Increase the
pace as your condition improves. It's always better to underestimate your
ability at the start. Begin a little slower than you think you can handle, and
then adjust the pace from workout to workout.
