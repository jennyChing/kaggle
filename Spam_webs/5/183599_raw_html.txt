           <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
            By Jeff Price

         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          There have been six fundamental changes to the music industry that have revolutionized and transformed the business. It is vital that artists are fully aware of these changes in order to make the most money and pursue their passion on their own terms.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          These six changes are:
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          1) Music fans now buy and listen to music from digital music stores and services.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          2) There is unlimited shelf space where everything can be in stock at no detriment to anything else.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          3) For no up front cost, there is unlimited inventory always available on demand as a perfect digital copy.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          4) With the launch of TuneCore, there is no gatekeeper to placing a song on Apple, Amazons etc store or hard drive.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          5) Distribution of a release is now global and not restricted to just one country.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          6) Artists can market directly to their fans.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span id="more-1117">
         </span>
         <br/>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          With these changes, gone are the days of needing to be able to negotiate a label and/or distributor deal agreement (provided you were lucky enough to get one).
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          Instead, with self-distribution and access to marketing, the artist is now: The Label, The Performer, The Publisher and The Songwriter. While wearing all of these four hats at once, artists are now uniquely positioned to profit from the best possible contractual distribution terms and highest revenue generation via the sale, use, or streaming of their music. The challenge is that many artists dont know what these rights are, or how to collect the money theyve earned from these revenue streams. A comprehensive, streamlined, and completely inclusive infrastructure does not yet exist that enables every artist who is owed money to easily collect it. However, there are solutions out there for artists, and its imperative that you understand these.

        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          Money is made from music by either selling, licensing or using it the sale of the music is the one that gets talked about the most.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          The others also generate a LOT of money for artists, performers and songwriters. This money is made based on the USE of music as opposed to just the SALE of the music  in other words, music does not necessarily have to be sold to make the artist, songwriter, performer and label money. Much of the money from these six copyrights is collected by entities located on every continent around the world called Performing Rights Organizations (PROs). PROs tend to be not-for-profit or government controlled and/or mandated. Their function is to collect and distribute money owed to songwriters, labels and performers. The amount of money the writers are paid comes from federal laws in those countries that mandate entities MUST pay them for the USE of music.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          This has become increasingly important now that the music industry is global  with one click your music can be distributed, sold, shared, tracked and marketed around the world.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          As one example, unless the songwriter agrees not to be paid, every single time a song is streamed legally for free on the Internet, money is owed to the songwriter. This money is paid to the PROs and sits there waiting to be claimed.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          As another, every single time a song is played on the radio (either via the Internet or broadcast from an AM/FM transmitter tower) the songwriter, label and performer must get paid. As an interesting twist, and to make a point, there is an exception to this rule  everywhere in the world the songwriter, performer and label get paid when a song is played on AM/FM radio EXCEPT for the United States. In the U.S., only the songwriter gets paid. This means from radio play, there is money sitting in other parts of the world with a PRO for the label and performer. If the label and performer are based in the U.S., they are not able to collect this money UNLESS there is someone in another country working on behalf of them to collect it.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          As yet another example, if you are a U.S.-based band and you write your own songs and use TuneCore to distribute your music into another country like iTunes Japan, each time your music sells in Japan, iTunes pays the Japanese PRO money for the reproduction of your song. This money is in addition to the money iTunes pays for the sale of the song. This money sits with the PRO until it is collected by the songwriter/publisher. After a certain period of time, if it is not collected, it is given to other members of the PRO.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          It is vital for you to know about all of these potential revenue streams and how to collect on them around the world.

           Major Artist Initiatives in 2011
          </strong>

        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          I view it as TuneCores job to go into the world on behalf of its artists and help them plug into and collect all the money that exists for them. This is a major initiative for us in 2011. Over the next 90 days, we will be providing significant news and updates on how we intend on doing this for this new industry.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          Also, in the next 45 days or so, we are rolling out a new accounting system that allows for even more transparency down to the one trillionth of a penny as well as even more advanced custom sales reports and free access to iTunes trending data.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">
          A major education initiative is also being undertaken to provide the knowledge and information every artist should know. To that end, we will continue to post a large amount of specific information on the blog as well as create more PDF booklets for free download. George Howard (former President of Rykodisc, current professor at Loyola) and I are embarking on a series of free to attend multi-hour seminars discussing in-depth the nuances and information around the six legal copyrights.

          The power of TuneCore Artists is now unquestionable  they have sold over 300 million songs via paid download or stream over the past 2  years and have transformed the industry. Artists today not only can take the power and control into their own hands, but they must do so. This does not mean that you must go it alone; there are resources that you can avail yourself of in order to create and succeed on your own terms. It is our mission to continue to work with you to further transform the industry and provides these resources. Only by setting it free can the industry grow to its full potential.

             For me this article highlights one of the problems I keep running into with the new music industry model that everyone keeps raving about. This whole movement of convincing musicians that its empowering to be able to do everything themselves.
             <br/>
             I dont want to know everything, I dont want to DO everything. I want to have enough time in the day (after Ive worked to pay rent and feed myself) to write songs, and keep practicing at writing songs until (hopefully one-day) their so jaw-droppingly, undeniably awesome that people just NEED them
             <br/>
             Thats not gonna happen if I spend all my waking hours trying to learn every aspect, turn of legal phrase, technical jib-jab and social marketing technique one needs to be part of the empowered online musical future. May as well grind out a few more Blink 182 sound a-likes, slap a naked chick on the front and sell it to the next 50 teen kids with hard ons
             <br/>
             I am quickly becoming frustrated at these kinds of blogs and articles. Excuse me while I pick my guitar up and go strum quietly in the corner

             Well, the one thing I would say to Franz is that you have to remember that not only  are you a musician but also  a business.
             <br/>
             Just like a chef that loves to create through food and share his enjoyment with others, there are business aspects he must attend to.
             <br/>
             The other alternative to doing it all yourself is to add folks to your team who either volunteer to help or are paid to help.  The key here is finding folks you trust and enjoy working with.  I would start small and then add as you need to.
             <br/>
             The other thought about doing it yourself is that you gain experience and knowledge in the different areas, i.e. booking, publishing, marketing, etc.   Therefore, when you do add someone to your team you have an understanding of what goes into the process and, as the owner of the business, can judge whether the right strategy or decisions are being made.
             <br/>
             Best wishes for your music career!

             Franz,
             <br/>
             no offense, but why are you here then? This is ALL about figuring out the new music industry and making sense of it (as the model evolves, rather than new). I mean if your disgruntled about insight into the mechanics of your bread and Butter then go old school and shop you a label. And once you become the rockstar you foresee yourself as, and the label holds all the rights, youll wish you knew more about copyright laws.

             This is a fascinating REVOLUTION in how music is made &amp; distributed.  I saw a Guitar Center interview with the
             <br/>
             guys from Weezer and they said they are questioning whether a physical product ( disc ) is even necessary
             <br/>
             anymore.  Thank you for how you are putting these discussions into the forefront.  Thanks Tunecore, for
             <br/>
             being the Twitter of this revolution!

             I dont think the point of this was to make you do everything. Theyre just saying you can do everything. I dont understand why a person would complain about options?

             Fronz, I hear you and agree, there is a dark side to DIY. One company Im checking out is songtrust, and another Im waiting for is muckwork (not launched yet). ONe more is mywerx. Youll have to spend some time to grok these services, but they seem legit and potentially very helpful, at least for all the legal mumbo jumbo. You might also look at Ariel Publicity. Hope all this helps. i feel your pain.

             As one who has been making music for about 30 years, I have been signed to a demo deal with a major, and my wife had a release on a major. It has never been easy to make it in the music business, and you have always needed to know about how it works to successfully guide your career, or at least avoid getting screwed. The new music business model is in the end better for 99% of artists, because a) the gatekeepers are gone and b) you can keep a lot more of your revenues and have direct relationship with your fans. And though you are required to do a lot yourself, the tools for making and distributing music, video, graphics etc are better and cheaper than ever.
             <br/>
             That said, we have a smaller pie that is being split among more people, and the top earners are earning less. Meanwhile, the economics of touring get worse, and corporate sponsorship deals are probably a necessary evil for artists with enough fans to get them. Music is not the growth area it was in the 20th century. If you want to get rich, you have a better chance writing and selling an App!

             I think it is about a new industry sprung up called share hunters who return unpaid royalties to those due them,every compant like tunecast should have them.Because it seems a one way traffic the music is out there but where is my money?

             But lets not forget is this the death of the band as we know it because look at the charts all single artists well almost.No record companys no money no bands,we,re on our own.Oh it dark out there and it gets darker.

             i understand your frustration, as a business partner of an artist, i am the one who does all of reading, promoting, you need to find a good friend who likes to read, if you want you can add xlipsx campbell on facebook, i will keep you updated with the shortest versions and most important info.  I hear what your saying about the sex sells turn out, its eveywhere, we dont promote it.
             <br/>
             I think it is all about joining other artists in sharing info, in your own ways, or do what we did, we got a number of artists together who can afford a little each a month, enough to pay a small wage part-time, then found a passionate friend ME, who is supposed to work part-time thats just silly if im awake im working because i want the best for them, and then you have someone answering e-mails searching the web for oppurtunities, setting up web sites, Promoting you on social networking sites ect, ect, and now, if this is what i understand it to be collecting money from the PROs, i bet there is someone close to you who would enjoy doing the business bit that stunts you as an artist.  Good Luck, and although i know it wasnt supposed to but your Male Rant did make me chuckle

             Fronz I agree 100%. The nearly insurmountable burden of time that just self-marketing and brand awareness campaigns level on an artist can be crushing (unless your just sitting back expecting the world to just find you through osmosis). If you do everything, composition, arrangments, recording, engineering, mixing, producing, publishing, marketing, online social media campaigns now add being your own lawer into the mix and youve got a recipe for becomming homeless unless you either A: dont have to sleep or B: dont need to make money or C: have a self-sustaining income stream from your music already.
             <br/>
             As an aside, this is a huge opportunity for new businesses to emerge as artist collection agents.

             Fonz. If youre working in an industry, you should know the ins and outs. End of story. It doesnt matter if you learn this stuff to go completely DIY, or you learn this stuff to make sure your manager is not ripping you off, or you learn this stuff to protect yourself during negotiations with record labels or you learn this stuff to make sure your accountant is giving you the money youve earned.
             <br/>
             How many artists (The Beatles included) have been ripped off because (and solely because) they didnt have any grasp on any of the legalities or financial aspects of the recording INDUSTRY (important word). If you say Oh Im an artist, not a businessman then youre setting yourself up for commercial failure. Its that simple. You dont have to be a subject-matter expert, but you should know the basics going in.

             We will miss a lot of great song makers if this stays to complicated,  Imagine some one like Jimi Hendrix who sells more music every year then the year before! Axis Bold as Love,  Jimi said  Point on Mr business man you cant dress like me  its like you cant be a Electrician and a Mortician. Us *ARTISTS* need HELP we make the cake some one else drives it to the super market!  Jimi only lasted 3 years how many  Jimis didnt even get discovered ? Hopefully the darkest hour is just before the dawn!  ASTRALMAN  Gary

             RE: Jeff Price, can you fight for artists to receive more business intelligence about our online customers from Apple, Amazon, etc.?
             <br/>
             The only problem with this new music business paradigm is, where is the business intelligence? Who exactly is buying my music online? What is his or her name? Where does he or she live? Is it difficult for him or her to get to my concerts in my region? What other music does he or she listen to? How can I micromarket effectively?
             <br/>
             Beyond people through my own store coming to my concerts, who exactly is my online audience?
             <br/>
             If I had this information, I could market more effectively. I could devise product specifically for each buyer profile. I could measure whether an online concert series with other artists would be viable.
             <br/>
             A general profile will not suffice. I need real names, email addresses, and physical addresses. Let the customer indicate to Apple, for example, what information he or she is willing to share with us artists.
             <br/>
             What has anyone to be afraid of? Artists are not axe murderers nor are we stalkers. This identity hiding issue is insanity. Moreover, it is not possible to steal Apples customers away from iTunes. Empower us creators to get personal with our audiences in a meaningful way.
             <br/>
             Artists need to get feedback directly from real fans who _actually_ buy their stuff. As in any business, musicians need to optimize their resources. Look. Anyone can say they like your stuff. Practically speaking, you cant concentrate your efforts on them. I respect myself and my work. Id rather spend my time targeting people who feel the same.
             <br/>
             Jeff, please make this request for customer information of the online retailers a priority. To reiterate, we artists require _real_ customer information that resolves to _real_ people.
             <br/>
             Thank you for your sensitivity regarding this issue.
             <br/>

             No, I wont pay tunecore in order to sell albums and become a pawn of your so called new music industry.
             <br/>
             They should pay me, the pro musician, that still writes music for the masses. And yes, musicians all over the world and especially good ones, are still underpaid -been playing and composing music for 34 years
             <br/>
             Thats my point end of story.
             <br/>
             =============================
             <br/>
             I prefer to sell by myself my own music that was produced inside my own digital studio that was built with my money.
             <br/>
             Selfish? Yeah, I know, and prefer it that way.
             <br/>
             You dont like my albums? Fuck off and go buy the shit that the new music industry wants you to buy.
             <br/>
             Bye bye now, and you tunecore executives should stop making money by conning young artists, get a day job like we do.

             Bruce,
             <br/>
             After 6 plus years of DIY, this is what I have found:
             <br/>
             1. In order to make it in the music industry, you have to get your song played on the radio.
             <br/>
             2. All radio stations that are relevant for one to make it are owned and controlled by four companies:
             <br/>
             a. Clear Channel: 900 Stations
             <br/>
             b. Citadel: 243 Stations
             <br/>
             c. Cumulus: 347 Stations
             <br/>
             d. CBS: 130 Stations
             <br/>
             With 900 stations, Clear Channel owns the radio market when it comes to popular music.  If you dont get played by Ryan Seacrest, forget about it!  Citadel, Cumulus, and CBS are just Clear Channel followersin other words, if Clear Channel plays it, then they do tobecause they are desperately looking for listeners.
             <br/>
             Who said Payola does not exist?  Ive spent the past six years on the phone with program directors. DJs, Personalities, etc.  These people have no control over what gets placed on rotation.  If anyone out there thinks a radio programmer is going to suddenly stop rotation on Black Eye Peas (as Interscope pays zillions of dollars) to play a no name non Blessed by a major record label artist, those days are overwait no actually did those days ever exist?
             <br/>
             3. Another way to make it is by touring major venues.  Lets not mention the type of budget one must have to accomplish such feat, guess what? Live Nation
             <br/>
             4. Most major venues are either owned or managed by Live Nation: 48 Amphitheaters, Every House of Blues, etc
             <br/>
             5. Live Nation ALSO owns Ticketmaster who fulfills most if not all event ticket sales.
             <br/>
             6. If one takes a close look at the executive management for these powerhouses, its a no brainer figuring out whats happening.
             <br/>
             7. Another way to make it is to get your song placed on a tv showthe right tv show. Reality TV is not looking too bad these days :).  So find a shitty reality show and let them use your song.  Before you know it, the majors will come knocking.  BTW: The shittier the show, the better!
             <br/>
             8. Lets face it, the Media and its content is controlled by the Powers that be One can take the Red pill or the Blue pill.  However, the names Rupert Murdoch and Sumner Redstone seem to stand out.
             <br/>
             9. And then the Internet came along!  Viola!  More powerhouses to take advantage of creators of music.  Apple: I  everything you folks know the rest on this list: I meanis it really necessary to charge an artist 50% of their share to distribute their music?  I meanthere is no manufacturing, or promotional effort involved.  At least the record labels spend some money when they release a record.
             <br/>
             10. The Internet has leveled the playing field somewhat, but mainstream media it still manipulated to serve a much higher purpose.
             <br/>
             FUNNY ENOUGH: EVERY REALM OF ENTERTAINMENT NEEDS MUSIC.  PERFORMERS, MUSICIANS, AND MUSIC MAKERS ARE SO INDISPENSABLE, YET SO DISPOSABLE.  WE GET STEPPED ON, SPIT ON, TRAMPLED ON AND WE STILL WANT IT SO BAD THAT NONE OF US ARE WILLING TO HAVE EACH OTHERS BACK AND BEGIN A MOVEMENT.
             <br/>
             TAKE 5 MINUTES AND TURN ON YOUR TV.  IMAGINE ALL THAT CONTENT WITHOUT MUSIC.  5 MINUTES!
             <br/>
             I got excited for just a moment thinking that the time I spent typing this response will actually make a difference.  I hope it does.  Thankfully, having the flu and 102 degrees fever served its purpose.

             Empowering???  In the music industry you have to join them.  Going against them takes you no wherecheck out history.  The industry is closely controlled and manipulated by the powers that be and if you want to get on, you just have to play dumb and blind all the way to the top

             I would agree with this stance. I have been a musician for many years now and have pursued it professionally and even made a little money, nothing to get rid of the day job but still nice to make a little cash every once and awhile. I think it is nice to have the option to pursue all areas of the music process that you want, but it IS very draining and takes an immense amount of time and energy to tackle all areas of a good music creation process.
             <br/>
             If you are a musician first and foremost, not only is it highly unlikely to be able to become an expert at all aspects of the music process (mastering and even mixing especially come to mind) but even if you do have the golden ears and natural talent to excel in all areas, the pure energy requirement to do all parts of the process correctly and to their best can be so daunting that you may find yourself cutting corners or getting lazy just so you can get a song actually finished. All the more when youre talking an entire album or your third entire album this way. Be realistic about your abilities and time investments and by all means, look for professionals to help you with your weak points.
             <br/>
             I think sometimes that the increasingly jaded atmosphere I see toward the local artist is partially because there are so many people throwing something together in their bedroom with all this gear and software they barely know how to use. I have met a lot of lay people who have a very jaded impression about the unsigned artist and one of the big reasons is because they expect the recordings and sometimes even the musicianship to just plain suck! Theyve heard so many locals doing the full DIY that they are jaded of new independent music! Of course they may have a point when you are trying to wear so many hats it can be hard to become experienced and professional at even playing your instrument of choice!
             <br/>
             I also take slight issue with this article for two other reasons. 1) I would somewhat disagree with point number 2 in the article. It is true that anyone can have their stuff posted up on the net if they are willing to pay something or find a hosting site, but I cant say there is no detriment to any artist. People are only going to look at so much music and a flood of new artists posting in a given genre with greatly varied quality of recording and musicianship doesnt make people want to wade through all of it to find the gems. It becomes a real visibility issue and some great music slips through the cracks because of it. I have heard some really good DIY recordings, but to be blunt I have heard maybe 2 people in all my years of being a musician who truly pulled off the DIY at a professional level. Most of the time there is a REALLY obvious difference between a DIY recording and the album that had some money invested into it to have professionals handle some aspects.
             <br/>
             Also, though I suppose its their right to do so, I think this article is a little self serving. Tunecore is not the only service out there, CD Baby was available and doing this before Tunecore was even around. They still do it and do a great job. Either service is useful and there are others as well now. The article to me seems to imply that Tunecore has been fundamentally responsible for this massive shift in the music industry. These type of services might have helped, but Tunecore is only one of the many. Also giving the impression that if you copyright your material in all possible ways that you will make bank because of all the fans out in music land just dying to buy something isnt accurate. The truth is there are some independent artists making some good money but many many people simply dont buy music, they steal it. A lot of younger people dont even see anything wrong with pirating at all, they dont have any concept that they are stealing someone elses hard work and time. You might get some people to buy your album or track on iTunes or other sales sites, but I would never get into music these days expecting to make a killing especially from the sites that Tunecore and others provide for people to buy your material. It might be hard to say you can make decent money even if you have a large fan base.
             <br/>
             I do realize that someone at Tunecore took the time to write this nice article so I dont intend to come across like I am bashing here. I see A LOT of people who are really GOOD musicians trying to do all of this on their own and they get depressed and frustrated when nothing comes out of it. I also see people who think they are going to be a rock star buy a $500 computer and a $100 mic and think they are gonna come up with an amazing song that will make millions. I just want people who might read this to understand that the music world HAS changed, but you still might have to let someone else who is talented in an area touch your baby. Just because its possible doesnt mean you should. Its also possible to waste valuable time developing your music career in the wrong areas. If you are wanting to get into some form of commercial music youre much better served with developing your live talents and networking with other artists and industry types. The gains from being a dynamic interesting showman in the commercial music business far outweighs tackling the behemoth of time and experience required to make a decent DIY track, get good enough to make an acceptable demo and dont sweat being amazing at all of it.
             <br/>
             Of course if your more interested in a genre that traditionally isnt audience or performance based then focusing on recording chops is worth a lot more serious look as it will by much more beneficial to get a good recording on your own. It can even be the tie breaker that gets you the deal and at the least means you get to keep more money at the end if you didnt have to hire someone!

             Fronz, my hero! This echoes my feelings exactly.  Musicians give their labors away when all theyd need to do is take time to educate themselves and learn to advocate for themselves. Why is is that when this hard reality stuff is said on this and other forums, that musicians inevitably comment that the poster is being too hard on poor starving artists who just want to make great music, dude!!!!! Heres a newsflash: EVERYONE feels that way, but the only ones who will make money at it are the smart, driven ones who refuse to be taken for granted and who refuse to starve.
             <br/>
             Lets find a new way to take over this industry  together! Step one is to stop conceding defeat like whipped dogs and accept that one needs to do MAJOR WORK in areas that musicians turn their nose up at, like contracts, marketing, and DEMANDING PAYMENT for work and services like the rest of the world.

             When I signed my first record deal in 1978 a clause on it was that I would function as executive vice president of the label in charge of publishing and A&amp;R.My group was to function as a springboard coronation unit for all of the artists and sonwriters affiliated with the label.(Wooden Bowl records.)I gained tremendous knowledge in these areas which were primarily business oriented.Done with a land line phone and a typewriter.A gentleman at The Library of Congress,Ralph Gingery,took me under his wing and mentored me in the world of copyright law.And I was given a blessed eye for finding and developing new talent other than just my own.That exists to this day.I get to do my thing fully yet can Ice That CakeThis is a very tough and very beautiful business, and say what you will all of the top performers become savvy business people in one way or the other.And one would have to expect that with the new freedoms of the internet that a lot of wanna-bes are going to climb on boardwouldnt you?To be a true artist though you are going to have to presevere through the highs and the lows.This is where you get galvinized and develop your skills.This is where all of the talking ends and you have got to deliver the goods.I spent a lot of time and money honing my studio chops both singing and playing.And my expierence as executive VP led me to make sure that I had ALL of the masters in my possesion with 10 back-ups of every digital session.Doing my best with my producers to get the best recording possible under a limited budget so that later it can be re-mixed to sound even better.I will have to testify to you that to do DIY,and I am an original indie pioneer from way back,After I got the living shit knocked out of me in the boxing ring,and I was shaking up ALL of the major labels,charting nationally with every major label artist you can think of on broadcast top 40 radio and they just whopped me up so bad,When Rene gets her see that a whipping is placed upon that boy.How much can the boy take?And I was not a boy anymore I was a man and a single parent to boot. when I was led back to my corner there were people there to mend me back up again and send me out ready for the next round.And for all of this,my whole life,this was all that I wanted to do,if I had the choice to have great sex or be onstage I would be onstage,on time kicking your everloving ass.The sex can wait to where I steal a kiss from you down on the boatdocks and you give in to me darling on such a wonderful night!. I may never be noticed by the world.I may go down as the biggest failure in rock and roll,a laughing stock.Would I change any of it so I could be safe?Not on your life or mine lad.Let us begin to help eachother as a synergy,I am always open to a good idea and willing to assist you anyway that I can,people that want to make it in this world are people that are willing to learn.When you are opinionated that means you have decided to stop thinking.I dont make it a habit to demand anything,Derek Sivers also taught me many lessons on this do your very best and let the chips fall where they may.Dont bark like a dog,howl like a wolf!My website is an open forum renelabre.com if there is something you want to ask me or talk about please do so.I get a lot of good ideas from you guys and this is a great article to groove around.I might even be the missing piece to your band.Do not hesitate to call,I am open 24 hourscall me!

             The music industry is, and always has been, a shitty business with relatively very few golden opportunities given the amount of musicians struggling to get some sort of meaningful break. Would anyone in their right mind pay out of their own pocket and suffer a lifetime of poverty and frustration for any other business other than the entertainment industry? No, and Ill tell you why.
             <br/>
             It is because underneath the veneer of someone claiming to be a poor struggling artist just wanting to write music for the world (blah blah blah) is a selfish dream revolving around heaps of money, fast cars, huge mansions, celebrity parties and tons of sex.
             <br/>
             If all you care about as a musician is performing and writing music you love then just get on with it and stop whining about how tough it is. Do it because you love it first, and take whatever comes from it as a bonus. If however you are chasing the dream of being an extremely wealthy, global rock star then boo hoo if you dont achieve your shallow ass dream. The truth is no one gives a fuck except you.

             Much more succinct my friend.You have to do it first because you are an artist doing what you love to do.And the truth is you really do have to give a fuck because nobody gives a fuck except you.You had best to give a very strong fuck about it!So you save up your little pennies after you pay the bills so you can go to the studio and record.You live to play everytime you can,even if it is not your own thing you do your best to back someone else up.And you are reliable and dependable for this.And you get a little extra money rolling in which is very handy.The wanna-bes and such are going to be filtered out,this has to be true because it is such a long haul and a hard road.I,to this day have so much fun doing it,it is an addiction that I am hoping to endure.I LOVE my work,late for a gig?I cant wait to show up.And put it right where it is at.You know what I am saying hereI am going to blow your motherfucking face off!And then when I receive some appreciation for that I do not go on and on about how great I am,I just thank you and am so glad that you enjoyed yourself.You made my day.I did not make yours.And then The Blue man (T-Blue) walks over to give me my packet and says thanks for playing with me tonight, and it is 3 yardnotes when I was agreed to do the gig for 80 bucks!I paid the rest of the rent and the electric bill in full.Good to keep on going!The complaining and the whining,that is a major turn off.In view of this as the exec producer of an important albeit-low budget recording project,I will find another artist who is brilliant and willing to learn and fun to work with.I think what the Truth was going after here is Star TripsSelfish and childish behavior openly demonstrated.Judy Garland.Well Judy is a star like you shall never be.Trained by the best teachers in this wicked world from her childhood on every aspect of showbiz.She could sing,dance,act,on the highest levels.She danced with Fred Astaire!For the most part of it all she was fun and easy to work with.And second to none on the set!renelabre.com

             I would like to see Tunecore to be my main source to attain all my rights, licensing  and royalties they should make a link with ASCAP, BMI and Soundexchange to collect and connect all artist with these services as well as educate them on how and they are for.. Basically instead of me going to all this crazy paper work and singing up for all these services Tunecore can set up a simpler model where all my licensing and royalties are been collected and sent to one source. Please send me some feed back on this

             I dont want to sound rude, but to all those people who are complaining about the new DIY system, the radio stations, etc.  Maybe youre just not good enough yet.  If you were, people would take notice and many of those road blocks would disappear.  Instead of wasting time complaining about things you cant control, you should be honing your your craft.  85% of your time should be focused on your craft and the remaining 15% should be focused on learning about the business so youre not completely in the dark if you ever get good enough to garner peoples attention.  If you want to be an artist, the business wont truly affect you until youre good enough for others to care.

             This is all CRAP! Sure those ARE the laws but fact is almost no working musician will EVER see a dime of royalty money owed. Ive been with BMI since 1994, been signed to a label with distribution through Rykodisc / ADA / WEA, I am a publishing company registered with Harry Fox, registered with Sound Exchange and toured and been played all over the globe and have never received a dime. I played by the rules and got screwed for it. Now I own my own label and the only money I make is from gigs and TuneCore. Thats it! Thats all! Thats the true reality. If you cant handle the truth find another line of work. I really wish these people would stop selling false dreams..

             Jeff Price taking credit for revolutionising the music industry when he is just a digital truck driver.  You put bands on iTunes.  THAT IS ALL.
             <br/>
             You did not reinvent the music industry  100s of companies put bands on iTunes.  Your company has never evolved past stage one.
             <br/>
             You are no different from anyone else and even charge for iTunes 6 times over.

             You know, I read things posted like the comment by Cyrusjohnsmith and I have to admit, I just do not understand where the anger comes from.  And its not just this one person, there are a number of people out there in the world that have an inherent anger towards just about everything in the music industry, no matter what it may be.
             <br/>
             The attack it all, including the musicians.
             <br/>
             So be it, but honestly, I do wish I could figure it out.
             <br/>
             On a different note, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but they dont get to make up facts.
             <br/>
             TuneCore charges a flat rate for unlimited songs to unlimited stores.  There is no incremental charge for stores  that was removed around two years ago.
             <br/>
             Actually, last week, we also added up to 25 streaming media players per account with distribution.
             <br/>
             And yes, we actually did reinvent the music industry  on January 26th, 2006 the music industry changed.  For the first time in its history any artist had access to distribution, there was no more gatekeeper deciding who get let in.  In addition, artists kept all their rights and received 100% of the money from the sale of their music via a non-exclusive agreement they could cancel at any time.
             <br/>
             With this final piece of the puzzle in place, the industry was democratized, all were welcome.
             <br/>
             In the last 2 1/2 years, TuneCore Artists sold over 300 million songs generating over $130 million in gross music sales and another $100 million or so in publishing income.
             <br/>
             It is the artists and the music fans that changed the world, they music just had to be let in.

             With all due respect, this conversation should be about artists, not me.  Your personal like or dislike of me has no place here.
             <br/>
             TuneCore will continue to do what it set out to do  fight for artists, provide them information, access and education.  Create opportunities to pursue their goals under their own terms.
             <br/>
             And we wont do that by simply writing some comments on a blog

             As I said, there is a lot of anger out there  it really does confuse me.  I am not certain of the cause but do hope that energy can be redirected towards helping their own careers as opposed to suggesting people hang themselves.
             <br/>
             In the meantime, for those that want it, the help, opportunities and information are there.

             Its a saying Jeff. Google it.  So is trumpet blowing Jeff.
             <br/>
             Artists feel anger to you personally due to your persistent trumpet blowing. Thats a saying, you can google it.

             Well Tunecore, seeing as you deleted my last comment i will have to re-post.  Hope i dont offend you this time LOL.  Also still waiting for any mention of those opportunities.  Still waiting.
             <br/>
             Enough rope to hang yourself is a saying Jeff  google it.  Another saying is trumpet blowing, which is all you ever do and why anger from artists is directed against YOU personally Jeff.  Perhaps youre not too hot on sayings.  Or just on Google.
             <br/>
             To make your blogs interesting all you need to do is keep up with current events and try and give an educated comment on them.  NOT saying how everything relates to how wonderful you think you are.
             <br/>
             Obviously you are not a musician so can not understand how we think  i suggest also recruiting a guest blogger to write about artist matters.  Someone who can actually relate to your customers.  You could google them

             Although you do seem to have a chip on your shoulder and a lot of anger about something, i do agree with you that you blog comment should not have been deleted
             <br/>
             i will find out who deleted it and make sure they do not do that again
             <br/>
             in regards to opportunities  our blog is not meant to be an advertising platform for TuneCore, but here you are
             <br/>
              Access to digital stores with no gatekeeper, artists keep all their rights, get all the money, non exclusive, cancel when you want.  A major deal with a new one is launching shortly.
             <br/>
              we actively market and promote TuneCore Artists  over 2,000 TuneCore Artists have had editorial placements in the stores, over 50 have been the iTunes single of the week  placements have also occurred in all other digital stores
             <br/>
              Amazon.com/tunecore  we have a branded section of Amazon.  We select what gets placed on that page.  Amazon drives traffic to it as do we. The placement highlights and sells releases and music for our customers
             <br/>
              Once a quarter an email is sent by Amazon to a portion of its customer base exclusively marketing and promoting TuneCore Artists
             <br/>
              Compilation albums available for free download at Amazon and iTunes  we regularly put compilation albums of music available for free download in iTunes and Amazon.  These albums are then promoted by TuneCore via Tweets, Facebook, press releases.  In addition, the digital stores market them as well.  The TuneCore Experience Music free download albums within Amazon frequently are in the Top 10 most downloaded albums.
             <br/>
              Connect artists with brands  we frequently tie brands into the marketing of artists.  Yamaha, PayPal, Guitar Center, Gucci, Hard Rock Hotel, Roland and many others have been tied into marketing/promoting the free download albums driving awareness and downloads.  We had 220 physical Guitar Center retail stores in the US put up in-store signage and POP featuring the 20 bands on a Guitar Center branded download album on iTunes.  Most recently we had 26 TuneCore Artists featured on the Jumbotron monitors at the Verizon Amphitheater in Irvine, California.
             <br/>
              Contests  from time to time we run contests or promotions.  We flew five people to Peter Gabriels Real World Studios in the UK to record all expenses paid. Engineer provided as well.  We then worked with SSL and Eventful to market the band and their music. We recently registered copyrights for TuneCore Artists, gave away copies of Donald Passmans All You Need to KNow About the Music Business  We gave a band a 16 passanger Ford Econoline van and a lot more
             <br/>
              Artist could download stems from a song by the band Ministry and use them in their own original recordings.  Two artists were then selected by Paul Barker to have their tracks licensed to appear on the Ministry The Movie soundtrack with members of Tool, Skinny Puppy and others
             <br/>
              We tied in with Owl City  artists could elect to have a song sent to Adam from Owl City. He listened to all the tracks and picked one artists to reach out to and write about their music.  he also then marketed and promoted that bands music to his fans.
             <br/>
              We provided bands guaranteed gigs through House Of Blues if they sold over 200 songs within a 30 mile radius of a HOB
             <br/>
               we have gotten bands press in the New York Times, MSNBC, LA Times, NPR and many more outlets
             <br/>
              We struck a deal with Universal Music Group allowing artists to get distribution via Interscope Digital Distribution, DefJam, UniMo and Republic providing a direct sales feed of data to the A&amp;R people in those labels.  In 2010, around 10% of Universal Republics signings came off TuneCore data
             <br/>
              We create free downloads of booklets on information about the industry and how it effects you.  We also provide specific detailed booklets on tips to market and promote to sell more music on-line
             <br/>
              we get artists placed into the Starbucks free download program providing national expsoure
             <br/>
              we get asked for artists and music to be included in music samplers for SXSW, Austin City Limits and a large number of other promotions
             <br/>
              We have a dedicated in-house marketing and promotion department whose sole job is to get artists placed and featured within the stores
             <br/>
              We provide 25 free media players per TuneCore account for TuneCore Arists to use to market and promote themselves
             <br/>
              We constantly tweet and market TuneCore Artists to over 580,000 people that have provided us their email address and asked to receive information
             <br/>
             And then there was yesterdays press release.I can assure you, he was not hired to do nothing.
             <br/>

             <br/>
             I hope your music connects with the world, as ultimately, we can help to get you distributed and heard, but its your art that causes reaction.

             Well Jeff, thanks for the long list.  Not sure if i agree with the Tunecore blog NOT being advertising  it does come across that way.
             <br/>
             Thats a long list of claims, i have researched them and can say that you are bending the truth in certain areas.  But i am really getting tired of this.
             <br/>
             In conclusion,  point 4 of your blog is rather egotistical and short-sighted.  Tunecore were not the first distributor to put independent/unsigned artists on sale online and you have put bands on iTunes for 5 years.  That is all.  You did not save the world and your claims only belittle the hard work us musicians put in.
             <br/>
             You did not change the world.  Music did.

             You are factually incorrect.
             <br/>
             TuneCore was the first entity to provide distribution to any artist with no gatekeeper while allowing the artist to keep all their rights and receive 100% of the money from the sale of the music via non-exclusive agreement
             <br/>
             It changed and democratized an industry and I am damn proud of it.
             <br/>
             I encourage and support you creating you own service to better the world as opposed to posting bitter comments on blogs. (From what I can tell you simply post on blogs and nothing more.)
             <br/>
             In regards to "checking"  with all due respect, give me a break. You do seem to have an agenda, and I clearly don't know what it is, but you personal dislike of me clouds your judgement.
             <br/>
             Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but you don't get to change facts.
             <br/>
             I did want to give you a heads up that if you future blog postings continue to mis-state fact etc, we will delete them.Opinions are always welcome
             <br/>
             I do wish you success in your music career.

             Yeah, people dont understand that in the real world, when an economy is flooded with a product, its value is low. Because the American market is FLOODED with a BAJILLION half assed Bright Eyes/Decemberist wannabes (of course being that their music is half assed as it is), then people arent gonna buy it. You dont have to have marketing expertise, you have to write music. When you write good music, it markets itself.
             <br/>
             Any network marketing person can tell you that if you have a great product, it sells itself, and when it does, people buys it. The fact of the matter is that so many people on the market are so concerned about the market that instead of using the information as tools, they use them as ploys, and manipulative tactics. Marketing TOOLS should simply be used to market an already GREAT PRODUCT, not just some lame ass song that you and your college buddies got high to while you swooned about your ex-girlfriends and pontificated lifes true meaning (or lack thereof).
             <br/>
             Stop bitching about it, and just write the music and use the tools.

             However, at the same time, the amount of money for an independent artist is still limited, and may be completely unattainable, but I dont think so. I think there is a way to do it, but instead of yammering about it on a blog, we should use our creativity to pump out new ideas.
             <br/>
             This stage of development is a risk taking stage, and no one gets anywhere without taking the risk.

             Some things are different, but some things are the same. If the Beatles turned up tomorrow, or the Who, or Nirvana, they would still make it to the top rapidly regardless of the structure of the music biz. Fact is, there just arent that many GREAT acts around. There are lots of OK acts around. WHile Im not crazy about canned acts, fact is that all great bands ran into great producers who helped them to greatness. Then they would get spun into a radio industry that may have shut some people out but also pushed others. Bottom line, though, is a great song still gets traction IF its pushed hard enough by its producers. Videos are critical, and the quality of those videos is critical.  Touring is important because a great performance earns paying fans, and enlarges the footprint, but so does a Youtube video with millions of plays. Touring is good because it makes a band better. Fact is, though, that it all comes down to songwriting and vocals, and then that needs to be produced well, and then pushed. In some ways, nothing has changed. In the past, labels could release entire albums with two good songs and still sell, now they cant. Hit songs are hard to come by  nothing has changed there. The media is hungry for good songs, so dont think a good song cant get traction, but you gotta meet some minimal production standards, and that is easier said than done at home, but it CAN be done, BUT it takes more experience than noobies realize.
             <br/>
             Same thing with great vocals, and lyrics, and songwriting. The pros are pros because theyve mastered something pretty complex, and even then, only a handful can write consistent hits, and even then, NOBODY does it forever.

             I feel like music these days is written for an audience, as opposed to what is true. In my experience as a music lover, the most successful artists write about what they know and love with unbridled musical talent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Theres a new band out of California called SurReal Abyss and I think they have some potential with truth in their lyrics which will resonate with people of any age. Not to mention the lead singer can belt like crazy!

            <p>
             I welcome Tunecore and others like them. For the first time in history musicians have a real chance to share their work with the world without having to go through the gate keepers. The economic model of the major labels is absurd. A band is very lucky to make 2% of the revenues it generates and labels these days also want some or all of your merchandising. In a typical example only one out of 25 acts a label signs will not owe money to the label at the end of their contract. The other important detail here is much less than 1% of musicians have what it takes to make a major label deal work. Having really good songs is only a small part of what makes the major label world work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Realistically an artist needs to sell 100,000 units on there own for a label to take notice.
             <br/>
             500,000 if theyre expecting to sign a contract they wont later regret. Labels generally dont do packaging and development. A record deal is still a good goal to have if you understand that you have to make yourself into something really great first.
            </p>
            <p>
             With the event of Tunecore and others like them artists now have powerful tools to put themselves in the position to be an asset that a label might sign a lucrative deal with. The cost of creating a way to sell 100,000 units has never been lower. Artists have never had easier access to fans and potential music consumers. These are the core issues that are shaping the future of music in the world we live in now.
