         It now commits itself to avoiding the worst excesses of he said, she said journalism. It says to itself that a report characterized by false balance is a false report. It introduces a new and potentially powerful concept of fairness: being fair to the truth. My verdict: Bravo, NPR.
        </h6>
        <p>
         Within the world of pressthink there are occasional events, things that happen and by happening bring to light shifts in thought. It happened last week
         <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/164223/npr-introduces-new-ethics-handbook-appoints-standards-and-practices-editor/">
          when NPR released a new document
         </a>
         , an ethics handbook headlined:
         <em>
          This is NPR. And these are the standards of our journalism.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Much of whats in
         <a href="http://ethics.npr.org/">
          the handbook
         </a>
         is Journalism 101. Much of it resembles an earlier document, The NPR Code of Ethics and Practices, which I reviewed in the writing of this post. (The new handbook replaces that earlier code.) But there are some crucial differences, and some of them speak directly to
         <a href="http://pressthink.org/2011/09/we-have-no-idea-whos-right-criticizing-he-said-she-said-journalism-at-npr/">
          earlier posts
         </a>
         at PressThink about the troubles at NPR.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my view the most important changes are these passages:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          In all our stories, especially matters of controversy, we strive to consider the strongest arguments we can find on all sides, seeking to deliver both nuance and clarity. Our goal is not to please those whom we report on
          <em>
           or to produce stories that create the appearance of balance, but to seek the truth
          </em>
          .
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         <a href="http://ethics.npr.org/category/b-fairness/#1-fairness-in-storytelling">
          and.
         </a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          At all times, we report for our readers and listeners, not our sources. So our primary consideration when presenting the news is that we are
          <em>
           fair to the truth.
          </em>
          If our sources try to mislead us or put a false spin on the information they give us, we tell our audience. If the balance of evidence in a matter of controversy weighs heavily on one side, we acknowledge it in our reports. We strive to give our audience confidence that all sides have been considered and represented fairly.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         With these words, NPR commits itself as an organization to avoid the worst excesses of
         <a href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2009/04/12/hesaid_shesaid.html">
          he said, she said journalism
         </a>
         . It says to itself that a report characterized by false balance
         <em>
          is a false report.
         </em>
         It introduces a new and potentially powerful concept of fairness: being fair to the truth, which as we know is not always evenly distributed among the sides in a public dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span id="more-2192">
         </span>
         Maintaining the appearance of balance isnt good enough, NPR says. If the balance of evidence in a matter of controversy weighs heavily on one side
         <em>
          we have to say so.
         </em>
         When we are spun, we dont just report it. We tell our audience This is spin! (Update: The new policy is
         <a href="http://jayrosen.tumblr.com/post/18535795088/actually-governor-romney-what-you-just-said-is">
          already having an effect
         </a>
         .)
        </p>
        <p>
         There was nothing like that in the old Code of Ethics and Practices, which dates from 2003. So why the change? I asked Matt Thompson, Editorial Product Manager at NPR. He co-wrote the handbook with Mark Memmott of NPR. Heres our exchange:
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Matt Thompson
         </strong>
         : In this Handbook, we aimed to be as clear as possible in defining and elucidating terms that are open to varying interpretations. The change from the previous Code of Ethics to the guidance you see here is less a wholesale change than an evolution of our thinking and an addition of context. The definition of fairness given in the code was that we present all important views on a subject. The development of the Handbook allowed us to expand on what that really means.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the brief section on fairness in the previous code, the focus was on how we treat those we cover. That focus hasnt really changed. Most of the guidance in the section on fairness dwells on how to do right by them  representing their words faithfully, giving them time to respond to criticism, following through on promises of anonymity, etc. Its vital to treat these stakeholders fairly because its difficult to do thorough, accurate reporting when one side of an issue doesnt trust you enough to cooperate with your reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
         But its important to remember that the public is our primary stakeholder, and we wanted to emphasize that. Its critical that we earn and preserve the trust of our sources and subjects of coverage, but its always most vital to tell the public what we know to be true. Were striving to give the public the strongest perspectives on the various sides of a debate. We expand on that in the section on completeness:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          When we say our reporting is complete, it means we understand the bigger picture of a story  which facts are most important and how they relate to one another. Its unrealistic to expect that every story should represent every perspective on an issue. But in our reporting, we must do our best to be aware of all perspectives, the facts supporting or opposing each, and the different groups of stakeholders affected by the issue. Only then can we determine whats best to include in the time and space we have.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         In a section thats mostly about how we treat those we report on, we felt it was necessary to underscore the primary importance of those we report for.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          PressThink
         </strong>
         :
         <em>
          I noticed that the term unbiased doesnt play the same role in the new document as it did in the old. Why is this?
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Matt Thompson:
         </strong>
         The word unbiased appears twice in the old code. By my count, it appears twice in the Handbook as well, but a related term  impartial  appears more often in the Handbook.
        </p>
        <p>
         In part, syntax made impartial a stronger word choice for us. There is no noun form of the adjective unbiased, so the word itself doesnt work in the list of ten principles that guide NPRs journalism (e.g. accuracy, fairness, honesty, impartiality, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
         On a personal note, the word geek in me also likes that impartial comes from the same root as party. It suggests not favoring any side in a dispute. We talk about impartial officials and impartial judges, folks who act without favoring particular people. Thats more solid than unbiased, which suggests, more open-endedly, having no prejudices. The majority of guidance in the Handbook concerns how we treat and relate to people. We like that the word impartial is solidly grounded in the notion of how we treat and relate to people as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         More philosophically, the Handbook format allowed us to deepen the treatment of an idea, and to easily revisit topics. It allows us to acknowledge that yes, journalists  like all people  have opinions. But a strength of our journalism is that we strive to aggressively challenge those opinions and capture reality in a way that one can embrace no matter what perspective he or she comes from.

         :
         <em>
          My reading of the old code, as compared to the new handbook, is that the document that dates from 2003 is kind of defensive: its about preserving something it calls credibility. It then details all the ways credibility can be lost, and warns against them. The new document, it seems to me, tries to be more affirmative. Rather than assuming credibility and defending against its loss, the 2012 handbook is really about the production of trust and what it takes to be trust-worthy, the NPR way. Thats not a huge shift, but it is a difference. What accounts for that?
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Matt Thompson:
         </strong>
         What youre seeing there is a consequence of the shift from a Code  a compendium of rules  to a Handbook  a how-to guide. We did certainly make a conscious effort to make the document an affirmative presentation of how journalists can approach their work rather than a list of thou-shalt-nots. In several places, we emphasize that the goal is to provoke thought, not to preempt it. Wed rather a journalist approach a decision by thinking about stakeholders, choices and values than by outsourcing the decision-making process to a rulebook. Bob Steele, who was a terrific guide in this process, often says that rules are brittle. They tend to break down in complex situations. So in most places where we have laid out rules in this Handbook, weve tried our best to connect them to an explanation of our thinking.

         Thanks, Matt! I think the key words here are: We felt it was necessary to underscore the primary importance of those we report for. Journalists arent primary. Sources arent primary. Not even the story is primary. The users are. That may seem obvious. But it wasnt obvious in the old code. And it hasnt been obvious in the bitter culture war controversies that have rocked NPR, like the Juan Williams firing in 2010 and the resignation of Vivian Schiller in 2011. (See PressThink on those events

         )
        </p>
        <p>
         This is the way the old code began:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          <strong>
           I. Statement of purpose
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Credibility.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          NPR is primarily a news organization. We are always testing and questioning the credibility of others. We have to stand that test ourselves, whether we are functioning as reporters, hosts, newscasters, writers, editors, directors, photographers or producers of news, music or other content. Our news content must meet the highest standards of credibility.
         </p>
         <p>
          The purpose of this code is to protect the credibility of NPRs programming by ensuring high standards of honesty, integrity, impartiality and staff conduct
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Notice the strange jump cut from statement of purpose to credibility. The

          purpose
         </em>
         of NPR cant be to maintain its credibility. That doesnt make sense. Its a confused, thin, and I would say insular way of introducing what NPR is about.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now heres the way the new handbook starts:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Our Mission.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The mission of NPR, in partnership with its member stations, is to create a more informed public, one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and culture within the United States and across the globe. To this end, NPR reports, produces, acquires and distributes news, information and other content that meet the highest standards of public service in journalism and cultural expression.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         There is an attempt to get the pressthink right. The big idea behind NPR, the reason we should care, is not protecting professional reputation, or newsroom credibility. Way too thin! The creation of an informed public that is capable of dealing with its many challenges: thats what NPR is about. Bravo.
        </p>
        <p>
         Final comment. Theres a common misconception about codes of ethics. They dont dictate practice;
         <em>
          they distill an existing culture.
         </em>
         The NPR handbook is
         <a href="http://ethics.npr.org/category/a-preamble/#1-about">
          clear
         </a>
         about this.
         <br/>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         We didnt have a written, public ethics policy until 2003. But well before that, our journalists were poring over technical documents to make sure they had described an obscure detail correctly, or were politely hounding the subjects of critical stories because true fairness means not being satisfied with no comment.
         <p>
          A policy or handbook  no matter how great  is not what creates a culture this strong. If anything, its quite the reverse.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Amen. Now I know what some of you are thinking. What good are these fancy declarations, if he said, she said remains in common practice at NPR? It wouldnt surprise me if that happens. But if it happens, we have stronger grounds on which to criticize NPR. The people inside who want to change things have a stronger hand. What is legitimate, and what is not, has shifted ground. That counts.

              The Truth is completely subjective. There is no such thing as an objective Truth. So, I guess NPR decided to no longer be objective in its reporting. At least theyre honest about it.

                Did you read the article? There is very much objective truth in what they are going to be reporting on.

                If two politicians make opposite claims, instead of just saying he said this, and he said that  they will instead look into the issue and see which one is right and which one is wrong. This is especially easy on claims regarding documented statistics.

                  If two politicians make opposite claims, instead of just saying he said this, and he said that  they will instead look into the issue and see which one is right and which one is wrong. Then theyll announce that the liberal view was right and that the conservative viewpoint was just an attempt for the obscenely rich to become even richer by forcing working class women to get pregnant and breathe poisoned air while bombing oppressed people everywhere.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I expect this change (change!) will pretty much amount to the same old stories, only followed by, and that was the real, real truth.

                Sometimes newsmakers intentionally attempt to deceive the public. They take advantage of the unbiased media to present their press releases as journalism. Sometimes the truth isnt as complicated as you might think.

                  You can always tell the FOX Republican shills because theyre the ones who insist that reality is up for grabs/a myth/whatever they say it should be. This is because their favorite conservative news sources have been caught lying so many times that study after study shows that
                  <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-11-22/news/30431182_1_fox-news-results-show-viewers" rel="nofollow">
                   FOX News junkies are the least-genuinely-informed people in America.
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is also why FOXs slogan is fair and balanced instead of we strive to tell the truth.

              When a politician or an interest group tells an obvious factual falsehood, journalists most definitely should point that out.
              <br/>
              Thats the highest calling of a free and honest press.
              <br/>
              Were not talking about opinions here, were talking about facts that are provable with evidence.
              <br/>
              Those who say this new policy is anti-conservative are in effect declaring that conservatives are more prone to lying than others.

              I remember listening to KNPR one time when they interviewed a hispanic on immigration policies, and what a good thing it was for him and his family to come to Amerika? The opportunities of work? Of healthcare, education? Not one word about helping LEGAL Americans right to WORK? Thats one sided PERIOD !!! GOV RADIO BS

            Is this a consequence of the new leadership at NPR? And, maybe, that the new leader (name escapes me) wasnt around during the Bush years to get intimidated?

              The drive to overhaul the code began under Vivian Schiller, well before the arrival of Gary Knell as new president and CEO. I think the new thinking is probably more a product of NPRs culture, which, when you take away the board and the politics of funding, has a lot of solid journalistic talent and backbone. Thats my sense from the outside. But I dont know what role Knell played.

            We can try to encourage NPR to take this new handbook seriously. Would an immediate surge of donations work? Perhaps itd be worth organizing such a movement in the next week or so. Id hate to see these ideas ignored like the code at the NYT so often is.

             <p>
              Our experiences and perspectives are valuable assets to our journalism. We enjoy the right to robust personal lives, yet we accept some unique professional obligations and limitations. Because our words and actions can damage the publics opinion of NPR, we comport ourselves in ways that honor our professional impartiality. We have opinions, like all people. But the public deserves factual reporting and informed analysis without our opinions influencing what they hear or see. So we strive to report and produce stories that transcend our biases and treat all views fairly. We aggressively challenge our own perspectives and pursue a diverse range of others, aiming always to present the truth as completely as we can tell it.

No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination.
               </p>
               <p>
                Article 37. The freedom of person of citizens of the Peoples Republic of China is inviolable.

               </p>
               <p>
                Article 41. Citizens of the Peoples Republic of China have the right to criticize and make suggestions to any state organ or functionary.

                  Im assuming by quoting the Chinese constitution, you are implying that an organization can have a positive creed, but not follow it. I would think instead of declaring propaganda! and posting copy-pasta, youd actually put forth an example.

              What would you rather have the news report, if not the truth? Empty fair and balanced reporting where journalists parrot the facts and figures fed to them, but its fine because they include both sides of an argument? Not all arguments are equally valid, and occasionally people are just *wrong*. The truth can be a murky thing, but if I say black is white and up is down that is not a valid counterpoint worthy of consideration and discussion.

              Propaganda and lies need to be exposed, not repeated, by journalists.
             </p>
             <p>
              One reason polls show widespread political ignorance among the American public is that the press has not been fulfilling its very crucial role of watchdog and whistle-blower.

            A great start to this revised policy would be for the execs at NPR to send their current ombudsman packing  the one who decided the euphemism enhanced interrogation should still be used in NPR stories, rather than calling It what It is and has been for decades in international law: torture. One of NPRs biggest sins was continuing to spew the Orwellian line of the previous administration in the war on terror.

              Exactly! What has forever stained NPR in my estimation is not that they made a mistake in their approach to reporting on torture, but their continued refusal to admit that mistake.

                The NPR ombudsman who arrogantly defended the organizations policy on torture was Alicia Shepard. See Glenn Greenwalds post from 22 June 2009 at Salon for a critique of her tortured reasoning. Fortunately, shes no longer NPRs ombudsman, her 3-year appointment having come to an end last year. Since June 2011, Edward Schumacher-Matos has held the position.

            Hi Jay  is there any way to compare and contrast NPRs new Code to the Codes of other major journalistic enterprises? Such as CBS/NBC/ABC News, The New York Times, Fox News, the BBC World Service, etc.

            Here, here! This gets away from the old three-paragraphs-of-pro content must be matched by three-paragraphs-of-con content. No more word counting to assure a falsely predicated evenness for my editors of old! This requires reporters and editors to use common sense, something, if youll forgive me, that seems like common sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its dicey, yes, and calls for judgment calls at each step of the way. It will be controversial and done sloppily it will backfire and has the potential to hugely injure a news organizations credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this step forward makes great sense to me because  assuming, of course, that those judgment calls are carefully made by honest, thorough and well-trained people in the full light of day  it will result in providing readers with much more meaningful, more valuable information. Its benefits should be tangible and long lasting.
           </p>
           <p>
            And in the ultimate free market practice, if readers dont trust the result, they can seek their news and information elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            I couldnt agree more with Rosens point that a report characterized by a false balance is, by definition, a false report. We as an industry need to get away from that. We need to assure that codes of conduct are written in ways that instill a culture of fairness to the truth.

              In other words, we admit that the internet or blogosphere or whatever term you want to use it the ultimate source of reconfirmation of user world views. Maybe real journalism can only take place where Lou Grant is the editor or in the Wire both interesting fictions.

                The best thing about the internet is that if youre careful, you never have to read conflicting views ever again. You can always find someone to cater to your personal slant on reality, or if not, start up an outfit of your own. Its a massive echo chamber where you can always find a legion of people to back you up on any issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                And if you get bored of being right all the time, you can always go invade someone elses echo chamber and tell them how stupid they are for not seeing the world in the obviously correct way. And obviously its correct, because so many other people believe in it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Meanwhile, the truth just kind of gets lost in the shuffle.

              Huh? NPR is stronger than its ever been. Its board is weak, but thats because its dominated by the local stations. NPRs listenership has been growing. And it far more diverse that cultural warriors understand. It is massively popular online. It could easily survive the loss of Federal funding.

              Morning Edition &amp; All Things Considered lost me as a listener back in the early oughts due to obvious untruths &amp; bias in their reporting &amp; selection of stories to report. I had been a regular listener &amp; contributor since 1984. Maybe if theyve really changed I might once again give them a listen. Unlike some of the troll comments I dont want news that is biased, I want honest investigative journalism and Im done with lies or opinions reported as fact. (One of the most offensive NPR moments for me was when Barbra Bradly Hagerty interviewed Scalia but presented him as merely a man on the street w/o identifying him)

            Jay I wouldnt say it would easily survive the loss of Federal funding. I mean you are on the outside and allI dont know how true that is. (I think its a giant question mark what would really happen. But easy it wouldnt be.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking of how federal funding is effecting things, Ive heard PBSs NewsHour has had some cutback in budgeting precisely because of LESS funding from Corporation for Public Broadcasting has less.

            Ill believe it when I see a change in NPRs performance. As Chomsky and Herman have so thoroughly documented, journalists internalize the lies their publishers require. The lies become habit. I doubt long-time NPR staff can change their ways: breaking free of the propaganda stream takes a clarity of thought thats beyond most human beings abilities. Most people, ESPECIALLY journalists, choose the blue pill.

            NPR has a long history of coddling the government and other powerful interests (as bad as any of the other mainstream media just with more pretense of being real journalists)so Ill believe this when I see it  kind of like NYTimes promise to try not to rely on anonymous sources (that lasted what? a day?)

            Hi Jay,
           </p>
           <p>
            As a former newspaper hack hired by NPR to launch one of its local news blogs in Seattle, Ive experienced the internal struggle here at NPR and at affiliate KPLU in trying to create a voice and do engagement as a blogging journalist  while also adhering to the previous ethical guidelines put forth by NPR.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still working on shifting from newspaper reporter to blogger, as a matter of fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the new guidelines are better. But I wonder if they provide enough clarity for some of what I see as inherent tension points that arise from new media styles of reporting.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds reasonable enough to say everyone should seek to remain impartial. But this is more an aspirational target than anything an honest individual will ever claim to achieve. As Ive said many times, only journalists believe journalists are unbiased. Our job is to do our best to be fair, which is what I think the new NPR guidelines are trying to achieve.
           </p>
           <p>
            But its much harder to always strike the right balance in a fast-moving medium like a blog. More importantly, we are told to have voice, to demonstrate expertise and engage with the community you report on in order to succeed as a blogger.
           </p>
           <p>
            I try to achieve a balanced perspective not so much in everything I post (which, frankly, would be impossible since I sometimes just re-post or curate stories and opinion pieces from Fox News to The Guardian) as in what I post over time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I make mistakes and sometimes reveal my ignorance, but I think I do have voice and have become quite engaged with the community (global health, aid and development).
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I meet NPRs new standards? I have no idea. But Im sure Ill find out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thoughts?

            I will assume they remain corporate centrists, liberal-moderate on social issues and conservative-centrist on economic and foreign issues until I hear differently. If I notice an on-air change Ill quit calling them Nice Polite Republicans.

              Yes! So trueever since 9/11 and Bush administrationI still listen, but I am feel I am subjected to the National Publican Report more than anything else as far as their news goesI was shocked the other day when they actually played tape of Obama speaking and then the reporter paraphrased a rebuttalso much in the past 10 years has been the oppositeI have never been left wondering what a particular Republican stance is on anything for the last 10 years listening to NPRbut often wondering why they dont report on some obvious flaws within those positions???

                Ive heard plenty of ridiculously left questions from their interviewers over the years, although generally their guests are smart enough to deflect them. I like NPR as a news source (supplemented with others of course, getting all your news from *any* single source is dangerous) but sometimes they are so cartoonishly left it hurts.

            Agree..until they fire their ombudsman and apologize for enabling the crippling Bush Decade NPR is Fresh Air and music only for me. I used to enjoy the carbon waste that is Wait Wait Dont Tell Me. As the Bush years revealed their horrors I realized it was comedians making jokes about the decline of Empire that NPR has managed to avoid covering.

            Perhaps now that the truth is your goal, you could consider interviewing Stefan Molyneux the host of Freedomain Radio- the worlds largest philosophical discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has released multiple books ranging from treatises on truth and morality, to novels and comedies, and they are all free at his website: freedomainradio.com
           </p>
           <p>
            Itd be quite interesting to match your journalistic integrity to the rigors of reason and evidence.

            From what I have seen NPR already works this way for the most part. Naturally this type of journalism will lead to people on the right calling NPR out for a liberal bias since anything that doesnt toe their party line is considered biased in the other direction.

            Fair to the truth. Treat all views fairly.
           </p>
           <p>
            The difficult case is always when there is an accepted view that nevertheless has flaws and outcomes that cant be explained away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alternative views often stem from efforts to explain these flaws and as such are narrow and potentially erroneous outside of that area of correction.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the onus on a reporter to understand the distinction and nuance involved is substantially increased. This is a good thing if followed through.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its why the best blogs work  they normally have someone at their core who understands the field that they are blogging about.
           </p>
           <p>
            In most contentious fields, when I am am reading I first want to know that the writer understands the field. Only then am I interested in opinion or analysis. It can be simple mistakes that flag a report as lacking, and as indicated, primarily that is lacking fairness in the treatment of views. Just because a view is narrowly held, doesnt mean it should be treated unfairly. A view doesnt have to be treated unfairly to be disagreed with.

            So, you might start reporting on Ron Paul now? His poll numbers put him at #1, ahead of Obama, yet you insist on reporting on Gingrich, Romney, and anal juice. Its amusing to think that NPR is about as fair and balanced as Fox News.

              No one on any side, left right or center knows what to make of Ron Paul, so they tend to just not report on him. I will grant that the man has convictions and more integrity than the rest of the Republican Party combined, but even if you believe in his policies you have to admit they would tear the country in two if he tried to implement even a quarter of them.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was a great Daily Show segment a few months back where they discussed the results of a debate, and mentioned the 1st, 2nd, and 4th place candidates and discussed them in detail. 3rd? Ron Paul.

            [] With these words, NPR commits itself as an organization to avoid the worst excesses of he said, she said journalism . It says to itself that a report characterized by false balance is a false report. It introduces a new and potentially powerful concept of fairness: being fair to the truth, which as we know is not always evenly distributed among the sides in a public dispute. # NPR Tries to Get its Pressthink Right  Pressthink []

            The fundamental issue facing any journalists and media outlets that are serious about their accuracy responsibiities to the public is this  whenever you simply report and permit, without question, statements and basically concocted talking points by politicians and their backers  that were very deliberately created and designed to mislead the public  you are in effect directly serving as their daily propaganda mouthpieces.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they try to use the media to perpetrate often totally outrageous and totally false lies and misinformation over extremely important public issues (affecting peoples lives in very profound ways) then they MUST, as a core matter of ethical behavior, at all times be called out on this. And very clearly and determinedly in these regards.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a necessity for any credible media code of ethics to tackle this specific challenge head on. And for the code to explicitly identify and describe such deceptive practices as what they really are.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I think that some progress has now possibly been made in this instance at NPR (but the proof as always will lie in their actions not words), the intentional political deviousness and lying involved here has clearly still NOT been directly talked about by the revised code.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until it is (and to the full extent really necessary), this code and consequently NPR will continue to serve the purposes of those seeking to manipulate public understandings of key issues. And NPR will de facto still have failed to truly serve its listening public, as the declared new priority.

           <p>
            Lets step back for a moment and consider why moving from he said she said journalism might be a positive step. The expectation embedded in the old approach is that there are at least two sides to any story/issue/situation and that if the pubic is shown/told each side, clearly, factually, without bias, then average citizens will have the necessary information they need for participating in civic engagement and the democratic process therefore leading to a more perfect union. This is not what we now have.
           </p>
           <p>
            Present corporate control of journalism reflects no allegiance to perfecting the union, only profit getting and thus freed from the shackles of responsible objective reporting can and will say whatever keeps the viewer engaged and sitting through the commercials. The goal and purpose of reporting has utterly changed and therefore the product shifts into something that cannot address the civic and informational needs of citizens. Informational chaos and framing of issues for other purposes, such as political engineering and profit making are the present status of most journalisim.
           </p>
           <p>
            This journalistic relationship is a two-way street, as equally dependent upon an educated citizenry as it is upon objective and unbiased reporting. If the populous is aware and discerning, knowing hogwash, infotainment, scrofulous commentary, shading and blatant lies when they see and hear them and understands the critical role that news reporting plays in a participatory democracy, they would refuse to watch and listen to biased junk journalism. Alas, this discernment and awareness on the part of the average American seems wanting. Our people seem to have slipped into an almost comatic state of semi-consciousness; awake enough to adopt proffered opinions, but unconscious enough not to understand what or why they believe something beyond parroting the supercharged verbiage they willingly imbibe.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, both sides of the reporting/receiving relationship are badly broken. NPR wishes to address the problem by a re-framing of that relationship. Instead of interviewing the experts on various sides of any issue/argument they will now act as an expert, providing their own supposedly unbiased questioning of responses and perhaps providing the correct information. I can understand how NPR hopes this will bring more factual reporting to its listeners and as one and sympathetic to their cause I wish them the best but I have little hope this will be effective in creating any fundamental change leading to that more perfect union. Symptomatic solutions that do not address causation seldom fix a problem. Liberals will shout hooray when a conservative voice is upbraided for misstatements and the same on the right (though I wager these will be less frequent) and we all get to stay firmly rooted in our biases. NPR listeners will likely feel better for awhile because finally some of the ridiculous statements spouted across the airways may be questioned, but little positive change will occur because the whole damn framework is broken. We are a nation divided and that is the goal of those who wish to wield power without taking responsibility for their actions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until we as individual citizens of this nation regain our balance and perceive each other as fellows, engaged together in creating the country and world our children will inherit and that we have commonalities that unite us that are more important than the differences that divide us, and we dedicate ourselves to respect of each other beyond our various positions, I fear we will remain stuck in the nation divided we now find ourselves in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good on ya NPR for trying to fix your side of the equation.

         "We need to keep the press from being absorbed into The Media. This means keeping the word press, which is antiquated. But included under its modern umbrella should be all who do the serious work in journalism, regardless of the technology used. The people who will invent the next press in America--and who are doing it now online--continue an experiment at least 250 years old. It has a powerful social history and political legend attached..."

           Like reluctant migrants everywhere, the people in the news tribe have to decide what to take with them. When to leave. Where to land. They have to figure out what is essential to their way of life. They have to ask if what they know is portable.

           Just so you know, the media has no mind. It cannot make decisions. Which means it does not get behind candidates. It does not decide to oppose your guy or gal. It is a beast without a brain. Most of the time, it doesnt know what its doing..

A conspiracy of the like minded to find out what happened when the national news media isnt inclined to tell us might be way more practical than you think.

           The Master Narrative in Journalism:
          </a>
          <p>
           Were winning to somehow be removed or retired as the operating system for news, campaign reporting would immediately become harder to do, not because there would be no news, but rather no common, repeatable instructions for deciding what is a key development in the story, a turning point, a surprise, a trend. Master narratives are thus harder to alter than they are to apprehend. For how do you keep the story running while a switch is made?

           This White House doesnt settle for managing the newswhat used to be called feeding the beastbecause there is a larger aim: to roll back the press as a player within the executive branch, to make it less important in running the White House and governing the country.

           Realist, a classic term in foreign policy debates, and reality-based, which is not a classic term but more of an instant classic, are different ideas. We shouldnt fuzz them up. The press is capable of doing that because it never came to terms with what Suskind reported in 2004.

           Were headed, I think, for schism, tumult and divide as the religion of the American press meets the upheavals in global politics and public media that are well underway. Changing around us are the terms on which authority can be established by journalists. The Net is opening things up, shifting the power to publish around. Consumers are becoming producers, readers can be writers.

            News Turns from a Lecture to a Conversation:

           Some of the pressure the blogs are putting on journalists shows up, then, in the demand for news as conversation, more of a back-and-forth, less of a pronouncement. This is an idea with long roots in academic journalism that suddenly (as in this year) jumped the track to become part of the news industrys internal dialogue.

          </a>
          <p>
           Among foreign correspondents, there is a phrase: parachuting in. Thats when a reporter drops into foreign territory during an emergency, without much preparation, staying only as long as the story remains big. The high profile people who might parachute in are called Bigfoots in the jargon of network news. The problem with being a Bigfoot, of course, is that its hard to walk in other peoples shoes.

           There are hidden moral hazards in the ethic of neutral observation and the belief in a professional role that transcends other loyalties. I think there is an abyss to observation alone. And I feel it has something to do with why more people dont trust journalists. They dont trust that abyss.

          </a>
          <p>
           The answer, I think, involves an open secret in political journalism that has been recognized for at least 20 years. But it is never dealt with, probably because the costs of facing it head on seem larger than the light tax on honesty any open secret demands. The secret is this: pssst the press is a player in the campaign. And even though it knows this, as everyone knows it, the professional code of the journalist contains no instructions in what the press could or should be playing for?

           I think its a bankrupt form. It serves no clear purpose, has no sensible rationale.

           When journalists avoid drawing open conclusions, they are more vulnerable to charges of covert bias, of having a concealed agenda, of not being up front about their perspective, of unfairly building a case (for, against) while pretending only to report what happened.
