              Here, you will see former National Security Agency employees affiliated with a program called ThinThread, a tool which could capture and sort massive amounts of phone and e-mail data, but had an encryption function to protect the privacy of individual Americans. They and others describe the moment they found out that the technology was being used without the privacy protection.

               General Keith Alexander was the director of the NSA from 2005 until he retired at the end of March this year. He also headed the U.S. Cyber Command.

                GEN. KEITH ALEXANDER (RET.),

               So, given all the news, all the stories that have been out there over the last year since the Snowden revelations, I think there are some people out there watching who think the NSA must collect whatever it wants to on anybody it wants to at any time. What do you want the American people to know about what the NSA does?
              </p>
              <p>
               <b>
                GEN. KEITH ALEXANDER:
               </b>
               Well, I think you bring out a great point. First, they have to have the facts, because the facts are largely incorrect thats being put out there, that the NSA would be collecting all the U.S. persons information, the content of their e-mails and their phone calls.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think this is where the courts really play a key part, and what the judges have found and what they have asked us to do and allowed us to do actually comports with the Constitution. When we make a mistake, they correct it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think the key thing that I see in a lot of these discussions and the ones that we just saw is people looking at things and jumping to conclusions theyre collecting everything, theyre doing all this, when the programs, the 215 and the 702, are tailored to address problems that were found after 9/11.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you remember where our nation was after 9/11 and what we now have to swing to do, and it brought in all three branches of the government, Congress, the courts and the administration.

               OK, so the metadata program only has the two phone numbers, the duration and the date, time group of the call. You can encrypt it, but theres no other U.S. persons information other than their number, and NSA doesnt know whose number that is.

               So, you bring out a great point. You can see where the confusion immediately arises.
              </p>
              <p>
               They have the ability or they could be doing this, but what every review group, Congress and the courts, have found out is, theyre not doing it. And if they do, we hold them accountable. The 12 cases are a great case in point.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, its important that we step back and say, why do we have these programs or why is NSA involved? Look at this. The Church-Pike commission in the 70s said we dont want NSA collecting inside the United States, and, actually, we dont want NSA collecting.
              </p>
              <p>
               So why is NSA involved? And when you look at it, NSAs expertise is overseas, foreign intelligence targets, terrorists. And thats what we found in 9/11 is what we knew overseas wasnt connected to the dot that FBI had. So it has nothing to do with us going after the content of U.S. persons. And I really think thats the part we have got to help the American people understand.

               Not in exactly those words.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I dont want to be  I dont want to walk away from this, because I do think this is an important point. So, NSA goes after a foreign target. And why people equivocate is, if a foreign target is talking to a U.S. person, then its going to be covered.
              </p>
              <p>
               And what we dont want to do is say, well, OK, we didnt mean that one. And so, as soon as you say that, people say, oh, but you lied. So what you want to say is, under FISA, NSA is not authorized to target the content of U.S. persons e-mail or phone, period.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, we are authorized to go after other targets, and there will be things like incidental collection, and the courts say, if you do that, heres the process and procedures you must comply with, and we will check it, and they do.

               No, I was just going to  because I want to turn to a couple of other questions that are out there.
              </p>
              <p>
               President Obama, when he ran for president, among other things, he pledged, in so many words, no more illegal wiretapping, no more what he called national security letters that would allow spying on citizens not suspected of a crime.
              </p>
              <p>
               Were you surprised that once he got in office  and you were in office under President Bush and under President Obama  that President Obama was prepared to accept some of these things that he had said he wouldnt?
              </p>
              <p>
               <b>
                GEN. KEITH ALEXANDER:
               </b>
               Well, I didnt track the election as close  I was actually looking overseas, as you would want me to.
              </p>
              <p>
               But I actually sat down with him in a group in the White House Sit Room not long after he came in to review these programs. Wed had some compliance issues. Wed worked through the court how we were going to fix those. We had a chance to sit down with him.
              </p>
              <p>
               Heres where I saw it on both presidents. Their Article 2 authority to defend this country is paramount. And what I say were good people, both sides, doing their job to protect our nation and our allies. And President Obama is a better lawyer than me, constitutional law, saw that what the courts and the Congress was doing and what we were doing is exactly right.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, he did say, OK, how are we going to address these compliance issues in the future? How do you work that with the court? We set up better procedures that were more technical. We worked with Congress. It was a long six months, not because of him, but because of things we needed to fix.
              </p>
              <p>
               So when I look at that, what it tells me is, theres a lot more going on here than the American people get insights to, and it has nothing to do with us listening to U.S. persons or just trolling through U.S. persons data.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our job  look at the terrorist attacks from 2012 to 2013, you saw some of that data. The number of people killed rose from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 in 2013. Now, why is it that we and Europe have been so secure? And its these tools that help you. So, this is an issue that we, you and others, are going to have to help us face. How do we do this?

              <p>
               It wasnt for them the 702  I know you dont want me to use numbers, but the PRISM program, or the one that allows us to actually track bad guys who could be communicating with people in the U.S., went in foreign, were tracking the bad guy, but now they are going to talk to somebody in the U.S. and talk about bombs. That was found by this program.

              <p>
               It would not, was not found any other way. That case is out there. And then the other program came in and helped when the FBI said, this is his phone number. It gave us even greater legs.

               You have argued time and again that hes done great damage to U.S. national security. How do you quantify that?

              </p>
              <p>
               Heres what I see. Terrorists and others are adjusting how they operate. We have been very good because we have great tools, great people in the military and the intelligence community helping to defend this country and in law enforcement.
              </p>
              <p>
               When you take those tools away, its analogous to the Wheel of Fortune, when you can guess vowels and stuff. And, all of a sudden, they say, well, you cant guess A and O anymore. You cant guess some of these, but you have to figure out the puzzle.
              </p>
              <p>
               And what were doing is, were taking away some of the tools that our intelligence analysts use to stop terrorist attacks. And I believe, given the fact that terrorist attacks are increasing and that our tools are being publicly revealed, that we put our nation and our allies in greater harm, and I believe thats why we have said people are going to pay for this with their lives.
              </p>
              <p>
               And thats what caused me concern. So, that really gets us to, where do we need to be going? You dont want me thinking about Snowden. You want me and the rest of NSA  now, I know Im retired  but you want them saying, OK, whats the next step?

               Thats right. Thats right.
              </p>
              <p>
               And so, from my perspective, heres the case that were going to have. You will be here in a few months and somebody will say, how did you let this go through? And the answer is because we lost some of those tools. And so this is a time where I believe our politicians need to step back and carefully consider how we protect our nation and our civil liberties and privacy.

               Well, Im worried that people jump too quickly, rush to a conclusion, instead of standing back and saying, whats good for this country? I was at NSA eight-and-a-half years.
              </p>
              <p>
               I never saw anyone trying to do something against our civil liabilities and privacy. And if we did do that, we punished them. And that was the 12. Think of that, in eight-plus years, 12 people.
