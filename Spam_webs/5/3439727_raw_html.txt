      The Benefits of Online Dating
     </span>
    </div>
    <p>
     Are you thinking of joining an online dating network? Well, you should be for a variety of reasons. They're simple to use and very effective. But, I'll explain how online dating is far better than offline dating.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h4>
     Single &amp; Looking - Meet Other Singles That Want To Date
    </h4>
    <p>
     Say you walk into a Starbucks and meet a cute guy or girl. You start up a conversation and find out you have a lot in common. And then you find out they're seeing someone. This isn't an issue with online dating because people tell you their relationship status up front. You know if they're single and you know they're interested in meeting you.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <hr/>
    <h4>
     Interesting Interests - Find Someone With Interests That You Want
    </h4>
    <p>
     A big issue is that when you meet someone you don't know what they like. You have to spend a lot of time in order to figure out if they are right for you. Perhaps they're big into watching sports and you're bugged by people that watch sports. This may not come up on the first, second or even third date, but such a hobby may not be something you want in your significant other. With online dating this is different because the people tell you ahead of time what they like and don't like.
    </p>

    <h4>
     Safety - Find Someone On Your Terms
    </h4>
    <p>
     Ever meet a person at a bar that you thought was great at first and then realized, too late, that they're a creepy stalker? I am sure you have because this has happened to everyone. What's even more terrible about this is that now they know your hang out place and so you have to give up that favorite bar to avoid them in the future. With online dating you get to pre-qualify people. You get to chat with them before you get to meet somewhere that you choose.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <hr/>
    <h4>
     Choice - Pick of the Litter
    </h4>
    <p>
     More than likely you are limited to a very small set of people. You may have a hobby that is social, but you're continually surrounded by the same group so your choices are limited. With online dating you get to search your entire region for available people.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <hr/>
    <h4>
     Free - Nothing Has More Value
    </h4>
    <p>
     There are many ways to meet people. Often these ways involve paying money. At a bar you're expected to buy drinks. At yoga you need to pay for the class. And most speed dating sessions cost money as well. In contrast most online dating sites are free.
    </p>

    <h4>
     No Hurtful Rejection - Remove the Shame
    </h4>
    <p>
     Everyone knows that rejection hurts. When someone tells you that they don't want to meet you again, when you were sure they were the one, makes you feel terrible. With online dating you're going to have dates with people that are already interested in you.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h4>
     Quick - Dating At the Speed of the Internet
    </h4>
    <p>
     You can spend a lot of time trying to meet someone offline. Finding someone can especially be an issue if you're shy. With online dating you can create an account and it's possible to create a profile and find a date within minutes.
