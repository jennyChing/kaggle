            Northwest School of Survival was founded in 1983 by our  President Brian Wheeler. Our goal then and now remains the same: to provide  year-round professional hands-on safety training in the skills required for  preventing or surviving remote backcountry emergencies. Our instructors are all professionals and highly skilled in their respective fields. Each will  provide quality instruction drawing from years of previous knowledge and  experience. Most of them are also certified as well as active members on  mountain rescue teams. We are convinced that we have some of the finest,  well-trained outdoor educators in the world.
