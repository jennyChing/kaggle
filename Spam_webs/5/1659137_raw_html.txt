          , enough for doing this very informative and respectful post on circumcision for our BWF readers. It truly is a phenomenal article on such a heated topic.

         ~Mrs. BWF
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         During my first pregnancy, I was overwhelmed with joy when I found out that there was a little boy in my belly. Like many mamas-to-be, I instantly fell in love and spent my days (and nights) dreaming about him. As the months passed by, I began to plan for his arrival: washing and hanging all of his tiny clothes, picking out the softest blankets I could find, figuring out what breast pump would be best. I wanted to be prepared for every little detail. When I began to make plans for the birth itself, I thought about what would happen on the day of his birth, and circumcision crossed my mind.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         <a href="http://www.birthwithoutfearblog.com">
          <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3471" height="351" src="http://birthwithoutfearblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/jpg57-460x351.jpg" title="deciding on circumcision in pregnancy" width="460"/>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         At the time, I did not think there was even a choice about circumcision. Every male I knew- my husband, dad, brothers, friends  were all circumcised. The thought of a penis with a foreskin wasnt appealing to me (even though I never saw one in real life), and I had always heard of women saying it was dirty or gross. I also advocated the benefits of circumcision (even though I never truly looked at the research articles.)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         My heart sank in my chest, because I didnt want to put my new found love through any pain whatsoever. However, after talking to various family members and my OB/GYN, it seemed that circumcision was the best option for my son and his future. Its cleaner and hell have fewer problems were the most common responses. I had yet to hear a single response that was in favor of not circumcising.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         I didnt think about it much after that, until about 2 months before his due date. By that time, my love for him had grown immensely, and the thought of any painful procedure made my head spin. So one day, I decided to sit down and search on Google to see what came up about circumcision. I was very surprised when the vast majority of the information was against it! My curiosity was perked, and I found myself on YouTube,
         <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXVFFI76ff0" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXVFFI76ff0', 'watching a video of the procedure']);" target="_blank">
          watching a video of the procedure
         </a>
         . After all, my baby boy would have to go through it- so I should see it, right?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         My jaw dropped to the floor when I saw the video. I couldnt stop crying.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         From that day forward, I poured everything I could into researching this topic. I wanted to know the truth. Using various sites and forums, I started to network with as many people as I could. To my surprise, I found that there were thousands of parents who had healthy boys who were not circumcised. This intrigued me, because I had always been told that foreskins would cause many problems in boys/men. I needed to know more.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         As I dug further into the topic, I found out that the majority of the males in the world are not circumcised. In fact, the United States is the only country to perform this procedure routinely for non-religious purposes. Another interesting fact is there is

         !
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         So why was I under the impression that circumcision was best? Why do parents continue to choose it? Why do some doctors advise us to do so? I decided to create a list of the apparent benefits and researched them one by one. I had heard various reasons, such as better hygiene, less chance for UTIs, less chance for HIV/STDs, needing to look like father/brother(s), less chance of penile cancer/HPV, better to be done as an infant and needing to fit in with his peers. Heres what I found.

         Its been said that much more care is needed when boys have a foreskin. That more cleaning time is required, because it is dirty and the foreskin needs to be retracted and cleaned from an early age. However, there is nothing unclean about a foreskin, especially in infancy. In fact, both boys and girls have foreskins, which serve the same purposes. The male foreskin is actually fused to the head (glans) of the penis in infancy and through much of childhood (much like a fingernail is fused to a finger.) This is the bodys way of protecting the genitals against urine and feces. Because it is fused shut, bacteria and other foreign particles cannot invade. Theres no need to retract the foreskin to clean under it. You simply

         , This claim is based on one study that looked at charts of babies born in one hospital (Wiswell 1985). The study had many problems, including that it didnt accurately count whether or not the babies were circumcised, whether they were premature and thus more susceptible to infection in general, whether they were breastfed (breastfeeding protects against UTI), and if their foreskins had been forcibly retracted (which can introduce harmful bacteria and cause UTI) (Pisacane 1990). There have been many studies since which show either no decrease in UTI with circumcision, or else an increase in UTI from circumcision. Thus circumcision is not recommended to prevent UTI (Thompson 1990).

         It has often been said that circumcision is better to be performed on an infant for various reasons, but it is important to look at the subject logically. If a man is left intact, he can always choose to be circumcised later. However, once a circumcision is performed, it cannot be undone. There are

         Even if he opted for circumcision later, not only would he have the choice, but he would also get adequate pain medication for the surgery and understand what is happening to his body. A large majority of routine infant circumcisions are not performed with any anesthetic. In fact, up to 96 percent of the babies in the United States and Canada receive no anesthesia when they are circumcised,

         This was a very important issue for me. My husband is circumcised, and so is his oldest son. I was worried that there would be issues with the new baby being different than his dad and brother. I didnt want him to feel different or alone.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         I found out that a distant family member was kept intact, even though his older brother and dad were circumcised. Although it seemed like it would be an awkward conversation, I just had to have my husband ask him about it. So he did. It turned out that he really didnt care and it was never a big deal.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         I connected with other men who grew up intact with circumcised dads, and they laughed saying, I dont even remember what my dads penis looked like. and quite frankly, I wouldnt want to remember!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         It all made sense even though I never thought of it that way. To my surprise, it just wasnt an issue for these men. There were even online groups dedicated to keeping future sons intact, and I spoke with hundreds of parents who had made this same decision. Many of them now had grown children, and were happy to share their experience with me. I asked many questions, and it came down to this: as parents, we can only do what we think is best for our children. But, we also need to be able to grow and learn, so we can always make the best decisions possible. Sometimes, we learn that a past decision wasnt necessarily the best, and that is OK. We adapt and move on, and our children will understand that. I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.  Maya Angelou

         Getting made fun of in the locker room was a very common response for potential issues for boys who were not circumcised. This was also an important issue for me, much like the issue for my son to look like his father and brother. While this may have been an issue for men in previous generations, it is just not the same for boys growing up today.

          had dropped to 32.5% in 2009
         </a>
         . While this number was not actually endorsed by the CDC, their 2010 reports still show circumcision rates have dropped over the years (
         <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6034a4.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6034a4.htm', '54.7% in 2010']);" target="_blank">
          54.7% in 2010
         </a>
         ). No matter which number you choose to use, the results are the same: circumcision rates are falling in the United States, and continue to do so. With at least half of American parents saying no to circumcision, intact boys will no longer be in the minority. Boys growing up in todays generation will have the same amount of peers who are intact vs. circumcised.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
         Some regions in the US have a higher percentage of intact males, while other regions have a lower percentage, so it will vary depending on your location. However, it is important to remember that no matter what, children are going to be different than each other in a variety of ways. Some will be considered too smart, not smart enough, too fat, too thin, too tall, too short the list goes on and on. The main thing is to be sure to teach our children to understand that they are unique and that they should love themselves for who they are. After all, they are special in their own ways, and that will never change.

           I am not an intactivist, but my son is intact. My husband (who is perfectly happy with the appearance and function of his circumcised penis) and I did tons of reading about circumcision before our son was born. In the end, the only thing that mattered to us was watching a short video clip of the procedure. The video we watched was not particularly barbaric; anesthetic was used, etc., but we just felt that it had to be painful, and any amount of pain was not justified when the benefits are so minimal (and many can be achieved better anyway by safe sex practices, which we hope our son will use).

           Serious question two of my boys were born with their foreskin retracted and looking circumcised.   With my now 2 year old I didnt continue to retract it and it is now fused in very odd places.  My babys tries to fuse and tears away if I dont retract it.  Their doctor, who has two intact boys himself, told me to retract the babys  (he actually thought at his 1 month checkup I had him circumcised somewhere else).  I am honestly not sure which is better to do in this situation.  My two year old was given a steroid cream to thin the skin because of where and how it fused.  I dont want this to happen to the baby.  Any advice?

             Never retract. It will naturally retract when older Not necessarily a time frame but by puberty. Possibly sooner if he plays with it but never should anyone besides him retract it. Thats what causes infections Leave it be Only clean what is seen.

             It sounds like your boys have a short foreskin. My husband is the same way. His foreskin doesnt reach the end of his glans. Im hoping your doctor told you to retract because he thought your son was circumcised, otherwise he is not foreskin knowledgable despite having intact sons. The best bet is to leave the adhesions alone unless they start causing pain or are attached in a way that blocks the flow of urine. If that happens, then a steroid cream may be useful. Honestly though, they will likely fix themselves around puberty. This is the same advice I would give to a mom whose son had been circumcised loosely and refused.
             <br/>
             Questions to ask your self about your doctor
             <br/>
             Does he say there is an age your sons foreskins should be retractable?
             <br/>
             Does he say you should be retracting to clean, knowing your boys are intact?
             <br/>
             Does he make comments that make you think he wants you to circumcise?
             <br/>
             Does he recommend circumcision for minor issues?
             <br/>
             If any of those are yes, then he is not intact- friendly or knowledgeable.

           We  had both of our sons circumcised for a couple reasons. First, my dad was not and he wanted his sons to be. And most of all my wife worked at a hospital and a nursing home and took care of too many old men , lets just say it was not a good time for them or her. And yes I the dad went with my little firstborn baby to see this procedure done and to comfort him when he cried his eyes out. Well, he didnt even fuss so it must not have been too bad. Most of the time im sure its fine to let the skin alone but im sure glad mine is gone already instead of having to take it off for some reason later in life , sounds scary to me!! By the way, sexual performance is not diminished!! Doesnt look like my thoughts are going to be very popular though.

            <p>
             There is evidence to suggest that the lack of crying during a circumcision is actually a state of shock- much like how if your leg was severed you could still be awake and talking- our bodies go into some primal mode. Also, in relation to sexual performance, its great if you never had any issues with it, but you are lucky, as again there is evidence that shows a direct link to circumcision and erectile dysfunction (and why Viagra is so prominent in America). I am not arguing with you, as whats done is done, but there is information out there that addresses your points.

             Allan you cannot say sex is performance is not diminished because you have never had sex with an intact penis. also Ive worked in the medical field since 2006 in nursing homes and hospitals. theres nothing hard about having to clean an elderly mans intact penis. The only problem one will have is if they are uneducated about an intact penis. all you do is move the foreskin back, wipe, then put it back. it only takes about 2 seconds longer than cleaning a circumcised penis, if even that. if someone has a problem with doing that then they should not be working in that field. the intact men dont have anymore problems down there than the circd men do, in fact the intact men have healthier penises at that age and usually it still function very well while the circd men have penises that gave out sexually years before they even ended up in a nursing home. I thought the same way as your wife and you do until a medical professional who actually knew what he was talking about taught us how to care for an intact penis when I was going to school to get my license, and because of that I walked into my first job not falling into the traps and lies most the other people I worked for believed. its amazing how they can have the proof right in front of them and still  believe and defend the lies. luckily some of them werent so ignorant and learned from me that it wasnt  more difficult to care for an intact elderly man and it was actually less gross than dealing with a circd man.

                 @Brooke. What you are writing is baseless, fact-less garbage.  Im uncircumcised and I can last over an hour in bed with my wife.and she LOVES it!

                <p>
                 Please America, stop doing this to your infant boys.  It is not normal in most of the rest of non-Muslim world.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Im so glad I have a daughter and dont even have to think of the atrocities so many little boys are exposed to by their parents and the medical profession.

                 An ignorant Irish doctor convinced my mother to have my foreskin cut off in 1947, but it wasnt until I was 12 years old that I discovered this, and that my penis did not work as well as the other boys. I have always needed lube to have intercourse, and about 10 years ago I stopped being able to orgasm even after an hour of thrusting, though by then she had dried up, and told me to stop. My son is intact, and at 29 he has had no troubles with his penis. It is high time to ban the nasty procedure, which only serves to spoil sex, and make medics richer.

               I am male, but I like to have fully removed body hair. This means that what I have is both harder to get rid of than for most women and more plentiful than for most women, yet nearly all instruction of it and products are specifically geared towards them. So overall it is an expensive pain in the butt (often literally) to do, but if they had had a genetic treatment to prevent body hair in the first place before birth, I would say no and I think many would agree that it would be entirely immoral to do. Even though I have to go through such maintenance to do, the choice to be hairless is mine and in cant work the other way around, to alter someone and take away the choice of who they want to be (except when medically NECESSARY) is always wrong. Some of said hair has even turned into a medical issue , yet I still stand by that. I have coarse, guitar-string like hair, which is a good way to hurt someone when it has been pulled up onto your shaft from a circumcision. Fortunately it can be mitigated by epillation. But know that while it is currently legally your choice, it is not your choice what kinds of sex someone can have. After all, what does circumcision do other than deny someone the ability to frot?

             Then your sons should hold you down when you are old and feeble and forcibly cut part of your penis off.  Already circumcised?  Thats OK, they can trim a little more off.  Theres more-skin than foreskin.  And they can make up a bullshit reason about how amputating part of your penis is cleaner, healthier, etc

           Nine and a half months of carefully monitoring my diet and health to insure the growth of a beautiful, perfect, healthy baby.  Then, soon after birth, Im supposed to allow doctors to chop a piece off of him? That which can never be regrown or replaced?  No.

           I have a son, age 35, who is intact. He was born at home, but had mild respiratory distress at birth and spent 2 days in the NICU. While he was there, I witnessed a circumcision of another baby. The child screamed in agony until he ran out of breath and his little mouth formed an O but no sound came out. A mother knows the difference between a Im hungry cry or a pain cry. This baby screamed like he was being tortured, and he was. It was the most horrifying, barbaric thing I have ever witnessed in my life. I literally clutched my baby boy to my chest protectively and vowed that no one would EVER hurt my child like that if I could help it. I followed my conscience, even though I was a young mother, and I have never regretted it. It is HIS body, who am I to make a decision like that for him?

           My husband is intact and if we had a boy at anytime he would be intact as well.  I have known my husband all my life as we grew up together and I have never known and he hasnt told me of a problem he had being intact.  I will have to share this information to my daughter as they will be having kids soon so that they will be informed so they can make the correct decision for their boys, if they have any.

           I saw someone mention the ladies from SATC being appalled by Charlottes encounter with an uncircumcised penis. I just want to add that this reflects every conversation I have ever had with a friend on this topic. We are mid-20s women and most of us have only seen one or two uncircumcised penises, and Ive never heard a positive reaction. Im surprised that there are so many women here saying that their sons are happier in adulthood only because my male friends who arent circumcised have anxiety about it. Ive had friends tell me guys warned them out of being self-consious ahead of time that they are intact which is sad, but understandable considering the women I know stifle a negative response to it.
          </p>
          <p>
           All that being said, if it were my own child this issue would weigh heavily on my heart. I feel guilty that I find it unattractive while believing in leaving the body to its natural state. Certainly these feelings are deeply ingrained cultural beliefs. I appreciate every woman here who takes the time to educate herself, but  I also respect whatever decision they may make.
          </p>

           Just wanted to put another talking point out there.

             An erect penis looks the same in intact and circumsized.

                 It looks very very similar when erect. When its flaccid it just goes back in its little pouch like a travel umbrella. Despite the similar look, the function of an intact penis is FAR superior to a circumcised one.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After getting numerous back to back vaginal infections my gyno asked me if my partner was circumcised. She diagnosed me with vaginal micro tearing where the keratinized glans scrapes the walls of the vagina and causes tiny rips that get infected. When I moved to Europe I had my first intact partner and was really squeemish and scared of his penis. How dumb I was! It was the BEST sex of my life. I wrote it off as a fluke, had another intact partner, fireworks again! Went home for the summer, slept with a cut guy and BOOM. Infection city again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I am not suggesting that all womens bodies react the same way as mine, but the more I look into it, the more women I find that bashfully admit they have the same problem. It is not really something that we talk about that much though.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After having my eyes opened, I would say, let your boy make the decision about his own body. I too would have circumcised before I went to Europe and saw that the intact male body is not only normal, it is the best thing for natural, pain free, lube free, toy free sex

             I find it interesting that you say this, Phoebe. I am a 20 year old (which means I am a part of the younger generation which is the topic of discussion) and have discussed the topic of circumcision with my group of close male friends. First of all, I was surprised to learn that most of them were uncircumcised. But they were ALL very comfortable with their status, and all of them said that they didnt feel awkward or strange about being uncircumcised.
             <br/>
             I have had two sexual partners, my husband and my high school sweetheart. My first partner was uncircumcised, and I had nothing to compare it to. My husband is circumcised, and quite frankly, I often find sex uncomfortable with him an experience I never had with my first partner. I find the corona (the rim around the bottom of the head) is very irritating when there is no forskin acting as lubrication. My husband regrets that he is circumcised, and we did not circ our son for this reason.
             <br/>
             Even if a young boy is circumcised, I can guarantee you there is some other physical attribute that he is self-conscious about. So unless you intend to force your son to grow a six pack and allow him to undergo plastic surgery until he has no gripes about his appearance, then you cant justify circumcision on the grounds that he will be insecure intact.

             In our sons generation where 30-50% will be cut and 50-70% intact this should be a total non-issue. Even now if a guy leaves the US he may encounter women that think being cut is weird and unpleasant since all the guys theyve seen before were natural/normal. I dont see why it ever is  an issue honestly though, the 1st guy I was ever with (Im 33 now) was intact and I thought NOTHING of it but I guess some women are pretty shallow.

           This is a big issue in my house right now we are having a boy in 2 months, my husband is circumcised and wants to have our boy circumcised as well, but ever since I started looking into it I dont see the point.

           Are you determined to keep your son whole the way he is going to be born? You can reassure your husband that you love him, but this is one issue that you will not budge on. Be willing to compromise on other issues with your husband so that he does not feel cheated out all the time. If your husband will be the deciding factor in this issue, then ask your husband to prove to you that circumcision is necessary beyond a reasonable doubt, and that there will be no harm to your child. Ask your husband to do the research.

           I am a nurse (RN) and I can tell you the complication rate of infant circumcisions is higher than the public is lead to believe. While its true most boys dont die or lose their entire penis, although some do,  babies frequently hemorrhage, go into a catatonic state and refuse to nurse, develop buried penis, or suffer from meatal stenosis as a child or man. I personally know about a dozen males, young and old, who say they have a urine stream that shoots sideways every time. This is a common circumcision and all these males were circed.
           <br/>
           I frequently hear women say they circed their sons because either they are Christian or because of the lower STI rate. It clearly speaks in the New Testament (several books) that Christians are not required to circumcise. STDs are much higher in the US with a high male circ rate than in low circ rates areas such as Europe and South America. Clearly, a foreskin is not what is causing all the infections.
           <br/>
           I think about 40  50% of the baby boys born in my area are now left intact. Ive heard many stories from parents who did circumcise and now regret it but Ive yet to hear of a parent who didnt circ and regrets it.
           <br/>
           Why risk any problems for a surgical procedure unless its absolutely necessary?

             Amen sister.  If God gave boys &amp; men a circumcised penis, why are we questioning the almighty Creators creation?  Also, name one other animal besides humans that does this barbaric practice.
            </p>
            <p>
             What about the childs rights?  Shouldnt he be the one getting to decide about control over his own body in the same way that women should have the right to have control over their own bodies?
            </p>
            <p>
             Whenever I see a circumcised boy in a locker/change room (just want to be clear I am not intentionally seeking this out, but in close change room quarters it is impossible to avoid seeing), I feel so sorry and saddened for him that his parents did this to him.

           I have just recently found out how amazing my husband is. We are expecting our first child, whom happens to be a boy, in November. I was strung on what to do, as I had never seen a circumcised male, ever. With that, I thought that circumcision was easy, routine and standard. I really did not feel I had a choice. And then I did researchand watched a video. The video I watched was just so barbaric! I mean, they had this beautiful little baby tied to a table (arms and legs), with some nurse shoving a passy in his mouth to hush him and all they had done to numb the pain was place an ice pack over his little male parts. I could not even finish the video, I was floored. I was sobbing uncontrollably and I am so fortunate that the video and me turning to my husband saying, I am NOT paying out of pocket to torture my child was all the convincing my husband needed to decide the procedure was a waste of time and money. He did have some questions (as I) about whether it was clean, harder to clean or not, if it posed medical risk, if it had benefits, ect. We did some research, and the mixture between the research, the video, and the though that my son would have an open wound that would get pee and feces on it just made it seem like such a ludicrous option. I am so thankful to have a husband as understanding to me and my intuition.

           Im not American and seem to be in the minority here, but I have to say I much prefer a mans penis to be intact the way its meant to be. My husband is intact and his penis looks healthier? Less scarred? And I guess in that regard, much nicer (to me). So I guess I prefer an intact penis. Ive never been able to relate to women saying its gross. And speaking from previous experience, it just seems to work more the way its supposed to  I have had circumcised partners in the past who seem to have to resort to more workarounds to make sex pleasurable for themselves (require more foreplay before being touched, have trouble with premature ejaculation, or on the flip-side, seem desensitized). Ive known a number of men whove had to be circumcised as adults because of phimosis, and its unfortunate, but its definitely not a given for an intact man, men with that condition are in the minority.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anyway, Im pregnant now, and there is no way on gods green earth that I would circumcise my child, should I have a child born with a penis. Its completely barbaric and unnecessary and it makes my skin crawl thinking that parents would allow that to happen or even REQUEST the procedure for their children.

           I just cannot understand why anyone would want to enforce a wholly unnecessary medical procedure on anyone else, let alone a defenceless infant.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I am British and circumcision is really the exception here. I once had a boyfriend who had it, but I cannot compare his performance because its not a large enough sample size to be scientifically relevant. Anyone who misguidedly believes it is medically necessary should check out the majority of the worlds population. Thats a decent sample size!

           Im an American woman who didnt see an intact male until I was in my 20s and I have to say I would prefer an intact male partner if I had the choice. My husband is circd but our boys are not.

           The circumcision rate in the US is by far the highest in the Christian/western world.  Here in Canada up until the mid-1980s it used to be as high as in the US (but regrettably, this trend seems to be reversing a bit  not surprising given the conservative era were in), but is now over 80% against.  In Europe, circumcision is very uncommon nowadays.  I am so thankful that my parents decided against circumcision for me in the 1970s, when it was still in vogue.  I am flat out against it (including for religious reasons  may Jews are even against the practice [see:
           <a href="http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/" rel="nofollow">
            http://www.jewsagainstcircumcision.org/
           </a>
           ) unless it is absolutely necessary.  The nerve damage done to the penis makes me shudder any time I think of it.  If this were female circumcision (as is sickeningly still done in some places in the world), the absolute outrage would be unbelievable.  A word of wisdom, many doctors make statements in favour of circumcision without a shred of evidence to back up their statements.  Always question what a mainstream doctor says.

           I always wonder if a man who is intact requires circumcision due to problems, if those problems were not caused in infancy from forced retraction. Many parents are convinced by doctors to retract their babys foreskin. It is painful for the baby and can cause tears that adhere and creates problems in later life. I never allowed my son to be retracted by the pediatricians. Hes never had a problem and he is a man now. Hes never had a urinary tract infection and I never had difficulty cleaning him as a baby and toddler. Let your son enjoy his penis as he was meant to.

           Wow it is just awful what some people are saying here. This IS a personal decision and when parents are making the decision to circumcise (or not) it is because theyre trying to make the best decision for their child. You cannot judge ones situation unless youve lived it. This is just terribly depressing to read through these comments  So many of you should be ashamed of yourselves.

             Jen,
             <br/>
             The choice being made to cut off 50% of the erogenous flesh of someone ELSES genitals is anything but a PERSONAL choice.  You say you cannot judge ones situation unless youve lived it is so true.  That is precisely why we should never cut the healthy genitals of a child due to information gleaned from Joe or Jane Blows feelings or situation.  The people on this site should never be ashamed of relaying information concerning the health and wellbeing of the boys and men who were lucky enough to be spared the atrocity that is genital cutting. I applaud these people for trying to educate others who may not realize the very real life-long physical, psychological, and sexual damage that affects the man AND his sexual partners.  Im 42 male and circumcised here in America -land of the free???

               Education is one thing, name calling is another. Tell me when using shame has ever been an effective motivator? Do you shame your child in hopes of better behaviour? Shame your friend hoping theyll lose weight? Shame your spouse into cooking a meal more to your preference? Thats the point I was trying to make. I would never talk to someone with an opposing view to mine like some of the people have tried to talk to others here. Its disgraceful.

           Im from the UK and until very recently Id barely considered circumcision, its just something Jewish and Muslim people do (quite a minority in our society). I do however know about female genital mutilation being a former midwife. Now I have researched male circumcision I am so so shocked, its just as horrifying as fgm. I cannot believe that an advanced society  the US lets this happen to their baby boys! As a midwife and a mother I can absolutely assure you that infants do feel pain, in fact they feel it much more than adults  they are hyper-sensitive (

           ) What happens to a baby at the beginning of life is important, setting up his neural pathways for life. A newborn baby should be bonding with his parents and learning how to feed, not be taken away, strapped to a specially-designed restraint, maybe given some anesthetic, and a have medical person cut of part of his penis. There is an enormous  ELEPHANT in your society, we do not harm babies, we cherish and nurture them!

           Please do not take something from your sons that can never be replaced. I am so pleased rates of circumcision are falling, society will be more humane for it.

           My mom recently asked me what my husband and I will choose to do if we happen to have a boy (waiting to find out at the birth). when i told her we had briefly discussed it and we were leaning towards leaving it be. I just couldnt imagine that man had evolved in a way that could be dangerous to his health. she started to pressure me towards circ. and we ended up having this stupid long conversation about it. after reading this its nice to know my gut decision was right.
          </p>
          <p>
           so now my husband and I have a response to that strange question. if its a boy my husband gets to decide if our son has a circ. and if its a girl I get to decide. Because thats how ridiculous we think it is. I could never cut the hood of of my daughters clitoris why would I do that to my son?

           Male circumcision is more sexually damaging in terms of the number of sex nerves excised than any form of FGM.  Virtually all sexual sensation comes from the foreskin. All circumcised penises are  dysfunctional, scarred and crippled, and depending on the severity of the cut, can leave the penis totally numb.  AS someone who was circumcised without my informed consent at 14, I know it destroys sexual pleasure.  Neurological analysis of the glans and foreskin has confirmed this.
          </p>
          <p>
           IT is not a medical procedure, has no medical benefits and is a barbaric, anachronistic act of sexual suppression no different from FGM.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is worse than rape. Rape causes psychological damage.  Forced genital cutting causes psychological and physical damage.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you want to teach your son that consent is important , dont start by letting him know that his wasnt.  Do not expect any circumcised man to abide by anti-rape laws when the law does not protect him.

           Under the Better to be Done as an Infant section, I wish you had addressed the claim that there is a greater risk for complications in getting the procedure done as an adult (or after the age of 1 year old). I still would not circumcise an infant, but this sounds like a legitimate concern Ive heard other parents have. They are afraid that if their son decides to get circumcised later, that he could die or have other problems from the procedure. It can be a tough decision to make; parents who make the decision dont always make it as lightly as we think, and some find it is a tough decision to NOT make.
