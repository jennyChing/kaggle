           A little girl was confiscated from her loving parents because they smoked marijuana.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hills two-year-old daughter Alex, short for Alexandria, was removed from her parents home last November for neglectful supervision following her parents admission that they smoked pot after she was put to bed, reported

           This is a truly heartbreaking example of the states atrocious war on drugs.
          </p>
          <p>
           The war on drugs is nothing more than a license to destroy innocent lives.

          <p>
           To all those who enforce such immoral and unjust laws against humanity, how can you sleep at night?

                   Taxpayers actually pay more for the death sentence than life in prison and a firing squad isn't legal anymore so yes .... life sounds good.

I'm honestly confused here.  How can extensive holding, feeding, and upkeep of an individual cost more than simply doing away with them?

                   Raymond, the problem is they don't do during squads. They use crazy expensive drugs. There have been studies done and I'm just as curious as to why as you are.

                   Raymond Fillingame   Because every prison has a charge for each service they provide, and killing is right there at the most expensive, maybe it's because the staff have to go through extensive therapy. But I doubt she will make it to a death squad prior to the inmate getting her first. There are a lot of women in prison who lost there kids to foster care, and would love to make a point with those who abuse kids, on any level. All government entity's charges by each of the services they provide.

The CPS in Michigan neglected to get a bunch of kids into foster care and the oldest, a 12 year old, killed another child. The kid is now being tried as an adult for first degree murder, as I write this. The CPS worker said it herself that she was lazy, and hesitated, she believes too long. The kid thought he would get the death sentence because he was suicidal, and thats why he carried out such a bloody assault on a 8 year old he invited to play at the playground. I do believe the state is guilty here, and now this child will be caught up in the system for the rest of his life. A 12 year old brain is not even half way through maturation, so far from making adult decisions.

                 I remember this case as I run in CPS reform circles-was a couple of years ago?  I remember wanting to SLAP ALL DCS INVOLVED!!!  I get involved in those types of cases because I fought my own fight with CO DHS in 1999 not because of alcohol, drugs, neglect, or abuse but in, in the social worker's own words, because she "simply didn't like us," because my husband was disabled and I am a veteran.  Quote:  "You WILL abuse your children because YOU WERE TAUGHT TO KILL!"  She obviously did not look into what I did in the military:  I was a computer operator at Cheyenne Mtn!  That's all right-the dumbass got fired for it.  I had to fight for three weeks to get her back and she had a severe case of untreated thrush because the dumbass kept the foster mom from taking my little girl to the doctor.  I had her to the doctor IMMEDIATELY upon getting her home.  Poor tyke was crying in pain and refusing to eat, and had actually lost weight-dangerous for a newborn.  Today, she is a beautiful, well-adjusted 15 year old young woman-and she told me today, she has never been abused, lol!  I still had to fight for another 6 months to get them to let us go home-my husband's pych eval kept coming up "missing".  He had to go through it three times.  Guess who was taking it?  The new social worker put a stop to the dumb shit, God Bless her, by going to the psych worker's office and picking up the report herself!  The first two times, apparently it didn't say what the first social worker wanted it to say, lol!

                   I am glad it all worked out for you and most of all for you baby girl...I had some issues when my younger son was little too, though not as extreme as yours, thankfully, it was still very frustrating...first they had his medication at the school and I told them I work 60/70 hr weeks you see his meds everyday when he gets down to 10 pills leave me a voice mail or a quick call so I can make sure he doesn't run out they wouldn't work will me so he'd run out and I decided to keep his meds at home and give them in the morning before I sent him to school...they called CPS and report medical neglect....another report was they called and reported he was being hit at home because there were knots on his head....it was his skull..his Dad and half-brother have the same skull shape on the back of their heads to...and since that didn't work...they reported that there must be drugs in the home because my so would stretch his head over one should and pop his kneck and then do the other side....this time I had to take him to do x-rays, scans and drug testing....this was the last straw for me and the school got a peice of my mind....and I told them I don't do drugs my children do not do drugs and if anyone I know values our friendship they don't either...amoung a few other this...they never took him because there was nothing they could do and nothing wrong with either of my boys ever but they tried until they looked stupid....

                   Rebecca Pouncey Williams Schools are terrible about those things.  The teacher slapped my daughter across the face in kindergarten-and blamed it on my husband.  Earlier that year, she had banged my daughter's face into the desk-then said she didn't understand why Tricia was crying.  When I saw the huge bruised knot on her forehead, the bitch said my daughter did it to herself!  Tricia is autistic, but high-functioning-I still wonder if it didn't stem from her trauma in foster care.  Course you can guess who got the blame-we did!  She wasn't fired, but moved to another school.  One time, Tricia was having a terrible migraine and I took her to the hospital.  We do have a family history of brain tumors, so they did an mri and I was so relieved when it showed nothing.  I told the teacher about it, and she laughed and said, "Oh, there's NOTHING in Tricia's head!"  Made me want to slap her.  Both girls have brought back lice from this school, and this year, my younger daughter contracted mono.  I was told that yes, there are SEVERAL students there with it, they do keep them with fevers, during their MOST contagious times, but "it's no more dangerous than a common cold!"  Excuse me, but I have never known anyone to die from a common cold!  They have from mono.  I told them, "You do realize I grew up in the 80's and 90's, right?  When there was a severe outbreak of it and several people DIED from it?"  I still wonder how a nine year old could contract the Kissing Disease.  No quicker way to get Momma up in arms than to tell her the potentially deadly disease her child contracted at school is no big deal.

                   Laurie Merrigan Fight em to the hilt.  Look up Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997-foreknowledge is forearmed.  Page 7 states that the state will get a kickback for every child adopted out.  Once the state began to run low on adoptable children, they knew their kickbacks were about to be threatened.  That was when they made child abuse and neglect definitions so nebulous ANYONE could be charged with ANYTHING, even though you may have done nothing to your children.  I will never forgive Bill Clinton for that one.  Once they realized Suzanne Shell had informed me of this act and I was better prepared, that was one of the things that got my daughter back to me so quickly.  Another was the social worker's flagrant disregard of court orders:  I was a nursing mom and she had refused to allow me to go with my daughter.  So the court ordered her to come and get my milk and take it to my daughter everyday-which she did not do.  I began sneaking my milk to my daughter through the foster mom on visitations, instructing her to shake it up because it does separate, (not pasteurized, of course) and kept pumping for my daughter.  (I, of course, contracted the thrush from my daughter!)  I took two weeks worth of frozen milk into the hearing, intending to force the social worker to take the milk to my daughter through the judge.  Instead, my lawyer, bless her heart, held up the milk and said, "Your Honor, my client has been pumping like a FIEND for her daughter!"  My girl was ordered home that day, and you should have seen the look on the social worker's face, lol!  Priceless!  I'm glad it happened that way, or I still have a bad feeling I would have been burying my daughter instead of raising her into the beautiful young woman she is today, someone who is HIGHLY protective of all younger children!  I have held nothing back from her, she knows everything that happened.

                   I also found out in Tricia's case she didn't hardly get any recess that first year because the teacher was always dragging her by her arm to the principle's office for any little thing.  I had wondered what the bruises on her arms all year were from, but figured that she might have been getting them from recess.  After the slapping incident, one of her classmates and his grandmother spilled the beans on the teacher to me-about EVERYTHING.  Tricia couldn't really talk till she was 7 so she couldn't tell me what was going on-she suffered from echolalia and had to go through speech therapy for many years, part of her autism.  She was held back, so I sent her to another school than have her suffer another year with that teacher.  When she had to go back to that school the next year, she was apprehensive, and halfway through the year they sent her to a special needs class in another school, where she spent the rest of her elementary years, thank God.  She came to LOVE school there, and didn't want to leave when it came time for her to do so!

                   Misty Henry Wow...that is crazy...but I do know that autistic children and those with other issues that prevent them from being able to communicate are subject to abusive behavior from worthless teachers who obviously should not be in that profession...my step-son will be 23 this year, he is autistic and he still can't really talk, it's mostly gestures...when was in school in the same school that my son was in, he was always getting injured on the playground from bruises to broken bones...they always said he fell or whatever and we could never really know for sure what happened.

                   Rebecca Pouncey Williams Very true, and I have a second autistic child, my son.  He has a little trouble with his speech but not as bad as Tricia has it.  He's more of a chronic head-banger and chewer.  Has been since day 1.

                 Why give her the death penalty for smoking weed after her daughter goes to bed? Shit. I'm a father. And I smoke weed. When my daughter goes to bed. I go outside and light up a fat one. And I love my daughter to death. And the only way CPS is ever gonna take her away from me. Is prying her from dead hands. I'll pray for this couple. And smoke a fat one for them.

                 Im a victim of cps. I was removed from an abusive mother. Then spent years being moved from abusive foster home to abusive foster home. All along being seperated and moved hundredsof miles from my very loved sisters. Then placed with a family that didnt give 2 shits about me that gained adoption over me, kicked me out of the house at 15 just 2 years after adopting me. I roamedthe streetsbefore agood friend let me stay with him. I found work, then spent the next years of my life working and being homeless. Im just now getting back in touch with my sisters. Its been a long hard road. Often foster families are just people or families that apply for foster family to mooch the thousands of dollars plus medical benefits they get from the state for taking kids in every year. The more kids they take in, the more money they get. When I was in "the system" the going rate for a kid was $500 per month plus benefits with a maximum of 6 kids per month. There used to be years of schooling and a degree involved with becoming cps. Now its any shmoo that is will to take a 6 month paid course. Hardly a qualification for a person reponsible for a child's "protection". I actually had a good case worker, usually even with a degree a case workermay not even have control over which family a child is placed with.Usually it's done by a lottery. A case worker is only able to remove a child from a home. Sometimes that involves red tape, especially when politics are involved. Many case workers give meaning to the phrase, "Give someone power over a persons life and they will use it." Also a available surprising fact is that many case workers dont have children of their own. That should be a requirement. Also bringing back the degree that was once required for case work would hugely help. As it stands now, joe down at the tavern can get into case work if he is willing to take a 6 month course he will get paid for. Then he will be over worked and have very little over sight with supreme authority over the caees he has provided a supervisor doesnt play politics with his cases to get promoted orprove his power over the cases under him. This particular case with this girl being killed in foster care is playing far tooften in the same exact scenario.

                   Wow!  I often wondered why foster kids seem to have so many run-ins with bad foster families.  :(  My husband once remarked that he felt it was odd we take kids away from families with struggles and pay someone else to raise them.  He said, "why don't we spend money on the actual kids' families to help them cope or get their lives together rather than paying other people to care for the kids?"  Obviously, it's not that simple when the bio-family is abusive, but there's got to be a better way, right?

                   A sister of mine was as well a victim of cps "protection" after being molested in one home, neglected in another, she was placed in an over crowded home because of a lazy case worker that didnt want to drive the extra distance to a home that was better suited for her, she was brutally attacked after several months by a vengeful foster giver for playing the television toloud and was hit upside the face by a hot skillet and still bares the scars of the incident. I travelec dB through many foster homes and met many different children from varing backgrounds. One was severely undet

                   Rweight because the previous foster family had starved him, then beat himfor trying to sneak food into his room. 2 girls that wrre sisters had been reunited in a foster home after seperation only to be molested multiple times by the foster father. Ne was so violent because he had been brain washed by his foster givers to hate white people. He had to removed and supposedly was placed in a "looney" facility for children. One girl I met was so tramatized that she barely talkec to anyone, she had been repeated raped by her foster fathet. The foster mother didnt report for fear they would arrest her husband and take all the othrt kids away. She was 11 years of age. One home I was in used strugulation as a form of punishment to brutalize the children their. Sometimes it was shocking the type of abuse we were subjected to in these families. The parental instints just arent there. The foster families have no connection to the children they foster. Its almost lime we wete pets they didnt want but uad to take care of.

                   I always tell people that if they want to know what goes on in a particular place, ask the people that are in these places. Want to know what children experience in these places, ask the children, not those responsible for thei care, cuz it would look bad if they report anything other than steller care. Fact is more children than not are being brutalized in these homes. Sure there are great stories, but where are the horror stories? Everyone knows they are there, but turn a blind eye and a deaf ear, cuz its a, ways easier to pretend you dont know and have to do something if you do. The story above only came to light because the circumstance ended in the murder of the child and the parents were still actively seeking custody and would not have remained silent, so the story was forced into the open. what about the girl that I met that had been repeated raped, what happened to the family that brutalized her. The father was of course arrested and charged, the other children were removed from the home. The story was p, asterec all over the news so people were made aware of the lack of over sight and the long period of brutalization of this little girl??????? NOPE!!!!! No news, no papers, no story!!!!! Swept under the rug and the little girl lives with the scars the rest of her life.  I once wanted to see a movie,, but was skeptical ofthe reviews, so did I wait for more reviews to decide to see it....???? NOPE....!!!! I walked to the sourcd, THE MOVIE THEATRE,  I stood outside the exit door of the room it wasplaying and as, ed everyone that had been in there what they thought of the movie.After getting less than average reviews, I elected to watch it and another movie. Afterwards I realized that the people were right it was actually quite lacking in well any kind of material. The other movie I watched was because a few of the other people from the lacking movie had actually said, dont watch this movie, watch that movie instead! That movie was AWESOME!  The moral is if you want to know about a particu.ar situation, go to the source. Hopefully in bringing the these stories to light we can bring more accountablity to those who are accountable. Lets start charging ghe CPS workers who oversee these children with negligence and child endangerment, by placing them with people who would commit these acts. The man that raped that little girl had to hqve had signs he was a rapist. Im sure there had been a fea minor incidents prior or maybe even worse, other raped children that were over looked, because the CPS worker wanted a light case load and didnt want to report the incident because a mountain Of paperwork would be required. If you ask me if the worker knew there was a risk,  the worker should be charged with accessory. If you want to have a real accou tablity, then dont charge the worker,charge a collegue with the acceszory. That wou, d bring instant accou tablity. SELF-IMPOSED!

                   actualy now they can have a child place where they want them. my case worker knowing I didn't like her placed my daughter with her own family and laughed and asked you are ok with this? I said no she sent me forms of instructions but no form to actualy fill out when I asked for another she replied I was just being difuclt and unruly so I drove down there and complained my daughter was moved to another home

                   Clarissa Fowler, I was homeless at the time and suing CPS was the lest of my worries. Besides I tried ar some point ro get my records, but a mile red tape was wrapped around the process that made it nearly impossible to get even a single file.

                 Some ppl complaining about the journalist for a repost of an old story.  This story is NOT old.  It happens all the time, in every state, every year, sometimes more than once, and in addition to this, there are hundreds of complaints every year, in every state regarding accusations of abuse and neglect by foster parents for decades.  And it's been getting worse due to budget cuts and the lack of quality families who are willing to foster.  Instead, states increased the payout to foster parents to foster, so to lure more to foster, but it still attracts the scum of the earth in many cases to apply.  The problem lies with state screening and also still, lack of foster homes, so states are often likely to accept anyone who applies as long as their homes meet the bare minimum for safety and they put on a good facade.  The worst states for these types of cases are the Red States who are often pro-birth, but are anti-life.  Many can care less about funding any services that help children after they come out of the womb, including those in foster care.

                 The problem here is mainly the foster care system not being consistent with the welfare of the children they place into these foster homes and the checks that should be done on the foster care parents.  This is absolutely atrocious and the blood of the little girl is on the hands of those in charge of the foster care system as well as this horrific excuse for a human being that killed that innocent little girl.  Her parents may have been smoking pot after she fell asleep, but it is any different than the parent who drinks a legal glass of wine after their children are asleep or even at the dinner table?  My heart goes out the parents of that beautiful little angel.

                 I hope the parents were at least the ones to choose if she was taken off life support or not. If not, that's just wrong! After all of the states neglect in this case, they better not have removed her so they didn't have to pay for her to be on it! They should sue the hell out of CPS!

                   Quit doing the lazy whining fuckers work for them. IF they can take the time to bitch about there not being enough intel they can take the time to research a case. Nothing against you Janey but they'd rather insult me and talk a line of shit than actually do something with themselves. The comment section is nothing more than their form of entertainment. Probably the only socializing any of'em do.

                 I don't like that some parents smoke pot around their kids, I've even known some that told me they blew pot smoke in their child's face, they needed their child taken away. I have no problem with pot smokers as long as they don't smoke it around me. Now, on the darker side whom ever hired this foster parent needs horse whipped along side of a good a$$ beating with the foster parent. Some times it's just better to leave the kids with the parents or family

                   Jesse D Wilkinson, you need to read what I stated. I never said this couple was doing that. In fact I said, "sometimes it's better to leave the children with their parents or family." I also said "I've know parents that said they've blown pot smoke in their children's face"

                   Jesse D Valcore  Dawn didn't say they were. I don't agree with her I think pot is fine around kids, from growing to blowing. I do agree though anyone that blows smoke in their kids face should be horse whipped too though for incredulous stupidity. Kids should be allowed to eat it though. Especially high cbd marijuana, rather more particularly no one should have a problem that the seizure kid eats a cookie that has a little pot butter in it and it keeps his seizures at bay. Teenagers don't need recreational anything when it comes to something you intake from candy and pop to alcohol and pot, anything with repeated releases of endorphins is going to be at least habit forming if not addictive and who NEEDS that lol. I'm a pot smoker hate that I have to smoke it and can't just eat it. The fiber is good for you, the seeds have 16 different amino acid chains (proteins), and the chemicals found in the plant are known NOT to harm you. Burning anything creates carcinogens and albeit 9 is far less that the 10s of thousands in a cigarette, the inhalation of a carcinogen is still unwise. To me, the state has no place(right) taking a child from it's parents let alone housing it. If immediate family members such as the grandparents as well as any brothers and sisters of the two parents didn't see a problem or did and reported it they should have come together as a family and addressed the issue they had. If someone in the community reported they should have notified other family members of the problem and if they had no immediate family then the community should band together to address the issue, and still at no point in time so long as the child is being taken care of would anyone have the right to take the kid away.

                   I'm with ya.  And what really amazes me is that some parents will actually consume alcohol - OR even light up a Cigarette!  Both of which are magnitudes worse than marijuana.  Hell, people even drink AND smoke in front of children in public.  We need to get serous with this War On Drugs.  Let's go back to prohibition, outlaw tobacco, and arrest anyone and everyone caught doing anything with either.  /snark

                   Johann Ivan Quite the contrary I believe we're better off legalizing just about everything 'cept crack meth and heroin, and even then only think the dealers should be the ones targeted, junkies should be treated like victims. My point was anything can be addictive and moderation is key with anything. Both are magnitudes worse than marijuana too, hope you weren't being facetious there as well. I think being drunk around your kids is extremely irresponsible but whatever, I'm sure my viewpoint will be knocked. I know that I'm pretty normal when I'm high, and incapable of much if I'm truly drunk, which is a rarity only drink enough to catch a buzz usually.

                   A little girl is dead because.. because why?  Because society, in its infinite ignorance and stupidity, maintains mainstream acceptance of the absurd notion that marijuana is somehow "bad", while peddling $hit like alcohol and tobacco as if their were gifts from Heaven.  That's why.  Root cause, silly crap like that.
