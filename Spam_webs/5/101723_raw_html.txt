      Humanity's interest in healing and being healed has never been higher -- but the success rate of healing -- meaning, real, lasting healing -- is still abysmally low. The emphasis is on managing symptoms, while ignoring the fundamental disease that
      <span class="Italic">
       creates
      </span>
      those symptoms. To truly cure what ails us, we need to understand what makes us sick -- and what can heal us.

      Popular healing methods have all failed miserably in addressing the real problem. Even alternative, or New Age, healing methods, which
      <span class="Italic">
       recognize
      </span>
      the role of love in healing, don't
      <span class="Italic">
       provide

      love of healing quality and quantity. The best we get is "Love Lite" -- it may whet the appetite, but doesn't heal.

      Why? We're experiencing an overall breakdown of intimacy in our culture.
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      What happened to love and intimacy? In modern society, selfishness rules. But at the same time, it practically rules love out. Or at least ruins it. People hurt themselves and their loved ones by acting egotistically, not lovingly, in love. And unfortunately, negative experience created by lack of love is thought of
      <span class="Italic">
       as
      </span>
      love. Twisted love, dysfunctional love, but love nonetheless. Tragic error, that -- because if relationship and love are associated with pain, we get fear of
      <span class="Italic">
       love
      </span>
      .
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      Love is the great healer. But what if we suffer from fear of love? Then obviously, that makes healing difficult.

      We hire loveless (or love-poor) caregivers, hoping to mend the broken heart careless love left behind.

      And what about a psychotherapist? Psychotherapists have an extremely high suicide rate. Most of them are absolutely

      Fortunately, dissatisfaction with modern medicine and psychology has helped raise people's consciousness about illness. It is generally recognized, at last, that illness is a complex physical, emotional, even
      <span class="Italic">
       spiritual
      </span>
      problem. Such is the holistic nature of health: body, mind, spirit.
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      That is, potentially, a great step forward. It opens the door for greater understanding of the core importance of
      <span class="Italic">
       love
      </span>
      in the healing process. And it has given rise to a groundswell of "alternative" healing methods.
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      To their credit, many alternative therapies have even seen that the key issue in both psychology and spirituality is
      <span class="Italic">
       love
      </span>
      . However, few healers have integrated the crucial importance of
      <span class="Italic">

      </span>
      into their methods, or into their recommendations to their clients.

      Have you heard the term "professional ethics"? Strange as it sounds, modern professional ethics virtually prohibits healers from giving Great Love. Why? Because in the popular mind, "Big Love kindles big egotism." And of course, unleashing egotism on one's client would be terribly inappropriate. (The only place it's "socially acceptable" to be egotistical is in one's private life, with friends and family.)
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      To put it plainly, here is the usual party line:
     </p>
     <p class="IndentItal">
      "Once a personal relationship begins it is impossible for your healer to act in the capacity of therapist. His or her impartiality and ego-less behavior towards you will by necessity end."

     <p class="SubHead">
      Monstrous professional detachment in reaction to monstrous ego
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      The concern is, and this concern is understandable enough, that when people are deeply involved in a relationship, they become more reactive. Therefore, it is presumed that professional healers can
      <span class="Italic">
       only
      </span>
      stay on "good behavior" by staying
      <span class="Italic">
       out
      </span>
      of love, by maintaining what is called professional detachment. They believe they would hurt their clients if they loved them more.
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      Thus, professional detachment is "required" by the (presumed) inevitability of egotistical behavior in those who invest big in love. Professional detachment rules out Great Love, and calls for no love at all, or at best Love Lite -- all to pre-empt the threat of egotism in love.
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      Admittedly, egotism, loss of objectivity, etc.,
      <span class="Italic">
       that
      </span>
      is not healing. It is not healing because it is unloving. But if we're talking about things of ego, are we still talking about love? No.
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      Unfortunately, in this world where ego rules, people cannot distinguish love from selfishness! That terrible confusion is the sad cornerstone upon which the satanic super-virtue known as professional detachment was built. How
      <span class="Italic">
       horrible
      </span>
      , to admit that Great Love is the Great Healer, but then, at the same time, think that Great Love is
      <span class="Italic">
       harmful

      ! That's insane. As a healer, you need to help the people get over this terrible contradiction:

This behavior and set of feelings was first described by Sigmund Freud who coined the term 'transference' to describe it. The process itself is a very real possible side effect of psychotherapy.

      Similarly, people love to be "healed" -- even to be healed
      <span class="Italic">
       over and over
      </span>
      for the same malady. Now healed again, they crow, "My healer is so good, he's healed my headache problem

       hundreds
      </span>
      of times!"
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      So today, a healer can say to the client, "You're all better." And for the moment, the client could actually believe it, more or less. But tomorrow they could begin to think of themselves as sick again -- and return to the condition of being sick.

      Because their "healings" don't -- and can't -- provide lasting well-being, people become addicted to an endless search for new and hopefully more effective therapies. From conventional medicine, patients often demand new prescriptions, even elective surgeries. And when they turn to alternative healing, the menu of options is nearly endless. To list a

       few

      That's a pretty corny little cornucopia, if that's our idea of how to get well. Anyone with half a brain can create a theoretical model that
      <span class="Italic">
       sounds
      </span>
      effective, and anyone with half a brain might buy it. Deep desperation and cluelessness make people willing to buy products they don't need, and that are unlikely to work. All you have to do is convince them that this will solve a problem they have. For example:
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText indentsmaller">
      "Basic DNA introduces ThetaHealing(tm) techniques and focuses on activating the 12 strands of DNA within each participant. The chronos, or youth and vitality chromosome is activated, the telomeres are strengthened to reverse the aging process, and students experience an opening to the Unconditional Love of the Creator."
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      Routinely, with alternative healing methods, people are led to expect magical relief and rescue for their money. But the proof is in the pudding. Or is it?
     </p>
     <p class="BodyText">
      This clueless world has no real idea what good health truly
      <span class="Italic">
       is
      </span>
      . Therefore, people tend to construe temporary relief of a single symptom as a successful healing -- "proving," presumably, the efficacy of the healer, the healing method, etc. It all adds up to this big picture of promiscuity and dysfunctionality, getting nowhere.

      <span class="Bold">
       Answer A:

      It's absolutely better to have nothing than to have something that's completely frustrating you, constantly reminding that you really are hopeless.

      </span>
      that penny. And if they can't take more than that, must they be condemned to have nothing? So you become passionate in your conviction that Love Lite is

      Healers, and I've had contact with many, generally grow more dysfunctional in love as they go along. They tend to hide in their work from deeper, vulnerable love. They become encrusted with theory and belief. The result is atrophy and dysfunction. Ten years down the road from when they started, the usual healer is less ready for love than ever. And in another ten years, they'll be less ready again. Such is the reality of the situation. Usually; not necessarily.

      The person may think, "I'm progressing socially, because instead of staying home, I'm venturing out and exchanging energy with my clients." But can one honestly say, "If I walk around the block once a day, I'll eventually be an Olympic champion -- or at least physically fit"? Absolutely
      <span class="Italic">
