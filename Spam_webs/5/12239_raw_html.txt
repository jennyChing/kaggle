   Free Verse
  </h2>
  <hr/>
  Poetry that is based on the irregular rhythmic CADENCE or the
recurrence, with variations, of phrases, images, and syntactical
patterns rather than the conventional use of METER. RHYME may or
may not be present in free verse, but when it is, it is used with
great freedom. In conventional VERSE the unit is the FOOT, or the
line; in free verse the units are larger, sometimes being
paragraphs or strophes. If the free verse unit is the line, as it
is in Whitman, the line is determined by qualities of RHYTHM and
thought rather than FEET or syllabic count.
  <p>
   Such use of CADENCE as a basis for POETRY is very old. The poetry
of the Bible, particularly in the King James Version, which
attempts to approximate the Hebrew CADENCES, rests on CADENCE and
PARALLELISM. The Psalms and The Song of Solomon are noted examples
of free verse. Milton sometimes substituted rhythmically
constructed VERSE paragraphs for metrically regular lines, notably
in the CHORUSES of
   <i>
    Samson Agonistes
   </i>
   , as this example shows:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   But patience is more oft the exercise
   <br/>
   Of Saints, the trial of thir  fortitude,
   <br/>
   Making them each his own Deliver,
   <br/>
   And Victor over all
   <br/>
   That tyranny or fortune can inflict.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Walt Whitman's
   <i>
    Leaves of Grass
   </i>
   was a major experiment in cadenced
rather than metrical VERSIFICATION. The following lines are
typical:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   All truths wait in all things
   <br/>
   They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
   <br/>
   They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon.
   <br/>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
   Matthew Arnold sometimes used free verse, notably in "Dover Beach."
But it was the French poets of the late nineteenth century
--Rimbaud, Laforgue, Viele-Griffln, and others--who, in their
revolt against the tyranny of strict French VERSIFICATION,
established the Vers libre movement, from which the name free verse
comes.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the twentieth century free verse has had widespread usage by
most poets, of whom Rilke, St.-John Perse, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound,
Carl Sandburg, and William Carlos Williams are representative. Such
a list indicates the great variety of subject matter, effect and
TONE that is possible in free verse, and shows that it is much less
a rebellion against traditional English METRICS than a modification
and extension of the resources of our language.
