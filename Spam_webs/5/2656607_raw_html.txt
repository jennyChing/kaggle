          (Ever since new airport security procedures went into effect in  late October, the Transportation Security Administration has been at the  center of controversy. The combination of enhanced image screening with  invasive patdowns for those who opt out has rankled civil liberties  advocates and some of the flying public. John Pistole, the head of the  TSA, is a 26-year veteran of the FBI  an expert in counterterrorism  and for six years the bureaus deputy director. As TSA administrator  since July, he finds himself having to defend the new measures. James  Fallows and Jeffrey Goldberg spoke with Pistole on Monday. An edited  version of the interview is below; their posts about the conversation  are

          <strong>
           James Fallows
          </strong>
          : Id like to start with a question both Jeff  and I have raised, which is the whole question of the balance between  security, on the one hand, and liberty and privacy concerns, on the  other. Is it TSAs job to set that balance? Or how do you think that  balance is set?
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           John Pistole
          </strong>
          : The way I  view it is for TSA to develop the security protocols that afford the  best security, while recognizing that there is a balance. The best  security would be something way beyond what were doing.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Jeffrey Goldberg
          </strong>
          : The best security would be to just not allow people on planes. Thats perfect security.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          :  Thats risk elimination. And were not in the risk-elimination  business, were in risk mitigation, informed by the latest intelligence,  informed by our friends [in the intelligence agencies], and informed by  the results of our covert testing.
          <em>
           [ed  if you are in the risk mitigation business, you have to weigh the cost against the risk mitigated. And cost applies not only to money, but to the damage your risk mitigation activities could do on their own. This guy is NOT in the risk mitigation business, he is in the destroy America quickly business.]
          </em>
          <br/>
          Those  things inform judgments and actions and then we take that information   I take that information  and then ask the experts how can we address  these threats? They come up with different things based on all the  information they have, and then they make a recommendation, and then  its up to me to say, OK, does that exceed what I think is appropriate  in terms of privacy?
          <br/>
          So thats my  responsibility. To say, does this give us security, without violating  something that would be a Fourth Amendment issue? Thats what I did in  this situation [the latest controversy]  being informed by my prior  background [with the FBI], and seeing this as different from a  law-enforcement Fourth Amendment search, for example on the pat-down,  and the privacy of the AIT (the controversial scanner).
          <em>
           [ed  oh, so the 4th amendment only applies to law enforcement.]
          </em>
          <br/>
          How  do we go about deploying this privacy screening? Separate officer,  separate room, not retaining the images. Youve seen these posters, and  you realize, its not as graphic (as has been reported). A lot of the  media reporting showed these graphic images, and they rotated through  360 degrees so you get almost a crotch shot  thats not what these are.  A lot of informed people describe these, I think in some of your  writing, as the naked machine, or the porno

          <strong>
           Fallows

         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Goldberg
          </strong>
          :  Fallows is very statesmanlike.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          :  I thought of bringing something in that actually was pornographic. I  could say to you, then, This is porno, this is not. Ill recognize it  when I see it.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Goldberg
          </strong>
          : Exactly, the Supreme Court standard.  Do  you agree with the civil libertarian view that airports  not just  because of the TSA  but airports have become these Fourth  Amendment-free zones? This is the fundamental concern, that youre  giving up your Fourth Amendment rights when you buy a ticket.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          : I dont agree with that. But I do agree with the  difference between what most people think of in terms of a reasonable  search-and-seizure for purposes of law enforcement, versus a  public-safety administrative search. I dont know if people are drawing  that distinction, either, from a legal standpoint or a practical  application. I think people dont look at the public safety aspect. They  look at it strictly from  as I did for almost 27 years (in the FBI)   a law enforcement search perspective, in which I need probable cause,  and Ive got to be reasonable in that search.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Goldberg
          </strong>
          :  It is true that you now have more power as a TSA administrator to  search people without probable cause than you ever had as an FBI  official.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          : Oh sure, yeah. If  people take an affirmative act of engaging in, in this case, aviation   they want to get on a plane  theyre taking an affirmative act to do  that. Then, yes, there is authority to do the administrative search for  public safety purposes. As Ive said a number of times, I think  reasonable people could disagree as to the precise technique used on  each person. So for you, it may be patting around the knees or the  armpits. You might be sensitive there. For others, it is groins. For  women, it is breasts, for which procedure hasnt changed. Our protocols  on the breast have been the same for years now.

           Atlanta Journal Constitution
          </em>
          as saying that you were opposed to the cookie-cutter approach to  security. I think that the criticism from the public now is that it  seems like were seeing a cookie-cutter approachdisabled people, old  people

          <strong>
           Pistole

          : If they are nuns. Thats the question. So how do we verify who that person is?
          <em>
           [ed  you already check their IDs against a terror watchlist (except for the underwear bomber who WAS on a terror watchlist but allowed on the plane by US State department anyway).  I would think that if the nun isnt on the watchlist thats good enough.]
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Fallows
          </strong>
          : So how is what youre doing now not a cookie-cutter approach?
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          :  So, starting with pilots. Pilots were the biggest group of those I  assessed as being low risk to civil aviation. I mean come on, theyre in  charge of the yoke, they can put the plane down, like the co-pilot in  Egypt Air in 990 did. I worked that investigation in October 1999. It  was just a horrific recovery effort  men, women, children, body parts,  everything.
          <em>
           [ed  it was not Pistoles idea to exempt pilots.  It was only after the pilot unions created such an uproar that he rightfully caved.]
          </em>
          <br/>
          No amount of physical screening is  going to identify what was going on in that co-pilots head. So why are  we doing physical screening? Instead of physical screening, we do an  identity management base system to say, OK, this ID matches up with this  airlines current records as of five minutes ago or whatever it is, so  if they got fired yesterday And then the airline has the  responsibility  shared responsibility  to make sure [of the  identity] of anybody that is a licensed pilot with their airline, that  theyre actually supposed to be in control of the aircraft, pilot or  copilot.
          <br/>
          For me thats the first step. Then you  start looking at who are the other trusted travelers. What about flight  attendants?
          <em>
           [ed  another union making a huge fuss, and not Pistoles idea to exempt.  Sheesh, this guy is slime.]
          </em>
          So we made some modifications to the type of physical  screening they go through. We havent advertised that, but weve made  some modifications to how they are screened, and were looking at the  possibility of doing something similar to what we did with the pilots.
          <br/>
          Ive  had members of Congress say, Look, I am a member of Congress. I am not  a terrorist; This is absurd. Why do I have to go through a physical  screening? Its an insult. And I say, Well, in the legislation that  authorizes TSA every year, they specifically include provisions that  members of Congress will go through physical screening. By the way, I  go through screening every time, I went through AIT three times last  week in L.A., Long Beach, and Las Vegas.
          <em>
           [ed. Hmmm, thats interesting if its true.]
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Goldberg

         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          :  No she has a security detail and she doesnt. And she usually goes on  Coast Guard aviation, so yes, thats a different construct.
          <em>
           [ed  now why would the head of DHS need security detail if she were doing her job keeping America safe?]
          </em>

         <p>
          <strong>
           Goldberg

          :  Talk about the difference between commercial aviation, and general  aviation, or private aviation  corporate jets, private planes and the  like.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          : Theres a number of  issues here. Much of our approach is risk-based. To say, OK, what was  the last threat from general aviation? And we did have this guy down in  Texas last year fly into the IRS building [in Austin]. Killed himself  and unfortunately an IRS agent. But being smaller aircraft, typically,  than a full jumbo jet or something similar, with the fuel capacity and  the damage that could be done, there are certain risk-assessments that  have to be done. Were trying to look at what makes sense from a risk  management perspective, while also trying to promote the free flow of  people and goods. And whats the balance there, just like whats the  right balance on a pat-down, in terms of security and privacy?
          <em>
           [ed  translation  we havent gotten to the small planes yet.  But just you wait.]

           Fallows

          :  I wanted to follow-up the question about the TSAs role in setting the  balance. It sounded to me as if you were saying that it partly is your  job as TSA administrator to set a balance.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          :  Yes. Thats part of my job, to identify the issues, then discuss it  with a broader community  within the department, and elsewhere  as  to: Does this make sense? What equities will be affected by this  decision? How does that work?
          <em>

          <strong>
           Fallows
          </strong>
          :  Youve mentioned the new rules for pilots, and the unpublicized new ones  for flight attendants, as an adjustment of the balance. Those are  relatively recent changes, right? Does that reflect a response to the  pushback of recent months?
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          : So  when I came in [to this job] on July 1, I asked for a review of any  number of things. Who do we screen and why? Whats on the prohibited  item list, and why? Are we harmonized with the EU [European Union], in  particular, because of all the traffic in those areas. For example with  the EU, they say to us, you dont have 100% staff screening at your  airports, talking about insider risk.

          <strong>
           Pistole
          </strong>
          :  Yes, there is a small number where we do 100% staff screening, but to  do that for the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of airport  workers. I mean, people who work in the kiosks, the stores, food  vendors, and then the airline employees, the mechanics, and all those  peoplethats a big lift in terms of additional screening. And other  than drug smuggling, we havent seen terrorists exploit that. They tried  to last year, Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula, dealing with some  Brits. Theres a little bit written about that, but they tried to use a  prominent airline insider, an employee, to recruit a couple of other  airline employees to do something bad. So we see that as a risk, but it  subsides.
          <em>
           [ed  the truth is that airports do not really employ THAT many people, and some airports ridiculously employ more TSA than general airport staff.  It would not be hard to send a couple hundred extra people through the checks each day, especially early in the morning when traffic is light.  But maybe THEY would revolt if the were subjected to it?]

          <strong>
           Fallows
          </strong>
          : One of the general  critiques of the TSA approach is that its not scalable. That is,  somebody has a shoe bomb, which cost him a thousand dollars. Then it  costs us a billion dollars to respond to that. Somebody has an underwear  bomb, which is cheap, and it costs us a lot of money to react to. How  do you approach this problem?
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Pistole:
          </strong>
          As  terrorists become more precise in their design and concealment, they  make this proportionality question even greater. They did two  toner-cartridge bombswhy not do four, six, eight ten, that are just  waiting to go.

          <strong>

          <br/>
          Every  morning I start off my day with an intelligence briefing, and looking  seventy-two hours out in terms of who is on any watch list, terrorist  watch list, who might be interested in traveling. Who has purchased  tickets. So we can look at, out of 27,000 flights that are occurring  today in the U.S., where are people traveling that might be of interest?  Do we need additional federal air marshal coverage on those flights?
          <br/>
          We  had a situation a couple months ago where we saw five individuals, four  on a (watch list) and one on the no-fly list, who bought tickets from  around the country to the same city, flying to another city, on the same  day. And we thought, Hmmmm, OK, thats of concern, potentially. So we  pass that information to the joint terrorism task force, our colleagues  in that city. They do the little check and say no, theres an iman  conference this weekend in that city. So thats intelligence. Now we  still did additional screening of the four who did fly, and of course  the no-fly didnt fly, fortunately.
          <br/>
          Now, if  youre saying in an ideal world, if I also had all the information about  where a person purchased that ticket, or the co-travelers  and thats  one of the things I do see on the 72-hour look ahead, are there  co-travelers, that sort of thing. What does the credit history on that  person show? You know, theres a lot of commercially-available data  about people that we are not allowed to look at

          If Im drawing a map, look where TSA  is on the continuum. Weve got NSA, CIA, then foreign intel services,  law enforcement services overseas, foreign agencies. Their SIGINT  [Signals Intelligence) and their human collection and all that. Lets  say somebody gets through all these defenses. Nobodys identified  putative terrorists. They get through our terrorism task forces, 103 of  those around the country, and lets say they dont identify anybody. The  750,000-plus police officers, sheriffs, deputies, they dont identify  anybody. The concerned public, nobody sees something and says something.  They get through all these layers of security, then it comes down  really just to the TSA.

Our explosives specialists, theyll do something  they do  hand swabs at random, unpredictably. If that doesnt work then they go  through (the enhanced scanner).

          :  Oh yes. Theyre not all in the sterile side. Theyre out in the area  where people are congregating, and if theres someone who comes in that  looks out of sorts or whatever, then the goal is for the air protection  officers to see that person and do something. But look, were doing a  whole review, from the curbside to the cockpit. What is the best  technology, what does the checkpoint of the future look like? So thats  all underway
          <em>

          </em>
          . The TSA of the future, what should that look like? And Id  be open to your opinions. Ten years from now, in the year 2020, how  should we be doing it, and what technology should we be using to  accomplish that?
          <br/>
          Ive asked a number of people  that, for their ideas, and weve asked internally, what should the  transportation security officer, the TSO, the one that most people deal  with- what should that position look like? What should the educational  requirements, what should the professional requirements be
          <em>
           [ed  luckily, thanks to our stellar government school system and failing economy, there will be no shortage of qualified TSA agents]
          </em>
          ? So theres a  whole number of issues that Ive undertaken a review of, looking to the  future, recognizing that we have to protect as well as we can today.  But I want to build a different TSA for the future, frankly. I want to  see a different organization that can do a lot of things that I know  worked, worked other places. But I need the support of Congress and the  American people to do that.
          <em>

           Pistole
          </strong>
          : Some will. Just like enhanced pat-downs.
          <br/>
          It  becomes a question of, those people who see their civil liberties or  privacy violated, if theyre one of those three percent who get an  enhanced pat-down, how do they view more security. I think some people,  they want to fly anonymously, with no security screening. Thats their  ideal. OK, were never going to be that. Others are effusively  supportive, saying thank you for what youre doing. I want to make sure  everyone else on that flight has been thoroughly screened. And you  cant tell that because this person looks like an Arab male , hes a  threat  weve got the [non-Arab] McVeighs, weve got the Rudolphs,  weve got the Kaczynskis, so there you go.

          :  That is. So I want to use the latest intelligence to inform our  judgments and actions, and use the best technology when we dont have  intelligence. So theres a huge gap there. So here are the threats, here  are capabilities, here are gaps. So how do we fill those gaps? And  right now we do it with a somewhat blunt approach.
