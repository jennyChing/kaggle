      <p>
       Isnt that the kind of story you want to write?
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past year, Ive read only a few books that I couldnt put down. Unfortunately, several of the books I started to read didnt keep my interest past the first few chapters. There was a time when I forced myself to finish every book I started, no matter how boring it was. But I dont have time for that anymore. My book pile is big and my reading list is long, so if Im not compelled by the time the second act gets underway, I move on and find something more intriguing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a reader, Im on a perpetual quest for better stories. What does that mean for writers?

       The Best Fiction Sticks
      </h2>
      <p>
       Ive been thinking about what makes some books so easy to put down and what makes some stories impossible to let go of. After reading
       <em>
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769177/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316769177&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=writingforward-20" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316769177/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316769177&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=writingforward-20', 'The Catcher in the Rye']);">

       </em>
       , for example, I had the strangest feeling that Holden Caulfield was a real person. I expected him to come walking around some corner and start mumbling about the lousy week he was having. This sensation lingered for a few days, both times I read the book.

No matter how many times I read the book or watched the movie, I always cried at the end. To this day, quotes from the book and scenes from the film get me choked up. Its a story that sticks.

       The most recent book I couldnt put down was a trilogy:

         The Hunger Games
        </a>
       </em>
       . Im a science fiction fan, so the dystopian world intrigued me, but what really kept me glued to the page was the heroine, Katniss Everdeen. She wasnt fearless but she was brave, strong, and honorable. Its rare to find female characters of this caliber in fiction, and its not every day that a novel with such positive messages becomes a worldwide sensation.

       Stories like these haunt readers; stories like these linger in hearts and minds. These are the best kinds of stories.

      <h2>
       Writing Better Stories
      </h2>
      <p>
       If we want to write better stories, we have to read the best fiction and figure out what makes it so excellent. When Im absorbed in a book, I always try to keep one corner of my mind focused on what the writer is doing so brilliantly to keep my full attention on the story. Some things are obvious: believable characters, an interesting plot, realistic dialogue. Other elements of the best fiction are more elusive. Here are some observations Ive made about how to write better stories:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Give People a Reason to Read
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If I get to the third chapter of a book and still dont care about it, Ill probably put it in the donation pile and pity whoever ends up with it. The characters have to want something badly enough to go out there and try to get it. The must have purpose, an objective if you will. The characters purpose gives me a reason to read their stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dont Bore Your Readers
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Pages of description, minute details that are neither interesting nor relevant to the plot, and dull scenes that have no essential function to the story will bore readers to death. Keep the conflict coming and the action moving and your readers will stay up to read your book rather than reading it to help them fall asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Its the Little Things
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much detail and description gets boring, but the right details can make an otherwise average scene extraordinary. One liners that make readers laugh, subtle (or overt) pop culture references, and symbolism that has deeper meaning keep readers stimulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Stimulate Imagination, Provoke Thought, and Pull Heartstrings
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of stimulation, its one of the main reasons people enjoy reading so much. Sure, lots of readers are just looking for escape and entertainment, but plenty of us want to engage our imaginations and have our intellects challenged. Get readers emotionally involved, and not only will they enjoy your book; theyll also become loyal fans of your work.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Do Something Different
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget about trying to be completely original. I doubt thats possible anymore. Every story is the result of stories that have come before. But that doesnt mean you cant put your unique stamp on your story. Give old story premises new twists and your stories will feel fresh and invigorating.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Write Smooth Sentences That Make Sense
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This one is last on the list for a reason. One of the best novels I read recently did not have the best sentence structures. In fact, some paragraphs were fragmented and disjointed  not so much that I couldnt understand what was going on, but it was a bit jarring at times. The story was strong enough that I didnt care that much, but this type of oversight can mean the difference between a four-star and a five-star review.

           I am reading the Three Musketeers right now. Ive never read it before, but I have an audio tape of the story since childhood. Now, the tape told the entire story in an hour while the book is a thousand pages long on my iPad. So, of course, I kept thinking wow, the tape sure left out a lot of details while reading it.
          </p>
          <p>
           I noticed that its like many of the classic books in that it has lots of descriptions. Nowadays, an editor would probably read it and ask, whats with all the descriptions? Why is it so slow? Tastes and attention span of people sure have changed. I just read a chapter that described the servant of every Musketeer. And right after that, its something along the line of Okay, now we are done talking about the servants. Its time to describe the apartment of every Musketeer. Its hard to imagine a book nowadays being published that way.

             Ive noticed that older books are dense with description. I have a theory that because we didnt have photos and videos back then, descriptions were necessary. For example, nowadays, if you tell an audience in middle America that the story is set on a tropical island, they automatically have an idea of what it looks like due to their exposure to media. However, a few hundred years ago, the people in that same location would have no idea how to imagine such a setting without a ton of description.
            </p>
            <p>
             I dont know if my theory applies to the example you gave, since the descriptions deal with people and apartments.

               thats probably it. i like abridged versions or whatever. the shortened version. but i agree. we know so much from media that its pointless to write tons.

           Better fiction is surely a matter of taste, though. One of my favourite books is The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro  I didnt want to put it down, even when I finished it  but there are plenty of reviews out there that say its dull and nothing happens and the reader couldnt get through the first few chapters. Similarly, you mentioned The Hunger Games as an example of better fiction but Ive heard its terribly written (although, I havent yet read it, so might love it too.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Kelvins not a fan of classics but I generally prefer them to contemporary novels. To me, theyre just better written  and yes, sometimes a classic does seem to be in need of a good edit (The Brothers Karamazov springs to mind  I dont need a  back-story every time you introduce a new character, thanks Dostoevsky) but only ever for cutting. Whereas The Hunger Games is riddled with typos and grammatical errors  sometimes I wonder if contemporary fiction is edited at all.

             I would agree that there are spots in The Hunger Games where the text is a little fragmented. In my opinion, the quality of the story outweighed those issues. I wouldnt say it was riddled with typos and grammatical errors. The style of writing was different, and for all I know, the author did that intentionally since the voice of the narrator belongs to a teenager in the distant future (who would not write or talk the same way we do).
            </p>
            <p>
             Taste is definitely a factor, but theres nothing an author can do about that. I wanted to focus on the techniques we can use to write the best stories possible. In the end, no matter how good a story is, some people wont like it (and conversely, no matter how bad a story is, some people will like it).

             I dont think The Hunger Games is poorly written. I have to agree with Melissa; the language reflects the teenage character. I did find a few typos spread throughout the three books, but nothing jarring enough to make me want to stop reading.
            </p>
            <p>
             LOL! If youve heard from others the books are poorly written, suggest they give the Fifty Shades trilogy a try. Talk about poorly written! Theyre so cliche-ridden and so full of poor sentence construction that anyone who has any sense of writing skills at all would be very hard pressed to read more than five pages without groaning (if not laughing out loud!). Of course, the author is laughing all the way to the bank

               I thought about reading Fifty Shades but decided not to. Theres just nothing about it that matches my tastes and interests, based on its synopsis and all the reviews. I am sort of curious to see what all the fuss is about though.

           The last one I couldnt put down was Kings 11-22-63. Vivid characters and interesting plot, interesting subplots and enough sensory details to put you in the scene. Kelvin (above) hit the nail on the head, though. Past literature was full of beautifully painted pictures  JRR Tolkien, in particular, comes to mind. He paints such detailed portraits of his characters and landscapes you can see them in your head. Todays editors and publishers would toss the manuscripts of The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion into the trash bin after reading the first chapter  if they bothered to venture that far. Ann Rices Lasher and Blackwood Farm would have never been printed if it hadnt been for the popularity of An Interview With a Vampire.
          </p>
          <p>
           Melissa, what did you think of the ending of The Hunger Games? The end of the final book left me literally saying aloud, Really? I read all three in a weeks time. The end of the final book (for me) felt as if the author lost interest in her own story! Here we had a heroine just as you describe and, suddenly, the revolution is resolved in a single, short chapter and a sedate life of marriage and children is the perfect pastoral existence. I was highly disappointed.

             I think the ending could have been better, but I also think that is a matter of my personal taste rather than quality of the story. My opinion on the matter is steeped in feminism. First of all, there are not enough strong female heroines in literature (and pop culture in general). Then when we finally get strong female characters, they save the world and then settle down in marital maternal bliss. Its like our culture just cant let go of the fairy tale (happily ever after). I have a hard time imagining someone whos been through what Katniss endured would be able to settle into a domestic life (and she never really wanted that life anyway, from my understanding). As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I also had a hard time with how that ended (but for completely different reasons). Again, I dont think this has to do with the quality of the story so much as my personal preference with regards to how Id like to have seen these tales end.
            </p>
            <p>
             I happily endorse Hunger Games because it contains some refreshing and much-needed insights about our culture, which is something that most fiction is sorely missing these days. Most recent phenomena in literature have been entertaining but few have actually provoked thought or concern about who we are as a society (and where we are going), and that is something I require from a story if Im going to give it more than three stars. I also think the story itself was quite ambitious, and Im willing to give authors a little leeway when they are tackling such complex concepts. There are a lot of interesting ideas packed into the Hunger Games and I can sleep easier at night knowing that while some young girls are fawning over YA paranormal romances, others are getting a taste of adventure and heroism via Katniss Everdeen.

           That last book that I feel deeply in love with was Friends &amp; Foes by Sarah M Eden. Sarahs style reminded me lightly of The Scarlet Pimpernel. The time and language of the characters was elegant but clever and so engaging. She created the type of heroine that you not only root for but wish could be your best friend. So many leading ladies these days traipse around with perfect bodies, have all the money and connections and always get the guy, in a steamy too manydetails sort of way. Not this time and I adored it! I reread the ending three times because I couldnt bear to leave the characters behind.
           <br/>
           Lessons Ive learned from Sarah (who by the way Ive had the pleasure of meeting!) Give your characters time to fall in love. Let them say clever things and then turn around stuff their entire foot in their mouth. Let love triumph in the end. Detail the world so that you could stand at the bottom of the stair case and remember what happened on it that made you cry.

           I always feel its a risk saying some fresh, popular work is well-written or an excellent read. It always seems that there is some person ready to scoff at my choice of readsometimes they havent even read the piece in question.
          </p>
          <p>
           Much like you Melissa, I found the Hunger Games Trilogy to be a great read for many of the same reasons you stated:  vivid characters, masterful plotting, and *substance*. I fully enjoyed the ending; I thought it was just disgruntled enough to avoid resolving *all* the conflict into a nice tidy package. You know, the type people can just pack away and never think about again.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think many people put all their faith in the classics simply because its a safe choice. Of course its good, its stood the test of time. Someone dares challenge the quality of the writing? They must not have the mental faculty to really get the author.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think the first few chapters of a book are like a first date. I need the author to give me enough to want a second date, but not so much that i feel like theyre trying to take me home to meet the parents.
          </p>
          <p>
           Likewise I think every reader interacts with the writer through the writing. Just like people, every match isnt made in heaven. In fact theres people (and authors) I cant stand to be around. However who doesnt like to be around articulate, good looking people that are easy to talk to? I think thats what the tips Melissa has written here are trying to help us all be as writersarticulate and easy to be around for the reader.

             Thanks Robert. It sounds like were on the same page in our approach to reading (pun fully intended). I find it quite interesting when people criticize books they havent read. On one hand, we do have to pass some kind of judgement to decide whether we want to read a book or not. On the other hand, going around openly criticizing something we havent read means were forming opinions without being informed (never a good thing, in my opinion). I love your analogy of a first date. Henceforth, Im going to consider the first few chapters as if Im being courted by the author.

           I think that Stimulate Imagination is the top advice. The reader must use his imagination. Often books are written drily and overly realistically. Of course, if this book is about First WW or something like  it is ok. But not in the fiction. Book should help to fly away from this world.

             I agree. The best books take us away to another world and we get lost in it. Those are the ones I cant put down.
