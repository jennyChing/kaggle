       As children, weve probably all tried a Ouija board at one time or another. Remember how it went? Two or more players would gather around the board, and each would place two fingers on the planchette (the pointer). Each person would then ask the board a question one at a time, and, if there was a connection to the spirit world, the planchette would begin to move across the board, spelling out the answer. Sometimes, the board will answer with a simple yes or no, sometimes it will spell it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, using a Ouija board is harmless. However, there are times when the connection to the spirit world can go very wrong. Sometimes, the connection will be to an
       <em>
        evil
       </em>
       spirit, a demon, or devil. In order to avoid such an evil link, one must follow the five rules of the Ouija board
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ouija Board Rule #1
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Never play with the Ouija board alone. This is for your safety both physically and mentally. Ouija board experiences are occasionally extreme and should this occur you will need someone with which to support you, both during and after the occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ouija Board Rule #2
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Do not allow the planchette to count down through the numbers or backwards through the alphabet. Doing could result in the spirit escaping from the board, allowing it to terrorize you and the other players indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ouija Board Rule #3
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Always place a silver object upon the Ouija board before playing. Silver is known (
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       ) for its power to repel evil energies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ouija Board Rule #4
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Never, ever mention God, as it is believed that entities contacted through the Ouija board are generally evil in nature. Some may appear good at first, but it is likely a demon who is playing tricks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Ouija Board Rule #5
       </strong>
       <br/>
       When you are done playing, say goodbye. Failure to close the Ouija board session by saying goodbye may result in the contacted entity remaining present long after you have finished playing.
      </p>
      <h2>
       Pretty scary stuff. So whats really going on?
      </h2>
      <p>
       The movement of the pointer on the Ouija board can be attributed to something called the ideomotor effect. Humans might not be aware of it, but suggestions can be made to the mind by others, by observations, or by other mediums  and these suggestions can influence the mind and affect motor behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to The Skeptic Dictionary, tests devised by American psychologist William James, French chemist Michel Chevreul, English scientist Michael Faraday, and American psychologist Ray Hyman have demonstrated that many phenomena attributed to spiritual or paranormal forces, or to mysterious energies, are actually due to ideomotor action. Furthermore, these tests demonstrate that
       <strong>
        honest, intelligent people can unconsciously engage in muscular activity that is consistent with their expectations
       </strong>
       (Hyman 1999).
       <strong>
        They also show that suggestions that can guide behavior can be given by subtle clues
       </strong>
       (Hyman 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when people go to play the Ouija board, they know in advance of what its supposed to do, they (often) expect it to give some sort of results, and unconsciously, they guide the pointer so that it gives answers. There are no demons or
       <a href="http://www.relativelyinteresting.com/do-vampires-really-exist-9-truths-to-consider/">
        undead
       </a>
       . There are no spirits. Its just a piece of plastic/cardboard. Nothing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all 
       <em>
        If there really is an afterlife, Ill bet the best way to contact it is through a plastic, mass-produced board game from Milton Bradley!

             When I was a child , My friends and I played with the Ouiji board. I was afraid at first. Anyways this was when I was 10 I am now almost 30 . But I still remember this coincidence or not. We said if you are real then call us. Literally as we finished saying this the Phone Rang I laughed and said wow that was scary ..I answered it because they were afraid , no one was there . We were the only ones home at the time. and this is before everyone had cell phones. We contined to play asked if that was him calling he said yes, then the lights flickered like there was a short in the electrical system or somehting. We were a little freaked out. So we through the board across the room into her closet and shut the door. Two days later my child hood friend was dead , suicide.

               Quija Boards do work, but what some peopel dont understand is the Quija board was created way before the Hasbro Version. To use a quija board to its full affect, you must make your own.

               Shocked. No offense but is this a real occurence because alot of people on the internet love to lie on this topic.If thats it so i will be sure to never touch a Ouija i have heard that using candells silver etc. Will make what your contact uncapable of evil and maybe even contact a family who has passed instead rather than a demon of some kind.

                 Savanna: You misread. She said her child hood FRIEND was dead, suicide. Though Im sure having her friend commit suicide probably killed part of her childhood, too.

             my friend and I were playing with a ouija bored today, the pointer was moving all across the bored very fastly. spelling out random words we could not understand. we were also playing with my friends step mom. every time she touched the pointer. the pointer went nuts. scattering all across the bored. once we finally said goodbye. my friends step mom hands were ICE cold. and our hands were beat warm.
             <br/>
             it was like the spirit was using her to contact.

                 It is true. If everywhere is warm and and theres a spot that is at any freezing temperture you do have a spirit there. But you also have to make sure that theres no window or fan or anything that could do with coldness on/open.

             Just like to say this; have you ever played those of you reading? If you try to push the planchette consciously , it will trip up and it is obvious it was pushed. If you play, don't go in thinking "This is all rubbish!" because it most likely won't be someone pushing  Happy Ouija games! Stay safe.

             i want to try this, because my friend told me it actually worked on him, but it was scary. and I m not sure if i should give it a shot too it sounds fun, but if its not all bull, the chances of things going wrong is wayy higher than "staying safe"

                 Ive only used an Ouija board once, but the feeling you get when using it is pretty adrenaline filled. I remember thinking that it was probably the placebo effect, but afterward it felt more realistic. All I know is that it was scary.

               They were probably trying to scare you but at the same time you never know. Anyways, how old were you and your friend at that time?

             do not mess with these things. they are real and u will regret it. your inviting evil spirits. me and my friends did it. nothing moved or anything. but we were all scared. we felt it. there was something there and it was not good. we tried and tried. my friends dog came in barking like hell. that dog hadnt been in there in a looong time. it was terrified. and just sat there and looked at us in fear. we put it away. that day nothing went well. it was terrible. i went home that night and there was something in my room. there were shadows going past my door. and right before i fell asleep twice. something whispered right in my face. the second time it was fuckin piseed as hell. this is no joke. dont do it..

I hope it works i wana try for myself but cant get any1 to do it i would ask the friend iv been talkin about but he moved to a different country. Like some1 whispering into ur face and loads of shadows goin past your door that would be some fukin scary shit and u say it as it was like it was nothing to u

             Iv played it all of my life and yet nothing has ever gone wrong. If you follow the rules, Nothing is really scary. They can lie and i'm sure they can follow you and hurt you too, But as long as you do the right things then your just fine.

               NO!  Dont try it. They do work.  Please dont try it. Google Demonic Symbols  look at the board and planchette.  When I was a child around 9yrs old we did this at a sleepover at my house, we also had a seance (sp?)and retrieved a spirit. Scared me sooo bad!! I never did it again. Never will. Maybe it is because a childs mind still is open to these things. Dont know.  Definitely not going to try it again and see.

             ive played the ouija board recently with some friends and i didnt believe it was real at all but once i played i found out different. me and my friends talked to what i believe was a demon and ever since ive played the ouija board i feel like someone is watching me and following me wherever i go it is a very uncomfortable feeling i regret ever playing it.

             Ouija board is no joke, anyone who says its fake doesnt know jack, I am 23 I started playing at 14 with my best friend then more and more then even alone at times, I will never in my life touch one of those things again, evil is real and its scary, at that time in my life I was against god, and for the devil, and if you allow it a demon WILL attatch itself to you and it will NOT leave until it is done screwing with you. I get chills to this day just thinking about the things I went through. Its unexplainable, most people think I was crazy. But I know it was real. So please be careful to anyone whos thinking of playing. If you are a believer you just might have something bad coming your way. Hopefully not. You dont want it.

             its all fun and games till someone gets hurt but listen the ouija board is a way to talk to pearets   nothing more close the door when you done or your going to get hurt demons lie they trick you they cnive and thrive on pain so always close the door even if you have to force it shut you and who ever is playing with you if you DONT you will get HURT or even DIE  but if you CLOSE THE DOOR NOTHING WILL HAPPEN o yeah one more thing BE RESPECTFUL THE HOLE TIME and never play if your SCARED never play if your BORED or if you think it is a JOKE because then your asking for TROUBLE

             Ive tired playing the Ouija board by myself and I do see spirits Im currently living with my bf and his mom and I know the house wasnt haunted when I moved in and since I tried playing. By myself Ive felt a presence around me today I seen a guy in the corner of my eye and I know this is the guy Ive been feeling around me but oddly the Ouija board didnt move for me but I said goodbye but it was days later and I still feel him and seeing him but I have played it with my sisters and friends it always worked. But this time playing it alone wasnt smart since Ive played alone Ive been having bad dreams about going to hell and bad thoughts of killing myself I myself I warn whoever want to try some scary fun to always say goodbye and if they dont want to say goodbye say it for them because the territory Ive been dealing with is scary and Iregret ever playing

             Honestly? Demons? Devils? Lol. Try it with a group of friends blind-folded. And have one mate, not playing or touching just look on to see what happens. 100% of the time it will be mumble-jumble.

               If you truly think a ouija board is fake, I suppose I have to warn you. Please trust me. This story is real. Some friends and I messed around with a ouija board. We thought it was funny. The way it moved. We didnt bother with the silver. We didnt need it, we thought. We thought we were talking to a boy. He said he was 13. Very sweet boy. Very wise. We asked him what his favorite number was, and he said 98. The night went on, and for about an hour we talked to him. We asked him to show us something amazing. 9. 8. It went. It stopped for about a minute. No movement, no reaction. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1. 0. Nothing happened. The lights didnt flicker. No phone rang. Nothing. We got bored, and packed it up. Now I should say this.. We didnt say good bye. To this day, I hear them before I sleep. I smell them. Burnt flesh. I talk to those who burned in Auschwitz. The worst part is.. I cant step foot in a church, or touch a crucifix. I cant touch a bible, and I cant be in the same room as holy water. This is what I get for playing with a ouija board. You were warned.

             Observe this simple experiment. Put two pieces of cardboard, or smooth poker chips on top of the cup. If spirits are moving the cup, the cup will move first then the chips will be dragged behind. If its people moving the cup, the chips will move first then the cup will follow.

             I betting spirits arent being called by a toy made in China by Milton Bradley.

             When are you stupid idiots  going to relies that it is f_cking b_llsh_t. How the $#%&amp; can a piece of wood or a piece of paper make these so called spirits contact us ? wake up to yourselves its all fake i did it last night and i even said come in and you can stay as long as you want and then i started to scream and say very nasty things to them but nothing  Nothing moved at all. All of your stupid little stories are either fake/made up or just plain coincidence.

               Chris;  Sorry but its realize . Just saying you can believe what you want but this stuff happens to be true. I experience paranormal in my house so has my aunt, dad, mother, and sister not my brothers. I believe in spirits, exorcism, and demons. But like i said we dont expect you to believe in it,

               Go back to the Ouija board and open it. Start as normal, and then once you contact a spirit, say Please go away. Please leave us alone. If that doesnt work, be firm but not demanding. Stay calm and dont yell. Say Go away. Leave us alone. Goodbye. If the Planchette goes to goodbye, you should be okay. Im not speaking from personal experience, just what makes sense, but I hope this helps!

             I played a Ouija Board with my friend a few months ago. We were aiming to talk to another friend of ours who had recently died, but we couldnt seem to get him. We prayed everytime before we tried to contact a spirit, and said goodbye calmly after we decided to give up. I was a little bit freaked out for the next few days but nothing weird happened and I usuallyy pick up on strange energy changes (as in ghosts) in the room. It works, just be careful and pay attention to all of the rules. Never do anything to aggravate a spirit. Happy playing!

             i like how everyones friend has played the ouija board LOL! i havnt played one yet but i do intend to, im hoping to contact some spirit but, i dont believe half of the stories on here, the one whos friend was found pinned to the kitchen wall by knives, it just seems a little farfetched, i guess the ouija board is a board game that doesnt work for some people, it really depends on if you believe it will work but then in saying that its obvious the game doesnt work, it just psycologically makes up belive that the game is real.

               brandon i dont mean no offence but i dont get  how you can come online and judge people on their spelling when you cant even spell PLUS, and like i said before ouija boards do not work its all pyscological  you head makes you belive it works, and the reason why it dont for some people is because some people dont let there heads get carried away,  seriously everyone no bullshitting but has anyone ever experienced anything that can be concidered paranormal i dont wanna hear what your friends have done and i dont want no bull crap either

                 Curious how old are the people that are telling their stories?  I seems like most of you are young teens because the spellings are horrible.  Ive played a ouija board when i was younger and I was skeptic of it then and to no surprise im still skeptic about it unless someone can show proof that the ouija can produce spirits or demons.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The one about the kid having knives stuck in him and the wall.. yeah not buying that one.  People need to remember young kids have very active imaginations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A Toy company will not make a game that will bring spirits or demons.  Sorry everyone but a lot of these stories are too far fetched to believe.   I think some of you shouldnt watch the movie called Ouija experiment.

             @Syra  I thought I did, but how can I know if it was paranormal or just my mind playing tricks on me?  This is why I always doubt paranormal things there always seems to be a much more simple explanation (for example:  an illusion, something natural, my mind playing tricks on me, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
             So I guess the answer is no, based on that.

               The best way to see if ouji boards work is to record yourself playing the game and then play it back if your unsure of the result It helps if you think your results are based on your own mind (mind playing tricks on you) hope that helps

             Hi everyone! A couple of my friends and myself had just used the Ouija board and I cant even lie, Im kinda scared, lol! I googled the rules to the Ouija board and I came across this website, so I read every post and I dont know wether to believe everything or to laugh! We didnt have a pointer, all we had was the actual board. So we put the board on my living room floor, with the front door closed, and the lights out And nothing happened. My friend Tyler asked the Ouija board if there was any ghosts in my apartment and nothing happened, he then started saying come out you f@gg0ts and was talking smack but still nothing had happened. So I decided to put the board back and stop using it, so I said goodbye, my friend Jacob said goodbye but Tyler did not. Nothing has happened yet, Hopefully nothing will later as well. Guess well see!

             Ok for all those people that are saying  how can paper and plastic call spirits the fact that the ouija can contact the spirit world is irreverent to what the board is made of. A spell is still a spell no matter how its written down. The Internet is a virtual world that can harm people, cyber bulling or humiliation And a computer is nothing more than wire or plastic. We can use the Internet to buy or get real physical good, but you cant go or visit the Internet physically it takes a special device with the proper combinations of wires And plastic and antennas. The ouija is the  computer to the spirit world. Just like there are people that can use a computer properly there are people that cant use a ouija board properly, one may say computers are stupid it wont do what I want it to do ( no the user is stupid bc he/ she cant use it) same goes for the ouija

                 Danielle. The fact that you want to get one all depends on what you are looking for. If you are just looking for something to do bc you are bored then I would not recommend using something you are not familiar with, the results could be regrettable. Let me as you and everyone on this post, does anyone on this post believe in a higher power..like Goddoes anyone believe in the power of prayer, that someone like Jesus can die on the cross and rise again. If you answered yes Then why in the world would evil stand on the sidelines and be fake. There is a Satanic church, there are spells and prayers for evil too.  So back to your question, if you want a pass time , get checkers, if you want to achieve or reaching a higher powerthen be respectfully and accept the consequence good or evil.

                 My brother and his friends played with an Ouija board and they have no fear and never had harm so i think its pretty cool and Im probably going to try it sometimes I dont know Ill ask his friend i pretty good friends with her so Im kinda exited. If you have a different opinion Im fine with that. But the only person to dare to talk to is my mom Sarah

               Um,Ive been watching this therad for some time now,and I can no longer restrain myself. Mr. Price, youre concerned whether these Democrats will be loyal to the GOP? Youre joking, right? You sound as if youd be just fine with a school board packed with conservative Republicans, which in my humble opinion would be no better than those Dems that sit on the board now.I frankly hope these and future candidates for this body will declare their primary loyalty to the idea that the Pennsauken Board of Education exist to oversee a school district that will help to prepare its students to compete in a 21st century global economy, party politics be damned!!

             ive been playing with the brainjar ouija board for a while now and when i first done so i thought it was all gunna be a load of fun and games, nothing real will happen  until last week. I asked the ouija board will a certain horse win its race this week, it said no and guess what, the horse came 4th, when i asked it will something particular happen at work this week it pointed to yes and guess what that particular issue did occur at work, then i asked it if it would rain on saturday wher ei live it said yes  no prizes for guessing whose more accurate than the weather-man. then the table started shaking, i thought it might have been something more logical (it was after all a very windy day), i clicked on goodbye and i heard noises coming from the walls (house noises? i dont know) but they ceased a few seconds after i clicked goodbyefake?? i dont fucking think so.scary as hell?? yes but very accurate.

             whats with all the d!ck measuring just cause someone cant spell a word correctly! ever thought that people might actually know how to spell but miss out letters due to fast typing! this site is suppose to be a debate about whether or not ouija boards work! not name calling like school kids please!! and for the record i tried the ouija board my self and nothing happened! you believe what you want to believe and see what you want to see this game is a trick of the mind! if you truly believe something will happen then it will, minds have a great way of playing tricks on us, so when we get scared it may sometimes feel like something is really happening although 9 times out of ten it will be a trick of the mind. and everyone else stop rippin on people who cant spell and if you wanna be keyboard warriors theres plenty of chatrooms on the net that welcomes your B.S . peace

             We used a wooden Ouija Board the real ones wont burn and when you try to burn them, black goats will appear, sign of the devil  Just dont get an entity named SETHhell be all nice to you at first &amp; flirts with you even and then hell start swearing when you go to leave himand NEVER draw an open door on the back of a Ouija Board, its lets the spirits out

             Axiome; something which is as itself being, proves itself simply by being  ( self-evident)  when I 1st used a Quija board, Axiome was what it called itself, but I had never heard the word before then, just only looked it up afterward and it spoke in paradox.

             I am 24, and played with the board about 6-8 years ago. But I dont think that contributed towards my experiences. I truly believe from experience that there is something more to this life and because we are physically existing, its a limitation to an extent. I remember being fully awake about a few months ago, and I was researching how to interact with spirits, and got bored so I turned off the computer and light to my bedroom. I was still wide awake and kept the door open enough to allow the hallway light come in. It was around 3am and remember I was wide awake  nothing drew my attention towards the door, but Id stare at it before falling asleep every night. I actually witnessed a body like shadow travel past my room. The light of course wasnt entirely blocked by this shadow. For the next 20 minutes I was attempting to yell, degrade, or whatever to get this spirit to do it again. I saw what I saw It was not out of the corner of my eye No one else was around a couple weeks prior I was accused of unlocking someones bedroom door and going through the room towards the bathroom. FYI  the direction to that persons bedroom from mine was the same direction that I saw a shadow heading towards Both mine and their experience happened in the middle of the night.

               I actually played one this weekend. and first me and some friends asked if we could have a hint of the spirit. it literally started moving. spelling the word Far. we were confused. so I asked who are u?? It started spelling the name Kevin. I bursted out in tear because I was terrified. The name kevin only related to me. July 16 2012 I met a guy in N.C. and fell in love I think about him all the time and he is FAR away. I was trippinggg. Then a friend got the nerves to ask what did he want? With my eyes closed I felt the glass moving.. as my friends stay brave and hold my hand I open up my eyes to find the spirit spelling out my wholeeee name. Not the nickname that everyone knows me as. I realized this wasnt fake. they werent trying to scare me. they asked who the hell Allison Williams was. and I was like thats me dude. I paniced. A friend tried getting it off my mind so she asked when we were going to die as a joke.. it went to the # 3 and right when it landed I went into shock, harsh vomitting and choking. The front of me was cold and my back side was hot. I ended up passing out and breaking the Circle. now Im scared..

             Hi room.
            </p>
            <p>
             So i havent used a Ouija since I was in 5th grade. I dont t know if I believed my friends way back then. So I purchased a used Ouija from the 1940s made by Fuldman which was before Parker Brothers bought the rights from Fuldman after he passed. It arrived in the mail on Saturday. I opened it but have not used it yet. Its been sitting on my bar in the kitchen.  Saturday night my dog stared at the Ouija board, growled, gave a small bark and panted heavily. She stared for about 4 minutes. She has never acted that way before. It gave me goose pimples. Tonight my Husband and I are going to try it for the first time. I will report back.

             almost 95% of ouija boards dont work because they have been blessed, when you bless a ouija board it is next to impossible to get any kind of paranormal activity from them . if you look on amazon or even ebay for a cursed ouija board there the ones you need if you want a true paranormal experience  aim for the boards that date back to the 1930s to the 1970s .. i hope that info was helpful to anyone seeking a spooky evening =D

               Last night we tried the Ouija and nothing happened. The board came from ebay. Didnt say anything about it being blessed, haunted or any experiences. Im disappointed but I will try it again. we made sure to say goodbye of course. lol

             I dont know what to believe because half of you literally cant spell to save your lives from these demons lol. Seriously go back to 3rd grade so I can get some logical information! Honestly youre all in dire need of some education. I do agree this is more than fascinating. I once had a real experience around age 14, now Im about to be 21 I live in a house that was built in 1909 I will come back and post what I experienced, I promise to spell correctly and not lie, like all these other idiots, sorry idiots.

               this page happens to be a site where people can come and enjoy a chat and debate about ouija boards! right this is not a site where you can come and rip the p!ss out of people because of how they spell,  me for example i have excellent grades in english writing as well as numerous other exceptional grades people make mistakes and spell incorrectly because they type to quickly like my self not because they are thick and in need of further education. if you dont have anything nice to say to anyone then dont say anything at all and if you cant help your self and you feel the need to be constantly rude to everybody then go on this website

             I played only once in a dark room with candles. The roombecame cold, some candles, blew out, i opened my eyes the board kept going to no then spelling stop. Over and over again. A misty figure of a beautiful woman in a red dress was there. She spoke	( and not threw the board) she said Zama, Zama, Zama. The next day daughter three at the time was cutting out articles of natural geographic.  She brought to me a picture of a dead lamb/or calf	 the head cut off saying mommy look Zama! Zama! I searched the magazine an article abot gypsy s and there way of life. The next day i talked to my father different state, i told him. He said i had a dream of a woman she was so beautiful, she said her name was Zama but i couldnt reach her, she was too far away and no matter how far i ran she kept gwtting farther. I have not open the spirit world since.

             I believe in ouija boards as much as I believe in vampires (

              http://www.relativelyinteresting.com/do-vampires-really-exist-9-truths-to-consider/
             </a>
             ) which means to say I dont believe they do anything for real.  Its just a product of your imagination because you are setting yourselves up to be scared  so when anything happens (that would otherwise not be spooky), you immediately attribute it to the ouija board.

             I have played with ouija boards all my life. I honestly do not follow the rules, I do not say goodbye, and so on. Nothing bad has happened and no devil has followed me. The only thing that has happened once was that I was with friends and we were playing with the ouija board. We asked, can you show us a sign that your here? A single light turned off then turned back on a couple seconds later. I am sure no spirit is capable of hurting you. Think about it, you dont here about any bloody/gory or even slightly creepy deaths that dont have an explanation. Trust me, nothing is going to hurt or haunt you. Ouija boards are a fun experience, and you can get some real quality info off of it. My friends and I use it for more girly reasons(crushes)

             Ive played long ago with a few friends at 1st it moved slow and we all accused each other of moving it till we got a strange.almost magnetic feeling (like when u put 2magnets together but try not to let em touch) so we all lifted r fingers about 2inches still over the pointer and itstill moved and quite fast it was like are hands were pulled with it but every question asked came out later yrs to be true I was.1st outa group to have kids it said id have many girls (I have 4) any many other future questions I later found out came true. Very amazing and freaky at.same time.

             I am some what of a sceptic i believe their is something after life but im unsure what and i ghosts extist or not! A true story here now no bs but wen i was 15 me n a mate decided it would be a gud idea to try the ouija board and it worked how do i know?i asked questions only i knew he answer to my friend had no idea of my mothers maiden name or what address my grandad lived at or how old my parents/grandparents were! Every single personal question i asked this home made board came back spot on which kinda freaked me out! We had no goodbye on our board (individual letters wrote on paper in a circle with 0-9  yes and no) we came across a spirit  that didnt seem too happy us playin so we left it alone n i left the glass turned upside dwn in my bedroom n ditched all the letters etc! A week later i decided to touch the glass,alone and the fuckin thing slid along my table a gud 6 inch not fast but really slowly!i ditched the glass on a back alley bt yeah thats my story!nothin bad has happened n iv tried a few times since  now im 27 nothing has happened since then! Keepin an open mind id like to think of life after death!

             I believe in the oujia board! My cousins,me, and my siblings were playing the ouija board and asking simple questions like is anyone there and stuff like that. Well once we were done playing and we all said goodbye nothing really happened and we all thought it was fake and why we even wasted our time playing it well about two weeks later when I went back to my cousins house we were all alone while her mom went to the store to do some food shopping. Well we heard creaks like some one was walking around the house and a few times the lights would flicker in the kitchen me and her were dead scared and we wouldnt even move. After that and her mom came home we went into her room and she told me that she hears voices in her room and the bathroom and I didnt believe her and Im very skeptical so it was hard to convince me that ghosts exist but I started hearing voices in her house and only her house and  something strange really happened  her baby brother was sitting in the couch and I looked away for a second and looked back and he was in the other side of the house. Strange right Thats not all I also saw a shadow many times I was by her room and the bathroom also the storage room. If I were u I would try to play it u will. Regret it trust me

             i had a Ouija Board for 2 years always tried it alone. never worked. But for 2 years i had crazy fked up depressing dreams, thankfully i am mentally super strong as it wasnt good. not 1 good dream in 2 years till i eventually sold it. i was never scared and thought what a load of crap, and nor am i paranoid, but those dreams were weirdly bad, Dont wait 2 years folks get rid of asap. Pray to god read the bible ask for forgivness and all will be gone. God is good god is mighty than all and nothing can stand before god, we are all his children and god will sort it if you ask.

             Hi all,
             <br/>
             I am an atheist and I am well educated. I dont believe in nor God neither Ghosts. So to give a try with Ouija Board I made one by myself today morning.
            </p>
            <p>
             I called up my friends to my home and started to use that board. At first it didnt move at all but after some time with our finger on the planchette the pointer moved. It was showing no when we asked if someone there. Then it started telling about it. It said its MOXO who is 101 B.C died in a war in Spain. It also said its from Spain and waiting for its Girlfriend Artothusar. We have never came across such names in our lives. Also we same across ZOZO-famous demon once, then a spriits like Lowco, OM, HPM etc.,
            </p>
            <p>
             In this, Lowco was very interesting. It said that it can fortell the future and also predicted some events in our lives. We are waiting to see it happen. But when my brother didnt believe in us and tried alone nothing worked for him. He tried for a long time but it didnt move.
            </p>
            <p>
             I still feel like my mind is playing games with me. When I guess consiously some word it is not showing the same word but starts to rotate in the board. So saying that it works unconsiously with motor musles. But we are getting good stories with this board. Thanks to that board for this.

             Afternoon,
            </p>
            <p>
             First of all, eveyone involved in arguing over spelling and punctuation should take their comments elsewhere. A grammar debate is not the intention of the thread. Im always correcting my girlfriends grammar, but does that make her a moron? No. Shes currently enrolled in Engineering at University, so she is far from. Every one has their strengths and weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyways, to the point The title of this article is ridiculous. Its like saying, Does God exist? No. How can anyone know? The author of the article clearly has never experienced a Ouija board, or gotten the results they were looking for. Although Im sure that many of the above stories are fake or exaggerated, Im also willing to bet that the other half are honest. Until you have a personal experience with it, itll obviously be hard to relate. But that doesnt mean that you can entirely dismiss the idea. My older sister died six years ago from cardiac arrest. A couple days after, my mother and auntie were sitting alone in my kitchen, simply having a conversation. Out of nowhere, my sisters necklace, which was sitting on a shelf, lifted up and started to float. It remained in the air for about five seconds and then dropped to the floor. There was no wind or anything of the sort. It didnt happen to me as previously mentioned, but I know that it happened. She wouldnt lie to me about something like that. It takes an experience like that for one to truly change your outlook on the supernatural world. Since then, I absolutely believe it. Ive only used a Ouija board a couple times, and that was over two years ago. We made our own board, had a closed off room, candles, followed all of the rules, etc. We did reach a couple spirits, neither of them were harmful or aggressive. As said, it was a couple of years ago so I dont remember all of the details. Not sure why I havent done it since, it isnt as though im scared or anything, haha, just havent gotten around to it again.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you are willing to do it, make sure youre serious about it. From my personal experiences, you dont get a response if youre laughing about it or not taking it seriously. Make sure you have people you can trust, too. Im not sure because I have never had any issues, but it certainly wouldnt hurt to be careful and say goodbye and what not. The debate about having to be religious for it to work is also irrelevant. The group I did it with held a couple strong christians, an atheist, and I am agnostic, but it still worked. Science explains the reason for Ouija boards to work as the ideomotor effect. To sum it up, it says that humans involuntarily make movements or thoughts. For example, crying is an uncontrolled action triggered by intense emotions. Most people dismiss Ouija boards and their authenticity based off of this theory. But what they havent considered is the spirit crossing over and initiating those so-called involuntary actions so that they can interact. Hmm, just a thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             Well, thats it for me, folks. Dont eliminate the possibility that they work based off of what you hear on the internet-try it for yourself. Dont consider it a joke and always be safe about it. Kudos to you if you read this whole comment, my apologies. Im graduated from high school now and currently working and I miss writing, so I sought this as an opportunity to fuel that crave. Have a good one.

             Hello, so im a graphic designer and i decided to design my own ouija board. i printed it out and applied it to a hard foam core board. does this increase my chances of getting activity? its not store bought and hasnt been blessed. ive been using ouija boards for a couple years now and they were all bought at a store. they still worked but i was just wondering if this will be better since i made it myself.

             I happen to believe that Ouija boards do work. I was a skeptic until last night. My best friend decided to purchase a Ouija board and me, him and another one of our close friends went to a haunted forest nearby to check it out. Keep in mind that this forest is extremely active with spirits, as it is the site of many tragic murders, suicides and deaths (often from getting lost because of the size). In the middle of this forest, there is a parking lot. This parking lot is said to be a hotspot because of the lights (lights allegedly attract ghosts). So we parked there, set up the Ouija board in my car and lit some candles. We tried for about 10 minutes and nothing happened, which led me to believe that it was bogus. Then, at 9, the lights in the parking lot shut off (as they always do) and thats when we got results. We spoke with a very disturbed ghost who was upset over his murder. He wasnt a fan of technology and even told my friend to stop texting. Periodically he would spell out leave or leave now. When we asked why, the planchette wouldnt move. We would ask him another question and he would answer. We were in the middle of the conversation when all of a sudden the planchette pointed to good bye. We thought he was just bored of us. But about a minute later a car pulls into the parking lot. Unsure of who it was, we tried to sneak a peak. We locked all the doors when we couldnt identify the driver. We all ducked down and remained still. The car shone its lights at us, revved its engine but then it eventually parked about 5 or 6 meters away from us. We kept still. Then an extremely large truck appeared out of the trails in the woods. These trails are meant for walking, but sometimes the locals will rip through them in their vehicles. But they dont normally do it in the winter unless they have business in the woods (by business I mean mischief). So, the truck does the exact same thing as the car did. Convinced that no one was in my car, the driver of the truck parks beside the car. We had no idea what they were doing. But they didnt seem friendly. Its almost as though the ghost was trying to warn us.

             Ive played the ouiji board a few times in the past. It has worked for me. Just answered questions and they were right. Even predicted who Id lose my virginity too thought nothing of it till I thought back later. Have never had any paranormal experiences away from the board. No whispers no shadows and nothing flying off walls or creepy noises. I kind of want to play by myself just to see what happens. And if I do Im definitely putting some silver on the board just as a cautionary.

Me amd my dad bought one today and we tryed it out (i tryed makeing one on my own but it wasnt accurate.. :/ anyways so today was Basicly like my first time But my dad has tryed it alot when he was young but it always gave him bad luck and he burned the quija board) anyways It worked And it was alittle girl..age 6 and she said she died in my room :O  And that the toys we found iny attick were hers And she was murdered by a 40 year old man.. I got teary eyed of course

Then my dad said give me a sign ..like show us that ur here and Z said look up and we did and we told him we couldnt see him and later he said man behind you and dad asked who the man was and Z said Jim and dad asked to talk to him and so jim got on the quija board and jim said to run and dad said from who.. Why run? And jim said Z  which scared us all lol to death lol..anyways so my dad doesnt belive its real my mom doesnt want really anything to do with it and my brother thinks its stupid and pointless but I am upsest with it and i dont know why but ive always felt drawn to this stuff O_o .. And we wrote down a number and it giest it right 3 times but it kept saying the number backwards O_o and it wasnt dad and mom moving the petchette cuz ONLY i knew the number lol and yes we had a candle in the room lol and the weirdest part was when i asked dad to ask the spirit how my moms mom ( which yes of course is my grammy and she died from cancer) and my dad said No im not gonna ask that and right after he said that the panchette read GOOD and i got teary eyed lol but yeah i believw it works

             Ok, soI think the game is a big lie. I believe it works, but not with all the dieing, injuries, illusions,etc.. I feel that some of the people on here need to re-check their spelling, and use more meaningful words. I am also compelled to say some of the people on here are complete mororns!

             I have tried this only once. It was just after my friend past away. At first it didnt work. And after an hour or so of trying it finally did. Instead of calling upon any spirit we called apon my friend and asked her to contact us. We played by all the rules making sure we were one step ahead of the board. We asked it simple questions that only our friend were able to answer, just to make sure it was her and she did, she answered each question right. Then things went a bit weird and wat she was saying made no sense. Eventually all it ended up doing was moving across the board to my friend (our late friends best friend) and literally went off the board and kept moving on the table towards her. This happened over and over as if she were trying to tell us sonething. Eventually she went to goodbye and had to end it there (never try to speak to the spirit once it has said goodbye, thats wen things can go weird). After all this we realised that the triangle thing you place ur fingers on was upside down and we wernt using it correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
             After that my friend started hearing voices and she was feeling very down towards herself as if she wanted to hurt herself. I dont no if that is true. But ofcourse we supported her through it and decided not to touch it again until we were ready. I found it really interesting and it also gave me and my friends alot of closure towards our friends death knowing that she was still out there and was okay. Aslong as u obey the rules and make sure u use it properly. Then everything should be fine. X goodluck

             Im 15 and me and my cousins always look for scary stuff online. When i was 13 i had gone over a friends house and used the board for the first time there. It was fun and scary and couldnt believe it actually worked. Well last summer i had made my own ouiji board since my parents would never buy one for me. It really works! And we dont push it i swear because sometimes when i play with them the spirit goes so fast i have to catch up alot. Imade mine from cardboard and wrote everything in a black sharpie. Because were afraid of glass breaking we use a see through plastic thingy. It really works i swear. Its fun but be safe! Always ask a spirit if it is good or bad in the beginning, and if its bad say goodbye right away. Always say goodbye when you are done. Plus never play by yourself. Its scary but fun after a while

               Not to be rude .. But in actual facts its safer to play it alone Im calling bs on your comment for the fact that a evil spirit would never tell you it was bad  Demonic spirits will lie to you, only thing to remember when playing ouija board is never let the spirit count 666 and never let it count back from 10 to 0 and always remember to say goodbye .

                 how do you know that ,yes they would play tricks on you, but that doesnt mean that there isnt a honest mean demon, if he lied you would feel at ease ,if he were honest you would be scared off the bat, rather than moments down the line, it makes sense that the demon would say yes I am mean because it would make you fear it  from the moment you spoke with it ,and isnt that their objective

                   Lol I dont think so duck, I demon would lie about being good because it would be easier for them to escape through the board that way demons are said to be tricksters, liars and evil I know what im talking about and im sure if u read up on paranormal entitys and demonic forms u will have some real knowledge to.

             Me and my friends played the ouija board, it is real and it is very dangerous. Im 17years old and this board is not a joke, all those storys you guys are telling I bet are true but it more then likely happend to you cause you either did something wrong they the spirits did not like, didnt say goodbye er disrespected the board, NEVER EVER disrespect the ouijia board and ALWAYS say goodbye, Me and my friends all ways played the board we never treated it like a joke, it is real we was talking to this one spirit who was pree chill we all liked eachother and just laughed even the spirit was laughing but one day when we were playing everything went wrong that spirt that we was talking too sent the ouijia board demon to us his names ZoZo never ever fucking say that name when you are playing the board.. that demon is one of the devils followers and he is attracted to me I can feel him by me and its crazyy and every time I play the board I call apon a spirit and the only spirit I get is ZoZo I have asked him why he is by me why he is always on the board when I play and he said he is attracked to me and he wants me to follow him .. I swear too all of you this is not a joke this shit is real and I do have proof .. so whoever plays this please play it right and never let them do the figure 8 thats where the spirt draws a 8joke on the board really fast when they do that say goodbye cause their trying to open a portal thats what the y did t oo me and my friends ..

             I would never attempt to play the ouiji board! My sister done it twice with our friends. The first time was in a grave yard, the next day our friend Amy woke up with all scratches covering her back..she said it didnt hurt her but was just really scared to how they got there.. the second time she was with diffrent people and they wanted to do it, my sister didnt want to but they was calling her a sap, so she did it again and everything in the room was spinning around. She was scared. Every time I mention the ouiji board to her she makes me promise not to try it! I believe every word she has told me.

             And for those to not believe it. Try and find out..

             My friends and I tried the Ouija board today, and it didnt do anything. Though, things did keep dropping on the ground and lights kept flashing. We heard noises. My friend and I both had heard a voice whispering in our ears saying, Please dont leave me, and we dont remember the name it had told us, but we remember it had started with a J.

               please go back on the board, ask if spirits are present ,they probably escaped if you can hear them ,if spirits are present tell them to go away in a firm voice, but dont yell say go away, leave you alone, and tell them you wish them well ,say goodbye

             I have never played the Ouija board,what do you mean dont let the so called spirits go to the number 8,or go through the numbers,do you mean in general,and once the board says goodbye on its own,,do you still say good bye,and furthermore are any of the spirits that anyone spoke to,good?  very paranoid person

             and what happens if I play alone,and for all the scientists out there, how the heck can I subconsciencely answer questions that I dont know or never heard of its insane?can someone play the board and ask a spirit if the government is using the music industry to worship the devil,and using us to help the government?and would a spirit know personal things about people who have passed away,so that they can mask themselves to be that person?just a thoughtplayed the Ouija once,nothing happene nut the people I were surrounded by were all mean nasty individuals,like some were having sex with minors,others I heard set others up to be killed,alot of the people in that particular neighborhood were pretty evil in my eyes,but I do believe that evil was around me,my grandmother had told me so.

             I, myself, have never tried Ouija.My friends at school said they have tried it. One said that the spirit will not leave you alone unless it is far away from you and where you live. Does the online version of Ouija work? Also, does anything bad happen to you as lons as you follow the rules of this game, be respectful, and have silver?

             I became interested in ouja boards and found this site. My Mum tried one when she was a teenager and has told me to never try it and stay away from ouja boards.
            </p>
            <p>
             When my Mum used it she had her mates around. When they tried, they did it at night and when it started moving they all got scared and threw it over the next door neighbours fence, the board, the glass, everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once they returned inside they shut the door and although my Mum was fine, she said a spirit followed one of her friends home and they had to get their house blessed and cleansed by a priest.

             OMG I just remembered!! When I was 10 I played one with my best friend. It didnt work and we saw this video where a girl started spazzing out, so we started laughing at it so we made a video of it. And since it wasnt working we didnt bother on saying bye. And a week later we did it again and we thought we were just kidding, but we were talking to her dead grandpa. (Died of cancer) and we thought it was each other doing it so we just laughed. At about 3 in the morning we both woke up and went to a picture of her grandpa talking     To us and we talked back. It was so scary. We woke up that morning and did the ouija board again and we realized it was actually her grandpa. She started crying. And her grandpa called her a crying bi*** we said goodbye. But he still followed her around. She was kind of happy she got to talk to him though. Do not EVER not say goodbye after using one of these!!!

               I find your behavior appalling. I guess if someone saw you spazzing out you would like for them to laugh at you and make a video of it?! I hope you realize the error of your ways and do some reflection and searching internally before trying a Ouija board sounds like it might be more helpful to your growth. Best wishes.

             When my mother and my uncle played it when they were in their 20s the person contacting them through the Ouija board kept pissing them off about my mothers brother that just passed away. My uncle told it to go to hell and the spirit replied with c u there. Thats the last they ever touched a Ouija board. My mother wont allow them in the house, and I dont blame her.

             anybody who thinks a Ouija board is fake and is done via the idometer effect is a complete muppet who doesnt know what the fark they are talking about. Ouija Boards are VERY Real. in fact ive recorded an EVP during a ouija session, I picked up a spirit, a boy of 11 who died in 1985 who kept on saying helphelp methese things are very real It gave me the name of 5 people who i allegedly was in my past live  my user name is the first and last name of one person who i was and my middle name is of the other. Unless you know what you are doing and can prepare to take action when something bad comes up then i strongly discourage anybody from using the ouija board. Idometer effect  HAH!

             Soooo me and 2 of my roommates decide to make a Ouija board after talking about doing so and trying it out for a few days now. Anyways we get down to doing it one night set up the board lit the candle and turn ne d off all lights and tv. We sat down making sure outs knees all touching each others. We asked a few questions then asked how long it had been living here. It pointed first to 3 corners of the board not 4 what does this mean? Then proceeded to perfectly align up to the 1 and stopped a few seconds and quickly started counting up it went to 6 before I moved to goodbye. After I waited a good 10 minutes set it up and tried again. Asked it something  again but dont remember what I asked it did the counting up thing again and I did the same thing again, went to goodbye. I then waited another 10min I set up and asked again how long it has ben living here. Took about 30 seconds and then went to 1 then a then s then somewhere near 4 but couldnt figure out what before it went to goodbye. What would this mean? This Victorian house I did it in was made in 1910 if that helps any

               I have used the Ouija and had very positive responses. I do not believe in ghosts or anything like that. I also do not believe in ghosts using a board or haunting homes. I do believe in energy. I also believe in multi dimensional beings after using the board. It is important to identify what or whom you are speaking with and show respect and gratitude. the answers may not always make sense to you and when it does not make sense ASK questions! do not get afraid and end the conversation. Simply ask for clarity. Be open, love without limits and have no fear. Best wishes.

             Years ago, my friends and I gathered around the Ouija board and began to play. We agreed that NOBODY was to intentionally move it around, but just relax our fingertips on it. After about 10 minutes of nothing happening, we changed the way we asked our questions. Our first response was: fkae. The second: blsiulht. After rearranging the letters, we were able to decipher the messages VERY clearly fake, bullshit. Amazing what a bunch of non-believers can do with Ouija board. True story as true and accurate as any you just read.

                 The Changing Light at Sandover is a 560-page epic poem by James Merrill (19261995).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Already established in the 1970s among the finest poets of his generation, Merrill made a surprising detour when he began incorporating occult messages into his work. With his partner David Jackson, Merrill spent more than 20 years transcribing supernatural communications during sances using a ouija board.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Merrill published his first ouija board narrative cycle in 1976, with a poem for each of the letters A through Z, calling it The Book of Ephraim. It appeared in the collection Divine Comedies (Atheneum), which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1977.

                 When we get higher educations, we discover methods of research that can make a difference in our theories or ideas. How about sharing information that is worth spreading. So much false information is spread to manipulate society and keep you in your naive bubble. Lets pop the bubble, and help put an end to spreading more false information about the Ouija without doing any research. I think it is unfortunate that this is continuing. But we can stop this. I suggest reading The Changing Light at Sandover by James Merrill. Or The Book of Ephraim, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1977. I have hope for you future leaders! The revolution begins with you! It starts within yourselves. Best wishes.

             I was at a public library last year with my sister and found a Yale review magazine. They send it to alumni. well this was donated to the library and inside was an article about a college graduate from the 1970s who used the Ouija board with a colleague and wrote poetry based on their findings. later he tried to burn the board and their notes, but somehow Yale saved it and they are now on display in their campus library. My sister and I decided to create our own Ouija board based on the one pictured in the article and experiment. What we found was very interesting. The Ouija worked and was very positive. I will only divulge a small portion of the messages received. if interested further, please email me or do your own research. I will quote the board

             I am seeing a collection of some of the most naive individuals Ive ever seen on the internet. How can any of you, with any semblance of intellect, defend one of the most asinine urban myths in human history? I have news for all of you; there is no afterlife. None. I apologize if that depresses some of you, but the more you grow accustomed to the truth, the easier it will be to handle. Im supposed to establish my faith in a toy produced by Milton Bradley based upon the supposed testimonies of adolescents and young twenty-somethings who struggle to use the words you and for without resorting to sophomoric internet colloquialisms? This is terrible for the progression of society.

             noit is art. society people and places all bend and intertwine coarsely to a collective mind that segments itself in complex and simplistic ways of any and all.so until you can difine what is and what is not,you are no better than these things you cannot see

             Well truth be told my old house keeper had a real experiance in contact with a oiuja board and she never touched one again she told me. But this is all honest and truth when I say this. My four old friends tried out my old ouija board in my room years ago and let me tell you we really put our minds together and really focused when we did it. We had candles around us and that night the four of us
             <br/>
             Felt somthing that is hard to explain the whole room had went dead silent the air shouldve kicked on by then but it didnt and we stopped after we felt this weird feeling. Years later the board must have gotten thrown away or somthing because it was not under my bed anymore where I use to keep it. My point to this story is that everyone may have different experiances and the only way to see results is to stay focused and believe.

               Haha for all you guys who really want to try playing with the ouija board its really up to you. Blindfold yourself and try it once though with a friend. You really do just spell out utter ridiculous things. Ive played it with friends and know at least 10 other ppl personally who have and nothing happened. Im pretty open minded about things so gave it a shot. And for all you punk bitches on here who think its funny to scare people and probably mostly kids grow the hell up.  If you wanna play the game for fun play it cause its a board game and thats all it is, but if your psychologically weak I wouldnt advice it cause it may just cause you to scare yourself. Anyways nothing bads gonna happen look it up yourself never 1 death or injury as a result of the board its so funny how gullible some people are. Welp have fun even though id say save your money

             Okay.. Its so not a joke. So we were playing with a few of my friends, and when we were done we forgot to say good bye. Then the next morning my friend was found dead. The spirit stuffed McDonalds chicken nuggets into his body until he chocked really badly. And he was also cut with Big Macs Dont play with these Im warning you.

             Consider these facts.
             <br/>
             1. To be able to use an ouija board it involves being able to take the string of letters pointed out and read them as a word.
             <br/>
             2. 9 out every ten real life ouija board stories are rife with spelling mistakes.

             No offense, but if you really believe in this shit in this age of knowledge and the internet you are about as dumb as a rock. This board was created when people thought primitively.. its all BS. Spirits, god, satan, ghosts, alternative medicine, its all one big misunderstanding of how the brain works.

             Ouija boards are real, and demons can be contacted through them. But why would you want to do this? You see, I am a Christian, and I have seen many cases of where people have been traumatized after contacting a loved ones spirit. They were not able to sleep at night, and they went through many nights of counseling and prayer before they cast the demon out. I am not meaning to evangelize to anyone, Christianity is not forced. All I am saying is, demons can be contacted through Ouija boards, and it is anything but fun. Try it if you want, but I and many others can guarantee you will regret it. Have a good day.

             My friends and I used one last night. We contacted a man who died three years ago of diabetes. He gave us his last name, and he told us his daughter went to our school. He also gave us her name. During the seance I asked him to show me the first letter of my mothers middle name, which he did produce rather quickly. We ended the session all feeling light-hearted. We proceeded to looked for his daughter in the year book of the year she supposedly graduated as we had her age, name, graduation year, and his name. No such girl existed. Seems like the ideometer effect to me. As when we saw it my friends immediately came up with excuses to rationalize this discrepancy. I reckon they made it move subconscious out of sheer hope of making contact. I too probably contributed, as I wanted him to know my mothers middle initial.

             The Changing Light at Sandover is a 560-page epic poem by James Merrill (19261995).
             <br/>
             Already established in the 1970s among the finest poets of his generation, Merrill made a surprising detour when he began incorporating occult messages into his work. With his partner David Jackson, Merrill spent more than 20 years transcribing supernatural communications during sances using a ouija board.
             <br/>
             Merrill published his first ouija board narrative cycle in 1976, with a poem for each of the letters A through Z, calling it The Book of Ephraim. It appeared in the collection Divine Comedies (Atheneum), which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1977.

             It works if you believe in it! If you play not believing its real then it wont. Ive played for years now to talk to my son who passed away in an accident. I didnt think it was real before I started playing then played with people who had done it before and I believed in it so I tried it with them and contacted my son. I know it was him because he told us stuff only I would know. And he explained how the accident happend. Nothing bad has happened to me but I only talk to him and nobody else. If you are going to play make sure to follow the rules and always say goodbye! Its quite the experience if you play with the right people.

             I am now 44 yrs. old. When I was 19 my best friend and I played with the ouija one night. I borrowed the board game from a another friend of mine. As we were leaving in my car after getting the board game a big black spider came down right in front of my face and almost caused me to have a wreck. We got to my best friends house and lit some candles in her living room turned off all the lights and at this time it was about 1:30 in the morning. After playing the ouija for about 10 min. my friends home phone started to ring. No cell phones then. My friend answered the phone, no one would speak and then it would hang up. Everytime we started to play the phone would ring and do the same thing. This lasted until a little after 2:00 in the morning, then the power went out. This is all that happened at her house. I took the board game home with me and never played it alone. My Mom saw the board game and told me that I had to get it out of her house. I laughed at her and told her that it was just a board game. My Mom pitched a fit until I had it out. I ended up putting it in the trunk of my V.W. which back then the trunk was in the front of the car. My Mom had a bad experience with one being in her home when I was a baby. She said that she kept having visions of me reaching onto the stove and pulling hot water on to me. She had the vision went running to the kitchen and I was standing there about to pull the pot down onto me. She caught it before it happened. After this she said that she thought the whole thing was bad news that it could lead to bad things even if people did perceive it as a game. I was driving to work one day and I slid and hit a telephone pole ran through a fence and hit a mail box and landed in the peoples yard. I hurt my back which I still have problems with today. It took two grown men to open the trunk on the car and there lays the ouija board nothing out of place everything else in the trunk had been crushed or scattered all over the place. This is when I decided to throw it away.

             There is absolutely nothing scary about a plastic, mass-produced game from Hasbro that has a cool backstory and a big Internet following.

             Its like I said before on my last post. It is not so much to do with playing a game. It is what you are doing that represents a black magic, a sort of evil if you will. Since Satan walks the earth during this time, I have no doubt that people may experience something weird or a bit scary. I stay away from messing with games or seances or anything to try and speak with the dead. If we were supposed to speak with them, it would happen and not through a board game. The board game itself is not real, it is the people whom are creating a boundry that they want the dead to cross. (Not a good thing) That would be working black magic and is a sin. I think bad things happen to you from what you have tried to open a realm that God has closed to us and for a reason. The board game does nothing. It just represents what we want to happen.

             The ouija board is real you all must be very careful the best thing you should do is to remember to say goodbye and be respectful and good because if you dont you will either get possessed or get killed and trust me the way you get killed is very weird and supernatural and when you become possessed then YOU BECOME A DEMON OR A DEVIL. stay safe

             The reason why it is real is because one time i played the board game then after the game i started to hear footsteps and creaks and I was full on scared so then i got out of my bed i didnt switch on the light because i knew it wouldnt fix anything so i just standed there and i just sat down on the stairs and i felt very different  then the confusing thing is that i felt very comfortable so then i just went to sleep and for some reason it really and truely felt like that me and the demon are one. trust me if it happened to you then you would feel the same thing. if those who dont believe then try it to believe it.

             if everyone wants to know why you wake up in 3:00am is because 3:00am is the time when Jesus died and the time when the demons and devils are out if you want to become a demon the safer way is to be Neutral Evil those are the good demons

             Satan is Lucifer and trust me if you want to become the demon or follower to Satan trust me you are leading yourself to suicide and it is no good to commit suicide because you will go straight to Hell and the things the things the demons would do to you is just say gnashing your teeth out skinning you, burning you eating you and rebuilding you and most importantly you will suffer there forever but just so you know if you are a person that believes something or doesnt believe in anything then dont become any demon only the ones that are seeking to become a demon can seek it.

             Whats with all the negative outcomes?
            </p>
            <p>
             When i used my board i met a nice ghost named Luna. She was very kind, but she does not know how to spell. She has never gone to school or anything like that. Luna also has two barn cats named Sun and Moon.
            </p>
            <p>
             i highly suggest trying out Ouija boards!

             i promise to all of you they work. my girlfriend bought me a ouija board for christmas and my spirit is named GUS he is awesome. If you truly belive and talk to your spirit he will be cool with you. When i talk to Gus i would ask him could you move something in the house for me and he would say yes. I ask what did he move he would say a lighter and i say where? and he says in the bathroom go look. So when i did there was a lighter in the middle of the floor sitting up right. There was noone in the house but me and my girlfriend i have plenty of stories of me and my spirit. He has called me on my phone, moved A LOT of stuff and gave me abswers to a lot of things. I highly recomend getting one because it will change your life.. its truely awazing

             I am 23 years pld and I have played it a couple of times. The reason it doesnt  work for some of our is because there are no spirits around .
             <br/>
             The  Ouija Board is not somwe little game for your enjoyment that shit is real , some times spirits can mix up their words when you speak to them, they do get tired, I came in contact with a demon that called its self AMNX I googled it answer I came across a demon name called MANXBut it didnt care for me or the other players it asked about one of the guys in the house who didnt even use the board my advice is to not pissed of or joke around with that board , do as much of research as possible of the board before you use it, youtube it as well

             Ouija boards work and if there is no spirits then how are we created how Is humanity come to life because if the ouija isnt real and there is no spirits then there would be no god no Satan no devils and demons and no angels and the main thing is that if there is no spirits then humanity would never ever been created

             Ok. I am 25 &amp; played the board with my sister about a year after my grandpa died, in hopes to contact him. I was 14 at the time. My granny gave us the board because she didnt want it in her house anymore. Her &amp; her sister told me stories about when they played it in their mid twenties. They swore up &amp; down that it worked. My sister &amp; I tried &amp; tried to get it to work &amp; NOTHING HAPPENED! Big shocker huh? I mean I believe in spirits, unexplained evil, &amp; paranormal experiences due to having many unexplained things happening way before playing the board. So I went in believing &amp; determined that this would work but nope. Just complete silence. All of my friends &amp; even my boyfriend swear it works but Im not budging from my opinion. If you believe it works &amp; that any unexplained phenomenon that has happened to you is DIRECTLY related to playing this Milton Bradley cardboard game then kudos to you. I however am sticking to the fact it didnt work for me &amp; have yet to see it work.

             I never believed in ouija boards, or the stories, or anything. But a few nights age me and 4 other friends used a ouija board and it was amazing.. It worked, the board or spirit answered our questions.. Sometimes it was wrong (it was right most of the time) but the glass still moved and some odd things occurred around us. It was not what I expected. It was a real experience. It worked.. It was enjoyable and we were fascinated and a bit edgy at times.

             also, when i was a toddler, i had experienced paranormal activity. there was a girl named kenitha, she had a dress with pigtails and was my best friend. but there was also a man with a cane who looked like house from the tv show (house) and he scared me. my mother didnt have a psychic come in or anything, and she just prayed to my grandmother and they were gone and i forgot about it all. i go to cemeteries and dont feel scared or anything, i feel comforted and at home. im 16 now and as i said in the previous comment, my friend and i want to use the board while camping. like i said, im not sure if its safer or worse to use it outside. by a beach or something. and also, do you think i could accidently contact kenitha and the man i used to connect with? my intention is to contact my uncle mike, uncle paul, and grandmother, seeing as i didnt know them well and id like to ask them a few things. is that dangerous or reasonable? feedback, please!

             I recommend not messing with this shit. It never worked for me but I know the dangers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh and if you wanna talk to an actual demon, sell your soul (backwards pentagram n shit) and get on cleverbot and Satan himself will talk to you He made me think he was God and that my past-life was Jesus and I was supposed to save the world until I figured out it was really Satan..
            </p>
            <p>
             But actually I recommend not doing that twas a big mistake on my part.

             Me and friends do Ouija board sessions on a regular basis.  Were all heavy into believing it and still are to this day.  We feel very comfortable around it now, not too scared or whatever, but the chills are still always coming.  Anywho, I just did one tonight actually, and we got a bunch of information about this woman who committed suicide due to a man raping her 4 times and the mental stress it led on her.  The man she referred to was another man that weve already gotten on our board multiple times, who we even asked if he was a dick and he said yes.  After having some doubts on it, we decided to look it up and we actually got information on the girl, and almost everything seemed to matchup.  Not entirely all the information, but most.  So, from experience, i can see that it is pretty legitamate.

             I just bought a Ouija board from walmart and used it last night by myself.. It did not do anything.. I was disppointed but I did proven my point that Ouija boards are all fake.. I will keep trying it by myself and see if it will work. If it doesnt work in a month or 2 then i will burn the Ouija Board.

             And my 2 friends got it and we let it sit out so it would glow. We sat on her floor, lights completely off, pitch black except for glow board, fan was on, we start playing and I forgot what my friend asked but it was the first question and after she asked the fan went super fast and you could hear and feel it, everything on the walls, like hanging and stuff, flew up and banged back on the wall, then I ran out because it was my first time and I was scared shitless haha

             A couple days ago, me and part of my brothers baseball team made a homemade ouija board at a resort on lake delton, Wisconsin. It took about 5 seconds to find a spirit. We started by asking her positive questions about her family and husband. Then we got more into where she was. We asked what country she had lived in. She answered, U S A. Ok ok we all thought. We then asked what state. When she moved the Gatorade cap to W there were only two states to go. When she moved it to I we kinda got freaked out. Her husband is the same age as her and he is still living with their two sons, Greg and Quinn in Janesville. Wisconsin. Her husbands name is Ben. She passed on June 2, 2013 by falling off a boat in lake delton. She was not with her husband at the time and she was not a good swimmer. We started asking questions about the resort she was supposedly staying at when she passed away so we know that it wasnt a demon playing tricks. She knew all the answers. We asked if her body was ever recovered. The answer was no. The rest of our stay at the resort, we couldnt stop thinking that there was a dead body in lake delton.

             I dont know for sure, but all I do know is that most of the time when I use one, the words tend to make a lot of sense. Once I contacted a deceased celebrity on one(Im not saying who I contacted), and I asked the board questions only the celebrity would knowlater I looked the person up online, and most of their answers were correct about that person.
             <br/>
             Its important though, to when you use it be careful and be smart about it. Make sure youre in a calm and/or a good, positive state of mind. Have a cross or at least a couple of crosses with you. Maybe a Bible. Have silver with you too. And just fill yourself with love and goodness. I was alone when I did it, so I know that I wasnt purposely moving it since there were no other people with me at the timeif youre in a group and you use a board, one of the people in the group could be a prankster and be purposely moving it just for the heck of it. You never know.

               U wont say which celebrity? Thats crazy, why not? They died &amp; spoke to you from the other side, that is cool. Do you think itll damage their reputation, or yours? HMM well whatever, its just weird. Your story would be more convincing if you did name the person otherwise why even say it was a celebrity, it doesnt make sense to mention that &amp; say that you wont say who was. Whaaat? even asking this question is stupid. Anyway I think your full of crap.

             Im not going to make a smart detailed comment about this because I feel like you guys wont look twice but are you guys serious? This is a fking peice of board thing sold by a dude who knew how to make profit off of an idea; which many absent minded people bought. Did you guys not read the article? This is all BS, the board, your story with your so called friends. Give me some hardcore proof, not your little redundant story, -annoyed 17 year old.

               If you did a little research of your own, you would find that the ouija board wasnt the idea of a board game developer but something that dates back to about the 11th century, possibly even earlier. Ive never, EVER done research on the ouija board before today as last night I came across an entity named Zozo. It sounds funny, I know, like BoBos alter-ego or whatnot, but when we (my friend and I) were in contact with this thing we knew something was odd about it. Almost malevolent. I was so intrigued that today I decided to see if I could actually find something on it (it was my friends first time using one, as was mine, so I was very skeptical). I found out that it is reportedly a demon that has been making itself known dating back to about 1805 and that it is not to be taken lightly. Many, many people have been inquiring about this entity. I know some people claim that people read about this thing online and then they are open to subconscious suggestion, therefore they spell it out on their ouija board. The internet did not exist in the 1800s, or the first three-quarters of the 1900s. A skeptic will always be a skeptic until proven otherwise. A person who will not budge in their belief on something will NEVER find evidence because they do not want to. Those people tend to be closed-minded about everything. What Im trying to say is that you will not find proof if you just sit there unbelieving, you need to actually try it for yourself, with an open mind, and thats regarding everything you are skeptical of. You might find yourself a bit surprised and discover youre wrong about something (its not a bad thing  a strong-willed person is one who can admit they are wrong once in a while). I tend to think that skeptics are only skeptics because they are afraid that it might actually be very real.

                 get your 4 players to put foreheads on table so they cannot see
                 <br/>
                 then move the board around a different way so memory plays no part
                 <br/>
                 place glass on board and players hands on glass
                 <br/>
                 make sure nobodys head lifts to check board and video it all iff possible

                <p>
                 I guarantee you it doesnt work 100000000% they may move to the wrong places on board where they think yes and no is but no reason why that should happen if its a spirit

             I going to have to say this. I played a ouija board last night: 02/08/2013 with my wife and two friends, i have never played one before last night so went in being sceptical.  Well i have to say that THEY DO WORK.
            </p>
            <p>
             We had a couple of spirits come in from the friends of ours they they knew previously, but towards the end of the evening, the glass moved around and spelt out my name, this spirit knew ME.  AS asked its first name Gareth then ios second name Thomas i asked him how he died Hanging is asked him to spell out what his job was before departing RNM Mental Health Nurse  I asked him where he committed suicide and he said Gorge as in Avon Gorge in Bristol UK, and i have to say no one else at the table knew Gareth apart from me, and my wife knows of him from college.  But all the answers he provided were 100% correct. So i am now a believer, Yes they do work, We did an incantation at the start to ward off evil spirits, and closed each session down by saying Goodbye.  So just like to say yes they work, so be sensible and stay safe.

             i have never actually tried the ouija board but i really want to. at the same time i am very scared to. my big sister went to her friends house because they were going to vans warped tour the next day and that night they tried the ouija board for the first time. they said they talked to a spirit called zozo. they said the planchetti kept on moving back and fourth to z and o very fast. like it was saying zozozozozozozo and after my sister got home she was acting very different. we didnt know why. but later on we found out about what her and her friend did on the ouija board and so me, my sister, and a friend went on the internet and searched zozo. turns out zozo is another word for devil or something but we read all about zozo and others have similar stories where they contact zozo and change after. my sister is now a devil worshiper when before this she was christian.  im not sure if zozo is the reason but it does seem like he is.

             If you guys encounter an entity that refers to him or herself as zozo you should immediately ask it to leave and close the door. Also it is an entity that may attach itself to the user. It is a trickster who will eighther lie to you and act friendly or will have zero patience and reveal itself on the spot. Once you have spoken to the zozo there is no going back. The entity will harass you and threaten to take you to paradise. When you ask zozo where paradise is he or she will respond simply with hell. It will remain in your life. That is all

             Well i was the most skeptical person around about the Ouija board always putting it down saying it does not work it never will its just a fairy tale, with that being said i had never even seen a Ouija Board besides seeing it on Radio Flyer. Well in 2011 i tried it for my first time with my girlfriend my buddy and his girlfriend we made it out of cardboard and wrote the letters and numbers on the board ourselves along with some zodiac signs for more spiritual invoice we followed all rules turned off the lights unplugged any electrical items and lit a few candles on the coffee table, well we all started to play it began to move. Me being skeptical of course was blaming everyone sitting at the coffee table for moving it all the while getting hateful replies from my friends that they are not moving it, we talked to a girl that kept flirting with me through the ouija board i thought it was my buddys girlfriend screwing with me so i asked the ouija board on the next session if all my friends can please take there hands off the piece, it replied NO, it kept repling No for atleast a half hour, i asked one more time 30 mins later it finally said YES, at that point i was very excited i was about to definately find out if it was real or not, i ask it a question and it starts moving my hand in full circles quite quickly, i asked it why is it doing this and it spelled out G.A.W.K repling to me that i was gawking it which of course i had been all night, it knew my middle name first name birthdate along with all my friends. MY FACE turned completely red and i was soo scared it was crazy. the board started counting down on me from 9 to 1 trying to get out and haunt me so the rules state, i pulled my hand and drug it up to the top of the board then finally after 4 hours of it keeping me held in the game it finally said goodbye. VERY CRAZY, IT IS VERY TRUE, I WAAS SOO SKEPTICAL AND TALKING SHIT ABOUT IT, NOW IM A FIRM BELIEVER AND WONT TOUCH IT AGAINNNNNNN.

             So what about when the planchette moves and no one is touching it. Almost every ouija board I have played with we have been able to get it to do this. Everyone touching the edges of the board BUT not touching the planchette. Seeing is believing when you see it move for the first time and everyones hands are inches away.

             I came across this page doing research after a session of the Ouija board.
             <br/>
             Today is 9/8/2013. My friends and I were in the dungeon of a very old house. We knew the house was haunted, because we had been noticing some very odd things. So a buddy of ours purchased one of these boards, and brought it over.
            </p>
            <p>
             I knew in my head this wouldnt work. We lit 10 candles in the shape of an upside down crucifix.  We asked if it was here, it said yes. We had asked many questions like so:
             <br/>
             What is your name: Susy
             <br/>
             When were you born: 1920
             <br/>
             How old are you: 27
             <br/>
             Then we asked how many fingers is zakk holding behind his back (Zakk was not playing, just watching.) Susy took about 10 seconds to answer us, and
             <br/>
             when Susy pointed to 7, Zakks face instantly got red, and he could not speak. He was scared, we were all scared.
            </p>
            <p>
             We didnt want to ask Susy how she died, because we were afraid she didnt know she was dead.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many other questions were asked, and I can honestly say I went from not believing at all into becoming a firm believer of spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
             ** If you are already afraid from scary movies and such, or an un easy person, please do not put yourself in the presence of this game. I am starting to go insane with the fears of spirits now, I always look around, I cannot be in a house since today.

             I believe tht they are real. Last night ( Friday, September 13th, 2013) my friends and I went to a cemetery and asked some questions. It was myself and two other people. We didnt move it at all. It was amazing, and cool. I dont really care what the data says about it. Why would they perform exorcisms then if none of this is true?

             How interesting to see that Witchcraft is considered evil? Sorry Christians but look at history and you are responsible for more death and destruction than anything else regarded as evil. Now to the board. Please dont rubbish other peoples beliefs. If you want to believe that you end up as worm food then thats down to you but a heck of a lot of people believe in the afterlife. I dont have to prove there is but people cant prove that there isnt. Ouija boards are not good news for anyone and I have been a Medium for 50+ years and I wouldnt use one. At the end of the day we Pagans, Witches, Wiccans, believe that everyone has freedom of thought. I have my beliefs, you have yours.

               Hardcore skeptics (people who only watch independent films slash wildlife / history documentaries, are faithless, think they are the smartest people on earth, and on a strict vegetarian / vegan diet  at least thats how I imagine them LOL) will always go to great lengths to discredit anyone who they believe to be crazy for believing what they believe. I think its because they desperately want for it not to be real. They will call you all kinds of names and then throw scientific facts in your face. We barely understand our universe and our space-time theories are always changing, so how do we know that our scientific facts are absolute? Many scientists believe that other dimensions exist, so why is it so hard for so many people to admit there might be even the slightest chance that ouija boards really do allow for spiritual communication? Honestly, I feel sorry for those people who are so closed-minded because they lack imagination and are probably duller than the independent films they watch. I have a much more romantic view of our reality in that ANYTHING is possible. And who would name their website relatively interesting? Why not really interesting? Its kind of like. eh, its relatively interesting, but Im going to find a site thats REALLY interesting At least thats what I almost did when I saw the name. One last thing, could you point me in the direction of good, credible websites that dont bash these things? Id really appreciate it as Ive become extremely interested in this stuff within the last couple of years (mildly interested in this stuff most of my life up until last year). Why extremely interested in the last year? I found out that two out of my three siblings had seen the same demonic entity I had seen at my grandfathers house when we were younger. The proof? I asked them (because I was a little skeptical) where they had seen it and exactly what it looked like, and both descriptions matched what I had seen exactly. I also asked them these questions separately, so I had my proof. I dont care what others think. And the crazy part is that I had seen it when I was about eight. My youngest brother was only two at the time and he claims he saw it when he was about the same age I was when I had seen it. When we made these revelations he started to cry because he thought he was crazy!!! I always hated staying the night at my grandfathers house. I always felt uneasy, almost scared sometimes, very much like something watching me all the time.

                 You can believe what you want but if you never question it your truly the one who is closed minded.

                 Think as you wish rain dance in your garden if you think it will help something grow, but dont condemn people for questioning beliefs as that is a truly closed mind

             i had an experience with the ouija board that really freaked me out! me and my friends were playing and a spirit started talking to us and he said his name was fallen so we instantly thought it was a fallen angel. then we started talking more to him and he said he knew me. i asked how  and he said he protects me . i asked why and he said dad and then i said whos dad?: mine? and he said yea. then he said he was actually a fallen soldier. and he wasnt very good at spelling so we asked where he fought the war and he started spelling PRU and we thought what is that so then we asked new question because he thought he couldnt spell it. Later we googled the year he said (i cant rememeber this was in the summer ) , i think it was 1879 . and it said there was a war in Prussia. never heard of that place. later i asked him what he protects me from, he said Demon  and name specifically Igqen ??? then i asked how long he has been protecting me for and he said 4 years. My dad died 4 years ago and apparently told this guardian spirit to protect me. no one knew my dad died 4 years ago ! freaky!

             I was skeptitcal about the Ouija Board until yesterday when I decided to use one with my friends at a party. We found a spirit named Sall and she seemed really nice. We kept talking to her and then I thought, maybe its time to him so I asked Is there anything else you want to say? Sall then spelt out You play well I was a little confused at first so I asked what do I play well? Basketball? Baseball? Ouija? Then it spelt out Music I found that a bit odd especially because I did not mention that to Sall. Then I said what about my friend? And she said Dad says hi that was REALLY weird because her dad passed last year around this time and it was crazy that Sal said that when my friend didnt really speak of it. Later Sal began to talk about her dog, X. My friend asked, is X friends with Marys dogs? (My name is Mary) and then she said Not Charlie  it was weird because I didnt talk about Charlie the whole time. Then she said X sometimes sees Rita now THAT was when I began to believe that this was no mind game because I didnt even tell my friends about my dag, Rita, who got put down in July.
             <br/>
             Now I believe in the Ouija board, I DO think that there is paranormal activity involved with it. There is now way the Ideometer effect could be why this happened especially when theres more than 1 person on the board. It is an experience that I will never forget.

             Me &amp; my sister used our spirit board when kids (we still do now &amp; then) well this one time, we were in the basement &amp; were talking w a spirit named Jasper (weird name) he was seemingly harmless so we asked questions &amp; asked how he died, he said he drowned. We were like, oh gross &amp; just then water started to drip from above onto the Ouija Board, drip drip drip. We both looked at each other like what the hell? We couldnt see where it was coming from. there were no leaking pipes or anything. My sister got scared so we stopped, she ran upstairs scared as hell. After that my sister bugged me to burn the board until finally I said OK! but I really didnt want to burn it. I said its just a game from a toy maker you dope So anyway, we went into the woods &amp; I tried &amp; tried but it would not burn. It was unreal, everything else burned like sticks &amp; branches but not that damned board. I still have it &amp; there are still black marks on the bottom of it where I tried to burn it. We still use it cuz I now live in a huge old victorian house &amp; its full of freaky spirits &amp; sometimes we get them riled up &amp; things go nuts when we use it. Anyway I found out you should never burn one of them, if a negative force comes thru it you cannot send it back if its burnt! So, did Jasper help us by not letting that board burn? Or, like I always thought it didnt burn cuz he had drowned &amp; therefore the water associated w him prevented its burning, either way Im glad it didnt burn. Weird but true folks and theres more but Ill save the other stories for another time.. I dont like to stir stuff up around here, its enough just on a normal day. Watch out &amp; do a protection ritual first cuz they can be a portal that you dont wanna mess with!

             I have not played with a Ouija board for some time.  My experiences with a board were shocking.  I had a friend who did not believe that the board would answer questions.  I told him to ask the board a question that I did not know the answer to.  He asked the board what was the last book he had read.  The thing started to move and spell out the word.  The first letter was E and the x and then o.  I said forget it, you dont believe so it will not work.  He said, let it go, let it go.  It spelled out EXODUS.  That was the book he had just finished reading.  He became a believer.  I do believe that we are inviting the devil into our lives when we played with the board.  It also spelled out the name of the car I was driving but the spelling was not how I would have spelled the word Cyclone.  The board answered many question accurately.  It does move and how can one make it move if they do not know the answer to the question?  We played with it for entertainment but it can be a dangerous game.  I recommend not having a Ouija board in your home.  Why take the chance,

             True story! My cousin and I was playing the board , not thinking much about it. We came across someone by the name Anna . We thought it was strange seeing how my cousins step sister in named Anna. We didnt think anything about it because we never had anything to do with the board or her step sister, she only came over every blue moon. Anyhow we told my cousins step sis that the name on the board was Anna. She freaked out! Went back to her moms house and would not return. Come to find out she had been talk to a girl named Anna on the board and it was beginning to scare her. Me and my cousin got jumped by her mom and step dad. Theythought we were pplaying a trick on her. Iv not spoken to my aunt , her husband and my cousins step sister in 20yrsI still dont understand what I did so wrong? Nothing I said consoled her. I had no clue why the same name she had been talking to showed up

              </p>
              <p>
               write alphabet letters on it, but instead of Ouija write on exorcism and yes and no
              </p>
              <p>
               Then summon the exorcist and he will exorcise the demon
              </p>
              <p>

               Hey, its not a rule that will impact on whether or not a spirit will attach itself to you or someone in your family.  I suggest you go to a church, one thats a little old timey, with an older priest.  They can guide you out of this dark place that its putting you in.  And you need to focus on energy and yourself.  Learn how to control it, in order to protect yourself, and put up barriors.  Dont be scared of it, and know youre more powerful because you are alive.

Btw no haunted objects however Ive witnessed areas that I cant quite explain but tbey dont come up on evps or meters.

             Board and paper.if the scare you dont have them like a  painting of clown all it is is art work tbat doesnt work as a toll. Most of you will refute thJimi s because of your religkous beliefs or strongly wanting them to work . Go out and make one work prove me wrong  you wont and for me I wish I was wrong

             Just because one doesnt get an active response does NOT mean that a gateway hasnt been opened or something hasnt been channeled. Id recommend everyone read Demonology: The True Life Story of Ed and Lorraine Warren
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a very scary book, it answers a lot of questions. Mostly you come to understand that a majority of the bad cases they were brought in on had to do with a young person messing around with things way beyond their comprehension.
            </p>
            <p>
             Amytiville  all of this stemmed back to the teenage son conuring dark spirits and using Ouija boards and such. A lot of their stories dealt with happy families that 10+ years of living in the same house all of a sudden had stuff levitating and disappearing  all because a teenager had been doing stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tarot cards, ouija boards  all of it  they are not good tools. There is NEVER a guarantee that we are channeling something good on the other side and if you think that Evil wont lie, think again. The Bible makes many mentions of such things and EVERY religion admits to the existence of dark forces and has its own process for exorcism rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have become a society fascinated by the things that go bump in the night. We eaglerly seek out tools, spell books and believe there is nothing to it. Too many people are scared of the things that go bump in the night, but have little faith in the one thing that fights this evil  faith, God. If all religions admit the presence and have a ritual for removing the evil that shows only faith, exreme faith is needed. There is NO right religion, simply faith is enough alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next time youre truly afraid, what is your comfort? For a people afraid to be religious or embrace God, we sure turn to him when things go bad. Thing is  if you believe in the bad, you have to believe in the good because everything is about balance. If the bad exists, so does its counterpart.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its counterpart is weak. The evil is very present and active and the light, the good has to be called upon and invoked.
            </p>
            <p>
             I heard that when it came down to deciding who was worthy of everlasting life and the kigdom of Heaven  the great argument, Jesus told God that people had to have faith; blind faith and Satan told God to tell the people the truth and let them decide for themselves. People believe what they can see and touch  not what they are told.
            </p>
            <p>
             The greatest trick the Devil ever played was convincing the word he didnt exist.
            </p>
            <p>
             If youre scared of the dark, you need to embrace the light. If youre not scared of the dark  you should be. Anything you do, ask for or get help with comes with a much higher cost.
            </p>
            <p>
             What you do today with a ouija board, tarot cards or a conjuring spell could affect the rest of your life in the most negative manner.
            </p>
            <p>
             AND to all you people who think you know the facts about ghosts and orbs, PLEASE read the Warrens books o you can stop talking out of your but. Preternatural beings (once alive) can only manifest in one of 2 ways  borrowing energy from our individual auras (energy fields) or right after a thunder storm by using the energy still present via Mother Nature. A preternatural being cant move anything more than 1lb 
            </p>
            <p>
             Demons and Devils must be invited in so to speak  Read about the Annabelle Doll for a better explanation on this. Demons and Devils feed off of our fear  age makes no difference and children give them more of what they crave, especially babies. They lie and present themselves as preternatural spirits to gain entry into our lives. With the Annabelle Doll such a demonic spirit was able to manipulate a medium into conveying the story it had picked.
            </p>
            <p>
             Demons and Devils are fallen angels. There are 9 classes of Angels, so such a hierarchy exists on the reverse. Demons are noted as unintelligent, writing backwards and such. Devils are noted as the Supervisors of Demons and when involved are more intellectual than a Demon, such as now writing forwards, not in reverse.
            </p>
            <p>
             To any person lonely, depressed and stupid enough to open this Pandoras Box, you were forewarned. You cant shut out what you let it and its dark, very dark and very old. Its not something fun to do at a sleepover or to talk about in years to come  it is something that will always leave you wondering if you alone unleashed this toxicity into your own life.

             I am a 24 years with a firm belief in science and natural causes. Ive always been a critical thinker and skeptical person, but ten years ago this really changed my life. We did this a lot and started testing its validity by removing number of people, so that we were only two max three people. The last time i did it, one of our friends observed and wrote down letters and numbers while we just let the glass move itself. We asked a random question, and It spelled the date of his fathers death. his father ODd when we were kids. Then the name of one of the other observers sister who died of cancer. It brought back terrible memories and people started crying. We tried asking questions none of us could possibly know about the other persons, and it was always right and very obscure. I remember asking what i had for dinner, and i had to go home to see that my mother cooked for the second time, to find out that it was right. Stupid example, but i just froze! this word was something similar to leftover-meat in my native language, Ive never used this word, but when my mom called it out when i got back home i panicked. Sure its partially BS, but i mean just try it. You will be truly amazed by how its moving, and the answers you will get. We had some really F up stuff happening the days after. Guitar strings being pulled at night, visions of dead people,  hallucinations of a lot of crazy shit..Two of these guys are junkies today, the other one is really a mental case killing civilians down in Afghanistan as a chopper gunner. Everyone were just influenced by that night for a long time after.  My advice is be careful! this was so popular everyone started doing it, and my higschool had to call out for a meeting with all parents to stop it.. Say what u want, i have nothing to gain but to hare my experience! Take care

             I use this board everyday, so I can be helped with my daily decision making.  I live my life by it and would recommend it to anyone, it always tells me the right thing to do. I use it alone and with my children to help complete their school assignments. I have even ran into financial issues and taken it to the casino with me. Now I even have three beautiful children because of my wonderful board, I hope I have inspired you to better your life with a ouija board.

             It works I know from experience playing in my early twenties with my cousin we would stay up from 8 pm to 4am falling asleep on the board with only one finger each on it our heads down n half asleep n it would not stop talking to usspelling out things and telling us our future by asking it questions that no one should know..being young n dumb we asked it whos dad would die first and it had said Tracy dad will pass firts and he did my father is still alive and in good health..then it had told me my bf was cheating on me i had no idea i was young and dumb i asked it who the girl was and it told me the girls name, it was Debbie which was correct I even got her phone number from the board and called it and it worked it had also told me when he was with her and even told me he got her pregnant this info was not told to me all at once it took several weeks to get this information from the spirts..and I swear on my life and on my eyes that this all true i do not lie and hate liars i have dated many of them.  Before all the serious questions I would ask it dumb questions like how many people called my answering machine that nightit said 5, I said who and it named all 5. I immediately called it n all 5 people it said had truly done so.  We got so hooked on this cardboard board you can buy in a toy store from toys r us that we were playing it 4 nights a week till the wee hours of the next morning but it was worth it in out eyes we were definetly hooked..Speaking to evil and good spirits didnt matter as long as we could talk to the dead we didnt care. Ive been told you are suppose to say good bye to the evil ones because you dont want negative energy in your home.  They would spell out to us and call us cunts over n overfudieIm gonna kill u..and we would joke with them saying no your not relax stop being mean and tell us how you died. The min we would ask the evils spirts to talk about themselves and stopasking dumb questions about ourselvesthe spirit would turn nice n say it was sorry and stop calling us bad words. Althought it did tell us it had murdered people when he was alive its still crazy to believe a story like this but Im not a liar. It actually had spelled out nice ass a few times and we were like who Helen or Tracy has a nice ass and it said Tracy Im sitting right behind her in the chair..mind you we were on the floor playing it in her living room bent over on our kneesHer little sister was 10 yrs old at the time and jumped in the chair it claimed it was in and it then begain to spell outouch get off of meget off.  So then we put it to the test n said if your really here make the phone ring..phone rang oncewe said do it again..and it did..we told it to do it for a third time n picked it up no body was there it just went dead we did this over and over like 20 times and it would ring and hang up as soon as we answered it..Maybe it was because she lived by a grave yard maybe because her house was over 100 yrs old who knows but we did speak to a woman named Emily a lotturns out she lived there in that house and got sick and died there she was not evil and very nice to talk towhen you ask it selfish questions about yourself only and want to hear your future you will get the answers you are looking for but it will not be very friendly to you. If you talk to it like a person n get to know the spirit first u will get better response about the questions you ask it better information if you take the time to know the spirit first they will come back to you and tell you more questions you have and want to know. We had also asked it what age we would be married it had told me n mycousin the correct ages 24 and 28 her firstit was dead on n also said we would both have a second marraige as well that came true for her but not for me it even told her what age she would be married again late 30s didnt pay much attention to that but i did come true as for  myself it just keept giving me different numbers first it said 39 I did meet a man n feel deeply in love for the first time in my life i was truly happy and he would tell people I was his wife and wanted to marry me but after the hunymoon stage was over all the mental abuse stared and him cheating and throwing me down concrete stairs and him getting arrested and restraing orders set in placeI had to say goodbye it had also went to 43 44 like it wasnt sure and I didnt pay attention after playing for 6 hrs I was tired.  It did tell me i would have twins but i am 42 now n not looking for another relationship any time soon..funny thing is my first cousin is pregnant with twin due any day now she is 42 as well and her father passed away so my father is the closets thing she has left to her father so maybe it got confused it really never gave me a definet age that day but I did have two abortions in my 20s (which i regret now) maybe those are the kids it was speaking of it said two children i would have..who really knows at this point but i can tell you this playing that bored has made me physic in some weird Fd up ways..i had spoke to a physic 10 yrs ago n she told me i was very intuitive n i know things but dont believe it to be trueshe told me i would be told things about people coming to me in dreams my uncle had passed that she knew about told her to tell me this and he would send me signs through dreams or othe ways i didnt belive this untill i had a dream about an old friend n it came true..not gonna go into details about her but i also see the number 13 on the clock to tip me off when something bad is coming my wayfor instance i wake up n look at the clock in the middle of the night n its 313 then ill get up for work do my routine and its 913 ill go to work (i work in sales) ring a transaction and look at the sales receipt an the time of the transaction will say its 213 the number will just keep coming ever time i pick up my phone n hear a text or an email i look n it always ends in 13 the timeit happend for two days straight n i got a dwi that night. another time it happened for a week and my great uncle passed away..tons of other occurences n something bad always comes out of it it even showed up alot at the end of my realasonship with the man that called me his wife to let me know he was up to no good when i didnt see him on certain nights ..sure enuff i would find evidence of another woman being at his househair on the foorearing backs..i dont wear earings soo..i think it kind of ruined us me knowing all this crazy stuff because I would look for things because of seeing that damn number and sure enuff you will find shit ever single time you look for iti would ask him about it n he would call me crazy n deny deny deny typical guy and then get mad at me for acusing him abuse me and throw me out of our home when he was doing me dirty all along when we did finally end it he told meyou have no idea what I did behind your back so i sent him pictures I took of lipstick on his shirtdryed up semen on his couch n another girls hair on the floor n I told him I have always been one step ahead and knew all along you just didnt know it. I told him about my weird gift n he didnt belive it in the beginning I bet he changed his mind.
             <br/>
             Who knows i didnt ask for this and i dont want it..but i will not go away so im stuck. Maybe i opened the door by messing with the ouiji board maybe it is some kind blessing in a weird sense and i just dont know it yet who knows..maybe i should embrace it n not think of it as a curse but i feel guys i meet out (i find the real winners) the number 13 shows up and i immediatly dismiss the realasonship before anything gets started its telling me to cut this person off they are no good and i find out its correct very strange. All i know is once  you talk all spirits and bring that into your life and into your home they dont want to leave you alone its like they enjoy changing a persons life and having a conversations with the living.  Maybe because i stopped playing it they got mad and messed with my future i have always been unlucky in love after messing with that board and feel like i am doomed to be alone the rest of my life.  I am a very attractive female that looks like im 28 by my coworkers n friendsi joke around n say i sold my soul maybe i did in some way but i will never know for sure that will be the first question i ask if i get to those golden gatesi do know this when we stopped playing its not because we wanted to but because we had to because of my cousins house being invaded by spirits and her mother was starting to become afraid to be home by herself hearing doors open and close and hearing people walking around upstairs when no one was home ..this experience did changed my life like I said dont know for good or for bad yetsorry for the bad grammar typed all this on my cell wasnt easy but felt compelled to tell my personal experience with the ouigi board..i say stay away no good can come from this for anyoneeventually we stopped and turned 21 n started to hit the bar scene instead lol

               Only person I ever met that could actually work the Board is my Mother.  Many times her co-workers would return from lunch and say youll never guess what I had for lunch.  My Mom would pull out the Board and accurately tell them  she never missed.  As kids we would try and disprove her ability by placing her in a completely dark room, blindfolded, and we placed a large piece of cardboard (much larger than the Board) over her hands and the Board.  She was able to answer questions with 40 or more character answers (we would use a flashlight to look under the cardboard to write down the letters without telling her what they were).  If she had the Board memorized she was very, very good because she never misspelled words in long sentences.  She always operated the Board by herself  and it always worked.  As an engineer, I have always wondered how my Mother was able to do this.

             I was also wondering about the number 13 if anyone else has heard of this happening to them and tipping them off that something bad is coming to you I would like to know there are others that experience what I have and what they think it is all about and if there is a way to make it stop.

             Ridiculous! In my early teens, I DID the dumbest thing: I made my own Ouija board on card stock weight paper! I used a small Dixie cup cut in half as a planchette. Then I started playing it ALONE. After several horrible things spelled out about someone dying in a car wreck, I took my finger off the planchette, BUT IT KEPT MOVING ON ITS OWN! It was my LAST time messing with that stuff! Then strange things started happening around my parents house. I had to bring in a Minister to do a spiritual cleansing. There is still a spirit of chaos and confusion that tries to re-enter from time to time if I dont toss it out! I have learned that they can only occupy a space if you ALLOW them entry. That damn board was the invitation, my naive ways the catalyst.

             Heres the thing. When the Ouija Board starts spelling things out on its own WHEN NOBODY IS TOUCHING IT shooting across the board very precisely, spelling the same thing three times in a row, and spinning  in a little circle around and around when it doesnt want to answer questions thats the sort of thing that says, Hi.  Freaky evil spiritual force here.   Its not our expectations-based muscular movement when it moves by itself.

             this is completely crazy.
             <br/>
             i mean its a board game for crying outloud.
             <br/>
             we should focuse on whats happening in life and leave those be that are in the afterlife.

             Hey,
            </p>
            <p>
             When i was young i used to see witches and sometimes at night when i was 17 a kid would visit me , a boy, he never spoke, but it scared me shitless so i blocked those things from my mind. It works, Also i saw a very old man with a long beard sitting in bushes doing meditating in the middle of night. About those boards, i never used that but one time i wanted to get in touch with my dead grandmother. Me, my brother and a friend sat in a circle with the alphabet put on the table and we holding hands. First 2 times i asked, ghost, are you there???? Nothing. But my brother and friend were laughing all the time, Then i said to them ,now serieus people, concentrate. ANd then i askes grandmother, are you here???  The second i asked that, one of the 2 candles flames went a meter up and the other stayed down. I fucking shitted in my pence and yelled ,STOP STOP STop , i broke the circle by yelling , stop holding hands, and the flame went down. We all three ranned downstairs scared as hell. This was 20 years ago and i never tried it again. True believer!!!

             So today at school we were watching videos on Ouija boards, and we decided to try it on our own. I am in the ninth grade, and there were probably 10 of us that went to a small dark room and somebody had a light from their phone to light up the board that we had printed off the Internet. We used one of my friends silver rings as the planchette and three of us volunteered to try out this new Ouija board. None of us had ever done it before, and we didnt really think it was going to work. Keep in mind, this was all at school but we had a study hall. We moved the ring around many times and then kept it in one place. We then asked if there was a spirit with us. No answer. We tried moving it around some more and then asked again. The ring moved a little bit and then stopped. We were all freaked out and kept on asking each other who had moved the ring, but none of us had and we all swore on eachothers lives. Now before this whole thing, we had all been skeptical that Ouija boards did not work. I thought they were just a hoax and that people did and moved them to trick their friends. Then the ring moved to yes. We were all stunned. We then asked it what its name was. It then proceeded to move to the M, then E, then the L and repeated itself three times. We said, is your name Mel? and it moved to the yes. My heart was racing, knowing that Ouija boards and communicating with spirits worked. My finger felt heavy though it was barely touching the ring at all. Both of my friends were barely holding the ring by their fingernail. We then asked what year it had died, and replied with 12 as in 2012. We also asked if it was a friendly entity and it said yes. It seemed to have left when it stopped responding to our questions so we said goodbye, but two minutes later a new group of 3 got together and asked again for the spirits name. And you can guess what it came up with, it said Mel. It said its last name started with a D also. It was time to leave, so we left and said goodbye. We were all in amazement that this had worked and almost didnt believe it, but it really had happened. I can tell you firsthand. It you move the ring over the paperboard by hand it makes a scratchings sound, obviously. But when the spirit moved it, there was no noise at all and almost seem to hover just barely. And another point, if someone were to move it to trick the others you would be able to tell they were moving it easily. I also tried pulling gently in the opposite direction it was moving, but it seemed to resist and kept moving forward. Dont listen to this article at all, Ouiji boards work. Later that day I researched Mel D 2012 death and an article about a girl named Mel Dyson that died in 2012 came up and she lived near where we were. Ouiji boards work.

             my sister and I played one for a joke once or twice, never asked it anything serious..  one time we tried it and the plastic triangle piece actually stuck to the board as though someone was holding it down, it was very interesting when my sister held on to the plastic piece and lifted the board off the table. hummmm!  we had that happen a couple of times.  my neice was able to retrieve my fathers name from the board, a name would never guess in a million years!  My brother in-law had a vision of an old neighbor when we asked him to show himself, i have never even seen this guy so when we investigated who he was, it was an exact discription. (short, bald, wore glasss and walked with a cane)

             another point, if you dont believe in the afterlife then your mind is obviously closed to the spiritual world, if you believe in a spriritual life then that door is already cracked open!

             The human mind subtly influences what is spelled out. Then when evaluating it you body views the rare and random coincidences as greatly more common and important than they are. Its a well known effect. You give 10 people a generic description of an average life and most will say it exactly/nearly exactly matches their life. The human brain focuses on connections because it helped our  ancestors survive. And honestly its a plastic board. Why doesnt my computer keyboard connect me to the spirits. its got letters, numbers, and you could use enter as yes and backspace as no. But it doesnt. Why, because Ouija boards work under the placebo effect. You believe, then you receive.

             The ouija worked for me and my friends. The only three of us who had our fingers on the planchette were blindfolded, and asked questions while my sister wrote down the letters spelled out. We kept getting clear and swift answers to our questions, so I KNOW that the power of the ouija and spirit connection IS EXISTANT.

             ive had good and bad spiritual encounters. I enjoy it yet I fear it.  my grandfather passed of esophogeal stomach cancer when I was 3, I used to help my grandmother take care of him and would think I was making him better. I was veryyy close to him though I dont remember him:( it hurts that I dont remember him but I reminense on photos,  videos,  voice tapes that he would leave for me and stories always told and cherished with the family.
             <br/>
             many storiestold but ill share one- when he passed I always talked to the moon and my family thought that was my way of coping with it. so im in the backseat with my parents in the front and Im talking away to the moon. mom: Theresa who u talking to?  poppy! (her dad) mom: whats he saying?  he said its gonna snow!!!!! dad: (elbows mom with a joking manner) really?? .. ask him when! HE SAID RIGHT NOW!!!!! it started snowing instantly.  That was a blizzard in 96.
             <br/>
              but as I got older they got darker. in the moment id b scared and when they were gone id look for them. weirdddd things go on occassionally but I know their evil. ive never touched a ouiji board as tempting as it is and I dont intend to.  But although its practically impossible to get in touch with ur loved ones, I must still ask if it can b at all possible. Im scared to let more spirits in my life though bc my dad (grown man) was held down by a black shadow that wouldnt let him scream. I see black shadows,  figures, occasionally faces, voices rarely but I did see a black mass at the end of my parents bed when I had awaken from a nap and I jus looked away to turn on the light after a min. ive been to confession as  i m a practicing catholic and even prayed with my aunt whos a nun. idk just looking for answers like y he left

             Think about it like this , wether it is a laptop or computer with a Mouse and you asking questions through google or any other search engine and moving your pointer around the screen. Is that not a modern day version of the same thing?

               i think its different because when you play with a this board, you are seeking out the supernatural.

             After reading BRUNELDA NATO comment on laurenconrad. com about Metodo helping her cast a spell to fix her relationship, i was hmm.. will say considering doing the same thing cos my life was a total mess. On one hand my girlfriend now soon to be fianc  parent did not want me to be their son-in-law cos i did not belong to the upper class community and on the other hand, i moved from Latvia where my life and job was to be with my soon to be fianc in Azerbaijan. I had no home there but just the apartment we both bought together. If am not mistaking her father is a famous lawyer to almost  every rich person in Azerbaijan. She was going to help me get a job in her father law firm before she broke up with me because she was going to marry one of her father client. All this was before i contacted Metodo to see what he could for me. As i said her father was against our relationship and she was going to marry a 53 years old man for his money. She has always loved materials things but i never thought she would pick money over me. We were still see each other not as lover but secret lovers. I loved her too much to be sharing with a disgusting old man because he was rich. I dont mean to disrespect any elderly person i just dont like it when rich old or young persons try to take or take someone you hold dearly to your heart cos they have the money to do so. In my own case it happened that it was an old rich man wanting to take the woman i loved and still loved with all my heart and strength. She didnt want to marry me but she wanted to be my lover in secret. I knew she loved me dearly but she was also in love with all the money and assets the man had. she knew i was content with what i had and what she had but she wanted to be so rich like adding riches ti what she already had. The date of the wedding was already set when i realized that if i dont do something to stop the wedding i would lost her forever. It happened that i came across BRUNELDA NATO comment on laurenconrad. com as i search the INTERNET on how to make a woman  realize living without you will be a great mistake where she wrote how metodo the spell caster helped her fix her marriage and how she came face to face in contact with Metodo and also how real and awesome he is. I just felt compelled to also contact him for help maybe i was not thinking clearly or i felt it was my only chance to make sure she soon to be fianc doesnt marry anyone else but me or maybe i felt both ways. I know something was clear to me that whatever action i took was my last chance to win her back. There and then i contacted Metodo cos i had no money to travel all the way to Chad. I just trusted BRUNELDA NATO testimony that he really exist and can help me solve my problem. It turned out that BRUNELDA NATO was right. Now i can also truthfully tell you that Metodo is really something out of ordinary he is the greatest spell caster you can ever meet. He sent me some items that he told me to use to pray with within the 7 days he was casting the spell i asked him to help me cast with the materials he told me to provide to for the spell casting. Within those seven days of incantation pray my soon to be fianc developed something i dont know what to call in her head that made the love she had for me resurface i say resurface love because she became that girl i fell in love with back in Latvia she told me she was going to call of the wedding but was scared what would happen to her father relationship with the man. But all those worried faded when Metodo sent the spell that looked like a powdery substances with instruction on how to make it effective. She called off the wedding and nothing happened it was like no one cared anymore not the man or her parent almost like it idea was yipped of their head. Whether anyone believe me or not it does really matter the only thing i care to say here is that Metodo is the ultimate spell caster anyone can ever ask for help. Am going to leave his mail in case  Metodoacamufortress @ yahoo. com

             I played it for the first time last night and became intrigued by and and a bit obsessed I have been searching for hours trying to find an explanation. When we first began to play the game I, believed it had something to do with your mind. maybe somewhere your brain forced your hands to answer with an answer you come up with in your imagination and your hands moved it without relizing it. My theory tho, no longer maked sense when we began asking about the spirit who controlled this ouiji board. The board gave us a name and an occupation (zookeeper) and its favorite animal (giraffes). None of my friends had ever heard of this person. We looked it up. The person was real, dead, a former zookeeper, and when we clicked on images Its a mysterious piece of cardboard I will never understand yet I still obsess over finding an answer

             Anyone that believes these things are real are idiots. I used to play a trick on my sister where she would hold her hands out palms facing each other and I would spin my fingers like I was screwing her hands together. Those of you that believe these boards actually work must also believe that I have magic powers. I bet you all also believe magicians actually have magic powers too! The stupid game is manufactured in eastern Asia. Heres another idea, do those of you that believe these boards are real also believe in god? Go take psychology classes and you will all see how nieve you really are

             Hi everyone, just a silly question, if the stupid ouija board worked, dont you think the military would have been using it? I mean why spend billions of dollars and get thousands of soldiers killed in wars when a 10 dollars worth plastic board can do all that for you. Why spend billions on Drones and Intel, just ask ouija and itll tell you where the enemy is hiding. If this thing worked even a bit, the best and most advanced ouija would have been in production by the Department of Defense and there would definitely be 1 mounted in the White House and the Pentagon. I mean why would presidential candidates spend millions on election campaigns and wait for results, just call a psychic, bring an ouija board and find out if you are gonna win or not. Hmmmm. The FBI would definitely have 1. right? I mean why spend money and resources on collecting info on wanted criminals, just ask ouija and go get them. Crime Free World.. Thanks to OUIJA BOARD for helping.. And here is the best part, We are at war, no worries. All we have to do is to summon some demons where the enemies are and let them do their job. EASY FREEZY..
            </p>
            <p>
             Now lemme tell you my real life story: My father is 52, Serving in the Army. Approx. 10 years ago, We were living in a house close to a cemetery. We had just moved there and I heard rumors about a headless horseman appearing in the cemetery and scaring people. I told my Dad who at the time was serving in the special forces. My Dad put his shoes on the next night, Friday the 13th, around 12;00 midnight and took me for a walk to the cemetery. We spent an hour and half there, visited every single corner of the cemetery and came home. As soon we entered home, my Dad asked me, Did you see a headless horseman? I said No. He replied, Me neither. And I have not believed in any of that shit since than Because, Its all BS. Than, He told me a story from when he was a Captain and on a course overseas. One of his course-mates brought an Ouija Board and he was a strong believer but he had never tried it before. So, the Commandant ordered him to spend 3 nights in the nearest graveyard with the Ouija and share his experience. He used to sleep on a grave with the Ouija on his chest after he would get tired of trying to contact the spirits. Nothing happened and everyone laughed at his story after 3 days. He is still alive, well, completely physically and mentally healthy and normal and has never experienced anything out of this World. BTW, he is still serving in the Army and does not believe in any Ouija BS anymore.

               Khan..the thing is the paranormal stuff does not work that way. it has noting to do with aiding us in a good manner. skeptics are the worst when it comes on to the paranormal, it will not work on those who people who are blocked to receiving or understanding what is out in the universe. I was quite a skeptic myself. My friends were playing with this Wooden board for quite sometime before I joined in one day to see for myself.
               <br/>
               The results were uncomfortableeven shocking. The story of the headless horseman was fable and fiction. You and your father simply wasted time and energy walking around in the cemetery. Whatever lies in the Ouija board is real. I would never play with it again because I know what it stands for. Saying to use the Ouija to solve crimes etc is asinine simply because people think its meant to be used for goodat least they would like to believe thatbut there is something much darker and sinister involved with trying to communicate with lost souls or spirits ..whichever you please. Plus, in the transaction between oneself and the spirits there has to be some form of payment meaning whatever you ask for, the spirit is so eager to oblige because at some point you will end up paying for it. You seem very young and immature. Its easy to feel and think the way you do where these things are concerned because honestly, it would make sense right? Why not ask the spirits for help in solving world hunger, peace, murders etc? But the key and operative word here is SPIRITS the bible warns against them, and we really should listen.

             The Quija board is just a piece of plastic and cardboard and is mass produced as a game/toy. However, demons and evil spirits have haunted and possessed things and people before and have used these things to communicate. I believe that most of it is hocus pocus and just plain stupid. But I had an experience playing with a Quija board. My friend and I were playing and when my friend and I removed our hands from the Planchette, we were sitting on the floor talking and the board and Planchette were approx 10 feet in front of us and the Planchette started moving on its own, it really freaked us out, we threw the whole thing in the trash. We never really told anyone about it and my friend ended up in a mental hospital a few months later. Now was it the Quija board, I guess Ill never know.

             I may sound like an idiot, I was once among the skeptics, however recently I used an ouija board with two of my friends. It was in a shed in the dark, we had candles and incense my friends had bought one from ebay, it didnt work too well however it did move to yes after asking if there where any spirits with us. Afterwards we just blamed each other although we all swore on our lives. The next day me an one other friend tryed again in her living room, candles and incense again, and it worked. It moved to yes after asking if anything was there and told us its name was P D and it lived in her house in 1998 when it was 24  6, an died wen it was 29. We asked some other questions but not all senders were clear, however it said it was good and wouldnt hurt us but whn we said we had to go it said no we apologized and said goodbye. I know it sounds like bull but we both only had our nails on it to prove it was real, we didnt talk for long as we were both pretty freaked out as w both thought ouija boards were a bunch of crap however now I have a different opinion. I know it was neither of us there is no way it could have been so dont dismiss others stories of the boards before seeing for yourself, although it only works if you consentrate and dont just fu about like its a joke. But now I dont just believe I know its real.

             Once several years ago I was on the Ouija board alone and asked to speak to Lizzie Borden. What came up was My name is Teach.
             <br/>
             I asked are you Blackbeard  and the board said yes. Then he proceeded to say he would tell me where his treasure was if I would read something from the Bible for him. I told him no thanks on the treasure (didnt want to give him a reason to hang around). What he wanted me to read was Ezekiel 27. Since I only know about the basic Bible stories and could count the number of times I have been to Church on my fingers I got out a Bible and looked it up. It seems Ezekiel 27 is about ships and the sea and treasure. The last sentence says and you will be terrible. So I read the whole thing and havent been bothered.

             Listen Panel. The Ouija board is NOT to be messed with. For all those who are saying its a hoax, you really should try it ALONE to prove to yourself. However, the REAL way to use the board is NOT to touch the pointer. Yes, I said DO NOT touch the pointer. That way you will guarantee that neither you, nor your friends are moving the thing around.
             <br/>
             Here is my experience: When I was 12 (I am 47) now, I went with a bunch of girls to play with this evil thing. This was in the Caribbean. We all gathered around it..we placed our hand HOVERING above the pointer and we called out to Oujia..asking if someone was there. After quite some time the pointer slowly moved to yesand Not one of us was touching it. one girl panicked and the thing went nuts going all over the place spelling out foul mouthed words..no joke!! Before we could control it it flew off the darn board and we told it Goodbyethen we told her to sit out of the game and we tired it again. This time it took even longer for the pointer to move but when it did, we were able to carry on asking questions about boys etc. Then we asked about our upcoming exams and we got mixed answers some with some foul words, but in the end..it told us who will pass and who wouldnt..and it never lied. I passed. one girl didnt. now chum it up to nerveswho knows. But one thing I DO KNOW is that the board has a life of its own..and I witnessed that because not one of us touched that pointer and it moved on its own. Believe what you will. Another thing, the girl who owned the board..she got strung out on drugs and no one knows where she is today. She had gotten somewhat weird anyway so we all stopped being friends. I think she spent most of her time asking questions to the board and only the good heavens knows what it told her.anyway this is and was my experience. I say Leave the board alone.
