          1. Most physicians are intellectually gifted and therefore rarely make mistakes.
         </strong>
         Perhaps Hollywood is to blame for this misconception, or maybe we simply find comfort in believing that exceptionally brilliant diagnosticians abound. Either way, I wish it werent a myth. But the truth is that the vast majority of physicians are average in virtually every way. Despite all claims to the contrary, we are no smarter than teachers or engineers, no braver than soldiers or firefighters, and no more infallible or crucial to human health than nurses or sanitation workers. If you want to find brilliance, look to the individual, not the career. No profession has a monopoly on intellect.

          2. Physicians are underpaid.
         </strong>
         It pains me to say it, but given our current economy, most physicians arenotunderpaid. Some argue that, due to the cost and length of medical education or the demanding nature of their jobs, physicians salaries are unacceptably low, particularly in primary care. That might be true in some utopian society where education and work ethic always correlate nicely with compensation, but in this country, that simply isnt the case in any industry. In less than a decade, annual salaries for primary care physicians and subspecialists will average $90,000 and $150,000, respectively  so plan accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3. Physicians are more altruistic than most people.
         </strong>
         Becoming a physician is not, and has
         <a href="http://www.unz.org/Pub/Forum-1932jun-00353" target="_blank">
          probably never been
         </a>
         , a purely altruistic endeavor. Physicians, on average, are just as interested in money or prestige as anyone else, despite the content of most medical school application essays or the professions overly romanticized notion of itself. And in this country, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. So theres no need for hypocrisy; trying to convince the public that all members of any profession are driven purely by altruism, and not by making as much money as possible for themselves and their families, is both disingenuous and counterproductive.

          4. We should abandon our sick care system and strive to develop a true health care system.
         </strong>
         No system or individual can thrive by doing many different things poorly. Doing a few things exceedingly well is the key to success. And in health care, that means providing high-quality medical care to the ill at the lowest possible cost. Disease prevention is indeed critical, and physicians can and should providebasiccounseling on health behaviors during office visits. But most prevention is best addressed elsewhere in our society. Good health does not (and can never) originate in any hospital or doctors office. And violating that universal truth is both exorbitantly expensive and stunningly ineffective.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          5. Technology will save health care.
         </strong>
         Google Glass, surgical robots, digital pedometers or calorie counters, cloud-based glucose or blood pressure monitors, handheld ultrasound machines, EMRs, CPOEs  all of these technologies have great potential. But technology is a tool, a hammer, nothing more. And like any tool, it can only be as effective as the hand that wields it, or the mind that determines if its use is appropriate for a particular task. Good technology can certainly help, but only good people, good judgment, and good intentions can truly improve our health care system.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          6. Big pharma is evil.
         </strong>
         No single industry is responsible for all that ails our health care system. Does big pharma deserve some of the blame? Sure. But so do our federal and state governments, the insurance industry, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital and health system administrators, and even the medical profession itself. Theres certainly plenty of blame to go around, but unlike most of those other entities, big pharma occasionally contributes something of value. And heres one irrefutable truth: Were it not for the biopharmaceutical industry, there would be virtually no reason foranypatient toevervisit a physician (except maybe for reassurance or a crude surgical procedure  but dont expect any anesthetics).

          7. Independently owned concierge and direct-pay practices will revolutionize health care delivery.
         </strong>
         No they wont. Any business model whose primary value proposition for patients consists of Ill spend more time with you or You can call me anytime or Ill always act in your best interests is destined to remain a small, albeit thriving, niche. Why? Because most patients will rightly ask, Why should I pay extra for this? Shouldntallphysicians offer these things? Over the next decade, then, payers will adjust their business models accordingly and lobby aggressively. And independent concierge and DPC practices will either be acquired by large corporations or become increasingly regulated, eliminating most of the professional or lifestyle benefits that attract physicians to them in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          8. Recent advances in medicine have been so great that physicians can now cure almost anything.
         </strong>
         Not really. Dont get me wrong, weve made much progress in recent decades (HIV, HCV, and some malignancies come to mind), but compared to centuries past, were well behind schedule with regard to true medical breakthroughs. The bottom line is that most modern pharmaceutical drugs dont cure a damn thing. Thats not an indictment (drug discovery is tough work), but it does form the basis of some sound advice for most Americans: eat well, exercise regularly, laugh frequently, sleep soundly, learn often, embrace faith, cherish the few, shun the rest, know yourself, love yourself, and be yourself. Nobody can do these things for you, and no pill will ever offer comparable benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          9. Employers have an ethical responsibility to provide health benefits to their employees.
         </strong>
         We already know that health insurance doesnt really make anyone healthier. But the assumption that employers should play any role whatsoever in directly financing their employees health care is equally flawed. Why? Because future health care expenditures are difficult to predict with certainty, and health care costs generally increase at a rate greater than inflation. As long as health benefits represent a significant portion of employee compensation, then, real wages will continue to stagnate or decline.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ironically, because income is a much stronger determinant of health than health insurance coverage, these employer-provided benefits are, in many ways,unethical. And employers should therefore be prohibited from offering what is often little more than a large, employee-paid deductible and calling it compensation. In short, cash is king, even (or perhaps especially) when it comes to your health.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          10. Pay-for-performance is the key to fixing our health care system because it doesnt create the perverse incentives of the fee-for-service payment model.
         </strong>
         This is blatantly false. For proof, we need only look to the legal profession. Lawyers will provide virtually any service if you pay their hourly rate and reimburse their expenses. But they only accept work on a contingency basisif they firmly believe they can win the case. Similarly, if pay-for-performance becomes the dominant payment model in healthcare, then all providers, from hospitals to individual clinicians, will have little financial incentive to care for any patients they believe they cant fix, at least on paper. And that will disproportionately affect the seriously or chronically ill and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, once we accept the false premise that physicians have the ability, or right, to unilaterally manipulate health outcomes or modify patient behavior  anything from diet or exercise habits, to medication adherence, to choice of birth control  then it logically follows that all payors, including government agencies and large employers, have the right to monitor and control those same behaviors. In short, pay-for-performance will unfairly penalize the sickest patients and threaten every citizens privacy, autonomy, and dignity. And that, my friends, is the definition of a perverse payment model.

               Interesting. Surprisingly clear interpretation.

              <p>
               But I do disagree a little with #7. I dont think all physicians should have to offer anytime accessthat, just like employer-based insurance, is an arbitrary association of the past. Being a physician shouldnt automatically mean a life of 24/7 servitude.

                 Very true.  My point was simply that the existence of these business models tells us more about the problems with our healthcare system at large than it does about their objective value to patients and long-term viability.

                   i think the key to fresh/rested doctors is more likely the total number of patients they are taking care of.  as long as a doctor has 600 or so total patients, i dont think it would be bad to be on call 24/7.  as opposed to a practice of 4 docs where each has 2500 patients.imagine how that doctor feels seeing patients the day after being on call for 10,000 patients compared to the one on call for 600.

               annual salaries for primary care physicians and subspecialists will

               average $90,000 and $150,000, respectively  so plan accordingly.

               Since were on the topic of money on physicians, a few money managers such as Michael Zhuang, Karen Cheong, Robert Kiyosaki, and Michael Stanley say that doctors are the worst with their finances!
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to read a few good articles, read why doctors dont get
               <br/>
               rich and why doctors are poor, and computer geeks are rich. These
               <br/>
               articles are from money managers by Michael Zhuang and Karen Cheong and they explain why medical doctors are the lowest of high income earners and are financially struggling!

              <p>
               Also a good article called  Doctors money mistakes by  Parija Kavilanz in which she talks with two medical doctors, a certified financial planner, attorney and president of MD Financial, and an executive director of Deloittes Center for Health Solutions and said that many are struggling financially

               Many of them are woefully financially illiterate. I cannot understand
               <br/>
               why people who are supposed to be clever can be so inadequately informed in areas of managing their finances.

               Fresh out of residency, many young doctors have school debt averaging
               <br/>
               $130,000. Still, that doesnt stop them from spending lavishly

               I supose it shouldnt be too surprising that someone who started out in the business world, then got an MD and went directly into consulting work would be prone to the public dissemination of ridiculous anti-doctor statements, however, I dont think that we should let statement #1 go unchallenged.  Physicians do not tend to be of average intelligence, and do in fact generally have higher IQs than teachers do, as documented by the research below.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/occupations.aspx" rel="nofollow">
                http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/occupations.aspx
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               However, should statement #2 become true and our average compensation fall to $90,000 for primary care and $150,000 for specialists, I think we would see a general trend down in the IQ for physicians as a group, since income tends (with some exceptions) to be correlated with IQ.
              </p>
              <p>
               Certainly I would assume that most reasonably intelligent college students would avoid a profession in which they were required to take on $200,000 in educational debt and spend 10+ years of their life in training, only to make less than $100K and be required to be available 24-7 to their patients as Dr. Collar suggests that we should be.

                 Thanks for the thoughts. If you read some of my previous posts, youll see I am certainly not anti-physician. And, for clarification, I dont say that compensation should be in those rangesI simply state that they will be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With regard to #1, please do not assume that academic success and intellect are synonymous. Some of the smartest people I know are physicians. Some, not so much. I also know many people in other professions / occupations that are every bit as smart or smarter. The point was simply that no profession, in its entirety, has a monopoly on intellect. If the discussion were, who, on average, has the best grades, that would be different. But, particularly given our current educational system, grades are not always synonymous with intellectual ability.

                   Some pro basketball players are under 6 feet tall.  That doesnt negate the obviously correct stat that basketball players on average are taller than the general population, which is what that chart shows metaphorically about MD intelligence.  This is pretty basic group statistical analysis that it not refuted by pedestrian anecdotes nor platitudes. Of course every group has genius and laggards.  The mean intelligence of a doctor is about 115.  That doesnt make all of them geniuses but it does put them a standard deviation about the norm, which is pretty significant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now if youre talking about applied business and political intelligence, I would agree with you that doctors are sadly lacking.   The post by QQQ below is an excellent example of that.   But as far as g, we are as a group above average and that is pretty indisputable.

                   It was unfortunate that you chose teachers as an example, because education majors actually perform worse on the MCAT or other graduate school level exams than any group.

                       Doctors are easy marks for being overcharged and exploited.  I know many private practice doctors who would probably be better off as hospital employees because their front offices blatantly rip them off.

                     Ill start with the MCAT part of your comment  I think we can agree that performance on that particular test provides very little insight regarding someones overall intellectual ability. Sorting the available data for that exam by undergraduate major in order to draw general conclusions about intellect is therefore a big stretch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     With regard to basketball players, your comment is quite accurate and statistically sound. But height is simple to measure; true intelligence is not. One is (literally) one-dimensional, while the other is multi-dimensional and quite complex. That comparison is therefore an oversimplification and somewhat misleading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Although we often artificially (and somewhat arbitrarily) break intelligence down into its component parts for testing purposes (e.g. MCAT, GMAT, GRE, certain IQ tests, personality / EI tests, etc.) in order to declare an intellectual winner, doing so isnt very accurate or useful outside of an academic setting. Academic intelligence, emotional intelligence, communication skills, visual / spatial ability, and creativity or artistic ability are all critical to an accurate measurement of overall intellectual ability.

                       All of that is obviously true (and my post reiterated my oft repeated rant about doctors not being street smart) but that doesnt mean IQ is useless a measure of general intelligence.   Clearly one is better off with an IQ of 100 and no personality disorder vs. 150 and a serious personality disorder/no social skills.   And the smartest person in America was at least at one time employed as a bouncer.  But again, exceptions do not negate the point of difference within populations.  I really wish people would stop doing this in society because its platitudes trying to pretty up unpleasant truths about the bell curve. The chart clearly indicates that doctors have above average g, which IQ measures, and that all at least in that sample were above 105.  The change of that happening in a random sampling of the general population is pretty much statistically impossible.   So it means something.  Any quantitative psychologist will tell you that.  Despite the fact that society in general is uncomfortable with discussing g.  Please tell me you are not arguing that doctors as a group are no smarter than the general population.

                       Cannot possibly be true because data derived from a singular, one-dimensional (and most likely flawed) view of intelligence says otherwise?

                       Other than the two extremes on the curve (genius vs. cognitive impairment), do you really believe that one can draw definitive or meaningful conclusions about the intelligence of one group vs. another based solely on IQ test results?

                      <p>
                       Its not that IQ doesnt mean anything or is useless, but I sincerely dont think it means what you seem to be implying it means. Even psychologists (which you referenced earlier) cant do much with that large piece in the middle of the curve in terms of drawing clinical conclusions of any significance). And that has nothing to do with any discomfort discussing g or its implications. Im quite comfortable with my brilliance. (Obviously a joke there  By the way, KD is better than LJ Im an OKC fan.)

                       In this case yes, not one doctor in the sample was below 105.   I never said it measured everything but it is quite clear that the average doctor has higher general intelligence than the average laborer.

                       Thats the pointThe evidence increasingly suggests that it doesnt measure general intelligence but rather only some components of it. Given that this type of test-taking success / definition of intelligence is valued most by med school admissions committees, it isnt surprising that physicians would score that way.

                       Wont get too far off topic, but since you mentioned it I do, in fact, feel the same is true of the real-life clinical implications of board certification. I havent checked recently, but I know earlier studies showed no significant difference in outcomes between boarded and non-boarded docs of equivalent experience. Again, nothing wrong with board certification, but it probably doesnt mean exactly what the public is led to believe it means by the entities that benefit most from its existence.

                       I havent see the evidence on board certification but I agree there is zero evidence that recert correlates with anything other than making NBME and Pearson executives wealthy.  And were supposed to not complain while they insist we practice EBM.

                       Never said IQ tests were useless (see earlier comments)the point, again, is that using them to say that physicians are smarter than teachers or engineers (my original assertion) is misguided. They dont measure overall intelligence, and certainly not in any way that provides any meaningful information in the real world (other than at the two extremes). Again, quant psychologists cant do much with IQ tests precisely for that reason (other than distinguishing mental retardation / cognitive impairment from genius). The research shows that intelligence is not quite as simple a concept as we thought.

                       On average, I believe that my medical school classmates were more academically successful than my high school classmates. I made that point earlier. But, again, academic success is not synonymous with intelligence.

                       Conscientious with regard to what? Completing their schoolwork? Or are you asking if they were more altruistic and all around better people? On the first, probably yes. On the second, definitely no.

                       But of course they werent and your medical school is fine.  Because what you are saying is obviously nonsensical since it is the job of medical schools to select bright students.  If they are no brighter than the people you went to high school with, your medical school is incompetent.  But it isnt.

                       If you honestly believe that your medical school classmates were no more intelligent than your high school classmates, and continue to dig in your heels after looking at the data AZ gave you, I simply dont know what to say.   Its a world where everyone gets a trophy takes precedence over the truth.   And the implication is that medical school administrators are incompetent in choosing students.

                       You are clearly confusing academic success with intelligence. I stated that my medical school classmates were more academically successful. Did I not? Medical schools, by and large, choose the most academically successful students. If you feel that, by definition, that means they are the most intelligent or conscientious as well, you are entitled to your opinion. But reviewing the literature on intelligence would show that it is indeed little more than an opinion. Are doctors smart? Yes they are, and I never said they werent. Smarter and more conscientious than all the other groups / professions / occupations that I mentioned in the piece?

                       IMO what has happened here is that Dr. Collar made an accurate statement (Not all physicians are intellectually gifted and so they make mistakes just like everyone else), which he then elaborated by making some silly and demonstrably untrue statements (most doctors are of average intelligence and doctors as a group are no smarter than teachers).

                       Having been proven wrong on the supplemental statements, he is now engaging in convoluted argumentation to try and avoid backing down.

                       I see nothing convoluted here, other than what appears to be a dire need to believe we are smarter and more conscientious than everyone else (based on comments). Stated simply: IQ tests do not adequately reflect comprehensive intelligence. Therefore, if you say doctors do better on IQ tests, then I agree. If you say that, because of the IQ results on that website, doctors must be smarter than everyone else, I cant agree. That seems pretty simple to me.

                       However, based on commonly accepted methods of assessment, physicians are indeed (in general),  smarter and more conscientious than other groups of workers are.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Unless you can point to other methods of assessing intelligence and conscientiousness, and show that physicians do no better than average on those, it is illogical to claim, as you do, that the assessment methods are flawed and that one can therefore draw the conclusion that physicians are average.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       If the assessment methods are flawed, and there are no other methods yet available, or if there are alternative methods but they havent been used to assess different groups of workers,  then all we can conclude is that we dont really know if physicians are smarter, or not, than average.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       They might be, and they might not be. But no one knows, including you, and so it is fatuous to make statements such as physicians are average in every way.

                       The correct quote is VIRTUALLY every way. Ive repeatedly stated that we are academically more successful. But academic success and intelligence are not synonymous. You are asserting that, based on their performance on IQ tests, physicians are indeed smarter or more intelligent than everyone else. The evidence clearly shows that we have an incomplete view of intelligence, and that these tests, though certainly not useless, do not adequately measure intelligence in the way you seem to think they do. That would render your assertion either one made based on flawed data or one that amounts to little more than an opinion. If you feel more comfortable calling mine an opinion, you are free to do so. But where is the compelling data that physicians are more conscientious than everyone else as well? The post from a blog referenced earlier?

                       I see this type of thinking all the time in the hospital. Some doctors just think they are smarter than everyone, including nurses with advanced degrees and more experience, even though its often not true. Luckily, not all doctors are like that.

                       I saw a staggering amount of people in welfare, and I did see people with college degrees, who were probably just over  the retardation line.
                       <br/>
                       These people had trouble filling out forms, etc., and doing things that help them function in life. I usually would not have seen the seriously retarded. They are in group homes.
                       <br/>
                       I also taught elementary Sunday school for years and had two retarded children and some children with various physical disorders.  It helps to know what their problems are.
                       <br/>
                       I had one child in Sunday school with cerebral palsy whose grandpa was a medical doctor.

                       However, in medicine, you cant have good diagnostic acumen without having absorbed/memorized a tremendous volume of data (not to mention updating that data regularly to keep up with the current state of medicine).  So you are less likely to be a good doctor if you have low IQ/MCATs since those indicators suggest that you wont be able to keep up with the other key component of being a good medical diagnostician.

                       This is only partially accurate. Beyond a certain minimum IQ score, other skills are more important to being a good physician. Yes, memorization is important. But as complicated as medicine is now, intellectual curiosity and empathy are even more important once youve hit the minimum level of intelligence required to do the job (which isnt all that high). No doctor knows everything, and if they assume they do because of a high IQ they do their patients a disservice.

                   I disagree wtih none of these statements at all, but none of them are what you said in the original post.  You cannot argue that doctors are average in every way including in intelligence, since thats demonstrateably untrue.  You also cannot claim that doctors are no smarter than teachers, since thats also factually incorrect, on the average.
                   <br/>
                   I would certainly agree, as most doctors would,  that all doctors are not brilliant diagnosticians, and that we all make mistakes. I dont believe that we ever claim otherwise.

                     Those statements do, in fact, precisely reflect what I said in my post. Pointing to data that measure only one aspect of overall intelligence in order to declare an intellectual winner is, in my opinion, unwise. (See comment below to Dr. OBrien.) Your point is well taken, though.

                   1) Your defense by saying IQ, MCATs, grades, etc. etc. does not measure general intelligence is called creating a non-testable hypothesis. If you reject every way that intelligence is measured and define general intelligence by how it *cannot* be measured, then you are not actually making a real statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2) Absence of proof does not mean proof of absence. Even if we accept your assertion at face value that General intelligence is some mysterious thing that cant be defined by any measure known to man, then how do you assert that there is no difference between doctors and other professions? At best, if you accept your own theory, you have to say we dont know if doctors are smarter than the average person. Thats a very different statement than that doctors *are not* smarter than the average person.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   3) WRT general intelligence. Even if we accept your non-definition of it, and somehow even accept that you have provided proof that doctors do not have more of it, you fail to explain why general intelligence as you define it, is needed for being a good doctor. Do you need political acumen to be a good doctor? Maybe, but you havent made that argument. Two aspects that do predict a good doctor are the ability to master a tremendous amount of information (even if its just memorizing, thats a ton of memorizing), and the ability to work hard. These abilities are generally captured by IQ and grades. Are there other skills, sure, but in the absence of any way to measure them (your assertion), we cant say anything about them.

                     Glad you seem to agree with most of the piece. Some thoughts on your comments:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     1.) The real statement I made is that IQ tests do not adequately measure true intelligence (there is a considerable amount of research starting to emerge that challenges the ways we have traditionally quantified intelligence). And I only made that statement in response to others that seem to feel that performance on an IQ test automatically renders physicians smarter than other groups of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     2.) I was not attempting to construct a theory of human intelligence. I was simply challenging the relationship between IQ test results and meaningful intelligence. For example, if the statement had been that physicians score higher on IQ tests, then, assuming the data is from a reputable source, I would agree with it. But taking it one step further and, based solely on that same data, asserting that physicians are smarter, more intelligent, or more conscientious (which is what the comments asserted) is not appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     3.) I never said you need to have the most general intelligence to be a good doctor. Or that most doctors are not good doctors. Nowhere does that appear in the piece. I simply said that doctors were average in VIRTUALLY every way and no smarter than teachers or engineers. I stand by both statements (purposely used virtually and most to qualify the statement because, as Ive said repeatedly, physicians generally do better academically, but academic performance is not synonymous with intelligence, or judgment, or morality, etc.).

                     All of your points are spot on. I would only add that as medicine gets more complicated, having the humility to understand what you dont know, as well as the empathy needed to bridge that gap for our patients sake, is becoming more important. Memorization is still important, but theres just too much information for any physician to truly master. In that sense, IQ and memorization are becoming slightly less important.

                       Well said. The information / research boom in medicine is stretching the limits of our brains capacity to memorize and retain. And, as you say, other skills / attributes (particularly humility) are becoming increasingly important if we want to do our jobs well.

                   This is very true. Too often, we just assume we are the smartest of the smart, and we dont realize how dismissive of our patients intellect we are. Not to mention that you are very right in saying that grades and education dont always reflect someones level of intelligence. Most of us are intelligent but so are many other people from all different walks of life.

               I  think I read the referrenced article in the MD.  If I did, it thrust really was  that people in the UK are unhappy that some hospitals are offereing some surgeries (&amp; the opportunity to jump the queue) to those who can self-fund.   Those inverviewed basically said that was unfair to let people jump the queue and the logical consequence was that only the rich would be able to get care.

               Dr. Collar is writing realistically. I dont know if DPC or concierge will self- destruct or get better regulated The United States generally has a laissez faire, capitalistic approach. If people can pay for the kind of medicine they want from a licensed practitioner, it will probably continue to be allowed.
               <br/>
               Intelligence sure is a hot topic here. IQ tests measure knowledge in a certain way.  Some say it measures the ability to take tests.  Thats not really true.  I will ace certain parts of an intelligence test, but I will flunk housecleaning.  I consider house cleaners and janitors brilliant!
               <br/>
               The tests measure many knowledge of facts learned and how to apply them.
               <br/>
               Physicians have a certain type of knowledge. Most doctors I have known are deficient in bureaucratic skills, like billing and how to deal with insurance companies and government.  The current system has forced them into this.
               <br/>
               The average doctor applies his or her knowledge daily in deciding how to treat patients. Most of them arent trailblazers, as in inventing new therapies. The average doctor can find an ordinary miracle, like how to treat certain persistent symptoms in resistant patients. Usually, those finds arent applicable to the masses.
               <br/>
               Medical progress requires risk.  Inventing new therapies, usually medicines, includes the risk of seriously harming patients. I have had a few doctors who are researcher, and I question how aggressive mine are.
               <br/>
               Some medical discoveries prolong like, like insulin and antibiotics. I just shot a little insulin, my first after a couple of months, to supplement my Victoza and oral meds, since my sugars are creeping high.  Its not a cure for my diabetes. One of the biggest helpers for the diabetes problem is the glucometer.  Im not aware of any other disease that has self-adjusting potential like this.
               <br/>
               Dr. Collar is right. Most diseases are manageable, not curable.
               <br/>
               I dislike the prevention is better than cure slogan.  Once I read about a druggie woman who had Siamese twins and didnt take good care of herself.  Some writer commented that she had had little prenatal care. That had nothing to do with the twins being conjoined. The only thing prenatal care might have led to was an abortion.
               <br/>
               Illness is a fact of life. Its something to be dealt with.  If so-called modern medicine cured stuff, why would doctors complain on this site about a shortage of primary care and a huge patient load?
               <br/>
               I do a lot of historical and social research. I just learned that its very arrogant to assume our ancestors hardly lived longer than 30 years. Longevity apparently goes in and out of style, existence.
               <br/>
               So-called modern medicine is not the only contributor to our current longevity. A greater supply and variety of foods, which developed in the late 19th century immensely.
               <br/>
               Yet, we have had extreme food shortages in the 20th and 21s centuries, often due to politics.  There was hunger, especially in Europe, during the two worlds. Afghans and Africans have experienced lots of hunger in recent decades. The tsunamis caused shortages.  Humans are usually powerless against the weather, unless we develop ways to predict and plan.
               <br/>
               Its known that the Native Americans had few contagious diseases before the coming of the Europeans. Many contagious diseases originate in animals, and they had few domesticated animals.  I recently read that a plentiful Native American food supply may have helped them fight off disease.  If we talk about intelligence, Native Americans were excellent botanists. They at least learned to manipulate the plentiful plants around them to their advantage.
               <br/>
               Hygiene also helps.  Fresh water and the ability to remove waste helps fight disease.
               <br/>
               The human is the most adaptable animal.
               <br/>
               With the coming of HIV, the gay community has learned to control some of its spread through safer sexual practices, which limit the exchange of bodily foods.
               <br/>
               Life is always about balance, as stated in the Eastern discipline of yoga.  Antibiotic overuse has led to super bugs.  Modern hygiene has probably helped increase allergies, etc.  Supposedly, illnesses like chicken pox strengthened a childs immune system.
               <br/>
               As for medical finances, lets fix the student loan system!  That would help a lot of other students!

               I responded to #1 above, but I also wanted to disagree with #2 and 6 (BTW, if it sounds like Im piling on, please realize I dont mention the others because I think youre right on the other points
               <img alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>

               #2  re: physician salaries. In a strictly market sense, youre right: doctors are neither overpaid or underpaid. Obviously there are providers willing to work at current payment rates, and if you believe in efficient markets, then theres no such thing as over/under-payment. But that said, when you start seeing shortages then classic economics means youre facing prices that are too low (higher prices would increase supply and decrease demand, thereby re-equilibrating the market). So when you hear everyone from the President on down saying theres a shortage of primary care physicians, then what theyre saying is that the price for PCP services is too low. Ergo, theyre underpaid. Now, the government wishes to address this by pretty much any means *except* raise salaries (e.g. cutting specialty salaries, which lowers the opportunity cost that PCPs face by choosing their specialty; increasing mandates to provide care, such as EMTALA, which forces physicians to supply their services regardless of payment; encouraging more NP/PA care i.e. supply substitution; etc). But that just means theyre trying to escape the fundamental economic truth that primary care (at least) is underpaid.
              </p>
              <p>
               On a more anecdotal level, once you lower physician salaries to 90-150k, you open up a whole slew of other fields that become competitive for STEM college grads. Yes, lowering physician salaries from 500k to 450k doesnt lower your supply because there arent that many more jobs paying 450k than there are paying 500k. But lower them to around the $100k mark and there are *tons* of fields, especially in engineering, but even mid-level management, etc. that become competitive (even nursing: $75k for 35hrs/wk might beat $100k for 60hrs/wk plus call). IOW, the supply / salary curve is not a smooth function: its stepwise based on the opportunities found at various levels. For example, in the 80s, medicine paid much better than Wall St. So generally medicine attracted brighter kids than Wall St. But once the salary lines crossed, a flood of students went into Wall St. rather than choose medicine.
              </p>
              <p>
               So given that there are shortages now in lots of different areas of medicine, and the fact that a $100-150k level of salary opens up a qualitatively different field of job opportunities, means that if salaries drop that low, I think you will see a huge exodus of physicians (both existing, and college grads choosing it).

               #6  Big Pharma. No, theyre not evil, but theyre not really as necessary as they try to paint themselves to be. Most of the difficult, speculative, basic science research is funded by the NIH and done by Universities. Much of the next level of R&amp;D is increasingly done by biotech startups funded by VCs. Big Pharma has become so risk-averse that their tasks have boiled down to late-stage development, shepherding promising drugs through clinical trials (even this is now being outsourced) and marketing. (Manufacturing has long been outsourced to generic manufacturers since they know how to focus on efficient production). So if Big Pharma dies, that doesnt necessarily mean the death of pharmaceutical advances. After all, Penicillin, Insulin, etc. came about long before Big Pharma ever existed

                 No need to worry about piling on. I dont think that at all and actually agree with much of what you astutely point out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With regard to #2, I agree with your assessment of the market forces at play. But, while the shortage of primary care docs does seem to imply that they are underpaid (which I believe is true), it does not mean that their pay will increase. For that to happen, the market would have to recognize no equivalent with which to fill the need. But as NPs / PAs become more common (most actually do a great job) and prove capable of doing the vast majority of that work, the market will not exert the pressure necessary to raise primary care physicians salaries. I believe the downward pressure on physicians salaries will therefore continue, and actually increase, over the next decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On pharma, Ill use one specific example. The biotech company that did most of the early research on Sovaldi did so with several government / academic grants, but they were worth only tens of millions of dollars. Gilead, however, paid billions to buy that biotech company. Although research would, as you say, undoubtedly continue, there would be much less incentive if the industry did not bring its deep pockets to the table (most biotech companies know they will be bought  they lack the resources and scale necessary to bring drugs to market themselves). I do agree they should be tightly regulated and dont deserve special treatment, though. I was simply pointing out that calling the industry evil as I often read and hear, while giving other players in healthcare a pass, isnt really justified.

                   Re: physician salaries. I agree that the marketplace is more complex than I painted it. For one, its subjected to monopsony power on the buy side, and subjected to tight controls by accreditation powers on the supply side. And I agree with you that product substitution (i.e. using NP/PAs to perform tasks that previously were done by PCPs) will increase. But there are limits to that as well. Firstly, there are supply limits for NP/PAs, and the rapid increase in demand has already led to increases in their salaries. In my area, the going rate for newly minted PAs is $100-120k. Experienced, productive PAs can command $120-140k. This is a straight salary with no call, significantly lower malpractice risk, no unpaid time required to manage a private practice, etc. Im not a PCP, but Id speculate that PA salaries are becoming competitive with new PCPs even now. Indeed, at these rates, my partner and I contemplated offering a new family doc a straight salary to essentially be our assistant instead. They could even run their own clinic on the side if they wanted.

                  <p>
                   While I believe that the govt will ensure our market price will remain irrationally low for a long time, Im not sure how long that can go with the aging baby boomers and other demand shocks waiting in the wings. And I certainly dont believe even the almighty govt can force PCPs to work for $90k. How many NPs these days would be willing to work for that much?? (not even counting that PCPs tend to provide other services like call that most NPs dont?)

                   Re: Big Pharma. Your example actually proves my point: Gilead didnt develop Sovaldi. A small biotech called Pharmasset did. They were purchased for $11bil. Your error is in assuming Gileads $11 bil cost for Sovaldi was for R&amp;D. Incorrect. They paid $11bil for Pharmasset precisely because they knew they could command enormous prices for the drug later. The actual R&amp;D cost for Sovaldi was a few hundred million. Indeed, the entire value of Pharmasset 1 year before it was bought out was &lt;$2bil. That Gilead bought it for $11bil is not a reflection of how expensive it is to develop a drug like Pharmasset, but rather an indicator of how massive the profits of such drugs are, which the market is appropriately pricing into acquisition costs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   At any rate, my criticism of Big Pharma (not speaking for others) isn't strictly about drug pricing. It's about market structure that allows people who didn't risk anything or produce anything of value, to capture the profits that are ostensibly a reward for developing a new drug.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Changing drug pricing requires changes to two things: our patent protections, and the laws prohibiting medicare from negotiating price discounts. Change those and prices will come down regardless of whether it's Big Pharma or someone else.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Changing market structure so that more of what we pay as inducement for future drug development (i.e. profit) goes to the ones actually doing drug development (Universities and biotechs) without siphoning out enormous amounts for companies that these days amount to little more than clinical trial managers and marketing firms, would ensure that we get more drug development "bang" for the profit "buck" we pay.

                     Great points. On the salary issue: The supply limits on the PA / NP side are much less restrictive with regard to duration of training / cost to train, time to practice, etc, and I believe the PA / NP training infrastructure will grow to meet existing demand much faster than allopathic medical education has grown over the last several decades. So I still think the true salary will be much closer to what we now consider APN salaries (a number which, although subject to geographic variation, is currently somewhere around $85,000  $105,000, nationally, depending on the source.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     On pharma: I was looking at that transaction from a different perspective. Namely, Gilead didnt pay that price for Pharmasset simply because the drug would be profitable. Of course, the potential for profit drives the decision to buy or not buy the company to begin with. But when it comes to price, the M &amp; A market plays a significant role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Specifically, Gilead would have paid less if they could have, but another large pharma company might have bought it had they not paid that price. From the perspective of a small biotech firm then, the financial incentive to innovate lies more directly in the current market created by large pharma companies looking to buy innovation than it does in the commercial viability of the drug itself (which is mostly a concern to the larger company). Given that the public funds that financed some of the early research were small compared to the sum paid by Gilead, I was hypothesizing about what would happen if large pharmas deep pockets werent providing these small biotech firms with additional incentive to initiate the research to begin with.

                       Re: salaries. I agree that supply limits on NPs/PAs are less than on MDs/DOs. However, if you believe NP/PA salaries will settle around $90k, then Im not sure how you expect PCPs to accept $90k as well. Furthermore, all weve talked about so far is primary care. NPs/PAs have much less potential to substitute for subspecialists, so I dont see how specialty incomes can be expected to decline to $150k. My own best guess is that NP/PA salaries will settle around $100k, PCPs ~$150k, and specialties variable depending on specialty.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Re: pharma prices. Youre right that Gilead paid $11bil because it had to or another competitor would have. IOW, the market valued pharmasset at $11bil so Gilead had to pay the going market rate. I agree. But the only reason the market rate was that high was because of the markets expectation of enormous profits. not the investors determination of costs and risks.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Regardless, if you believe that only the expectation of selling the company at $11bil drove the original investors to risk their money and scientists to risk their careers, then fine: lets assume that the market price needed to appropriately incentivize investors and researchers to develop Sovaldi was $11bil. From a public policy POV, that is all the money we should need to properly incentivize drug discovery. The only other cost is the minimal marginal costs of producing the pill. Anything we, the public, pay over and above that $11bil + marginal production costs, is excess money profiting people who were not part of the drug discovery process we the public wish to promote, and not an efficient use of the publics pharmaceutical budget. It is rent extraction due to an improperly structured market.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So how much is that rent extraction? In the first half of 2014, Gilead earned $5.5 billion from Sovaldi. That means its on track to recoup its *entire* investment in the first year. If every person with Hepatitis C (3.6mil people in U.S. alone) were to be treated with Sovaldi, they would net &gt;$300bil income. That means that Gilead will net a 2700% (27-to-1) ROI *after* paying market rate for the drug innovation itself. In contrast, if the market were more efficient and we just paid the $11bil required to properly incentivize the true producers (plus marginal production costs), then the price to treat all 3.6mil people would likely be &lt;$20bil.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       What if, for example, Medicare outright purchased pharmasset themselves, for the $11bil demanded by the market (which, BTW, was 90% higher than the market cap of Pharmasset on the day that Gilead announced their purchase), then licensed the patent for free to any generic manufacturer wishing to produce it? Medicare alone would likely come out ahead in savings (to say nothing of the private insurers or the rest of the world), while doing nothing to disincentivize people from undertaking the arduous task of drug discovery.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This is inefficient allocation of capital, and disintermediating Big Pharma from the suppliers of drug innovation (Universities and biotechs) and the customers of that innovation (patients and insurance companies) would go a long way to making drug discovery more efficient and pharmaceuticals less expensive.

                       I believe salaries in medicine will increasingly be based on functional role rather than credentials (e.g. the primary care role is compensated within a relatively narrow range regardless of education). Other industries function this way, and although it would have once seemed ridiculous in medicine, as more and more aspects of physicians jobs are shifted to other licensed providers, there will be no reason for the salary distinction on the provider side for employees providing very similar (and in many cases identical) services. Higher salaries for select PC physicians would be justified based on management roles or if leveraging PAs / NPs / others to manage very large populations of patients remotely.

                       Pharma: Agreed. Theres no doubt that efficiencies / savings can be achieved with your approach. But manufacturing, distribution, QA / QC, regulatory affairs, post-marketing surveillance, costs associated with lawsuits, etc  (whether outsourced to private generic manufacturers or via new public infrastructure developed at the federal level) would likely require additional investment if you want to leave the innovation capital / incentive untouched. (If intellectual property were licensed for free, there would realistically be no market reason to pay billions for it in the first place, which would bring us back to the question of innovation.) Undoubtedly, removing profit from the equation would trim costs considerably, but how it would pan out I really cant say. I think the chances of seeing $90,000 salaries across primary care are greater than seeing the profit motive removed from drug development / manufacturing / distribution any time soon.

                       Re: salaries. You might be right that compensation will be function-based. Its basically there right now (physicians get, what, a 15% bump on their E&amp;M codes as opposed to NPs/PAs?). All Im saying is expect to see the supply of PCPs dry up as no one in their right mind would spend additional years training to become a PCP when you could do the same functions for the same salary as an NP/PA.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Basically, family practice would be obliterated, and general internists would function as a consultant / gatekeeper level referral for problems that NP/PAs need help with before seeing a specialist. Now this may be okay with payers and patients. But this entails a pretty big shift in peoples expectations which payors may or may not be able to pull off.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Re: pharma. The marginal costs that you list are the same for generic manufacturers. Yet we know generics sell for significantly less than brand names, and they are profitable companies. In Sovaldis case, I highly doubt it constitutes even 1% of its price. And again, my point about disintermediating Big Pharma is that they are not the source of drug innovation, nor are they the ultimate consumers of it. In a competitive market, the services they provide would be valued as commodities, subject to commodity-level competition.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Licensing a patent for free does not make the patent worthless. After all, one must first *acquire* the patent from competing bids. In the hypothetical case I presented about Sovaldi, nothing prevents Gilead from bidding $11bil based on their market analysis. And if they outbid Medicare, so be it (wouldnt be the first time govt is stupid :-). The innovators of Sovaldi deserve the most they can get on the open market.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       But profit motive works both ways: if Medicare (or a consortium of large private insurers) realizes that they will soon be paying much more for Sovaldi if they let an intermediary like Gilead buy the patent, then their own profit motive should compel them to buy the patent themselves, open an auction for the right to produce the drug, with the winner being whichever generic manufacture is willing to offer the drug for the cheapest price (at least to the consortium; perhaps it would be allowed to sell at whatever price they want to people outside the consortium), this would decrease their own costs and maximize their profits. After all, one mans profit is another mans cost.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This would do nothing to demean the value of creating patentable drug discoveries, since the innovators are still able to sell their patent on the open market. Indeed, given that there would be additional bids, this might actually give them a *higher* price. All it means is that Gilead wont be able to extract enormous profits from essentially commodity services (like you list) that likely add at most a few dollars, if not pennies, to the marginal cost of production.

                       Both are very good points. I think salaries will increasingly be tied to what is actually being done rather than education or credentials.

                       In Texas, the powers that be decided to give incentive pay rewards to teachers.
                       <br/>
                       It went to teachers who earned graduate degrees, not to the ones who got great marks for teaching.
                       <br/>
                       It would be so nice to see pay tied to whats done.
                       <br/>
                       For some of us, education is easy to get.  Im thinking of getting a second bachelors.
                       <br/>
                       A lot of professions once required a four year degree. Now they want five years of education. It feeds the university system.
                       <br/>
                       I think Texas teacher certification has been extended to five full years of education. Yet, it doesnt look like many people get that much. The Texas schools hire less educated people into alternative certification all the time.
                       <br/>
                       I have often written about how much I hate the demise of the general practitioner. Although I see mostly specialists now, and I have some great ones, I find too much knowledge in a doctor can be scary. A lot of em are too into their own specialties.
                       <br/>
                       I have had great luck with non-board certified GPs. Why do most doctors need more training than seven years?
                       <br/>
                       And now we have less-educated NPs and PAs doing a lot of the general practice, just like less educated folks are teaching now!

                       On salaries: I agree that PC will change. Whether demise or radical transformation or obliteration is the right word / phrase to describe the phenomenon, I dont know. But PC, as we now know it, from salaries to job roles / care delivery, will not exist in a decade; the market seems to be demanding it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       On pharma: Again, all good points. But if one consortium were to purchase the patent outright as you say, would they not still have a vested interest in setting the price as high as the market will bear for all those not in the consortium (e.g. remember, theyd still have to outbid pharma, so different industry takes profits, but profit motive still exists)? In that scenario, wed still have winners and losers (just different ones) and no net gain in the ability to restrict profits overall or control costs / price for consumers / patients (outside the consortium).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And the scenario where Medicare (rather than a private consortium) is bidding against pharma wouldnt work without artificially / legislatively changing the market dynamics. Realistically, Medicare would never win a bid (outbidding Gilead, for example, would mean paying $12 billion (made up number) for the drug in order to convince the patent holder to sell to them . . . meaning that private profit becomes public waste, the costs of which can only be recuperated by increasing taxes to fund the repeated trips to the bidding table where Medicare is outbidding pharma companies without being able to justify the costly bids by generating profit.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Of course, with legislation that could be solved. So having Medicare as the mandatory patent-purchaser-of-first-choice is more fiscally feasible (would keep the sums paid to patent holders reasonably low). But what would happen
                       <br/>
                       internationally? We cant legislate beyond our own borders, so would foreign pharmaceutical companies have an advantage over American companies? Would the industry just go away entirely except for generic manufacturers? Would US companies simply move abroad? What about jobs? Would we simply close our borders to all foreign drug makers?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I honestly dont know what would happen, but it is definitely a very interesting problem.

                       To which I say:  ^This, and I have noted in my previous postsfamily practice dying and IM or IM-Peds being the direction many will go instead of FP.  Of course, depending on geography and other sub-specialization, these folks may not be receiving an income much higher than some in FP or Gen Peds.    So then you have to ask, whats the benefit of suffering through 5 or 6 years more of residency (IM-Peds, for example)?

                       Good question. I personally see the system shifting in such a way that the value proposition for prospective residents (at least with regard to salary, working conditions, etc.) is simply not there. And that would probably explain why family medicine residency spots are increasingly filled by non-US med school graduates. (Not sure about IM-Peds, but the numbers there are relatively small.) And it also explains why more college students are pursuing PA / nursing (on its own or as a route toward NP).

                       I believe salaries in medicine will increasingly be based on functional

                       role rather than credentials (e.g. the primary care role is compensated

                       within a relatively narrow range regardless of education).

                       I definitely agree. If two people are doing the same job, they should receive similar pay. The fact that one has different training than the other shouldnt matter as much as what they are actually doing for patients.

                       Again, I dont dont disagree in theory. But in practice, we already see this trend taking hold in various ways. As I mentioned above, nurse anesthetists earn more than primary care physicians, so the precedent for providers earning more than physicians based simply on job function, and despite having different credentials, already exists.

                       There really isnt any reason to pay physicians more than APNs in primary care. If they are both essentially doing the same job, they should receive the same compensation. If they are doing less, then they should definitely be paid less, but that isnt the case very often in practice nowadays.

                       No one that I have seen (given I am mostly skimming), has mention the risks and complications associated with many patients todayboth pediatrics as well as the elderly.  On the younger side of things, it is growing bodies of knowledge that have added to the comorbidities factorand other the more aged side, its also that along with longer lifespansand the probability of having more comorbidities as one ages.  Although not necessarily truedepending upon ones lifestyle and genetics, its something that must be appreciated.  Add to that the complications associated with things like obesityyou are looking at conditions that require more education, experience, and insight than what could or even should be provided via PAs or NPs.  .  Perhaps what will happen will be those leaving Family Practice and pursuing IM-Peds.  Bottom line, the comorbidities factor cannot and should not be overlooked.  As such, no NPs and PAs are NOT doing the same jobs and they should NOT be compensated as a family practice physician or IM or IM-Peds.

                       All good points. But the simple truth is that, in practice, many NPs and PAs are already doing the same work. Whether or not their pay should reflect that is open for debate. But it is a fact that much of what used to fall within the sole purview of physicians is being shifted to other providers. The trend is undeniable in my view.

                       NPs at my hospital are doing the same things with the same patients. It might be different at other hospitals, but the NPs at my job handle the same primary care and regular floor patients that the doctors do. No difference at all.

               So a random website that has some data (which came from one organizations working paper, which has itself never been published in any objective journal and has therefore not been extensively peer-reviewed, which contains only retrospective analysis of the putative relevance of an abstract entity whose very definition is in question, and whose very author concluded that the relationship between IQ and stratification is vastly overstated) is sufficient evidence upon which to assert intellectual superiority over other professions?

               Data on participants? Confounding variables and biases? Relevance to clinical outcomes? Other studies? Randomized trials? Well, lets not be so picky, or Ill have to assume youre just a difficult patient.

               A minor quibble. Number 1 is only partially correct.  Docs, on average, are smarter than teachers.  You can Google the Univ. of Wisconsin study that looked into intelligence in the various professions.  Docs were number one, just ahead of college profs and electrical engineers.  (Physicists and math PhDs were not separated out.  I suspect they would hammer us.) Of course variability generally trumps averages if the numbers are close.
              </p>

               But we have exceedingly challenging jobs and we are less up to ours than engineers are up to theirs.

                     Its hard to define power, but thats part of what can make a person rich.
                     <br/>
                     The issue in medicine is does the doctor really want to spend the most time with patients or devote that time to pursuing  higher income with more profitable patients or administrative control work or some other stuff?

                   I just asked one of my doctors, who is a specialist with a very well-organized clinic and research center, about setting up his business clinic.
                   <br/>
                   I used to see Doctor Former, with whom he came to practice years ago. Dr. Former semi-retired and left town years ago. Former is a nice guy, excellent doctor and hopelessly uptight.
                   <br/>
                   Dr. Current is also a nice guy, great guy, and very approachable and humorous. I asked him once if Former took his job too seriously.
                   <br/>
                   He told me Former used to come in and do this, as he straightened the picture on the wall. Per the staff, Dr. Current is still griping about the guy who used to straighten the pix. I dont think any of the current staff knew Dr. Former.
                   <br/>
                   I knew they didnt start a well-organized clinic overnight. I knew that all Former could do was be an excellent doctor and an excellent janitor.
                   <br/>
                   I recently asked Dr. Current, When Former and Current practiced together, did Current set up the business practices?
                   <br/>
                   Dr. Current looked at me like I was crazy. He replied, Former was the most meticulous person I ever knew. Then he paused and replied, My wife.
                   <br/>
                   So the answer was obvious, something I never intuited as a woman.
                   <br/>
                   Dr. Currents wife was his first and best  business manager. She helped his practice evolve as it did. He has a good woman behind him!  And they are still married!

                     I think thats very true for many physicians, especially for those running their own practice. Huge benefit knowing the business manager always has your best interests in mind.

                       Mrs. Current is surely an incredible woman. Dr. Current told me Dr. Former called him when his wife left him. Current is probably Formers only friend.
                       <br/>
                       As a woman, I just know Mrs. Current does whatever it takes to straighten out Dr. Current when he needs it.
                       <br/>
                       Dr. Current is the kind to give credit where do, to his lovely wife!

               Hi Kirsti I dont think all physicians feel that way. But based on some of the comments, I can see why you might think we do.
              </p>
              <p>
               I worked in several different industries before becoming a physician, and Ive therefore always known that there are highly intelligent individuals that pursue all sorts of different career paths / interests.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some of this might be related to how we define things such as intelligence or success in our society (e.g. better schools, better grades, more money, bigger house, etc) I also think we often mistakenly equate academic success with raw intelligence or talent.
              </p>
              <p>
               I definitely agree with you, though, which is why I included that misconception on my list.

               One of the best posts I have seen here and quite obviously hitting a nerve with your fellow physicians.  It is a shame that so many have gotten so defensive, I think most of what you have outlined is common sense.  There are exceptions in every situation in life and clearly that applies to physicians and the way healthcare is delivered, but I think you paint a fairly good picture of the healthcare system  or I would say non-healthcare system as it exists today.

                 Thank you very much for the kind words. I was a bit surprised at some of the comments as well, but in fairness, there is room for debate on all of these points. Most of the feedback seems to be related to point #1, though, which I honestly didnt think was controversial at all.

                   Agreed.  I have met not very smart teachers, lawyers, computer engineers and yes  doctors.  Higher education and multiple degrees does not always equal intelligence, if defined in broader terms.

                     And, honestly, the same case can be made for other human qualities such as compassion or empathy, which can be found in similar quantities across any broad sample encompassing different careers / occupations. Thats why I tend to focus more on the individual than the education / title when considering those types of attributes.

                   The volatility about your questioning physician intelligence was surprising, or not really surprising. I write double-speak.
                   <br/>
                   I have known a lot of doctors who think they are very intelligent and know best for the world.  Thats one of their main errors. They have a certain top of knowledge, and theirs is not the only one that matters.  Many doctors squawk about what happens to their decisions in the legal process. Doctors should realize from the beginning that their thinking is only part of a society.
                   <br/>
                   True intelligence is opening your mind to other views.
                   <br/>
                   When I was younger, I had serious menstrual difficulties. I  did not get compassionate, competent help at from the insiders, other women who were doctors.  Male doctors who had extra training in infertility and werent greedy were the most helpful.
                   <br/>
                   I think its better to say that the average doctor is not very innovative, rather than saying not very intelligent.  Most doctors wont be trailblazers. But, when he or she puts together his existing knowledge with a little creativity and helps a difficult patients, thats an ordinary miracle.

                 One of the best posts I have seen here and quite obviously hitting a nerve with your fellow physicians. It is a shame that so many have gotten so defensive, I think most of what you have outlined is common sense.

                 I completely agree with both of these points. Some may not like it, but most of what he says is absolutely accurate.

               I saw a wonderful article once years ago that I wish I could locate. Medicine is a profession, like law.  The professions used to could control the masses because only they had access to the secrets of their professions.
               <br/>
               The rest of us who needed their help had to pay for their services and respected them.
               <br/>
               The internet has leveled the playing field. The secrets are all over the place. I can use Dr. Google and learn that other people have had problems with thyroid dosage adjustment.
               <br/>
               My endocrinologist especially loves it that I research. Diabetes is an illness that one treats oneself anyway. I learn the dosages in which my glimepiride is available. I learned that my Victoza is based on lizard spit. I thought that really weird, since I am a mammal. A lizard is a reptile.
               <br/>
               He said a gila monster only eats two or three times a year. I learned gilas make a hormone that helps their food last that long. Humans make a similar hormone,  My Victoza keeps my stomach valve from emptying as quickly.
               <br/>
               You can how the ready availability of knowledge affects politics, too. Once upon a time, powerful families like the Kennedys dominated politics. Caroline Kennedy wanted to be senator from New York without having run for office.  People were discussing her online very seriously and stated she needed to get her first real job  and run for office like anyone else.
               <br/>
               Okay, she eventually became ambassador to Japan.  I made my point. Id rather have her there than in the US Senate. Most Americans did not consider her qualifed to be in the US senate. They also resented the fact that she never even worked as a lawyer for real pay.

                 Very true. Technology is leveling the playing field and changing things pretty drastically. The key, though, is always to make sure the information is reliable / applicable. But, youre right, there is good information out there that can help patients more actively manage their health and participate in their care.

                   Glad you read it and commented. This has turned out to be a good topic thread.
                   <br/>
                   Modern doctors who are open like informed patients. The days of dictating blindly are gone.
                   <br/>
                   You can do a lot of legal type stuff yourself with info gained online. Sometimes, you need a lawyer I could never get my brothers estate lawyer to talk to me, so Im filing a complaint on him.
                   <br/>
                   Government agencies can be dealt with yourself.  It always amazes that people think they need lawyers to apply for Social security or negotiate with the IRS.
                   <br/>
                   As a doctor, you have at least 7 years of education and have worked hard. Most doctors do work hard.
                   <br/>
                   So here we are on the modern super highway with info available for all. The lawyer daughter of American royalty, the Kennedys, wanted to be appointed to a normally elected senatorial office.
                   <br/>
                   it spread like wildfire on the net that shed never had a real job for pay.
                   <br/>
                   Thats an insult to all the McDonalds fry cooks, and other people who work hard, like doctors and lawyers.
                   <br/>
                   Lawyers who get real law jobs after graduation tend to work many hard, long hours.

               Physicians, on average, are just as interested in money or prestige as anyone else, despite the content of most medical school application essays or the professions overly romanticized notion of itself. And in this country, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. So theres no need for hypocrisy
              </p>
              <p>
               Isnt this the epitome of hypocrisy to claim that you are entering the field to help others, while in fact you are mainly interested in money and prestige? As long as we continue seeing nothing wrong with physicians prioritizing their pocketbooks over their patients, the healthcare will continue to deteriorate. Good luck rallying publics support behind any physicians cause or demanding deity-like respect for yourself after you showed everybody your real colors. This is exactly what I would want my physician to be  money-hungry hypocrite ; )

                 Theres a huge difference between making as much money as possible for themselves and their families in an honest fashion and being a money-hungry hypocrite. I believe trying to deny the former is what, paradoxically, often leads to the belief that all physicians are the latter.

                   So, making as much money as possible is not greed? And misrepresenting your intents while applying to medical school is not lying and hypocrisy? I wonder what world you live in, and by what kind of logical manipulations you came to this conclusions! Not only you are not ashamed of what you are saying, you seem to want to popularise these ides. Sad sad sad day for our profession : (  For patients sake, I hope there are physicians left who think and practice differently !

                     You seem to have misinterpreted (or I did a poor job of communicating) my point. My point was precisely that claiming to be 100% altruistic on application essays or marketing materials, when that is clearly not the case, is indeed hypocrisy. And yet we see that happening all the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Having said that, if you are asserting that all physicians are, in fact, perfectly altruistic, and much more so than all others in different industries / occupations, I would have to disagree. A simple review of where we are right now in healthcare would prove that such a view is out of touch with reality.

                       If they get some pleasure out of it and do some good, then so much the better, but that is not the prime purpose.  My initial reaction was to argue with you, though now I  am convinced it would be pointless as you seem pretty convinced about your distorted vision of the world. I genuinely feel sorry for you. And I really feel sorry for your patients : (

                       Those were not my words; they are the words of a physician writing in The Forum over 80 years ago. That particular physician clearly saw through much of the hypocrisy permeating the profession even back then.

                      <p>
                       And mine is not a distorted vision of the world; it is simply an honest and realistic one. You are more than welcome to disagree. But most physicians are genuinely good people. And so I simply dont see a need to engage in self-aggrandizing or delusional professional rhetoric. Patients deserve the truth, not some physician-as-unerring-altruistic-martyr caricature that probably never existed to begin with.

                       I agree wholeheartedly that patients deserve the unadulterated truth. I argue that your truth, while conveniently matches your own life views, should not be generalized to all physicians. I personally know many who are motivated by things other than their compensation. In addition, even if the majority of the group behaves certain way, it does not make it right, ethical or professional. Finally, I find it ironic that while by your own admission most of the physician lei / misrepresent their intentions on their medical school application and are driven primarily by money, you think the public should

                       So in your view, physicians are mostly altruistic, and other individuals that arent physicians are mostly greedy hypocrites? (I ask because all I said in my piece was that physicians were no more altruistic than other people. Yet you seem to vehemently disagree.)
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Even if you choose to believe that, we know that American physicians are, on average, the most highly paid professionals (outside of sports / entertainment) on the planet? Should they all renounce their salaries immediately to meet your expectations of the profession? Or should they continue to try to make the best living they can for themselves and their families (which is all I said).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Just because someone is trying to earn as much as they can (honestly and by doing the right thing for patients), which is all I said (youre the one that inexplicably equates that with greed), why should patients not trust them?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And there are exceptionally altruistic physicians, just as there are exceptionally altruistic physicians outside the profession. Im genuinely not sure what you are trying to argue.

                       In my view too many of the American physicians are money driven, which is very concerning to me and is questionable from the ethical perspective, because by definition their priority is NOT the patient.  Generalizing this to all physicians (or essentially saying there is no other way of doing it) legitimizes this status quo, which I think is a wrong thing to do. Condemning current practices and selecting trainees with different mentality might be a good start.  Of note, this does not mean that compensation should automatically decrease.  There is nothing wrong with paying altruistic people well.  In fact, many of the self-made well-to-do guys (and girls) newer had money as their goal, but just followed
                       <br/>
                       their passion. Money came as a collateral benefit. Perhaps eventually when physicians
                       <br/>
                       do become exceptional in their motives and acts (not just their compensation), they will regain the respect and the societal standing they once enjoyed.

                       Based on that last comment, I have a better understanding of what you mean. Basically, the gist of my argument was that thats not really true, and it doesnt need to be, so lets just be honest about it. Yours seems to be thats not true enough, so lets make it so. We still dont completely agree, but I do see your point now.

                      <p>
                       On the medical school essay point  If every student with an essay asserting a passion for practicing primary care or serving the underprivileged or just helping people without regard to money actually went on to do those things, wed be much closer to what youd like to see. But, at least based on my experience, that is not the case (with some exceptions). That doesnt necessarily mean they are dishonest; they may have just been more idealistic early on and somehow lose that side of it along the way. But in either case, it doesnt seem to work out that way (i.e. wed have less of a primary care shortage and many more working in underprivileged areas, etc., regardless of salary).

                   So, making as much money as possible is not greed or a conflict of interest? And misrepresenting your intents while applying to medical school is not lying and hypocrisy? I wonder what world you live in, and by what kind of logical manipulations you came to this conclusions! Not only you are not ashamed of what you are saying, you seem to want to popularise these ideas. Sad sad sad day for our profession : ( For patients sake, I hope there are physicians left who think and practice differently !

               But the benefits of those practice models do, in fact, all stem from the primary value proposition I referenced in the piece. The point is simply that those same benefits should be available to all patients throughout the system (even though they, in many cases, currently arent). I believe DPC / concierge can, in fact, offer some value, But they will not become the dominant practice models for the reasons I listed in the piece (e.g. as independently owned practices). They can, though, remain a thriving niche.

               Thanks for the thoughtful comments. Here are some thoughts:
              </p>
              <p>
               #1.) Agreed.
              </p>
              <p>
               #3.) I disagree. I dont think altruism, or any number of other culturally desirable human attributes, are disproportionately represented in medicine. Much like intelligence, if one is looking to quantify altruism in any meaningful way, it is best to look to the individual, not one particular profession. The idea that medicine is purely, or even primarily, about altruism is as flawed now as it was 100 years ago:
              </p>
              <p>
               One familiar delusion is to the effect that doctors are animated by an old saying, to wit, the relief of suffering humanity shall be thine only aim. This is a piece of poppycock that is not true and never was true. The cold fact is that most doctors practice medicine for precisely and exactly the same reason that lawyers practice law, or editors edit, or plumbers plumb, or laborers labor  namely, to make a living. If they get some pleasure out of it and do some good, then so much the better, but that is not the prime purpose.

               7.) I mostly agree. I simply stated that those practice models, in the form of independently owned / managed enterprises, wont become the dominant ones in our system for the reasons listed.
              </p>
              <p>
               10.) I disagree. Any payment model is bound to have some shortcomings. But pay-for-performance has as much, if not more, potential to do patients harm as fee-for-service. (P.S. In your last sentence I think you may have made a typo. Pay-for-performance is, in fact, the payment model that would supposedly reimburse based on outcomes.)

               Im not sure number 3 is universally true anymore. May have been true when medicine was a career. But changes in health care are making it more of a job: show up for a paycheck and keep your mouth shut seems to be the norm now.

               Excellent article. Very honest and well-written portrayal of healthcare in general and physicians in particular. And thank you for noting that physicians are no more infallible or crucial to human health than nurses I wish more doctors would recognize that other health care professionals are just as smart as they are but choose to help patients in a different way that is no less important.

                <p>
                 eat well, exercise regularly, laugh frequently, sleep soundly, learn often, embrace faith, cherish the few, shun the rest, know yourself, love yourself, and be yourself. Nobody can do these things for you, and no pill will ever offer comparable benefits.

               Thanks, Leesa. Im glad you enjoyed the piece. I agree that there are many less expensive, more effective ways to address prevention (particularly primary prevention). Education is key, as is having people accept more responsibility for their own health. Both of these are much less costly than bringing patients into hospitals or doctors offices for expensive, marginally effective visits and relying on drugs that yield minimal benefit. We should be able to address a huge percentage of chronic disease outside of the formal healthcare system. As a nutritionist, I suspect you see that more clearly than most.

               Try having a PA or NP balance CHF, DM, HTN, Depression, Arthritis, Liver Cirrhosis all at the same time in a 10 to 15 minute visit.

              <p>
               All clinicians make mistakes. Are you saying that PAs and NPs make that many more mistakes or are more careless than physicians? Any data to back that claim up? This just seems like another attempt to diminish NPs / PAs and the work they do.

               I dont disagree that there will be two tiers (at least). But the size of those tiers is what will matter. For example, we already see some of this stratification developing in the way of concierge / DPC practices, and yet the number of people willing to pay extra for a different level of service is exceedingly small. As I stated in the piece, those practice models will continue to thrive in small numbers but will remain more niche than mainstream. So they wont move the needle much on overall physician compensation.
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as NP / PA contribution, consider the current trend with in-store clinics (Walgreens, CVS, etc) These chains are opening thousands of clinics to meet the demand for low-cost, quick-access care. And it is almost universally true that these clinics are staffed by NPs and PAs, with physicians only managing several clinics from a distance (if at all). Those chains are capitalizing on the fact that most patients (certainly more than are willing to pay concierge fees) are comfortable being treated by NPs / PAs. (And they arent the only ones: even large ACOs and others are doing the same.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Couple that with the fact that pay is increasingly related to actual job function and not credentials, as well as the growing emphasis on controlling costs, and it isnt hard to see that the downward pressure on physician (and in some cases even NP and PA) salaries will only accelerate in the coming decade as the market forces that govern them evolve (or devolve, depending on your perspective).

               I agree Dr. Collar.  In my opinion, measuring IQ is like measuring physical beauty.
              </p>
              <p>
               Great point. If we say that fashion models are more beautiful, is it because they truly are (by some universally true measure of beauty)? Or is it because we defined beauty that way ourselves (thin, facial symmetry, etc.) and then selected for that group based on that definition? You can say they are thinner, on average (easy to measure), but measuring beauty is much more complex and, more importantly, less meaningful / useful if discussed across entire populations. Hadnt thought of that. Great example. Thanks.

                     You write like a man who knows himself.
                     <br/>
                     I consider cooking a male trait, cause my daddy was the best cook in the world. He supported himself when young as a cook, and then became an electrician because it paid more.
                     <br/>
                     Mama was a great cook,  too, but Daddy was better. He was a high fat Southern cook. He never made desserts.
                     <br/>
                     I currently attend a church with two men like my daddy. One is a retired silver-haired engineer who lives at his outdoor grill. The other is around 40, raising a second family now, who worked as a cook when young. He works in maintenance; I think hes trying to get some kind of two year electronics degree.
                     <br/>
                     Daddy was no cooking instructor. He taught me to cook the way some people learn swimming: put em in the water and tell em to swim. He told me to go in the kitchen and do it!

                 Thanks, QW. I dont think it was really deteriorating, though. Good people can have different opinions, and we all have different worldviews. Discussing them openly is a good thing, even when it doesnt necessarily solve anything  lol.

               First, Im sorry to hear that your mother has been ill; I hope she is doing better.

               I definitely believe patients should be able to choose who they and their loved ones receive care from. Credentials, training, education, experience, etc should all be easily accessible to patients so they can decide based on their own value system.
              </p>
              <p>
               Although I believe NPs and PAs generally do a great job, I wasnt implying that they should replace primary care physicians. I was simply pointing out that this is precisely what seems to be happening in practice, and I believe that trend will accelerate given our current focus on controlling costs / team-based care.

               I specifically said that most doctors are not that way. We agree on that. But hard to believe anyone can possibly think that IQ is what matters most in health care or gives doctors a right to be dismissive of patients, nurses and others ideas or contributions. And anyone that works in a hospital knows that happens way too often. Very sad.

                 I am not sure where you work or have worked, but I have found it to be quite rare that physicians are dismissive.  But I also have educated my patients, when and where possible, to collect your questions for the docs ahead of time, or have some family member with them to help them in this regard.  Physicians must see many patients in a day to evening to often night.  I have worked with a lot of surgeons as well.  People may find them dismissive at times, but some folks dont get that they have to round on their patients and be ready in the OR at the crack of dawn and work their azzes off sometimes well into the night.  Yes some folks are just plain ignorant, but you cant place that on a particular field.  And its important to understand the perspective and demands of the other person.  I get so annoyed at nurses that just jump to that stereotype w/o having solid insight.  Once again.  No one every said other qualities are needed in physicians; but they must be sufficiently intelligent, and yes, that generally means they should be above average intelligence.  Why wouldnt a person want this in their physician?  It doesnt mean they dont want all the other good qualities.   For me, Id take a surgeon that seems a bit short, but who is highly adept and has develop good M&amp;M stats over a sweetie pie charmer who is less than adept, has the necessary spatial intelligence, and busts her/his butt to perform their skills and medical follow-up with excellence.  Hell yes I want to know that you are good at what you do.

                   Of course thats true, and I never said it wasnt. But other things are just as important. Theres no reason that those qualities cant coexist. And for the record, I said most physicians are not dismissive. But as a nurse and soon to be NP, it happens way too often to be ignored or excused on the basis of IQ.

               If medically complex refers to specialist treatment-which is where most of those end up no matter who is caring for them-then I agree. But from the primary care side of things, NPs do the same thing doctors do in many hospitals and offices. Just a fact.

                 I was referring to this in your statement:  No doctor knows everything, and if they assume they do because of a high IQ they do their patients a disservice.
                 <br/>
                 Of course no one should ever assume to know it all.  What does that have to do with the benefits of physicians having &gt; average IQs?  Of course they should have other qualities as well.  One set of qualities does not diminish the importance of others.  By stating the bit about No doc know everything, you fuzz up the original point about physicians having &gt; average IQs.  Lets not dance circles around each other.  It is clear other qualities are needed in medicine.  Sigh.

                   The comment I replied to had nothing to do with physicians having higher IQs than others. As I said in my original comment, I was replying to the following statement: So you are less likely to be a good doctor if you have low IQ/MCATs since those indicators suggest that you wont be able to keep up with the other key component of being a good medical diagnostician.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That statement is not really true. MCATs have no bearing on how effective a physician will be, only on how well they may do on board exams (maybe). IQ, for the most part, has little bearing as well. Yes, if someones IQ is well below 100, they probably lack the cognitive ability necessary to be a physician. The point is that, in practice, most physicians fall into a certain range, say 105 to 140. Within that range, IQ contributes little to a physicians effectiveness (i.e. a physician with IQ of 110 can be as good or better than one at 120, and so on.) Thats not dancing circles, just the truth.
