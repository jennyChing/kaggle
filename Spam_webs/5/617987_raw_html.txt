This article originally appeared inThe Good Men Project.

Proposition: Evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, I think there is a 
place for thoughtful engagement over the clobber passages.

Yep. The Clobber Passages. Those six (or eight, depending on who youre 
talking to) passages in the Bible that appear to clobber the idea that 
God could ever love Gay people just the way they are.

As a liberal and an advocate for full LGBT inclusion in the life of both 
the church and the culture, I often run into a line of questioning 
(particularly on Social Media and the comment threads on blog posts I 
writeoh, the comment threads  boy howdy!) that goes something like this:

    How can you call yourself a Christian and still be for  you know 
    Gays? Dont you believe in the Bible?

I cant tell you how many literary interactions Ive had that began with 
something very much like, You cant believe that stuff and still believe 
the Bible. It happens. (Like here or here or here).

To which I respond with as much dignity as I can muster, trying hard not to 
sound like a third grader: Can too!

What happens next is predictable.

    Well then, what do you do with __ (fill in the blank with Genesis,
    Leviticus, Romans, etc.)?

So, I begin my spiel: You must realize that the world of the Bible and the 
world of twenty-first century suburbanites are different worlds   And off 
I go.

But as Im writing to my newest interlocutor for what seems to me at this 
point like the 37th time, I get a hollow feeling in my stomach. Even if I 
were the Albert Einstein of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, even if I 
could come up with some kind of seemingly airtight Thomist proof for my 
position, even if I could make the angels sing and the Begonias bloom on 
command (which, by the way, if it needs to be said, I am not and I cannot) 
I would still never be able to convince my conversational dance partner of 
the truth of my arguments  that the world out of which the Bible emerged 
could never have anticipated the world we inhabit.

I often despair, convinced that even making these arguments is pointless, 
since Im never going to convince the person with whom Im arguing.

Having said all that, though, I am beginning to think that having a 
well-reasoned response to the 
You-cant-be-a-Christian-and-still-believe-the-Bible-doesnt-condemn-gay-people 
argument is worthwhile  especially now.

Why do I say that?

Lisa Murkowski.

Yesterday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) came out in support of same 
gender marriage.

Big deal, you say. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) did something very nearly like 
it a few months ago.

I know. But as someone commented on my Facebook page yesterday after Id 
posted a link about Lisa Murkowski, It feels like were reaching critical 
mass.1

[As I write this, an announcement has just been released that the leader of 
Exodus International (an organizational leader in ex-gay treatment) is 
apologizing to the Gay community for years of abuse. Another article 
announces that Exodus International is shutting down altogether.]

I know right?

I think there can be no denying the obvious indicators that we are reaching 
critical mass, a sociological tipping point2 on the issue of embracing the 
full inclusion of LGBT people.

But heres the thing: This kind of cultural shift doesnt take place in an 
intellectual and moral vacuum.

What do I mean?

Well, even though the current is shifting, that doesnt mean everyone will 
automatically turn around and swim in the other direction  just because 
everyone else appears to be doing so. In fact, the cultural trope of 
hyper-individuality (Thank you, Baby Boomers!) stands explicitly over 
against the facile adoption of what everyone else is doing (c.f. your 
moms favorite incredulous question: You wouldnt jump off a bridge just 
because your friends did, would you?).

Consequently, and even if its for their own peace of mind, people who are 
making huge alterations in their thinking patterns need the fortification 
of good intellectual and moral reasoning. Most folks cant just turn on a 
dime; they need good reasons to change.

All of which we know instinctively, right?

But heres part of the psychology behind such a change: When things are 
moving so rapidly, many people who dont want to be left behind are 
looking for intellectual and moral reasons to do what everyone else is 
doing. Those reasons need some substance, of course. But if you can provide 
them good reasons, many people who find themselves in the midst of a great 
cultural shift, are looking for reasonable justification that will give 
them permission to change their minds.

Exhibit A: Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski, who has long opposed same gender 
marriage, admitted in March that her views on the issue have been evolving. 
The reason she gave yesterday for changing her mind involves an Alaskan 
military couple who are Lesbian. These two women have taken in foster 
children, prompting Murkowski to observe that our government does not meet 
this family halfway and allow them to be legally recognized as spouses. 
Our inability to recognize these fine womens relationship as legitimate 
gave Sen. Murkowski the reason she needed to change her mind.

Now, Im not saying that Sen. Murkowskis shift is a cynical ploy to get on 
the right side of history. Far from it. In fact, I take her at her word, 
believing she genuinely means what she says about the change in her 
thinking. Im just saying that when the cultural pressure to change reaches 
a certain point, many people will start listening to stories, Biblical 
arguments, scientific data that they were able to ignore before.

People need reassurances that theyre not jumping off a bridge into 
uncertain waters. Lisa Murkowski needed the story of that Lesbian family. 
Other people are going to need reassurance that they can simultaneously 
believe the Bible and that God doesnt hate Gay people.

So, I think refuting the clobber passages is an essential enterprise now 
more than evernot because it will convince those determined not to hear, 
but because it promises to give support to those searching for a new way to 
think.

      of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption

      behavior by widely adopting a previously rare practice. (

We live in a fragmented world, finding welcome and reconciliation at the table, as well as a charge to be welcoming and reconciling.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We embrace&nbsp;all who come with earnest hearts and a willingness to engage each other in thoughtful, honest, and compassionate discussion.&nbsp;

               Proposition: Evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, I think there is a place for thoughtful engagement over the clobber passages.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yep.  The Clobber Passages.  Those six (or eight, depending on who youre talking to) passages in the Bible that appear to clobber the idea that God could ever love Gay people just the way they are.

               As a liberal and an advocate for full LGBT inclusion in the life of both the church and the culture, I often run into a line of questioning (particularly on Social Media and the comment threads on blog posts I writeoh, the comment threads  boy howdy!) that goes something like this:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                How can you call yourself a Christian and still be for  you know  Gays?  Dont you believe in the Bible?
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               I cant tell you how many literary interactions Ive had that began with something very much like, You cant believe that stuff and still believe the Bible.  It happens.  (Like

               So, I begin my spiel: You must realize that the world of the Bible and the world of twenty-first century suburbanites are different worlds    And off I go.
              </p>
              <p>
               But as Im writing to my newest interlocutor for what seems to me at this point like the 37th time, I get a hollow feeling in my stomach.  Even if I were the Albert Einstein of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, even if I could come up with some kind of seemingly airtight Thomist proof for my position, even if I could make the angels sing and the Begonias bloom on command (which, by the way, if it needs to be said, I am not and I cannot) I would still never be able to convince my conversational dance partner of the truth of my arguments  that the world out of which the Bible emerged could never have anticipated the world we inhabit.

               I often despair, convinced that even making these arguments is pointless, since Im never going to convince the person with whom Im arguing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Having said all that, though, I am beginning to think that having a well-reasoned response to the You-cant-be-a-Christian-and-still-believe-the-Bible-doesnt-condemn-gay-people argument is worthwhile  especially now.

                Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) came out in support of same gender marriage

               I know.  But as someone commented on my Facebook page yesterday after Id posted a link about Lisa Murkowski, It feels like were reaching critical mass.

              <p>
               I know right?
              </p>
              <p>
               I think there can be no denying the obvious indicators that we are reaching critical mass, a sociological tipping point
               <a class="footnote" href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote">
                2
               </a>
               on the issue of embracing the full inclusion of LGBT people.
              </p>
              <p>
               But heres the thing: This kind of cultural shift doesnt take place in an intellectual and moral vacuum.
              </p>
              <p>
               What do I mean?
              </p>
              <p>
               Well, even though the current is shifting, that doesnt mean everyone will automatically turn around and swim in the other direction  just because everyone else appears to be doing so.  In fact, the cultural trope of hyper-individuality (Thank you, Baby Boomers!) stands explicitly over against the facile adoption of what everyone else is doing  (c.f. your moms favorite incredulous question: You wouldnt jump off a bridge just because your friends did, would you?).
              </p>
              <p>
               Consequently, and even if its for their own peace of mind, people who are making huge alterations in their thinking patterns need the fortification of good intellectual and moral reasoning.  Most folks cant just turn on a dime; they need good reasons to change.
              </p>
              <p>
               All of which we know instinctively, right?
              </p>
              <p>
               But heres part of the psychology behind such a change: When things are moving so rapidly, many people who dont want to be left behind are
               <strong>
                <em>
                 looking
                </em>
               </strong>
               for intellectual and moral reasons to do what everyone else is doing.  Those reasons need some substance, of course.  But if you can provide them good reasons, many people who find themselves in the midst of a great cultural shift, are looking for reasonable justification that will give them permission to change their minds.
              </p>
              <p>
               Exhibit A: Lisa Murkowski.  Murkowski, who has long opposed same gender marriage,
               <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/19/lisa-murkowski-gay-marriage_n_3465493.html?utm_hp_ref=daily-brief%253Futm_source%253DDailyBrief">
                admitted in March
               </a>
               that her views on the issue have been evolving.  The reason she gave yesterday for changing her mind involves an Alaskan military couple who are Lesbian.  These two women have taken in foster children, prompting Murkowski to observe that
               <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/lisa-murkowski-gay-marriage-stance-93047.html">
                our government does not meet this family halfway and allow them to be legally recognized as spouses.
               </a>
               Our inability to recognize these fine womens relationship as legitimate gave Sen. Murkowski the reason she needed to change her mind.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, Im not saying that Sen. Murkowskis shift is a cynical ploy to get on the right side of history.  Far from it.  In fact, I take her at her word, believing she genuinely means what she says about the change in her thinking.  Im just saying that when the cultural pressure to change reaches a certain point, many people will start listening to stories, Biblical arguments, scientific data that they were able to ignore before.
              </p>
              <p>
               People need reassurances that theyre not jumping off a bridge into uncertain waters.
Lisa Murkowski needed the story of that Lesbian family.  Other people are going to need reassurance that they can simultaneously believe the Bible and that God doesnt hate Gay people.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, I think refuting the clobber passages is an essential enterprise now more than evernot because it will convince those determined not to hear, but because it promises to give support to those searching for a new way to think.

                  In social dynamics, critical mass is a sufficient number of adopters of an innovation in a social system so that the rate of adoption becomes self-sustaining and creates further growth. (

                  In sociology, a tipping point is a point in time when a group-or a large number of group membersrapidly and dramatically changes its behavior by widely adopting a previously rare practice. (
