          Aura-Soma is a wonderful colourtherapy which was brought into being by the late Vicky Wall in 1983. It was designed to be a great beacon of light which draws people to it, so that they may consciously be healed through the non-intrusive force. Thus helping and putting people to find their own balance again, spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physicly. Colour Therapy is not new, it can be traced back thousands of years to the ancient Chinese, Egyptian and Greek cultures, who used herbs and coloured oils to help cure the sick.
          <br/>
          The dual coloured Aura-Soma oil bottles contain oils and essences, herbs and spices, water from Glastonbury, herbal colouring and crystal energies. The beautiful coloured bottles are created to put back the balance of those in need. In Aura-Soma we call the coloured oils living energies, who reach the people in form of wavelengths. You can just look at the bottles, put them at your side or even massage the oil into your body.

Aura-Soma is very much a healing therapy of the 21th century, as the "patient" himself selects the bottles he feels attracted to. So this therapy can be self diagnostic, non-intrusive and self curative. The patient is selfresponsable and should decide himself, when he wants to change bottles and "work" with a new one.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Aura-Soma Reading
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In a reading you are invited to select four coloured bottles. The colours that are chosen are a wonderful mirror of the self, the unconsciouss and consciouss self. Humans have auric colours which are the identification of the soul essence. The Aura is a guide for clearvoyants to read the person's potential, lifepurpose, scars and pains, emotional patterns etc. The Aura-Soma oils restores the energy flow in the aura and in the chakras and through this resonnance balance is found again.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Carolina trained many Aura-Soma Counselors who guide people in readings.
          <br/>
          She is a gifted Aura-Soma Bodyworker, applying the oils, pomanders and quintessences into the Aura and on the body. People experience deep spiritual and emotional healing, while during the session many pastlife scenes and blockages come into the consciousness and the patient can let them go.

            Bottle nr. 11 can also be used by a couple desiring to conceive a child, as Clear/Pink 
        supports a "conscious conception". This Set brings many benefits to both the mother and 
        the unborn child during pregnancy, with nr. 12, nr. 13, and nr. 14, being used
        for as many days, weeks or months as the intuition of the mother indicates is right.
            <br/>
            Bottle nr. 11 is suitable for use on newborn children, and should be continued until 
        either nine months of age or until the fontanels close. nr. 11 is also very helpful 
        with ear infections in children - regardless of the age.

            <br/>
            Bottle nr. 13 should be used on the child until the "rebellious" phase - often referred to as 
        the "terrible twos" is over. Continuous use of the Clear/Green Oil will soften this phase.

            Bottle nr. 15. Use of nr. 15 should begin at age 7, and continue to the onset of Puberty. It will 
        support the child to balance their male and female personality traits, discern and
        stand in their own truth, and move graciously and without fear into new or 
        expanded social groups or situations.

            <br/>
            Bottle nr. 12 should be used until the end of the nursing period. If the child is not nursed, 
        then use should continue until he/she can drink out of a cup by themselves. If this 
        transition has proven difficult, then the Clear/Blue Oil will ease the transition.

            Bottle nr. 14 should be used until the beginning of school - around age 6 or 7. As 
        its' name implies, it opens the way to subtle inner wisdom that otherwise would be 
        difficult to access and integrate.

             Oil nr. 94 reminds us that our individual Will is placed second to the Divine Will, and 
        as such the surrender is shown in the bottles colours - the Yellow of the individual 
        Will residing underneath the Blue of "Heaven". This is the Oil to facilitate moving
        from a state of Hope to a state of Faith, as all judgments and attachments are surrendered to 
        live in accordance with the larger Plan.

             Oil nr. 95 opens the way and supports those individuals that are becoming aware of 
        their Spiritual Selves. It is the proverbial "Wake Up" call, in that it switches the 
        focus from without to within, and makes one aware of the need to honour and 
        nurture their process and their awakening selves with patience and 
        self-compassion. Only by loving oneself
             <i>
              first
             </i>
             - can love for the 
        entire "Family of Man' finally be realised.

             Oil nr. 96 connects one to the "Peace that Passeth all Understanding", as worldly 
        cares and influences become illuminated so as to be recognised 
        for what they are - illusion. Clarity, vision and "seeing" what lies beyond 
        physical vision are all part of the promise this Angel brings - as the New 
        World awaits its birth, and prepares those that will be participating in that 
        future of Enlightenment.

             Oil nr. 97 is a combination which facilitates the refinement of one's
        inner-most essence (the Gold within), so that ego and personality may be 
        transmuted and transcended through the Divine portal of the Royal Blue Ray.
        In this process, the flow of Ancient Wisdom is unblocked, allowing the embodied 
	Soul to lovingly and coherently unfold this knowledge in times that will continue 
	to be even more chaotic.

             Oil nr. 98 is the second level of the Star-child, the new Christ ray coming through 
	subconsciously into 	the conscious higher mind of the pale violet, which is very powerful. 
	These two become one in the color pale pink, which holds a high frequency of unconditional love. We are 	being shown with this Archangel coming in now that it is time for our inner female and male
	to reunite and heal the internal issues of unrequited love for each other. Once this
	has been achieved we may return to the source of all love as one. Then we may co-operate
	and be in union with all that is, recognizing the joy of having our home in heaven right 
	here on earth - true bliss. Sandalphon brings together a realm of Angelic forces
	for change and growth through our own free will of inspiration and intuition.

             Oil nr.  is the second level of the Green/Pink and it's the first time the the Pale Olive has been born, which means a new light is being shone on the feminine leadership of the heart. Tzadkiel brings a real water quality from the energies that are contained within this bottle. It's the faith and the trust for a new beginning for many on the path and the hope for the future that gives the strength to the intuition and the possibility to joy, to love and to peace for the future. It's a step into freedom in a completely new way as the vibrations upon the earth begin to rise and we face our own responsability for ourselves within the context of this new energy.

          has taken many years to manifest, as the time between individual "Bottle Births" has varied from mere minutes, to a year or more !
          <br/>
          The influences that define the particular nature/meaning of a new Bottle include: position within the Ancient Kabbalah in terms of both the Tree of Life and the numerological attributes assigned by the Trust of Number (Light), Sacred Geometry, the Bottles' Natal Chart, and the colours that comprise both the Top (conscious Life), and Bottom (unconscious Life) Fraction.
          <br/>
          To gain a better understanding of these concepts, here is an overview of the various influences affecting the "Birth" attributes and correspondences of Bottle nr. 94.

          The Number of the position that Archangel Michael birthed into is 94, and 9 + 4 reduces
        to (is behind) the Number 13. Within the Tarot, the Number 13 is Death, and as one considers the
        interplay between the yellow (ego-self) in the Lower Fraction and the blue of the 
        Divine Blueprint in the Top Fraction, the colour metaphor for the tension of death or annihilation is quite visible.

          Behind the 13 is the Four, and not so coincidentally, 
        Bottle nr. 4
          <i>
           <b>
            Yellow over Gold
           </b>
          </i>
          is the
        specific Bottle that addresses the fulfillment of the
          <i>
           <b>
            "little 
        self"
           </b>
          </i>
          . So it is fascinating that Bottle nr. 94 which presents the opportunity to
        go beyond the little self and work instead under and for the Divine Blueprint, should
        have as the fundamental within it, the fulfillment of the individual on Earth - the geometry
        of Four.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If we consider this from the perspective of the Ancient Kabbalah and the
          <b>
           Tree of 
        Life"
          </b>
          , then we see that the two components of the bottle - Pale Blue and Pale Yellow - 
        (namely the two Masters El Moyra and Kuthumi), sit respectively in Kether of the Water
        World and Tiphereth of the Air World.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In the microcosm, this relationship is the connection between the crown chakra and 
        the solar plexus/heart centre. This represents the connection between Heaven and the Central
        Area where HUE-MAN resides - midway between Heaven and Earth - halfway between
        the Angelic and Devic Realms.

          <br/>
          <br/>
          So it is that Bottle nr. 94 is the connection between the Angelic Realm and the HUE-MAN
        Realm, and the path that connects these two spheres is that of Blue/Blue or Bottle 
        nr. 2. This is the walking of the lesson of trust that is seen in its intense form
        in the Top Fraction - Pale Blue. The Number Two is also significant because Two
        is the Number of Duality, and Bottle nr. 94 contains the fundamental of duality between
        two primary colours.
          <br/>

          This duality also exists left to right - male to female - as Bottle nr. 94 rests on the

          </b>
          of the
          <b>
           Tree of Life
          </b>
          . This is the neutral Pillar. As such, 
        Bottle nr. 94 sits between male and female as an androgynous energy. Note that Bottle nr. 94 
        directly follows the Twins -
          <b>
           Hansel
          </b>
          and
          <b>
           Gretel
          </b>
          - Bottles nr. 92 and nr. 93. 92 and 93 reduce to
        11 and 12 respectively. Bottles nr. 11 and nr. 12 are the Clear/Pink and Clear/Blue Bottles 
        which represent the male and female energies and would correspond to the Pillars on either
        side of the
          <b>
           Tree
          </b>
          - flanking nr. 94 in the neutral position. So, this Bottle is neither male or female exclusively, and yet 
        is a product of them and within each of them.

           Sacred Geometry
          </b>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Viewing the opposites as two circles that intersect, a new space is created by the 
         intersection points called the
          <b>
           Vesica Pisces
          </b>
          . The Vesica Pisces contains something of each, yet it is a new thing
         unto itself. So it is that One comes out of Two, and One and Two together make 
         Three, as does the Third bring a unity so that Three are in the One. Between the Two
         are both One and Three and this is the number 13 that is behind 94.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Referencing the Vesica Pisces once more, see the circles as the first Two Masters 
         -
          <b>
           EL Moyra
          </b>
          and
          <b>
           Kuthumi
          </b>
          . The image is of Two Light Beings co-operating as they care
         for this planet and the HUE-MANS upon it. The way in which their energies combine
         is the Vesica Pisces - open above the world - creating the mechanism for which this
         blessing of "Balance" enters our World.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          El Moyra and Kuthumi were the first Two Rays (Masters) to appear, yet, the Master
         Bottles themselves were indicated with the birth of Bottle nr.44 - which was the first time that
         pale colours (intensity) appeared within the sequence. nr. 44 Lilac over Blue is reflected in
         nr. 94. The Blue moves from Top to Bottom position and the Lilac of nr.44 and the Yellow 
         of nr. 94 are complements to one and another on the colour wheel.
         It is also significant that behind nr. 94 is the 4 and that 44 is the double 4. Even more
         amazing is that the reflection of 94 is 49, and this is the very Bottle that immediately
         preceded El Moyra and Kuthumi.

          THE AURA
         </a>
         <p>
          The aura is made up of seven main aura's which extend up to four feet from the body.
 These aura's all occupy the same space at the same time, each aura extending out further than the previos aura.
 All aura's are interconnected and reliant on the others for normal function.
         </p>
         <p>
          The seven main aura's of the aura are ETHERIC AURA : EMOTIONAL AURA : MENTAL AURA : ASTRAL AURA : ETHERIC AURA : ETHERIC TEMPLATE AURA : CELESTIAL AURA : KETHERIC TEMPLATE AURA.
         </p>
         <p>
          THE ETHERIC AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          The etheric aura extends about two inches out from the physical body and is usually a shade of blue in colour. 
The shade of the blue relates to the physical condition and health of the physical body. 
Athletes have strong etheric aura's of a deeper blue in shade. 
In the etheric aura you feel all the sensations, both pain and pleasure.
 Whenever their is pain the flow of energy in that area of the etheric is eratic.
         </p>
         <p>
          EMOTIONAL AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          The emotional aura extends about two to four inches from the physical body and appears as rainbow coloured clouds. 
This aura is associated with feelings.
 Positive feelings generally create bright colours, where as negative feelings generally create dark colours. 
Problems in this aura will eventually lead to problems in the first and third aura's.
         </p>
         <p>
          MENTAL AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          The mental aura extends about four to eight inches from the physical body and is usually a bright shade of yellow in colour. 
Within this aura are our thoughts and mental processes.
 The more active our thinking processes the brighter our mental aura becomes. 
Within this aura can be found thought forms.
         </p>
         <p>
          ASTRAL AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          The astral aura extends about eight to twelve inches from the physical body and appears as brightly coloured rainbow clouds.
 The astral aura is the bridge between the physical world and the spiritual world.
         </p>
         <p>
          ETHERIC TEMPLATE AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          The etheric template aura extends about twelve to twenty four inches from the physical body and appears as a blue print form.
 There is an empty groove in the etheric aura aura into which the etheric aura fits. The etheric template aura holds the etheric aura in place. It is the template for the etheric dimension.
         </p>
         <p>
          THE CELESTIAL AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          The celestial aura extends about twenty four inches from the physical body and appears as a brightr shimmering light of pastel colours. This is the level of feelings within the world of our spirit. Here we communicate with all the beings of the spiritual world.
         </p>
         <p>
          KETHERIC TEMPLATE AURA
         </p>
         <p>
          <how aura="" see="" the="" to="">
           The ketheric template aura extends about thirty six to forty eight inches from the physical body and appears as an extremley bright golden light that is rapidly pulsating. 
This aura takes on the form of a golden egg that surrounds and protects everything within it.
           <p>
            HOW TO SEE THE AURA
           </p>
           <p>
            Everybody has the ability to see the aura. For beginners a low light is the best way to start.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turn out the lights and lay on the bed. Leave the window curtains open and let the natural light flow in.
 As you are laying on the bed hold your hands out at full distance in front of you. 
Dont stare hard but rather just gaze at your hands.
 Moving your hands slowly, bring your fingertips together until they are almiost touching.
 You will notice a cloudy blue haze appear around your finger. 
This is the etheric aura.
           </p>
           <p>
            FEELING THE AURA
           </p>
           <p>
            Draw a circle on your left hand using your right fingertip. 
Dont let your finger touch your hand, keep it at a distance of about a half inch.
 Move slowly. 
You will feel the power of your aura.
