         The link shows chemical burns on protesters. It is still unknown what the chemical is. Or if toxicity will cause further problems to those affected.
         <br/>

         </blockquote>
         The situation in Turkey is no longer going to be controlled by police attacking the people. The highway between Europe and Asia has been blocked by thousands of protesters crossing the bridge. Police are escalating in their violence from the images of injuries I've seen. Including injuring young children, extensively.
         <p>
          The people of Turkey will not stand by silently as neo-liberal policies rob them blind.
         </p>
         <p>
          Until Edrogen steps down and the next leadership takes on a populist view these protests will just continue.

          <p>
           A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?
          </p>
          <p>
           Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.
          </p>
          <p>
           If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.
          </p>
          <p>
           Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.
          </p>

	Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries
	that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

           While his ham-fisted response to the protest has not impressed anyone, there's little sign his stature as the single most admired Turkish politician has been seriously undermined.

            Do not assume that Erdogan's electoral base feels that the secular, liberal Occupy-style crowd represents their interests.

             globe in response to an emphasis on human rights. The "in loco parentis" role has been seen as an acceptable compromise by wanna-be rulers, but the populace is no longer satisfied. People don't want to be ruled. They realize that there is a big difference between subordinating oneself to the common good and being subordinated by rulers or rules. Virtue turns into vice when it is coerced.

               the future. However, after having lived more than seventy years on three continents, I can report that there has been significant change in what people expect on the basis of what they have experienced.
               <br/>
               Some portion of the U.S. populace was quite satisfied with existence in the 1950s. Another portion, quite easily identified by the coloration of their skin, thought it would be satisfied by achieving the same standards as those enjoyed by the satisfied. Then it turned out that those standards were merely tolerated by the female portion of the whole population and following the dictates of fathers and husbands was not actually satisfying.
               <br/>
               There is some validity to the judgement that "some people are never satisfied." However, for some people that means, "we can do better," and for others it is merely a consequence of obsession.

                We live in a real world with billions of real human beings. Feeding them, caring for them and keeping them somewhat safe are all service missions that are deeply intertwined with frameworks of authority on multiple levels -- family, neighborhood, community, city, region, nation, ethnic diaspora, international.

               <p>
                Many rich, Western countries have taken strides to welcome women and ethnic minorities into the high echelons of that authority. But authority itself has been only strengthened by that addition.

               <p>
                None of us can know if the Turkish occupation is the forerunner of something inchoate. But in the short run, it is unlikely to displace Erdogan.

               <p>
                And even if he is forced to resign for his heavy-handed repression, his party will still run the show in Turkey. With overwhelming support from the Turkish "populace".

                I did not say most Turks love the repression. They think it has gone too far and was over the top.
               </p>
               <p>
                I was at Occupy in NYC and lived through the repression there as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most New Yorkers did not support the repression ordered by Mayor Bloomberg and approved by Governor Cuomo.
               </p>
               <p>
                Bloomberg and Cuomo survived their violent repression quite nicely, thank you. They remain popular politicians today. Cuomo's popularity ratings in NY are sky-high and people talk about him running for President.
               </p>
               <p>
                I stand by my statement that Erdogan is the most popular politician in Turkey by far. And it's not close. He is very likely to survive this crisis despite Turkish people disapproving of how he handled it.

               <p>
                I don't like it, but that's how it is.

                  If you're saying that a post-state anarchist utopia is hard-wired in our DNA, I can't go along with that.

                 <p>
                  Human societies back to the days of nomadic tribes have mixed collectivistic and individualistic elements. Authority of one kind or another has been present in virtually all of them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Primates, humans among them, act in collectives interwoven with shifting and contested webs of authority.

                 <p>
                  Occupy generated all kinds of new energy, tactics and approaches to contesting the nastiness of our current system.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I want those contests to go on in multiple experiments around the world. But the end is not certain. It's not written in our genes. Authority won't spontaneously evaporate.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The end is for us to design as we move forward, contesting the forces of violence, oppression and control that will stifle us still.

                      Tribes almost always DID contain hierarchies, albeit ones that the unpracticed Western eye was terrible at discerning.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      They had their own codes of conformity and extreme violence as well.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Not to mention, life for an individual within them was quite nasty and quite short.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The myth of the prehistorical Golden Age of tribal harmony goes back to Marx, then further to Rousseau, then even further to the Bible, then to prophets from time immemorial.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It's just a fairy tale. It's not real.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Real human societies always contained complexity, hierarchy, and violence. We'd best stop waiting for them to magically evaporate and learn to contend with them.

                        There is no natural "pure state" that it is possible to regenerate. The whole idea is an ancient, deep-seated myth, one that recent scholars have identified, derided as part and parcel of Romantic ideology, and dismissed as descriptive of reality in any meaningful manner.

                       whose works I've read, there were many examples of tribes organized along egalitarian, non-hierarchical forms of self-management.

                       There is a lot of variety among tribal societies. They don't "always" resort to hierarchy, and violence within the tribe. And peasant villages have also organized similarly.

                        And most anthropologists, whose works I've also read, would say that virtually every society contains forms of conformism, tribalism, authority, hierarchy and violence.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Humans are capable of many forms of social organization.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Social organization requires institutions which by their nature reify organs of control, repression, hierarchy, violence.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        That is true in the tribes you cite, and it's true in people around the world today.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Claiming that anarcho-democracy is in our genes, or more basic/essential than the state is not true, and not productive.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If you want to fight violence and hierarchy in our world, what is productive is explaining how to do so and fighting the very hard battle to install replacements.

                       <p>
                        Change is not immanent within us. We have to work for it, and it will not be simple, given the twisted human heart.

                        as if fact, as if you're an authority beyond question, which you're not (speaking of unwarranted authority).
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I've not seen a wide consensus among anthropologists on this to support your assertions. But I have seen references to various tribes which were egalitarian and non-hierarchical in formal organization, which refutes the notion there is universality in established hierarchical and central authority in ALL tribes.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And many of these early societies were based on gift economies, communally sharing land, food, tools, and shelters, which is an expression of an egalitarian social structure.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        As to claiming that anarchism is in our genes, as if existing alone as an absolute without
                        <em>
                         any other
                        </em>
                        tendency which mitigates egalitarianism, such as selfishness, or competitive behavior, I think that is a bit simplistic, and is a strawman. But that we have in our genes the capacity for anarchic social structure seems reasonable as a statement. We are complex animals, but we clearly are social and instinctively work as teams, which is a tendency that can be readily observed in countless examples.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I don't think anyone can reasonably deny humans have a communitarian tendency, as if our nature leans only toward the inefficiency of mutual struggle against each other, to the exclusion of other tendencies. This is because working cooperatively as a group is in the
                        <em>
                         self-interest of the individual.
                        </em>
                        It's easier to accomplish many tasks working in cooperation, which requires an ability to put aside inefficient anti-social behaviors of isolationism and individualism in order to survive. Self-interest and working together to survive are not only NOT mutually exclusive instincts, but stem from the same evolutionary adaptations.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Aggression and individual struggle certainly exist, but not to the exclusion of instincts of mutual aid and cooperation, and collective decision making. Even in the most hierarchical society, a close look will reveal ample examples of behaviors of cooperation and collective decision-making at work, as the people find ways to work around the inconvenience, inefficiency, and obstructive tendencies of the authoritarian grip of chiefs and monarchs.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And no said change is easy, that we don't have to exert effort to achieve a better society, or that finding constructive ways to lessen violence and hierarchy isn't necessary. That's just another strawman you erected.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You might want to do some reading about anarchism before acting as if an authority on the topic.

                       <p>
                        There is a wide consensus among anthropologists that all human societies that ever existed contained structures of authority, repression, conformity and violence. And that definitely includes the communal tribal societies you invoke.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The original poster suggested anarchism was natural and immanent within us. I disagreed. The straw man exists only in your imagination.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In subsequent comments I repeatedly said quite clearly that I believed human beings were complex. I never said we required an authoritarian system; I said that every human's concern for personal and social power, violence, domination and conformity is part of the very mixed bag that is human nature.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You've completely misunderstood and mis-stated my position, so the bulk of the rest of your comment is irrelevant. It consists of truisms that you, I, and sensible people accept.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Human beings are a mixed bag, as are all human societies. There is no simple path to an anarcho-democratic future.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I've done plenty of reading about anarchism. And, as usual, the straw men are all in your own mind alone. We are referencing here two of anarchist writers' biggest and most recurrent flaws:
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        (1)
                        <strong>
                         Ungrounded assertions that anarchism is somehow more "natural" than other systems
                        </strong>
                        and that once distorted humanity removes their blinders they will smash the state.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        (2)
                        <strong>
                         No mechanism for bringing this day about
                        </strong>
                        . Some of the most prominent contemporary anarchist writers get quite vague about when and how the state-smashing will happen. In some, the Marxist specter of imminent revolution produced by the system lingers. Unconvincing. In many others, they merely say that over centuries here and there state alternatives will be experimented with and slowly something else will emerge to replace states. Well, we can make vague prognostications about slow future change about pretty much anything. Unconvincing.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Fighting violence is great. But I'm not sure what sense fighting hierarchy itself makes and what would replace it. That latter feeling is widespread enough to explain the lack of successful anarchist (post-)states in our world today.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Anarchists have a lot of work to do to convince people they have reasonable alternatives for living in our world. And if we want to build a better world, anarchist or no, we will definitely face a difficult challenge in which answers are not so clear.

                        of our points, which inevitably seems to happen in these kinds of discussions.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Again, I've read of tribal social structures which were clearly egalitarian and horizontal (anarchic) so I don't know what you base your opinion on.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Graeber, for example, is just one source of information about anarchist tribal societies, and he describes several in his writings. Other sources corroborate this view.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And as to natural tendencies in how people govern themselves, I think that is fraught with complexity, but by and large I think humans do lean that direction, but that isn't the only basis to favor anarchic living arrangements.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Anarchism is the only form of self-management of society that eliminates the key causes of corruption and exploitation, and allows the existence of a free society based on equality and egalitarianism, which in the long run will be necessary if humans are to keep from destroying themselves and the planet. And it is the only social arrangement that respects the human right to live in a state free of dominance, exploitation, and slavery by exogenous, unjustified authoritarianism.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        It balances the needs of the community with the needs of individuals, and eliminates the opportunism that other systems invite and foster.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        As to mechanism to bring this about, that has been thoroughly discussed over the decades. The authoritarian grip on society is very strong at the moment, and breaking people free from the social conditioning from years of capitalist propaganda is not going to be easy. We're lied to about history and capitalism in the schools from an early age, kept preoccupied with little time for self education, dominated by corporate media, given a narrow latitude of electoral choices, and people tend to respond to this by turning off to political debate, which in any case is hard to come by unless people read widely (on the internet).
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This is why major changes come at times in history when societies are disrupted by collapse and discord. Times like that will come again, inevitably. But there are other approaches. Anarchists often talk about carving out the eggshell from the inside, by creating, for example, a co-op movement that fosters worker owned and managed businesses. As more people wake up to the enormous disadvantages of capitalism, and realize we don't need to resort to Bolshevik forms of authoritarian socialism if we want alternatives (which Americans, in particular, have been brainwashed to believe is the only form of socialism), anarchism will begin to become known again, and in fact the popularity of anarchism is on the rise.

                        One reason I find anarchism worth studying is I believe it is important for people to have some understanding of what kind of society and sociopolitical structure they favor. If we don't discuss and get a grasp of our options, we have no favored default position to which to compare our current system. How can we understand, for example, the extremely unfair, exploitative nature of wage labor practiced in capitalism if we don't know of other social arrangements?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This is one reason people don't revolt against the system. They don't think there are other viable choices, and the minute socialism is mentioned they think of the faux communist regimes like the former USSR, China, Cuba, etc, which were widely influenced by Lenin and Stalin and are highly authoritarian and oppressive.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Anarchism answers this, but most people today are completely ignorant about anarchism, thanks to years of cold war propaganda (which the new generations were not exposed to as much, and thus far more open to socialism than older generations).
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I find studying alternatives to capitalism highly useful and necessary, because it provides a contrast to help me understand the real nature of capitalism. So, even if anarchist society doesn't come about in my lifetime, I am enriched by knowing there is another way of living that would be far superior, and this gives me insights into human rights, authoritarianism, justice, economics, without which I would be rather clueless in my political understanding.

                        Most people don't "favor" any particular society or sociopolitical system. They simply are born into one. Then they make the best life they can for themselves given where they are. They would be puzzled by your question of comparing wage labor to other systems simply because no other systems exist and their imperative is to live and flourish in the one to which they are born.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        There are many reasons people don't revolt against the system. First of all, they do rebel and revolt all the time, in productive and unproductive ways. Secondly, it is hard to make said revolts contest the system in general because people feel they have a role within the system as is. It is when they lose that sense entirely that they are more willing to contemplate alternatives.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If people want to understand why and how capitalism exists, it is important as well to study the history of how it came into being. It was a crazy, drawn-out, unplanned, "anarchic" (excuse the word choice) tale, as much of world history is. History teaches us some vital lessons. Social systems have never been selected in an abstract void. Free individuals never were in a position to step back from the world, debate the options, and make a selection of how to live in a way that would be best for them and their fellows. Reality has always been there forcing us to graft our systems around its contours. The closest we have come to enduring social justice is representative democracy, and it was a long, bloody struggle just to implement that!
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Untold millions have fought and died to end serfdom, end slavery, establish property rights, establish voting rights, and establish some semblance of democracy. So those of us who study history are loathe to give up the few restraints we spent so much blood to gain on the 1% for what appears to be a pipe dream... For example, if we declared New York anarchy today, what would the 1% do? Join us? Give us their wealth? No, man, they'd do just what they did to Occupy. They'd crush us, laugh about us over stuffed prawns on 5th Ave, take in a Broadway show and keep donating to Bloomberg.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Like you, I believe that America is prisoner to a cascade of idiotic authoritarian and self-immolating impulses. It's a unilateral capitalist economic superpower in the initial phases of its inevitable decline. As it starts to sink, panic has set in as the 1% desperately try to maintain their world pre-eminence by extracting as much wealth from the laborers of the world as they can while keeping the home population docile and lulled by the illusion that their fates are tied to the fortunes of the Wall Street financial elite.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Occupy Wall Street indeed. I supported it and still do. But the outcome will not be anarchy. At best, it will be a more socialistic system, and that's definitely an endeavor that I support. And it is achievable in coming decades. Hey, it's a start.

                        I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but I have to disagree.

                       <p>
                        Graeber is an anarchist first and an anthropologist second. Other sources do not corroborate his view. In fact, he has been roundly criticized for over-emphasizing the horizontal nature of tribal societies and neglecting their vertical aspects.
                        <br/>
                        These vertical aspects are sometimes atypical of those found in Western societies and thus more difficult for us to identify and ascertain, but they are nonetheless present. For example, many "horizontal" societies do, as it turns out, have an informal vertical power structure that takes time and patience to discern. They are also prone to sexual oppression, literally beating and raping wayward females into submission. They also tend to view outsiders as "others" to be suspected, resisted, and slaughtered on occasion.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        What kind of model is this?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Across over a hundred years of anthropology, and around the world today, all human societies have always contained hierarchies and institutions of repression and violence.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        There is nothing "natural" about anarchism. We evolved over millions of years in a cruel and unyielding natural world, carving out a barely subsistence existence as bands of tribal nomads. Social life was grueling and fraught with internal and external violence. Death was always around the corner, and life was difficult, marked by malnutrition, disease and desperation.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Since the dawn of "modern civilization", as its shadow side became evident, thinkers have dreamed of reverting to a "better" natural state.  I argue that no such state ever existed. Life is tough and ugly now, and it was tougher and uglier before modern times. What is there to go back to?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Anarchism hasn't been proven to do anything. Who is to say it can eliminate corruption and exploitation? What if I were to argue that we are all free individuals, and that human beings in our fickle hearts are always, always capable of evil? No social form or nice plan or another can weed that out of us, no matter how hard we try.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You say anarchism will provide "a state free of dominance", etc. First of all, anarchism is supposed to provide no state at all, it is supposed to smash the state. But perhaps you meant "state" figuratively here? In that case, people of good will around the world have long struggled against dominance and exploitation. I fail to see why they have to be anarchists, or indeed what anarchism has necessarily to do with those struggles.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        All systems work to "balanc[e] the needs of community with the needs of individuals". And this includes nation-states as they exist today. There's nothing unique to anarchism in working toward that goal.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Places of the world that have turned anarchic have fallen into economic ruin and turned prey to warlords and psychopaths. Somalia, Liberia, Haiti are all fine examples of what happens when the nation-state weakens and anarchy is established.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If the goal of anarchism (as has been consistently held, up to and including Graeber) is to smash the state, there is no evidence good will come of the smashing. There is ample evidence that poverty and misery will follow.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I do agree with you that people are not educated well. You are also right that myths of authoritarian control are too strong in many places, particularly in America. A better, braver education ought to be more widely available. But we appear to disagree on the means and the end of fighting that authoritarian impulse. Take Oklahoma. You can spread education as much as you want and offer anarchist solutions, but what do you do when a vast majority of the population says "No thanks"? The fact is, most people are not as thoughtful or educated as you and I, and perhaps never will be. Not everyone may be up for or at all interested in participating in the radical public sphere anarchists imagine. What then?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Your last paragraph is much better. Devising anti-authoritarian practices and projects in our world is a vital and welcome task. But perhaps it portends a society, for now still ensconced in the nation-state, that can and will drift in a more benevolent direction? A recent Pew poll of young Americans even showed that they viewed socialism more positively than capitalism. The future may not be anarchism, and it may never be anarchism, and we may find it most effective to keep up the painful task of chiseling and re-chiseling the world as it is to become something more like the world as it could be.

                       I would say Graeber is first an anthropologist, and second an anarchist. Most of his writings are from an anthropological perspective. And I find it interesting that few people ask what political system is favored by most anthropologists. Would an anthropologist with a typical capitalist worldview allow capitalism to influence his or her conclusions? Certainly no less than anarchism influences Graeber.
                       <p>
                        But Graeber isn't the only anthropologist with this view. I provided below 2 sources I found online in seconds that corroborate the widely held view that hunter gatherer societies were more or less horizontal in leadership and egalitarian in approach. One is a basic online university course.

                        In each of these societies, the dominant cultural ethos was one that emphasized individual autonomy, non-directive childrearing methods, nonviolence, sharing, cooperation, and consensual decision-making. Their core value, which underlay all of the rest, was that of the equality of individuals.
                        <br/>
                        We citizens of a modern democracy claim to believe in equality, but our sense of equality is not even close that of hunter-gatherers. The hunter-gatherer version of equality meant that each person was equally entitled to food, regardless of his or her ability to find or capture it; so food was shared. It meant that nobody had more wealth than anyone else; so all material goods were shared. It meant that nobody had the right to tell others what to do; so each person made his or her own decisions. It meant that even parents didn't have the right to order their children around; hence the non-directive childrearing methods that I have discussed in previous posts. It meant that group decisions had to be made by consensus; hence no boss, "big man," or chief.

                         If just one anthropologist had reported all this, we might assume that he or she was a starry-eyed romantic who was seeing things that weren't really there, or was a liar. But many anthropologists, of all political stripes, regarding many different hunter-gatherer cultures, have told the same general story. There are some variations from culture to culture, of course, and not all of the cultures are quite as peaceful and fully egalitarian as others, but the generalities are the same.

                        <br/>
                        Most people in the world today live in a state-organized society. States are recognizable because their governments use population controls, such as a census and citizenship, and impose taxation, which is used to support a permanent military and police, and to support a system of laws and judges. In addition, members of a state have differential access to resources. As typical as states might seem to most people today, they have only existed for about 5,500 years and they have only been widespread for the last few centuries.

                         Why would the question "take me to your leader" be unusual for some people?
                         <br/>
                         In Star Trek, when the crew of the Enterprise lands on a strange planet, their first question of the natives is usually some variant of "Take me to your leader." In a similar way, the first Europeans who arrived in the New World during the 16th and 17th centuries asked the same question. This question reflects their (and our) natural assumption that in any group there is a leadership office. But what anthropologists know, and the 16th and 17th century explorers found out, is that this question can often lead to some confusion, because for societies with some forms of social or political organization there is no office of leadership. Among bands and tribes, there may be influential individuals (called big men or village heads by anthropologists), but there is no office of leadership they fill. Any authority these individuals have comes from their power of persuasion, not from the authority of the office. Remember how there was anxiety among the press and the citizens during the United States presidential election of 2000 because there was a delay in determining the winner (the press frequently called the one-month delay a "Constitutional Crisis"). The anxiety stemmed from the assumption of all Americans that at all times there is someone who is President. Anthropologists know that this assumption is not universal.

                        These vertical aspects are sometimes atypical of those found in Western societies and thus more difficult for us to identify and ascertain, but they are nonetheless present. For example, many "horizontal" societies do, as it turns out, have an informal vertical power structure that takes time and patience to discern. They are also prone to sexual oppression, literally beating and raping wayward females into submission. They also tend to view outsiders as "others" to be suspected, resisted, and slaughtered on occasion.

                       I notice you qualified your assertion by stating "many horizontal societies" rather than "all" of them. This depends on what kind of tribes to which you're referring. I was referring to early hunter gatherer tribes. You may be referring to later agrarian tribes. Agrarianism introduced a lot of changes in social tendencies, such as division of labor, and hierarchy became more common. When I refer to early societies, I'm referring to pre-agrarian peoples. Hunter gatherers. And while there may be subtle forms of hierarchy in any group, that is far different from formal hierarchy, in which people are under the control of a formal authority.

                       <blockquote>
                        There is nothing "natural" about anarchism. We evolved over millions of years in a cruel and unyielding natural world, carving out a barely subsistence existence as bands of tribal nomads. Social life was grueling and fraught with internal and external violence. Death was always around the corner, and life was difficult, marked by malnutrition, disease and desperation.
                       </blockquote>
                       Actually, this isn't at all true. I remember one study in which aborigines in Australia who had left traditional tribal environments and went to live and work in a large city. The researchers had them go back to their natural tribal habitat in order to observe the differences in health, stress, hours of work, leisure time, etc. The researchers were surprised to discover the subjects worked less, had more time for play, were less stressed, and happier, in the tribal environment. And some studies have indicated hunter gatherers had less "diseases of civilization". The reason life was often shorter is due to trauma, not necessarily to disease. The fact that humans had migrated to every continent, with a world population of millions during paleolithic times, indicates we adapted and survived very well.

                       Strawman argument. I'm not arguing we return to a primitive way of life. While there are anarcho-primitivists who might have such a view, most anarchists don't advocate any such thing. In fact, anarchists argue that humans are complex, with traits of cooperation as well as competitiveness, and that the notion we should create a society that accentuates the worst of human traits is the worst path we could take. It is far better to adopt a system that accentuates our better traits. There is quite a bit of writing on anarchism that delve into these topics, so I urge you to do some reading. I can't write all of this out for you, and I'm just scratching the surface in this response. I'm not going to give you links which delve into these issues you raise and answer thoroughly your criticisms, because I have concluded you aren't open-minded to viewing anything that doesn't confirm your bias, and getting together the links takes time and work.

                       Anarchism is much more comprehensive in ending exploitation than alternatives, like state socialism, or capitalism. In state socialism, there is still central authority and hierarchy, and thus still the exploitation of wage slavery, with the socialist state authority replacing the capitalist boss. In capitalism, exclusive ownership of the means of production robs the workers of the wealth created by their labor, thus wealth is extracted from the majority working class in order to enrich the minority owner class. Anyway, to answer your question would take more time than I'm willing to spend on you at the moment. Do some reading, some thinking, get out of your preconceived notions.

                       Not true. Capitalism does no such thing. It leaves many people destitute, without homes, food to eat, in complete poverty. It also is undemocratic, since the wealthy class tends to end up with the most concentration of political power, as well as with the highest concentration of wealth. The individual often has no voice at all, and is often at the mercy of the state, in relative powerlessness against enormous forms of coercion and control.

                       The countries you mentioned are not anarchic. Anarchism does not replace the central state with disorganization, but rather, with a different kind of organization. And with that comment you've made, I can now see you've not read

                        Anarchism, on the other hand, uses participatory communities and worker organizations, using direct democracy, and these smaller groups voluntarily group together in federations, to which delegates are sent who are recallable and mandated. All authority comes from the bottom up, without formal hierarchy. Anarchists would not permit thugs to run around bullying people into submission. If anarchists allowed that, they wouldn't really be anarchists. You see, anarchists will readily defend themselves (using militias) from aggressors. Anarchism removes the state, but

                       Nonsense. In anarchist Spain (1936 - 1938), conversion to anarchism produced increased consumption (people had been hungry before), greater worker satisfaction at the workplace, increased production, increased innovation, universal health care, retirement benefits for all (equal to average wages), increases in standard of living. The reason it didn't last is because the fascists won (they were supplied with far superior weaponry and assistance from Nazi and Italian fascists, while the US, France, and Britain refused to step in to help).

                        I do agree with you that people are not educated well. You are also right that myths of authoritarian control are too strong in many places, particularly in America. A better, braver education ought to be more widely available. But we appear to disagree on the means and the end of fighting that authoritarian impulse. Take Oklahoma. You can spread education as much as you want and offer anarchist solutions, but what do you do when a vast majority of the population says "No thanks"? The fact is, most people are not as thoughtful or educated as you and I, and perhaps never will be. Not everyone may be up for or at all interested in participating in the radical public sphere anarchists imagine. What then?
                       </blockquote>
                       It's a matter of timing. In the thirties, there were far more anarchists and socialists, but thanks to the cold war, people have been fed decades of propaganda against any form of socialism. But the youth is changing according to surveys, and now are more open to these alternatives to capitalism. Just when you think things won't change, they do.

             Our blue brothers and sisters living in the Deep South can attest to this. Their representatives and governors are freely and fairly elected by a populace that would like us to return to the 18th century. I'm not sure what the solution is for secular Turks living in a country dominated by people more religious than they are. But one either believes in democracy or not; if you believe that the will of the people can be overturned if enough of the minority wants to protest in the park, then you don't believe in democracy.

             It's a tough situation when you think the minority is right.
