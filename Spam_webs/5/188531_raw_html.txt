    Good customer service is more than helping the customers who actually reach out to you.
   </p>
   <p>
    One time, years ago when I lived in San Francisco, I went out to dinner with some friends. The restaurant was a popular one, and it was packed.
   </p>
   <p>
    While our expectations were high, the mishaps started not two minutes after we were seated, when a waiter opened and started pouring the bottle of wine we had brought at another table.
   </p>
   <p>
    Things only got worse from there, as they later brought out the wrong dish for one of us, and
    <em>
     no dish at all
    </em>
    for another. One dish was burnt, and one round of drinks was completely forgotten. In the end, we had to ask to have two items we didnt order (or receive) removed from the bill.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, we didnt raise a fuss about it. We were having fun, and as the comedy of errors unfolded, even managed to laugh it off as the screw-ups we counted went into the double digits.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still, one of my friends at the table is an avid Yelp user. She reviews every restaurant she tries, and the next day, she posted her thoughts on our experience.
   </p>
   <p>
    It wasnt exactly a glowing review.
   </p>
   <p>
    But the restaurant was listening; the same day, the manager posted a response to her review asking her to give him a call and explain what happened. She did, he tripped over himself to apologize, and offered a comped meal for all of us if we came back.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was a good example of
    <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/support/how-to-deal-with-an-angry-customer">
     customer service recovery
    </a>
    , but thats not what this post is about.
   </p>
   <p>
    The reason Im sharing this story is to illustrate what that restaurant  and thousands of others  deeply understand: that their customers arent telling them every time theres an issue. Instead, theyre going elsewhere and sharing their problems with others.
   </p>
   <p>
    The research makes it clear: according to a survey by
    <a href="http://leeresources.com/">
     Lee Resources International
    </a>
    , for every customer who complains, there are 26 customers who dont say anything to
    <em>
     you
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="" src="/attachments/support/customer-service-phrases/1-complaint-26-customers.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    But often, those customers with issues
    <em>
     are
    </em>
    telling others about it. By finding those issues in the wild and solving them, you dont only build better relationships with your customers, but you set yourself apart as a business that will do whatever it takes to make things right.
   </p>

     Your job isnt just to solve the problems that come your way. Its also to solve the ones that dont.

   <h2>
    How To Find Customer Issues
    <span class="linebreak">
    </span>
    Outside Of Your Inbox
   </h2>
   <p>
    There are three things you can do that will make outbound support easy for you and your team:
   </p>
   <h3>
    1) Watch your social media accounts.
   </h3>
   <p>
    Yes, I realize that Im about eight years late in saying join the social conversation (ugh).
   </p>
   <p>
    But its important! Often, social media is the
    <em>
     first
    </em>
    place customers will go to look for support.
   </p>
   <p>
    With this being the case, its amazing how many business Twitter accounts sit unmonitored and unused. As it turns out, thats a costly mistake: a 2012
    <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2101515">
     Gartner study
    </a>
    suggests that failure to respond via social channels can lead to a 15% increase in churn.
   </p>

     Its better to not be on Twitter at all than to look like youre ignoring your customers.
    </a>
   </p>
   <div class="bb-note">
    <h3 style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:10px">
     Tip: Twitter Search
    </h3>
    <p>
     Dont assume that your customers know your Twitter handle. In fact,
     <a href="http://landing.conversocial.com/report-a-day-in-the-life-of-brands-on-twitter">
      research
     </a>
     shows that only 3% of brand mentions actually use a Twitter handle, instead opting for the company or product name. Search for your product or business name on a regular basis (some tools, like
     <a href="https://hootsuite.com/">
      HootSuite
     </a>
     , will automatically update your feed with new search results) to see what people are saying.
    </p>
   </div>
   <h3>
    2) Understand where your customers hang out online.
   </h3>
   <p>
    Unlike with restaurants, your customers probably arent talking about you on Yelp.
   </p>
   <p>
    You have to dig a little harder.
   </p>
   <p>
    But if youre doing
    <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog/customer-development">
     customer development
    </a>
    like you should and talking to your customers, then you probably understand them well enough to know where they have conversations with others online.
   </p>
   <p>
    If your customers are developers, they may be mentioning you on places like
    <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">
     Stack Exchange
    </a>
    or
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">
     Stack Overflow
    </a>
    . If theyre SaaS startups, they might frequent
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">
     Hacker News
    </a>
    . And no matter what niche youre in, theres probably a
    <a href="http://www.reddit.com/reddits/">
     subreddit or two
    </a>
    that captures your customers perfectly.
   </p>
   <p>
    By listening and participating in the same communities as your customers do, youll have your ear to the ground when a mention of your product occurs, not to mention a better relationship with  and a much deeper understanding of  the people you sell to.
   </p>
   <h3>
    3) Use monitoring tools.
   </h3>
   <p>
    There are tools out there that crawl the web and tell you when your product or brand gets mentioned somewhere.
   </p>
   <p>
    They range from free search tools like
    <a href="http://www.socialmention.com/">
     Social Mention
    </a>
    
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="" src="/attachments/support/outbound-customer-service/socialmention.png"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    To full-featured, paid products like
    <a href="http://moz.com/tools/fresh-web-explorer">
     Mozs Fresh Web Explorer
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    <img alt="" src="/attachments/support/outbound-customer-service/fresh-web-explorer.jpg"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    These tools can help you stay on top of when and where your product gets mentioned. Theyre great for marketing, but just as important for customer support.
   </p>

    How To Respond To Customer Issues
    <span class="linebreak">
    </span>
    In The Wild
   </h2>
   <p>
    So, youre doing the right things and listening in the right places, and you see someone post an issue theyre having with your product.
   </p>
   <p>
    What do you do?
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>
     Solve the problem for them.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p>
    Reach out, either via the channel they post in, or personally via email, and do what you can to make things right.
   </p>
   <p>
    About a year ago, a blogger posted his review of a number of help desk apps, including
    <a href="http://www.groovehq.com">
     Groove
    </a>
    . He mentioned some things he liked about Groove, and a couple that he didnt.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the end, he wrapped up with:
   </p>
   <p>
    <img src="/attachments/blog/non-scaleable-growth-tactics/decision.png" srcset="/attachments/blog/non-scaleable-growth-tactics/decision@2x.png 2x"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    Not a great ending for us.
   </p>
   <p>
    But instead of getting defensive or asking him to remove negative feedback (one of the biggest mistakes you can make in outbound support), we reached out and offered to make things right.
   </p>
   <p>
    A few weeks later, he posted an update:
   </p>
   <p>
    <img src="/attachments/blog/non-scaleable-growth-tactics/tyler-returns.png" srcset="/attachments/blog/non-scaleable-growth-tactics/tyler-returns@2x.png 2x"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    Simply by listening and responding to issues that we
    <em>
     werent
    </em>
    being told about, we were able to turn a former customer into a loyal long-term customer.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Go Beyond Your Inbox
   </h2>
   <p>
    With only 1 in 26 upset customers deciding to send you an email about it, you simply cant afford to ignore those customers who choose to share their complaints with others.
   </p>
   <p>
    Go out there. Find them. And do everything you can to make them happy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Because great customer service doesnt stop at your support inbox.
