        Telegenisys India Pvt. Ltd.
       </b>
       specializes in "business process outsourcing"
  for medium-sized companies worldwide, and they boast a singular vision -- to
  one day achieve the
       <b>
        SEVEN F'S
       </b>
       of customer service. In no particular
  order, these f-words are

  and First Class!

       <b>
        Business
  process outsourcing
       </b>
       is
  a euphemism for lowballing bids on jobs like engineering, tech support, customer
  service or
       <a href="/library/culture/spongebob/">
        animation
       </a>
       , and setting up "call centers" in countries like India,
  China, Egypt, and the Philippines.

       Apart from movies and television, America's premiere exports
  are overindulgence, depression,
       <a href="/library/death/suicide/suicide-notes/">
        premature death
       </a>
       and regime change. There's
  no better way than to enjoy all of the above
  than working in an overpopulated Indian call center. India, crowned by businesses
  around the globe as the
       <b>
        world's
  back office,
       </b>
       employs
  350,000 people in the outsourcing industry each year, adding 150,000 new
  jobs every twelve months. Just imagine them all stuffed in one single cubicle
  clonking phones together and you begin to approximate the sensation. The average
  call center can house
       <b>
        fifteen hundred
       </b>
       20-year-old Indian technology
  graduates.

       When a business in the United States hands over all its
       <b>
        call center
       </b>
       jobs
  to workers in India, it means that young Indians will be on the telephone
  with you a great deal: answering your customer service questions, troubleshooting
  your software problems and assisting you with credit card inquiries from thousands
  of miles away. Similar outsourcing corporations exist here in America, but
  the majority of jobs go to domestic incarcerated prisoners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the time difference between
    India and the United States, Indian employees work
       <b>
        graveyard
  shifts,
       </b>
       arriving at the office  in the early evening (6:30pm) and returning
  home shortly before dawn (3:30am). The adjustment to such odd hours is hitting
  India hard, and carrying with it a host of health problems: digestive disease,
  hair loss, back pain and stress to name just a few. An estimated 50,000 young
  English-speaking Indians have already been exposed to the phenomenon of
       <b>
        accent
  stress.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <img align="right" height="150" hspace="10" src="cs_expo.jpg" vspace="10" width="200"/>
       In hundreds of classrooms across
  India, instructors from as far away as the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
  School of Business and Britain's Oxford University have set up workshops which
  serve to neutralize an Indian's accent before he or she ever touches a telephone.
  It can take
       <b>
        weeks
       </b>
       to teach someone how to "flatten out" their Indian
  intonations, to pronounce
       <i>
        Pottery Barn
       </i>
       more like
       <i>
        Poddery
  Barn.
       </i>
       Accent-neutralization classes incorporate a whole toolbox of geography
  lessons, regional dialects, and shorthand introductions to American culture
  -- including holidays and baseball scores. Some Indians are asked to act out
  Western fairy tales, perform Shakespeare, and examine popular caricatures of
  Indians like
       <b>
        Apu
       </b>
       from
       <i>
        The Simpsons.
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever tried
       <b>
        faking an English accent
       </b>
       for eight to ten hours
  a day? What a  pain in the ass. You get a sore throat that never heals.
  Crowded offices populated with hundreds of equally sick individual
       <img align="left" height="159" hspace="10" src="cs_dots.jpg" vspace="10" width="235"/>
       s merely
  exacerbates the situation. Some girls develop menstrual problems. Orthopedic
  distress and chain-smoking are other common symptoms. Many India call center
  employees find it difficult to have a positive outlook towards life when they
  can't even get a good night's sleep. Employees deal with
  an average of one hundred phone calls per shift -- more if their excitable
  manager is feeling "pumped up" for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Study these pictures of Indian call centers closely: these are not cuddly,
  friendly, operator-in-command studios in the traditional sense. Look at the
  top of every single computer monitor, where
       <b>
        nobody
       </b>
       has lined up collectable
  figurines from Pixar's
       <i>
        The Incredibles
       </i>
       . Where are the
       <i>
        Dilbert
       </i>
       mugs,
  the cat calendars, the bowls of candy pushed forth to foster friendship and
  camaraderie among employees? Okay, very well: where are the
       <i>
        Bollywood
       </i>
       posters,
  the
       <i>
        curry
       </i>
       forks,
  the
       <i>
        belly-dancing
       </i>
       platforms? Sometimes there's a banner on the call-center
  floor:
       <b>
        WEAR YOUR BEST SMILE AND MAKE YOUR CUSTOMER SMILE TOO!
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <img align="right" height="314" hspace="10" src="cs_bus.jpg" vspace="10" width="450"/>
       The quality of life in India, despite
    the lack of material comforts and amenities, is rich in religion, family,
  and human relationships -- none of which matter two shits when you're troubleshooting
    someone's Photoshop serial number halfway around the world, or helping some
  fat lady in Alabama figure out why her debit card won't come out of the ATM
  machine. The moment your shift is over, your chair gets warmed by another
  representative
       <b>
        ("rep")
       </b>
       ready
    to take over where you left off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <b>
        rep's
       </b>
       job is complex, to say the least. Chances are he'll be talking
  to someone as ignorant about India as he or she might be about America.
      </p>
      <p>

       One of the worst things you can do while trying to navigate a
  call center is to make a racist remark or a negative comment insulting an Indian
  rep's ancestry, heritage or skin color. When confronted with such
  a volatile situation, the rep will have no choice but to flip open the chapter
  on "setting
  boundaries for the conversation," and proceed accordingly. His or her voice
  will drop down to neutral or matter-of-fact tones, showing as little emotional
  reaction as possible, in the hopes your anger doesn't escalate. The rep's job
  is to help you subscribe to the Playboy channel, not to make you a better
  human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reverse racism scenario is equally worthy of study: what does
    a rep do when the
       <b>
        caller
       </b>
       believes he or she is a target of racism? Let's
  watch one of the most offensive (and effective) verbal strategies you as a
  customer can pull:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        <i>
         <img align="right" height="290" hspace="10" src="cc_borat.jpg" vspace="10" width="400"/>
         Customer:
        </i>
       </b>
       <i>
        I asked you twice now already: can I get the chamois
    crib covers in bronzeberry frost
        <u>
         and
        </u>
        periwinkle or do I have to take my business
    to Ikea?
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        <b>
         Employee:
        </b>
        I do believe we have those colors in stock. One "sec"
    while I check the figures.
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        <b>
         Customer:
        </b>
        Woah -- did you just call me and my family a bunch of
    niggers?
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       In this scenario, the rep will have no choice but to indirectly
    acknowledge the racist accusation with a neutral observational remark
    such as
       <i>
        it sounds
  like you're pretty frustrated.
       </i>
       Without so much as a pause, the rep will
  then U-turn the conversation back to the bronzeberry
  and periwinkle matters at hand. By delivering
       <b>
        empathy
  statements
       </b>
       which properly
  identify your feelings of frustration, and immediately following them up with
       <b>
        choices
  of appeal
       </b>
       which a customer can embrace, refuse, or ignore, the Indian rep
  can avoid further intimidation.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, responding positively is not always sufficient.
    The customer can
       <i>
        repeat
       </i>
       the accusation, even going so far as to suggest
    everyone in the company is "out to get" a particular race. This is where
    even experienced reps can choke: these remarks
       <b>
        <i>
         <img align="left" height="256" hspace="10" src="cs_center2.jpg" vspace="10" width="390"/>
        </i>
        must
    be treated
       </b>
       more seriously
    than other insinuations. If the situation cannot be sufficiently diffused,
    the customer might bring his case to the media -- who in turn will play endlessly
    looped recordings of the rep's technique, reflecting poorly upon the whole
    call center.
      </p>
      <p>
       In such an event, a company's best public relations maneuver is
    to fire that rep -- or the entire call center -- in 
    response to a news story that just won't die, thereby exorcising "troublemakers
    from within"
    without once examining mitigating circumstances. Companies can be somewhat
    reluctant to evangelize the number of outsource employees answering phones
    ten thousand light years away.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a multicultural world, and nobody understands each other. A rep's
       <b>
        self-control
       </b>
       is
  critical at racist junctures (however unfair or unjustified the accusations)
  and the same holds true for
       <b>
        sexism.
       </b>
       Both men and women can be victims
  of sexist comments, but Indian women are more likely to be targets, particularly
  when the subject of the call involves computers, mathematics, construction,
  or machinery. In this example, the customer is a male and the employee is a
  female.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        <i>
         <img align="right" height="323" src="cs_callcenter.jpg" width="431"/>
         Customer:
        </i>
       </b>
       <i>
        Not to be rude, but in my experience women just aren't
    that knowledgeable about auto repair. I'd be way more comfortable
    discussing all this with a man.
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        <b>
         Employee:
        </b>
        I understand. The thing is, if you want your car fixed
    today, I'm the only person available. So it's up to you what you want to
    do. I'm happy to discuss the problem with your car so we can get it fixed
    before the weekend.
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        <b>
         Customer:
        </b>
        How about I come down there and shave off your tits with
    a cheese grater?
       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       Again the rep must avoid
  being "drawn in" to an argument about a woman's natural abilities in the auto
shop. While sexist remarks can be insulting and demeaning, it's imperative that
  the female rep
       <b>
        not take the bait.
       </b>
       Instead, she must briefly reassure
  the male customer of her experience and skill and then immediately refocus
  the conversation back to the customer's car. Unfortunately in this instance,
  the caller chose to respond with another sexist comment: the implication
  that a woman without breasts would be an acceptable alternative to a male mechanic.
The caller might also have requested some "customer cervix".
      </p>
      <p>
       <img align="left" height="150" hspace="10" src="cs_banner.gif" vspace="10" width="500"/>
       Call center employees are trained to understand that a customer's fit
  of pique surfaces for one of two reasons. The anger can be a byproduct of the
  company, product or service in question -- or it can arise from personal matters
  completely unrelated to the rep. One such "unrelated" form of anger involves
  the caller's past negative experiences with vaguely similar agencies. Callers
  to a
       <b>
        government institution,
       </b>
       for
  instance, may approach the act of speaking to a rep with only disdain, factoring
in a lifetime of perceived injustices, exasperation and defeat.

       Callers become "difficult" when they feel their expectations have not been
  met, but our fearless Indian rep attempted the most logical course of action:
  she communicated an awareness of "where the customer is coming from". Hey
  man, I'm hip to your vibe; this life we endure -- how strange, yet how jolly;
  etcetera. We're all in it together, kid. This
  faux familiarity
       <i>
        (fauxmiliarity, n.)
       </i>
       must be delivered with complete
  neutrality, neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the caller, and certainly
  not dwelling on
       <b>
        old stuff.
       </b>
       Time-traveling is a strategy widely
  employed by call centers: the rep puts callers in a Wonka-style time machine,
  transporting them from the past into the present, with promises of four-star
  customer accommodation in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anger management is a challenge in any culture. If the callers' connections
  are free of line noise and their wireless phones are adequately filtering out
  unwanted background sound, there are only three communication barriers which
  threaten reps: foreign language customers, callers with impenetrable accents,
  and customers with speech disabilities.
      </p>

       </i>
      </p>
      <p>
       There can be only one common
  solution to these barriers. The customer service
  rep must
       <b>
        try
  and try and try again
       </b>
       to satisfy the customer's inquiry, under the mindful
  wiretapping of eavesdropping superiors. The Indian call center rep is a heavily-monitored
  surgeon performing delicate service operations, and all conversation must be
  reduced into shorter meta-sentences with periodic summarizations of the discussion
  so far.
      </p>

       If untreated, anger inevitably leads to abuse. Customers are far more aggressive
on the phone than in person. Not surprisingly, the
       <i>
        take-this-job-and-please-to-shove-it
       </i>
       rate
is high in call centers in India, as thirty to forty percent of most workers
quit within the first year. They are quickly replaced: English speaking youngsters in India are clamoring for jobs which pay anywhere from $160 to $300 per month.
