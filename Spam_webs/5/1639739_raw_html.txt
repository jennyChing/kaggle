       The questions remain. How did so many bombs get placed in the
building without anyone noticing? Did the three teenagers found in a field have anything to do with it? They seemed to have had a great deal of knowledge about the shooting. Why did they say no bullies at Columbine? Why haven't the"third-gunman" reports received more attention? Why does the top investigator with the FBI have disturbing ties to Columbine and the shootings? Why were officers told not to talk? Why are some files "missing"? Did Klebold and Harris wear masks, or were
       <i>
        other
       </i>
       assailants wearing masks? What is to be made of the numerous timeline discrepancies? What happened to them on Jan 30, 1998? Who else knew?  Why were Manes and Duran arrested and others not?  There are even
more questions and fewer answers...

               There have been numerous school shootings or similar planned incidents since 4-20-99 that refer to or are inspired by Columbine.

                cult heroes

               They have apparently succeeded, according to the evidence:

               played a key role in stimulating his behavior.

               Columbine massacre in Colorado -- left five people wounded.
               <br/>
               According to an article in the Ottawa Citizen, a 15-year-old boy, who was teased mercilessly by his classmates, became
               <strong>
                obsessed with the Columbine school massacre
               </strong>
               and the violent perpetrators of the tragic event. He posted pictures of the young men in his lockers and began counting down the days until the anniversary.

               John LaDue, 17, arrested for planning to bomb and shoot up his school, Waseca Junior/Senior High School in Waseca Minnesota on the 15nth anniversary of Columbine.  "LaDue in fact, idolized
               <strong>
                Columbine shooter Eric Harris
               </strong>
               and made several references to Harris and fellow shooter Dylan Klebold in a 180-page journal that spelled out details of his plan.  Police also found a black trenchcoat in his storage unit where kept his homemade bombs."

               These copycat incidents have caused many times the damage in terms of lives and money than the origonal incident ever did.  So when you talk of Columbine, I guess the question is, did it ever really end?

                Twin sisters, 29, from Australia tour Canada and the US.  They stop in Denver for five weeks, where they go to an outdoor gun range, rent two .22 caliber pistols for $20, and then shoot themselves in the head in a double suicide attempt(one twin survived).  News articles about the Columbine massacre are found in their luggage.  This occured Monday, 11-15-10, so I'm not sure why the story broke late Thursday--four days later.

                AUSTRALIAN twins Kristin and Candace Hermeler were carrying articles about one of America's worst school massacres when they shot themselves in a bizarre suicide pact.

                <br/>
                ..... As police interviewed the surviving twin, Candace, officers said a search of their bags had found magazine articles, clippings and letters related to the 1999 massacre at
                <strong>
                 Columbine High School

                <br/>
                [Comment:  Well, we know how they are going after all the privately-owned firearms from every angle, so this spate of shootings indicates to me they are going after

                 firing ranges

                now.  Thus the Columbine stuff found might just be one of those inside 'tells' that lets those 'in the know' what is really going on.]

                <strong>
                 appear to have been fascinated by the 1999 Columbine High School shooting massacre
                </strong>
                in Colorado that left 15 dead and 24 injured.

                <br/>
                When investigators from the Arapahoe County sheriffs searched Candace and Kristin Hermeler's hotel room earlier this week they discovered magazine articles, news clippings and letters related to the school shooting rampage, including a photocopy of a magazine cover story about the suspects in the Columbine case, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. .....
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The surviving Hermeler sister was interviewed for almost two hours by sheriffs on Thursday and confirmed she had entered a suicide pact, but denied they had any obsession or infatuation with Columbine High School.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "At that point, she did get frustrated, agitated, and basically said she didn't care about Columbine," Capt Perea said.

                <blockquote>
                 Twin sisters, 29, from Australia tour Canada and the US. They stop in Denver for five weeks, where they go to an outdoor gun range, rent two .22 caliber pistols for $20, and then shoot themselves in the head in a double suicide attempt(one twin survived). News articles about the Columbine massacre are found in their luggage. This occured Monday, 11-15-10, so I'm not sure why the story broke late Thursday--four days later.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 That is beyond bizarre. A few things:
                </p>
                <p>
                 1) Why would you stop in Denver of all places for five weeks when touring the U. S.?
                </p>
                <p>
                 2) Gun-based suicides tend to indicate a very serious intent to die
                </p>
                <p>
                 3) 99.9% of the time, it's males who "run amok"
                </p>
                <p>
                 4) Unless they were saving the articles all these years, where'd they get the clippings, and why would this have been such a burning interest that they would have felt a need to carry them around for a decade or so?
                </p>
                <p>
                 5) At 29 (same age as the class of '99), they were hardly impressionable youths, and it's hard to explain the Columbine connection as some sort of compulsive urge which took eleven years to manifest itself. So when did they get this desire and why would it have taken the shape of Columbine?
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 Thus the Columbine stuff found might just be one of those inside 'tells' that lets those 'in the know' what is really going on.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 I very much agree as I'm strongly reminded of the will and Koran found in the 9/11 hijacker's suitcase (was it Atta's?) that just happened to get stuck on the baggage carousel so as to be preserved for posterity. I wonder how far this goes.

                 A few more thoughts on the death:
                </p>
                <p>
                 1) Suicide pacts are usually a feature of mind control of the type found in cults, deeply abusive relationships, etc. Between family members, there is usually a strong survival bonding formed so as to be sure to try to keep the lineage going: in other words, the exact opposite of a suicide pact. One article said they came from a loving family and wanted for nothing. That may or may not be accurate but the point is, for family members to help each other die for no particular reason, there's got to be something pretty bad going on. So in other words, this alleged death pact between family members is very suspicious. See also: "The Victorian twins had their hair "done fancy" and seemed "pretty happy" when they arrived at the Family Shooting Centre in Colorado before the mysterious incident." (
                 <a href="http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/surviving-twin-wont-explain-suicide-pact-20101119-17zo8.html" target="_blank">
                  http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/surviving-twin-wont-explain-suicide-pact-20101119-17zo8.html
                 </a>
                 )
                </p>
                <p>
                 2) a) How do you survive a self-inflicted head shot, period and b) then recover enough to give an even semi-coherent two-hour interview within the next few days?
                </p>
                <p>
                 3) The cameras recorded the sisters falling but not actually shooting themselves. ("The incident was partly caught on security cameras.  "It does not show the actual shooting that occurred, Capt Perea said. However, it does show the girls falling to the ground.") So of course, the question is, did they shoot themselves or did someone else shoot them? (Three suicides at one range in twelve months is sort of a lot. Semi-officially, though, "Mitch Hamilton, a worker at the centre, [...] said the wounds were not caused by other shooters or a ricocheted bullet."
                 <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                 4) Why would they have shot for an hour and a half and then shoot themselves? Why take so long? Twenty minutes, maybe, but an hour and a half?
                </p>
                <p>
                 5) Any details on the prior suicides there?
                </p>
                <p>
                 6) "The sheriff's office said their visas showed one of them had arrived in Colorado on September 7 and the other on August 19, with one due to fly back to Australia today." (
                 <a href="http://www.watoday.com.au/world/australian-twin-sisters-shot-in-head-at-shooting-range-20101117-17wl3.html" target="_blank">
                  http://www.watoday.com.au/world/australian-twin-sisters-shot-in-head-at-shooting-range-20101117-17wl3.html
                 </a>
                 ) The visas were said to have been for "cultural exchange." What did these women do for a living and how were they supporting themselves on this very long excursion?

                Indeed there are many unanswered questions about this case.  And they sure seem anxious for this one to fade away quickly:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_16659007?source=pkg" target="_blank">

                </a>
                <br/>
                Sheriff's investigators do not believe that Candice Hermeler committed any crime* and
                <strong>
                 there will be no need to further interview her
                </strong>
                , Perea said.
                <br/>
                "As far as we're concerned," Perea said, "
                <strong>
                 the case is closed
                </strong>
                ."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                and they are backing away from the Columbine link:

                </a>
                <br/>
                Perea addressed media reports that a link to the 1999 Columbine killings was found among the women's possessions. He said the link consisted only of a photocopy of a Time magazine cover, from May 3, 1999, that depicted shooters Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.
                <br/>
                "There were no other clippings or documents, nothing else on Columbine," Perea said. Candice denied any interest in the case and there was no other evidence to suggest a link, Perea said.  When investigators asked Candice about the magazine cover, Perea said, Candice replied: "
                <strong>
                 I don't give a (expletive). It happened a long time ago
                </strong>

                 United States
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Historically, various states listed the act as a felony, but all were reluctant to enforce it. By 1963, six states still considered attempted suicide a crime (North and South Dakota, Washington, New Jersey, Nevada, and Oklahoma, which repealed its law in 1976). By the early 1990s only two US states still listed suicide as a crime, and these have since removed that classification. In some U.S. states, suicide is still considered an unwritten "common law crime," as stated in Blackstone's Commentaries. (So held the Virginia Supreme Court in Wackwitz v. Roy in 1992.) As a common law crime, suicide can bar recovery for the family of the suicidal person in a lawsuit unless the suicidal person can be proven to have been "of unsound mind." That is, the suicide must be proven to have been an involuntary, not voluntary, act of the victim in order for the family to be awarded money damages by the court. This can occur when the family of the deceased sues the caregiver (perhaps a jail or hospital) for negligence in failing to provide appropriate care.[6] Some legal scholars look at the issue as one of personal liberty. According to Nadine Strossen, former President of the ACLU, "The idea of government making determinations about how you end your life, forcing you...could be considered cruel and unusual punishment in certain circumstances, and Justice Stevens in a very interesting opinion in a right-to-die [case] raised the analogy."[7]

                 Interestingly, from the same page:

                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Australia (Victoria)
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  In the Australian state of Victoria [where the women are from], while suicide itself is no longer a crime, a survivor of a suicide pact can be charged with manslaughter. Also, it is a crime to counsel, incite, or aid and abet another to attempt or commit suicide, and the law explicitly allows any person to use "such force as may reasonably be necessary" to prevent another from committing suicide.

                Apparently attempted suicide is not a crime in Colorado, according to the newest info.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Anyway, one source is now reporting that the dead victim--Kristin Hermeler--wrote two letters to Brooks Brown back in June and July of 1999:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <a href="http://cbs4denver.com/local/twin.suicide.pact.2.2017160.html" target="_blank">
                 http://cbs4denver.com/loc...cide.pact.2.2017160.html
                </a>
                <br/>
                ....their(the women's) connection dates back to 1999, just a couple of months after the shooting.
                <br/>
                Kristin wrote two letters to Brooks Brown, a student at Columbine High School who was once targeted by Eric Harris, one of the Columbine gunmen. ...
                <br/>
                In one letter dated June 12, 1999, Kristin wrote, "As someone who has been rejected, victimized and ostracized in their life, I would like to thank you for giving him (Eric) that chance."
                <br/>
                She went on to write, "Thank you for not judging and for accepting Eric and Dylan who were, from what I have heard, rejected and victimized by so many others. Thank you so much. Sincerely, Kristin."
                <br/>
                In another letter dated July 14, 1999, she wrote, "... you felt like everyone hates you. Words could never tell you how sorry I am that you feel like anyone hates you. It completely baffles me as to why anyone would hate someone when they don't know them, it sickens me."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The source of these letters is apparently the Brown family.  In an online posting, Randy wrote this:

                "... We just had two letters from them and Judy and Brooks had talked to them a number of times on the phone. They had written us and called us after the Columbine tragedy. In the letter, and on the phone, they talked about being bullied and teased. They talked about not being given a second chance. She was sensitive, kind and a very nice little girl. We contacted Rick because we wanted to get these two letters to the parents. The Columbine connection is there, because the girls contacted us, but it is there in that they were sensitive, nice and cared about the tragedy. ..."
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I wonder if the women attempted to contact Brooks Brown, or any of the other Columbine figures, in the time they were in Denver. Also, the initial reports mentioned articles and clippings about 4/20 discovered in their possession, but also 'letters.' Did they find a reply letter from Brooks or other people?  Note this newest revelation
                <span style="text-decoration:underline">
                 directly contradicts
                </span>
                the sheriff's contention that the one photocopy of the Time magazine cover story was the only link to Columbine discovered in this case.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I am also surprised we have heard nothing about an online presence for these women. They must have left some kind of trail behind.

                 "But there was never anything we came across to indicate that they had intended to do another Columbine," said Captain Louie Perea, Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office. "Obviously, it was an interest, but nothing to indicate they were going to harm anyone other than themselves."

                The twins DID meet the profile of a school shooter in two ways:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                --they had a strong interest in the Columbine massacre, and apparently sympathized with the shooters
                <br/>
                <br/>
                --they were seen practicing at the gun range, on at least three different occasions
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Did the twins have a strong interest in guns and shooting generally?  There is no evidence of that.  Nor do you need to fire hundreds of rounds to familiarize yourself with weapons if all you're going to do is shoot yourself in the head.  So why exactly did they go to that range so many times?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What is in that written report on the results of the search warrant of their belongings?  Among the articles of clothing listed, did they find, say, long black coats or black BDUs?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If I were an investigator in this case, I would go to every gun store, gun show, and shooting range in the Denver area to see if they had attempted to procure weapons. I would also visit every local place where they have internet access--internet cafes and public libraries--to see if the twins accessed the net and what they were talking about, and with who. And of course I would have focused like a laser beam on where they were the weekend before the shooting, which no one seems to know about. The sheriff doesn't appear to have done this, so in no way, shape, or form can this case be considered 'closed.'

                 Even if the suicide attempt itself is not a crime, it's not like they chugged a bottle of aspirin in public or something; they (allegedly) fired guns in a place where theoretically, the bullets could have, by ricochet or a direct hit, injured or killed bystanders. Is that not a problem? Also, were the Hermelers aware that there had already been two suicides at that particular range this year (1/3 of American gun range suicides)?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now, it comes out that they called up Brooks Brown on the telephone back in the day. It wouldn't be surprising to learn that those initial reports of a deeper Columbine connection were correct, not in the least. But what, and why, especially in the context of the questions posted above?

                 I went looking for that sort of thing last night and was surprised at how difficult it was to wade through the hundreds of news stories and message board posts which have already appeared regarding this case. Their names yield no results on Facebook as of today.

                Agreed. Some differences are a lack of history of mental illness, drug use, occult practices, etc. (at least, as reported so far). Also, they are past the typical age range and female.

                 In my estimation, the repeated practicing at the range would indicate that they were not planning a suicide, as would their demeanor as well. But again, you're on a tour of America: is spending five weeks in Denver going to shooting ranges your first priority?

                <p>
                 Back to the photocopy of the Time magazine cover featuring Harris and Klebold. If you "didn't give an [expletive]" about Columbine, why in the world would you have made the photocopy in the first place, much less be carrying it around? This item, again, reeks of being planted for effect, with or without the Hermelers' knowledge, which would indicate some sort of knowledge of some event on someone's part by which the artifact would be made public knowledge. Those initial reports about it being a Columbine keepsake time capsule rather than just the one piece, though, may well have been correct, in which case a can of worms would surely be opened.

                The Arapahoe County Coroner's office also has concluded its investigation into Kristin Hermeler's death. ....
                <br/>
                (Sheriff's Captain Louie Perea) confirmed the two women initially checked out of the Denver area hotel where they were staying on November 12, but
                <span style="text-decoration:underline">
                 checked back in
                </span>
                the following day.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Did the bullets recovered from their bodies ballistically match the weapons they were firing?  Did they even bother to take blood samples to see if they were under the influence of some drug?  It doesn't sound like it, as these normally take several weeks at least to analyze.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                They initially told us the twins left the hotel on Friday.  If they had checked back in, why didn't they note that immediately?  Sounds like they don't want to tell us about that last 48 hours, so they just made up this 'checked back in' stuff.
                <br/>

                 Very interesting. Where had they been prior to entering Colorado? Why were they even in the Denver area in the first place, especially for so long? Where were they planning on going after they left? Or weren't they planning on leaving at all? What happened in those last 48 hours?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Usually, when people travel abroad, especially for "cultural exchange," they want to see as much of their host country as they can. Even if limited by a small budget, people can usually make up for this in some way by going on the cheap, staying in hostels, etc. But no, the Hermelers hole up in Colorado for months, carrying around Columbine memorabilia and going to target shoots. Why? Were they making contact with anyone there on a regular basis? What sort of connections did they have there prior to their arrival? Were they working?
                </p>
                <p>
                 How long had they been at the hotel they had been staying at and did they have another hotel booked to follow that, or was there some sort of bizarre spree preceding the gun range incident? No reports of them seeming crazed or appearing disheveled have surfaced that I've seen so I can't imagine some kind of bender leading up to the shooting. Also, their accuracy at the range probably would have been way off, and would they have even been able to hold their attention on it for a full ninety minutes if coming down from one or more drugs? Didn't a report say they were there for lessons? Surely the instructor could shed some light on their final minutes.

                The twins... were in the US on
                <strong>
                 90-day cultural exchange visas
                </strong>
                ...
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I guess the big question is what they were doing during that 12 week period, especially the last five weeks they spent in Denver, as they claim.  But how do they know they had been there for five weeks?  The only thing I can think of is the La Quinta Inn register had them signing in five weeks prior.  But that would only prove they had been in that hotel; it raises the possibility that their entire visit had been spent in Denver.  And who exactly sponsored their visit, and for what reason?

                The "cultural exchange visa" widely reported as their entree requires an American
                <strong>
                 organisation or individual to act as

                 </span>
                </strong>
                .  Captain Perea* said it was not known who had sponsored the sisters.  Nor was it known
                <strong>
                 for whom they had worked or whom they had

                , as required under the terms of the visa.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Training?  Well, the only 'training' I have heard of is this:

                One sister had
                <span style="text-decoration:underline">
                 gun training
                </span>
                two weeks before the shooting, and both showed up at the range about a week later for additional

                Also this odd note, which only this source reported:

                --Police had said earlier that after the shooting

                 unidentified personal effects
                </span>

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Huh?  I wonder if they have "identified" them by this time?

                <br/>
                *For what it's worth, in 1999 the current ACSO spokesman was Sgt. Louie Perea, ACSO SWAT.
                <br/>
                On 4-20, he responded to CHS at about 1pm.  He is vague on what exactly he was doing there, but one of his jobs was to guard the main library doors after the library had been secured. (see 8285)  So he was in a position to see and hear plenty.  The perfect Columbine gatekeeper.

                The twins were probably on the "Q" International Cultural Exchange Visitor visa. From the U. S Department of State:
                <blockquote>
                 What is a Q International Cultural Exchange Visitor?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 <p>
                  There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons to participate in exchange visitor programs in the U.S. under immigration law. The "J" exchange visitor visa is for educational and cultural exchange programs designated by the DOS, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and is discussed here. The "Q-1" visa is for certain international cultural exchange programs designed to provide practical training and employment, and sharing of the history, culture, and traditions of participants home country in the U.S.. The training/employment must be approved in advance by USCIS on the basis of a petition, Form I-129, filed by the U.S. sponsor. To learn more, go to the USCIS website by selecting Q International Cultural Exchange. To learn more about applying for the Q visa, select temporary worker visa.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 It's probably the "Q" and not the "J" that they were using, from the sound of it:

                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  There are two nonimmigrant visa categories for persons who want to participate in Exchange Visitor programs in the United States. The J nonimmigrant visa is for educational and cultural exchange programs designated by the Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs. The Q nonimmigrant visa is for international cultural exchange programs designated by USCIS. For more information on Exchange Visitors, see the Department of State: Exchange Visitor (J) Visas link to the right.

                  <br/>
                  You may be eligible for a Q-1 nonimmigrant visa if you are seeking to participate in an international cultural exchange program. The Q nonimmigrant exchange program is for the purpose of providing practical training and employment, and to share the history, culture, and traditions of your home country with the United States.

                  <br/>
                  Only employers who administer cultural exchange programs are allowed to petition for Q nonimmigrants.  The purpose of the Q nonimmigrant visa is to facilitate the sharing of international cultures. It is an employment oriented program, but an integral part of your duties must have a cultural element.  You must be at least 18 years old and be able to communicate effectively about the cultural attributes of your country.

                  <br/>
                  Your sponsoring organization must file Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, with the USCIS office specified in the form instructions (see the Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker link to the right).  In addition, the employer must submit evidence that the employer maintains an established international cultural exchange program. This may be demonstrated by submitting copies of catalogs, brochures or other types of material which illustrate that the cultural component of the program is designed to give an overview of the attitude, customs, history, heritage, philosophy, tradition and/or other cultural attributes of the participant's home country.  The employer may also submit evidence which illustrates that the program activities take place in a public setting where the sharing of culture can be achieved through direct interaction with the American public or a segment thereof.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  In addition, the employer must establish that:

                 </p>
                 <p>

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It will offer the alien wages and working conditions comparable to those accorded local workers similarly employed
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It has the financial ability to compensate the participant(s), as shown by a copy of the employer's most recent annual report, business income tax return or other form of certified accountant's report
                  <br/>
                 </p>

                  After you complete your Q cultural exchange program, you are afforded 30 days to depart the United States.  You are required to spend 1 year outside the United States before you can apply for participation in the Q cultural exchange program again.

                  The Q nonimmigrant visa does not have a provision for any spouse or children to accompany or follow to join a Q-1 nonimmigrant. Therefore, any spouse or children must qualify for a visa classification for which they may be eligible.

                Interesting how Perea's 11K statement doesn't have the initial time he responded in the first sentence, only the 1305 later on.
                <p>
                 And I wonder why they were going shooting so often (or at all)? Was this a part of their reason for being in the country?

                Yeah, the cops should have grilled the desk clerks at the La Quinta Inn about the hours kept by the twins.  Did they come and go at regular times, as though they had an appointment to keep?  Or did they come and go at odd hours, or spend most of the time in their room?  Who was paying the bills for this trip?  They had apparently been to the US previously, so it certainly doesn't sound like they were just average tourists.

                Any word on where the Hermelers were working or what the cultural component of their stay entailed? It sounds like there are pretty specific Q visa requirements that would have applied to them, the details of which would probably shed some light on the situation. The general lack of this information is somewhat conspicuous. Five weeks in one room with two beds at La Quinta would run about $2100.

                The ASCO has released more info, and the story gets curiouser.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                According to newly released documents, when investigators went through the women's belongings at their hotel, they found several self-help and spiritual books. There were also some
                <strong>
                 articles and clippings
                </strong>
                about the 1999 Columbine shootings, and correspondence from the family of Columbine gunman
                <strong>
                 Dylan Klebold
                </strong>
                . There was also correspondence with the family of Columbine victim
                <strong>
                 Cory Depooter
                </strong>
                .
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At first they said they found articles, clippings, and letters about Columbine, including the copy of the Time magazine cover.  Then it was, no--only the Time magazine photocopy was found.  Now it's back to articles, clippings and letters.  I guess the big question here is why did ACSO feel the need to massage the story in a particular direction?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Also check out the video of the twins at the firing range.  They said the girls had their hair done up 'fancy,' and they were described as being a bit overdressed for the occasion.  But I don't see that here.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <br/>
                Klebold's father, Tom, told News4 he was not aware of the letter, but said his wife might have written to the twins.  ....
                <br/>
                A cab driver who picked them up at their hotel near Arapahoe Road and Interstate 25 and drove them to the park said they were happy and joking around.
                <br/>
                "They wanted to go to the Cherry Creek State Park to jog and to walk," he states, adding that
                <strong>
                 they were not sure where they wanted to go in the park
                </strong>
                .
                <br/>
                He dropped them off at the west entrance at South Dayton Street near East Belleview Avenue, about
                <strong>
                 a mile
                </strong>
                from the range, where they had fired rented guns twice before.

                A person at the range, however, told investigators they "did not seem happy and something didn't seem right, but he could not put his finger on it."

                The more I hear learn about the details, the more hinky the story gets.  I wonder if those 'spiritual' books don't have an occultic subject matter.

                 Lots of people have read about Columbine -- some have even become Harris and Klebold groupies -- but only a select few go as far as contacting the Klebolds, the Depooters (?) and the Browns (by phone, no less). Perhaps an unusually deep fascination with the Columbine shooting was a major factor in Denver being their destination during their stay, perhaps they had some sort of contacts or plans in Colorado related to this and perhaps it's for this sort of reason that the ACSO is trying to play it down so much.

                  Also check out the video of the twins at the firing range. They said the girls had their hair done up 'fancy,' and they were described as being a bit overdressed for the occasion. But I don't see that here.

                  A cab driver who picked them up at their hotel near Arapahoe Road and Interstate 25 and drove them to the park said they were happy and joking around. "They wanted to go to the Cherry Creek State Park to jog and to walk," he states, adding that they were not sure where they wanted to go in the park.

                 To me, the twins don't look like they're ready to walk down the aisle but they don't slovenly, either. It looks like sneakers, jeans and a black pea coat on one and sneakers, slacks and some sort of purple top on the other. Compared to the exceptionally plain dress of the other (all-male?) shooters, they do stand out a little bit but again, it's nothing you wouldn't expect from two young women their age. The body language fits the cab driver's description; they seem to be alert and of a positive emotional disposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On another note, if this was the only camera, it looks like the shots which felled them wouldn't have been visible due to them being in the stall. At least as far as the video goes, the bullets could have come from several angles.

                 I want to stress again, though, that this "suicide pact" thing is highly suspect in itself. People, much less family members, don't just enter into suicide pacts for no reason. Something deep was at play here and I wonder if it was somehow connected to an (international?) plot involving violence, given the Columbine references. There are clues in here, possibly to some of the unanswered questions of Columbine itself.

                The Melbourne woman who shot herself dead at a US firing range as part of a suicide pact with her twin had made her sister the executor of her will, police say.  Kristin and Candice Hermeler had contacted Melbourne lawyer Ken Hanlon by email to discuss their wills... .  Kristin, who died, had named Candice as executor and taken her will with her to Colorado.

                Also curious is that video of them on the range.  Right next to them we see a bunch of guys milling around, two of them in what looks like WWII-era army outfits, and another guy in long hair and scraggly beard, who seems to be in charge.  Were they filming a movie scene?  Plus they brought in a lot of gear, including what looks to be a heavy-duty tripod, the kind you'd use for a crew-fed weapon like a heavy machine gun or mortar tube.  I mean the whole thing is strange.

                 I have long wondered if Columbine was intended to be a trigger event. If nothing else, this thread shows that the exploitative way the media handled it has certainly convinced dozens of disturbed would-be individuals that pulling off this kind of thing is a ticket to stardom, even if it's as a black sheep in the national (and, at least in the case of Columbine, international) pantheon. I believe that is also the thesis of the

                 The discovery of the Hermelers' wills is an interesting revelation, if true. How many under-30s have wills in the first place? I keep thinking, though, that it seems awfully strange that the living twin shot herself (or was shot) in the forehead at extremely close range (less than two feet, even if it was the other one who shot her), survived and was talking coherently a few days later. Even if the bullet merely grazed the skull, which would mean it would have had to have been fired more or less straight up or that the gun was pointed at a wide angle to the side (unlikely if it was a serious attempt at dying), that could cause some serious damage. There's a somewhat gruesome Yahoo Answers thread generally related to this

                 </a>
                 , and it is amazing what some of the posters have written in reply to the poster's specific inquiry. Seemingly, there is a great lack of critical thought in the general public these days.

                I believe that Harris was 100% Psychopath but it was never diagnosed.  He did in fact want to trigger some type of anarchic revolution, but knew he could do so much, he was not unrealistic in his planning.  He was a young master of deception and he craved control, he knew he could deceive other followers just like he had done with Dylan.  He was able to take a depressed suicidal teenager and mold him into a mass murderer.  I think Klebold was no more than a slave in Harris's eyes, another tool of death to keep him company on his journey to wipe out "Mankind." I can only compare this "recruitment" to Charles Manson followers, they also believed in some type of "Revolution." Harris understood that to achieve his ultimate objective, the "destruction of mankind"  he would have to recruit other sociopaths to do his bidding, just as Manson did.
