         Are you thinking of using social media contests?
        </p>
        <p>
         Do you
         <strong>
          understand how the law could impact your activities
         </strong>
         ?

        <h3>
         Why Legalities?
        </h3>
        <p>
         One of the best ways to grow your business is to
         <strong>
          give stuff away
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether your business is a small enterprise, a website or blog, or a large multinational company, hosting giveaways is sure to increase traffic, awareness and potential new readers or customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Sponsoring or hosting a giveaway comes with rules and regulations that many dont know or understand
         </strong>
         .
         <span id="more-10987">
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         Really, what could be so hard about telling people youll give away something if they sign up for your newsletter or leave a comment or like your page or follow you on social media?
        </p>
        <p>
         Remember the days when you had to buy things to enter a giveawayand the stuff never arrived, or if it did, it wasnt worth a fraction of what you paid?
        </p>
        <p>
         Research shows that more than half of all adults in the U.S. enter at least one sweepstakes every year. Thats a lot of things being given away! Used correctly, giveaways can
         <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-to-increase-the-quality-of-your-facebook-fans/" target="_blank">
          increase quality of interaction
         </a>
         and greatly increase your readership.
        </p>
        <h3>
         What are the three types of giveaways or promotions?
        </h3>
        <p>
         There are three types of promotions used to give things away:
         <strong>
          sweepstakes
         </strong>
         ,
         <strong>
          contests
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          lotteries
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         While they often go by many different names (giveaway, raffle, drawing),
         <strong>
          legally all promotions fit into one of these three categories
         </strong>
         .
        </p>

          </strong>
          are prize giveaways where the winners are chosen by the luck of the draw. Prizes can be almost anything you can think of, from handmade cards to an all-expensepaid trip.

           <em>
            Contests
           </em>
          </strong>
          choose a winner based on some merit. The winner is chosen based on some criteria such as best photo, most votes on a video, best recipe, etc.
         </li>

          A
          <strong>
           <em>
            lottery
           </em>
          </strong>
          is a prize drawing where people must pay moneyto buy a chance to win. Lotteries are highly regulated and should not be run without consulting legal counsel.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Most promotions we encounter in the U.S. are sweepstakes
         </strong>
         . Periodically, well find a lottery. Usually lotteries are limited to the states because they are heavily regulated and monitored and the costs associated with running a lottery are often prohibitive for most small- and medium-sized businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          In Canada and many European countries, however, most giveaways and promotions would be labeled as contests under U.S. law
         </strong>
         because they require a skills competition (usually a math question) to be valid. Does that always happen? No, but the laws require it.

        <h3>
         How do I know which type of giveaway Im doing?
        </h3>
        <p>
         There are
         <strong>
          three things the law looks at to determine if your promotion may be an illegal lottery
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Prize
          </em>
         </strong>
         who wants to enter a giveaway without a prize?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Chance
          </em>
         </strong>
         pure luck! You could get around this by having some skill or voting requirement but that is often difficult to manage or greatly limits the number of people who will enter. If you want to run a contest, you must omit this aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          <em>
           Consideration
          </em>
         </strong>
         something of value given by entrants to the giveaway sponsor. Often its money, but it doesnt have to be. Depending on what you require entrants to do, you could be pushing the envelope on this element. Each state may have its own particular definition, making it very difficult to manage.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to the online space, there are few things more valuable than followers/likers/friends (or whatever theyre called at the moment).
        </p>
        <p>
         As such,
         <strong>
          requiring someone to like you or follow you could be construed as consideration
         </strong>
         . Even more important, asking an entrant to go to a third-party site, navigate to find a product or service and then report back to your site is even more likely to be deemed consideration,
         <strong>
          and thus places your giveaway into the classification of illegal lottery
         </strong>
         . Time is exceedingly valuable!
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
         In the above giveaway, the blogger is all about me, me, me and theres no way to enter without giving something of value to the blogger. While this may not get the attention of authorities, clearly there is no free way to enter.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because technology is moving much faster than the laws that govern,
         <strong>
          were in uncharted territory with the definition of
          <em>
           consideration
          </em>
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Keep that in mind when figuring out what youll have people do for entry. Your best bet is to
         <strong>
          always have a means of free entry and then consider optional entries.
         </strong>
         
        </p>
        <h3>
         What laws apply to giveaways and promotions in the U.S.?
        </h3>
        <p>
         In the U.S., federal laws governing marketing promotions have been in place for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Sweepstakes are the most common type of promotion
         </strong>
         and have primarily been conducted through the mail, which is where many of the laws originate (
         <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/39/usc_sup_01_39_10_IV_20_30.html" target="_blank">
          Chapter 30 of Title 39 of the U.S. Code
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p>
         This has given the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) some jurisdiction over monitoring sweepstakes promotions. However, under federal law, the U.S. Department of Justice would have ultimate authority regarding enforcement even if the FTC was not involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Many states also regulate sweepstakes
         </strong>
         , especially when they involve alcohol, guns or tobacco. For example, Massachusetts, Michigan and Virginia prohibit tobacco-related promotions while California, Tennessee and Utah highly regulate those involving alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          In many sweepstakes or contests, youll likely see states excluded
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         It may be due to prohibitions on items given away or the state requires posting of a bond and the sponsor does not want to pay or go through that process. Florida and New York both require a bond to be posted if the total value of all prizes given away exceeds $5,000. Rhode Island has separate rules if retail outlets are involved.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Why official rules are so important.
        </h3>
        <p>
         Every sweepstakes, contest or lottery must have official rules and they should be easy to find.
         <strong>
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          There are guidelines on what must be included in the official rules
         </strong>
         to avoid question should there be a challenge if an entrant doesnt win.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the majority of people will never read the official rules, without them the sponsor highly increases the risk of liability.
        </p>
        <div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 492px">
         <img alt="rules" height="277" src="http://cdn.socialmediaexaminer.com/images/0811sh-hgtv-dh-rules.png" width="482"/>
         <p class="wp-caption-text">
          Place a link to the rules where it's easy to find.
         </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         Having a
         <strong>
          link to the rules in an easy to find and conspicuous place
         </strong>
         not only helps people find them, it also encourages people to read them.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Official rules must always include
         </strong>
         :
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          No purchase necessary.
         </li>
         <li>
          The alternative method of free participation.
         </li>
         <li>
          Geographic area of the sweepstakes and/or who is eligible to participate in the sweepstakes.
         </li>
         <li>
          Opening date and scheduled termination date of the sweepstakes.
         </li>
         <li>
          Complete name and address of the sponsor and promoter of the contest.
         </li>
         <li>
          Number of prizes, the accurate description of each prize, the retail value of each prize and the odds of winning each type of prize.
         </li>
         <li>
          Whether all prizes offered will be awarded and how the prizes will be awarded.
         </li>
         <li>
          Manner of selection of winners and when a determination of winners will be made.
         </li>
         <li>
          Where and when a list of winners can be obtained.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Of course there are other disclosures that should be made such as signing of releases, restrictions and misdirected entries. But if you hit the minimum, there is some compliance and protection.
        </p>
        <p>
         One other aspect of the official rules is that once they are posted and published,
         <strong>
          they must be followed exactly
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         They cannot be changed except under unusual and extreme circumstances. For example, if you were giving away a trip to Japan in the weeks after the earthquake, you could have changed the prize to another destination. But, as you see, were talking very unique circumstances.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Giving Away Expensive Things
        </h3>
        <p>
         Most giveaways have pretty minimal valuean eBook, $25 for an online store, a free product. But
         <strong>
          if the value of your prize is $600 or more, keep in mind that you will need to take an extra step
         </strong>
         (possibly several!). You didnt think the IRS would just let you do your own thing, did you?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          If the prize winner is subject to U.S. taxes, a Form 1099 will be required in January of the following year
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         This means you will need to
         <strong>
          collect not only the name and address of the winner but also his/her social security number
         </strong>
         . Even more reason to maintain a high level of professionalism because asking people for this type of information carries with it great responsibility.

               Our company has done a couple contests on Facebook and we followed the set rules to make sure there were no issues. I have seen many companies not follow the rules so I do not know how much FB actually regulates. We are not taking any chances though. Our contests have been quite successful to gain fans to our FB page. People love free stuff!

               Sara, thanks for sharing the sound advice. As a platform for social media contests, at Strutta we receive a lot of questions on this topic. Obviously this is a complex one to address in a single blog post but youve done a great job of sharing some key considerations. I would just add that the focus above is on sweepstakes, which as you said are quite common. But for contests where winners are not chosen at random (ie, a photo/video competition with merit-based criteria), some of the above requirements, for example bonding of prizes over $5,000 and requirements for alternative means of entry, may not apply. Its important to be aware of and understand the law but with the right partner(s) it should not be a deterrent to running contests.

               RB, thats one of the challenges with Facebook. You never know when theyre going to regulate you. In some ways its like some of the govt agencies. They cant police everyone so they focus on the most egregious offenders and then every once in awhile spin the wheel and see where it lands (not actually, but you get the idea). If you just do it right every time you wont have to worry if they draw your name. Kind of like IRS audits  if you make an honest mistake you fix it and move on. Otherwise, it become a very expensive gamble.
              </p>
              <p>
               But remember, just because its OK with Facebook doesnt mean that its OK with all the federal and state laws that also govern giveaways.

               Hello Ben, thank you for stopping by and sharing your insight. Yes, the post is mainly about giveaways as they are the most widely used (and my post would have been too long for anyone to read if I had all the contest info in it). Although, for the reasons you mention contests are becoming more popular. And, as you know from being in Canada, sweepstakes can not include Canadian citizens due to the giveaway laws of Canada. And to grow a business its best to be as inclusive as necessary.

               Sara, thank goodness you wrote this post, its so necessary as so many bloggers AND brands are doing this wrong, wrong, wrong  and not just on Facebook. As you and I have discussed, I think this issue is ripe for FTC or DOJ scrutiny, not unlike how they came down on blogger disclosure practices last year. Although Id love to see more bloggers learn this stuff, its actually incumbent on the brands to be sure that the bloggers they work with on giveaways know the rules and are including important things like alternate means of entry, terms &amp; conditions, and tax considerations in their giveaway process. This post is going in my arsenal for training both clients and bloggers.

               Sara, thank goodness you wrote this post, its so necessary as so many bloggers AND brands are doing this wrong, wrong, wrong  and not just on Facebook. As you and I have discussed, I think this issue is ripe for FTC or DOJ scrutiny, not unlike how they came down on blogger disclosure practices last year. Although Id love to see more bloggers learn this stuff, its actually incumbent on the brands to be sure that the bloggers they work with on giveaways know the rules and are including important things like alternate means of entry, terms &amp; conditions, and tax considerations in their giveaway process. This post is going in my arsenal for training both clients and bloggers.

               Every time I read an article about contests, I get even more confused. My company had some logo tshirts made, and would like to give them away thru various ways. One idea was to ask a question, and the first five people to answer correctly would be given a shirt. Or another idea was to post a QR code on facebook which opens up a notice saying that the first five people to email our marketing department would get a shirt. Another idea was to give a shirt away to whoever answered our consumer poll, or whoever our 200th person to befriend us on our facebook page, or whoever posts a photo to our wall. Basically, were thinking of not having any one specific contest, but various fun ways to give away our shirts. Now, I dont know if any of these ideas are illegal. All this info makes us want to shy away from giving anything away!

               As for all the photo contests I see on Facebook, its clear that few have ever read the Promotions Policy posted in the Help section.http://www.facebook.com/promotions_guidelines.php.One rule states that all contests must be run through the use of a Facebook app. If youve never checked the apps available to you on Facebook you may not realize there are MANY, and some are specifically created for running contests. To check them out, go to your wall and click on Edit Info under your business name. On the next page, go to the list on the left and select Apps. There is a lot there so allow yourself some time to read through them. At BizBuzz Marketing Partners we know how important it to to be aware of the legalities.

               Xpertadvice4u, Contests are a bit different and can get mixed up with being a lottery if not done right. Contests should not ever have a problem being form of gambling unless multiple bet-type entries are required. Id have to examine a proposed scenario closer to better understand how the two would overlap.

               Thanks for sharing your concern. First, giving things away on Facebook requires following their promotion guidelines in addition to federal and stat laws. I wrote a post about the Facebook promotion guidelines to try and clarify http://www.savingforsomeday.com/blog-law-facebook-promotion-guidelines-updated/  so maybe that will help.

               Putting anything on your wall as a giveaway can get you into hot water with FB. Its not a guarantee, but probably dont want to risk having your page taken down.
              </p>
              <p>
               You do need to use a 3rd party app or something that runs in an iFrame hosted off of FB (and include all the disclosures, disclaimers and legal guidelines). There are a few that are geared toward small businesses too. Not everyone can afford a few hundred dollars to give away a couple of shirts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Facebook is just a twist in how giveaways are managed and administered. Im sure youll find the right app, whether you search the internet or have someone create something for you.
              </p>
              <p>
               Best of luck,

               Sara, as an old lawyer who has reviewed these for Fortune 500s in the past - Kudos to you for writing the article and providing the information. Well done! I am just getting into the world of social media now that I am out on my own after a 25 year career as the GC to a couple of public companies and it had not occurred to me that this was happening on FB at the rate I have now observed.

               I cant tell you how many pages I could take down in a day due to non-compliance with Facebook Promotions. Thats not even including those that do comply with them but dont comply with the laws regarding giveaways. It could be my next full time job! 
              </p>
              <p>
               Many people think that using an app is the same as following the law. Thats not always true, some are definitely better than others in that area.

               Rodney, its hard to say that giving a shout out to one Liker falls under the laws of a giveaway since they dont enter and there is no prize. But I cant speak to it exactly (note, this is not legal advice!). However, using Facebook to do this does mean you need to comply with all their TOS, including their promotion guidelines. Ive tried to break them down into English here http://www.savingforsomeday.com/blog-law-facebook-promotion-guidelines-updated/

               Hi Sara,
              </p>
              <p>
               I agree with all of the comments so far  THANK YOU for this post.
               <br/>
               It is pretty confusing to me (as a small business and owner of 2 websites/fan pages).
              </p>
              <p>
               Can you please shed any light on the DOS for a small biz to promote on FB? We do already take advantage of Facebook ads, but love the contest angle for our LIKES (fans). The last thing we want us to have our Facebook fan pages shut down, and as many folks know it can be overwhelming tying to run businesses, manage all the social media while keeping up with the changes  all this can make an entrepreneurs head spin!

               Hi Jody, Facebooks promotional guidelines are in addition to federal and state laws governing sweepstakes, contests and lotteries and shouldnt be used as the sole determination as to if there is compliance. I think thats what makes this area even more challenging, having to manage both the governing laws as well as the TOS for different platforms.
              </p>

               Hi Stephanie, thanks for your position that its not just one party that needs to be aware of these rules. While it is incumbent on the brands (and their hired agencies) to be sure that promotions are handled properly, if bloggers were aware of what theyd need to do it would help. I think that bloggers dont want to be told about all the ins &amp; outs of hosting a proper giveaway because so and so doesnt do that or then I wont get more likes or followers. And at the same time, bloggers who are in the know are asking for greater compensation because it does take more time to meet all the compliance issues, yet brands are so used to the old way. There is a lot of educating that needs to be done and Im glad to know that agency professionals, such as yourself, are giving brands the real information they need. Because, yes, it ultimately can do the brand extensive harm both financially and reputationally.

               Hi Rochelle! There are no old lawyers, just those who dont have to pay bar dues any more. 
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you for your kind words and sharing your observation. Social media has added a new layer of complexity to laws that, when written, did not contemplate such a thing. Now were trying to put square pegs into pentagonal holes and its a challenge. Add to that a whole host of people who now need to be educated about the laws because the barrier to entry is getting lower, but the consequences to mis-delivery very high.
              </p>
              <p>
               The other difficulty is that weve conditioned people that accepting TOS (usually without reading them) is sufficient for most any type of interaction. Now that these platforms are being used in new ways, again ways the law never contemplated, its a learning curve. And the law isnt always kind to learning curves since there isnt always much gray.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its so nice to meet you, Id love to talk to you more about your experience. Ive been lawyering for about 13 years so Im still a pup compared to your years of experience.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks again for visiting and sharing your observations.

               Thanks for posting the section about official rules. As our business runs a lot of contests and sweepstakes, these are really helpful. It would be really great to have an article on running charity auctions on Facebook. There has been a lot of confusion and angst about breaking Facebook rules of late given the crackdown on posting on others pages. Small businesses would like to be assured their generosity wont see them suspended on Facebook. Any chance you could write something about this?

               Hi Lee,
              </p>
              <p>
               This post addresses the general overarching federal and state laws about giveaways and promotions, in a general sense. (disclosure: not legal advice, just legal information). In addition to those laws for any sweepstakes, contest or lottery, if youre running a promotion on Facebook you have to comply additionally to FB Promotion Guidelines. I wrote a post about that when the guidelines were updated a few months ago 
               <br/>
               <a href="http://www.savingforsomeday.com/blog-law-facebook-promotion-guidelines-updated/" rel="nofollow">
                http://www.savingforsomeday.com/blog-law-facebook-promotion-guidelines-updated/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               While you still need to comply with both federal and state laws, many of the 3rd party apps are incorporating some of the requirements such as having Official Rules and for sweepstakes having the least intrusive means of entry. Unfortunately, it doesnt cover everything and small businesses are often misled into thinking it does.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ive advised small businesses on promotion laws, but no all have a legal budget for them. Which is why I have tried to create some general informational posts to help get them up the ramp so they could then ask the right questions to a lawyer and have a focused conversation that might be more budget friendly.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you, again, for reading and commenting. If you have general questions, let me know b/c likely others do too and it will help Social Media Examiner know the kinds of topics readers are looking for.

               Cas, Ive done some work with Facebook Causes and its actually very easy to use. Its the intersection of Federal and State law with those requirements of Facebook that causes the lines to blur. Ill look at it a bit more and note it as a requested topic. Im sure Social Media Examiner is following along and noting interests as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do sit on the board of a 501(c)(3) non profit so I am aware of issues relating to both tax exempt and not tax exempt non profits. And that difference just adds to the challenges of managing charitable giving programs.

               Juan, I am not familiar with the laws of Mexico as they relate to sweepstakes, contests and lotteries. Im certain there are attorneys in Mexico who practice in the area of promotion and marketing law that could assist. Wish I could offer more insight, but that is clearly beyond my knowledge.

               I work with a local radio station on a part time basis as the field engineer. Weve been informed that the consideration part includes the expense of the trip to pick up the prize. So if someone drives across town to pick up the prize, the prize must be valued at more than the cost of getting the prize or we can be fined for running an illegal lottery.

              <p>
               Im not sure if thats an FCC rule, State of Georgia rule, or some other rule making authoritys rule. Regardless, the companies that want to give any types of prizes for giveaways have to make them substantial enough so we dont wade into those muddy waters. Consequently, most of our prizes are valued at $25 or more and some are even more than $50.

               James, Thanks for reading and commenting. I think thats someones interpretation of consideration but it makes sense (especially as gas prices have gone up). Consideration can be so many things, its interesting that travel time/cost is included.

               Hi Ron, thank you for visiting and sharing. It should only be indicated No Purchase Necessary if that is true. Many people will dump any and all language into their rules even if they arent applicable, negating their showing of due diligence and often exposing themselves to greater risk and/or liability.
               <br/>
               Regarding entry by those under 18 there are special laws. Maine, for example, prohibits anyone under 18 from entering sweepstakes due to laws prohibiting predatory marketing to minors. Which is why promotions open to entrants under 18 will exclude Maine.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for promotions geared toward those 13 and under, they must comply with COPPA if conducted online. Those promotions offline must comply with state laws about marketing to minors (see Maine above). In fact, there are promotions aimed at entrants 13 and under. Currently I know of ones by Nick.com, Knex and Lunchables just to name a few.

               Hi Sara. Thank you so much for sharing. This changes the entire blogging world for giveaways. This needs to be wider publicized. I will definitely be changing the mandatory entry for my blog (which is usually going to the sponsors website and choosing a product they like and commenting back on my blog). As these are usually the requirements from the sponsors themselves, I will be writing them emails, including your article on the subject. I also had a few more questions for you
              </p>
              <p>
               1. As far as Canadian giveaways go Does this mean that my US blog cannot have Canadians enter and/or win my sweepstakes? A few of my giveaways include US and Canada and even fewer worldwide. What about Canadian bloggers  can US entrants win their sweepstakes legally or is it illegal for them to host one in the first place? Can Canadian citizens win sweepstakes on Canadian blogs? Just curious.
               <br/>
               2. What about a prize package that is worth over $600 in prizes that are all under $600 in value, meaning the sum of all the gifts to be won total over $600? Do we still need to do a 1099 for these winners? What if one prize is worth over $600  will the sponsor donating and sending the prize be responsible for the 1099 or will the blog hosting it? And what about sponsors giving product to the blogs for review that are over $600 in value  are they required to give the blog a 1099? What happens if they dont?
               <br/>
               3. What about sponsors that require the entrants to donate money to a charity (much like a silent auction) in order to enter? Is it still considered a form of lottery if the money goes directly to a third party charity? Would the blog and the sponsor be at fault for illegal lottery, or just the sponsor requiring the entry, or just the blog hosting the prize?
               <br/>
               4. Where can I find information on specific states laws on sweepstakes?
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks so much!

               Hi Sara, wow, I learned quite a bit from this article. To be honest, whenever my company runs a contest we typically dont think much of it, let me rephrase that, we decide what were going to give away, then have some sort of contest that involves a random winner (from a draw) who can enter by following us (Twitter, Facebook, etc), or perhaps join our forum or whatever then we run with it. My point is, I never realized there were so many legalities involved until now.

               Hello GPlus! Many people dont realize there are a number of legalities. And for the most part most promotions fly under the radar (over worked govt investigators). However, as they are becoming more prolific and the scammers are coming out in force its lifting the veil. In addition, all it takes are a few complaints and youve got the attention of state or federal regulators and what was just a way to get a few more likes or followers turns into a legal mess. And for small businesses it could bankrupt them.

               Thanks for the article. Interesting read on a few more of the issues around the legal implications of free stuff. We always get issues of clients wanting to give away a case of wine or case of beer (might be an Australian thing!) and we invariably end up suggesting what about an amazon voucher or cd voucher etc  much less headaches.

               @Tony Bogar  we have been involved with a few promos on Facebook in Australia  the same facebook international guidelines still apply but you need to connider Australian trade promotion law. The most important things to remember is that:
              </p>
              <p>
               1. the law (or lotteries act) in Australia is a state law and not a national law so you need to ensure that you are applying the relevant state laws to your promotions
               <br/>
               2. The laws need to be met and you need to obtain permits in the states that you are promoting your competition not just the state that it originates in (eg.) If you run and promote a competition in NSW you need a NSW permit  but facebook is global  do I need a worldwide permit? The advice we have been given is that you should get permits for the states that you are actively targeting and promoting to. So if you are backing your promo up with facebook ads geo targted to Queensland  you should really get a permit here to be in the safe side
               <br/>
               3. Permits are normally required at the $1000 above mark in most states (but check yours first) and steer clear of alcohol as prozes  youll encounter a whole other world of froms and permits!!!
              </p>
              <p>
               Cheers,
               <br/>

               Wine. Beer. Definitely an Aussie thing! Alas, wine will be the prize so it looks as though we need to do our homework. Thanks for the heads up; your comment was most useful.

               Hello Blogger,
              </p>
              <p>
               Sorry for the delay, I missed seeing your reply here. Ill try to explain each of these.
              </p>
              <p>
               1. Canadians can enter promotions conducted by US businesses but the US business must then comply with all Canadian laws regarding such promotions. This specifically means that the promotion goes from being a sweepstakes to being a contest (in the US) because Canadas laws says that winners can not be chosen by luck. As such each entrant must solve a skill testing question.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for Americans winning sweepstakes in Canada, I am not fully versed on all the nuances of Canadian law but it is my understanding that entry by American is not prohibited solely due to nationality. And as long as a Canadian blog adheres to the laws of Canada for their sweepstakes, Canadian citizens may enter and win.
              </p>
              <p>
               2. There is differing viewpoints from an accounting standpoint as to how 1099s are issued for promotional prizes. If one single prize has a fair market value (FMV) over $600 a 1099 must be issues, although they are not always. The sponsor of the promotion would be responsible for issuing all such tax documents and securing any necessary releases. As for sponsors proving product for review valued at $600 or more, a 1099 should be issued. I am working on a post specifically on this topic. If a 1099 is not issued, it does not negate the need to report such prize.
              </p>
              <p>
               3. Silent auctions for charitable purposes are handled differently because there is no luck involved. Item goes to the highest bidder and it is not a promotion but rather a fundraiser and governed by those laws. As for providing a donation, even if to a 3rd party, that is consideration. There is a benefit  albeit not financial  to the sponsor or host thus to avoid being an illegal lottery the element of luck would need to be removed. Many of these large charitable fundraisers have registered their promotion with the state and follow strict guidelines for lotteries. Both the sponsor and the host could hold liability, the determination would be very fact specific.
              </p>
              <p>
               4. There is no one specific repository for all state specific sweepstakes laws. Most are uniform and follow the general standards. There are certain states where there are bonding requirements, age limitations and/or type of products that can be given away. If you are giving away alcoholic beverages as a prize that is a unique circumstance and state laws should be researched.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hope this helps.
               <br/>

               No worries on the delay  it was only yesterday that I asked the questions. I do have follow-up questions
              </p>
              <p>
               1. If Canadians are allowed to enter a US giveaway, can we have the giveaway be a sweepstakes and if a Canadian wins, have them answer a skill question or trivia and not the whole of the entrants?
              </p>
              <p>
               2. What about if a prize package donated by and mailed individually from several different sponsoring brands is worth over the $600? Not one single item is valued that, but the whole of the package would be. Are 1099s still required? I would hate to collect a SS# as a blogger and would leave that up to the sponsors, but if their prizes are not individually valued at $600, then they would never file one. What happens in this case?
              </p>
              <p>
               3. What key laws (that we as bloggers need to be aware of) do fundraisers have then? Specifically in regards to blog giveaways and silent charity auctions?
              </p>
              <p>
               4. We never give away items like alcohol on the blog, so that wouldnt be an issue. I would hate, however, to have to check every single states laws to figure out if there is something we cant promote or have a winner enter and/or win in their state. Could we just have a disclaimer that states void where prohibited by law as a blanket statement to cover the hosting blog?
              </p>
              <p>
               Ive been arduously working on my changes for my new promo policies/guidelines and disclaimers and have put up a preliminary one on the blog for now. I just want to make sure I have everything down to cover us and to comply with all regulations we know of. The only thing I refuse to adhere to is supplying my address. Theres got to be a line that is drawn somewhere, right?
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks again!

               1. If Canadians can enter their entry must be accompanied by a skills testing element. It can not be done after they are determined to have won.
              </p>
              <p>
               2. It is imcumbent on the sponsor to provide a 1099 to the winner if the prize is valued at $600 or more. If you, as the blogger, are the sponsor then it would be up to you to do that. If youve brought together several brands/agencies someone would need to take on the role of sponsor and that should be discussed with them. The Sponsor needs to be disclosed in the Official Rules.
              </p>
              <p>
               3. Charity fundraising is governed by different agencies in different states. Charitable fundraising has to handled in the state where the charity is domiciled. You can find information on which state agency to contact here http://www.nasconet.org/documents/u-s-charity-offices/
              </p>
              <p>
               4. You can have a disclaimer void where prohibited but youd need to know where it would be prohibited. There is no one location with all state laws which govern sweepstakes, contests and lotteries. You can usually find them by searching each states gambling or marketing statutes.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you are the sponsor of a sweepstakes or contest you would have to provide your address. If that is the case you should consider getting a business mailing address such as through one of those mail box businesses in the strip malls around town.

               Wow, a post like this is long overdue! Thanks!Although weve been working mostly outside of the US, its a verygood practice to give a 10 minute call to a lawyer before launchingyour promo. Just to be on the safe side!

               Thanks for a very helpful article. I did not know there were so many little strings that are attached to running a promotion. We will definitely do some extra research before even planning a giveaway.

               Great article, and much needed. As you mentioned in your comments, the number of Facebook users using promotions that violate Facebook TOS or, federal law, is astounding. It seems almost impossible to regulate, which is unfortunate. Now I dont want to see an honest mistake bankrupt a small business, but without any REAL regulatory presence the ignorance is perpetuated.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Those of us who are aware of the rules and choose to play accordingly lose a competitive advantage, which is wrong.

               CK, it is getting difficult to regulate the various social media platforms. It disturbs me that there are TOS and guidelines that the platforms have in place and clearly ignore. Why have them if they will be selectively applied? And when applied can be catastrophic to a small business because there is little or no customer service or way to get help to fix the problem and learn from the error.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hear the argument about losing a competitive advantage, and its a very real part of business. There will always be scammers who skirt the law/rules because their ethical code allows them to believe it is acceptable. But at the end of the day, if we feel weve done the right thing thats all we can do. Its easy to work to the lowest commondenominator, but what I strive for (and this site and its readers like you as well) is to raise the bar. There will always be cheaters, and some will never get caught. But when they do, they fall hard and those of us with nothing to worry about just keep going.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks, CK, for your input. I appreciate you taking time to read as well as share your insight.

               Spot on! Recently, I came across a competition Facebook page that posts hundreds of links to Facebook page sweeps available in the UK. 99% of them are either Like this post to win or tag yourself to win or change your status, etc. Unbelievable. Only a small portion of them get their tagging/posting suspended by the spam filter, the others just keep going like theres no tomorrow!
              </p>
              <p>
               BTW, always wanted to ask, why in England random drawings (sweepstakes) are called competitions?

               Thanks for this article. I found it while trying to find an answer to this question Is it legal to charge the winner shipping charges? Ive seen a lot of Facebook giveaways, in particular, where entering is arguably free, but the rules state that the winner will have to pay $X for shipping.

               Hello Igor, thank you for your offer of the toptabapp, Ill definitely check it out since Im always asked about FB promotion app options.
              </p>
              <p>
               The UK tends to have its only language for certain things (lift, chips, bonnet, boot, biscuit, crisps, etc.) so of course they have a different word for Sweepstakes. However, this is mainly due because what we know as lotteries are called sweepstakes. Talk about confusing!
              </p>
              <p>
               UK promotions being posted on US sites do pose significant problems, especially since Facebook has one main URL and the laws pertaining to each individual country where Facebook can be accessed are not woven into each countrys residents page. Having such a worldwide platform being so popular in its infancy has created situations like youve mentioned. Its a borderless online world that, unfortunately, must adhere to a vast array of laws (hence the issues relating to China and the internet).
              </p>
              <p>
               I would think Facebook could do a better job with programming to help reign in some of this (allegedly) inappropriate or offending content. This is where having vision and foresight comes in and given that Facebooks trajectory was not envisioned there are so many bumps on the road.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cheers my friend,
               <br/>

               Hello Penny, thanks for visiting.By law, sponsors of sweepstakes must not require a prize winner to pay any shipping or handing charges to win or receive their prizes. If a promotion requires such and you are the winner Id advise fighting them and reporting them to the FTC and/or State Attorney General if the prize is worth having, otherwise it might not be worth your time or energy.

               I host giveaways monthly and this week, Im doing 5 in a row. I get a lot of inexpensive, photography related items to review and I give them away to my followers. I havent eclipsed $50 on any of my prizes, but I have been putting a disclaimer on my contests (and reviews) as well as creating rules. I dont want to have to mail something to Ireland from Washington again, so my contests are US Only (unless the prize is an online download) and I participants must be over 18, although I have no way to check this, I like having it in there.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               I didnt think much about this until I attended Bloggy Boot Camp and an attorney shared the rules of giveaways.

               Thanks for the article Sara. Can you confirm something for me.Can I ask fans to post a video and the video that I determine to be the best will win the prize? Does this follow Facebooks regulations?

               Well, for example, when Zynga has a Poker Tournament on facebook, why is that NOT gambling?
              </p>
              <p>
               There was a Final Four College Hoops contest on Facebook, where people could win prizes for correctly predicting who would be in the Final Four
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, *my* understanding (which is limited by my own ignorance and that of others) is that IF there is no Consideration because it is a Free Contest and players do not have invest any of their own money in order to play  that it is therefore OK to let them compete and have prizes to the winners.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, I could let people play in an online Poker tournament, and as long as they do not have to put up any money to enter, I can give them prizes and it will not be gambling
              </p>
              <p>
               What do you think? That is the way it was explained by somebody operating a similar site.

               Thank you for this article. I have seen some giveaways on blogs that need to consult your article which screams out me, me, me! I do think giveaways are a great way to draw traffic to your site but if a person is entering into a contest it becomes quite ridiculous all the hoops some sites will make you jump through to win. Such as Tweet this, like this, go fan this, etc, etc

               Hello Kimberly,
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank you for visiting and sharing your experience. As part of the rules you can require that all entrants be over 18 and if you ever wanted to verify that information you would just need the winner to return an affidavit to you as a condition of prize acceptance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your giveaways should likely be limited to US Residents due to the different laws for foreign countries. Ireland (and the UK in general) have very particular rules and its not easy to manage all the requirements. Even if it is a download, there is potential liability if you do not adhere to the laws of each jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
               Glad you are able to incorporate what you learned at a conference into your blog.

               Brendan, Facebook does permit this type of promotion. It would be considered a contest because you are not basing the prize on luck. You need to use a 3rd party app to host this promotion. Of course you would also need to comply with the other legal requirements for a contest since FBs promotion guidelines are merely their rules.

               Besides not complying with the law its just not a best practice to (1) make your promotion a me, me, me program or (2) require people to jump through a million and one hoops. Just reading some of the entry requirements makes me tired.

               Zynga is an authorized and vetted app for FB so they have gone through quite a process to be a game on Facebook. And while one of their games is often considered a card gambling game (poker) it is in fact a game whereby credits are purchased. Since it is a virtual game and not a real interactive game the gambling issue doesnt come up.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the Final Four promotion on Facebook, no money is involved and thus gambling laws dont apply.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gambling laws are both federal and state and if youd like to know more about them Id suggest looking at Chuck Humphreys page. Hes an attorney and one of the leading experts in gaming laws http://www.gambling-law-us.com/  and they are very different than standard giveaways.

               You have such an informative article, Im glad that theres law for things like this, but i still doubt that everything is implemented. As we all know, people are really good in looking for loopholes in the laws and system. Im wondering , how this laws could be polished? Im also curious if those pop up lotteries, sweepstakes or any game, are under this laws? By the way, the description of lottery and sweepstakes are nearly the same. Is there a particular definition that settles their difference? -thank you

               Hi Irma, first, the difference between a lottery and a sweepstakes is that a lottery has all 3 parts (prize, chance and consideration) whereas a sweepstakes usually only has prize and chance. For a sweepstakes there can only be 2 things, or else once you add the third it becomes a lottery.
              </p>
              <p>
               All lotteries, sweepstakes and contests operated in the US must comply with US laws. Of course many of them do not. As for loopholes, Im sure people look for them. Especially since the word consideration and chance are a bit subjective.
              </p>
              <p>
               Depending on who implements the promotion, you will definitely have varying levels of compliance. Its a risk. Do they get caught? Sometimes. Does it make it right? No.
              </p>
              <p>
               So then it becomes an ethical issue  as I mentioned before, do you lower the bar because others are or do you continue to raise it and strive to set you and your organization apart?
              </p>

               Thank you so much for this post. As a bloggers and social marketer, it is very helpful to know these laws so that I could checked if I am playing fairly. It will also guide to those consumer that is mostly prone for theses giveaways.Contest happens a lot in social sites especially in Facebook. But, do these laws areproperlyimplemented?

               Robert, laws in the UK are quite a bit different. Not only do they call the promotions differently than here in the US there are some peculiarities for each of the countries that mean understanding the general as well as the specific. I hope someone with that information can chime in, but it is beyond my scope.

               We recently opened an optometry office and will be doing a glasses collection to donate to the Lions Club right before Christmas. To entice people to donate we want to hold a drawing for prizes. Anyone can enter once to win a prize (over the age of 18), but if you bring in a pair of glasses you will get multiple entry forms. We will be asking other businesses in the community to see if they would like to donate any prizes. From what I understand from your blog this will be considered a sweepstakes, right?
              </p>
              <p>
               Will employees and family members of the employees of those businesses be able to enter the drawing? Or is that up to our discretion?
              </p>
              <p>
               Any other red flags you see or want to comment on? Also reading through the questions, if other small businesses donate a prize, can they donate something as small as a $10 gift certificate? I didnt understand the consideration comment too well.
              </p>
              <p>
               THANK YOU!

               Hi Sara
              </p>
              <p>
               I just found the time to read this very informative article and hope you see this comment. Are we able to just give away something as a result of commenting on our blog and forget facebook all together? For example, the first ten people to comment receive one of our products.no other requirement necessary i.e. liking us on facebook etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               thanks again for sharing your expertise.

               ALC, that is unfortunate that posts (Im assuming comments) were deleted. However, winners of sweepstakes can report companies to the FTC and to your states Attorney General for failure to deliver a prize. If you know the state she is in you can also report to her state Attorney General.
               <br/>
               Each state handles things differently so there is no guarantee she will ever be contacted. The FTC may or may not follow up either, depending on the value and severity of the infraction.
              </p>
              <p>
               If it was a blogger giving away a branded product you may try to find out the PR Company that reps the brand or write/call the brand directly. Most of the time, though, the brand customer service people wont have any information on bloggers doing giveaways.
              </p>
              <p>
               Unfortunately, you may have to just chalk it up as a loss. Depending on the value, your level of involvement to retrieve your prize will vary.

               Giving multiple entries to someone who donates vs. giving one entry to someone who does not may be seen as consideration as the donee would be enticed to donate because they are getting something in return that a non-donee isnt.
              </p>
              <p>
               You decide the rules and if employees and family members can enter the rules should state that. However, be prepared for negative reactions because it may not appear to be truly arms-length in selecting winners.
              </p>
              <p>
               Prizes can be whatever you want to give.

               You get to decide how the winner is chosen. If the winner is chosen by random it begins to take on the scheme of a sweepstakes. However, if you are using some merit or criteria  such as speed of comment  it is no longer random/luck of the draw and the giveaway would not be a sweepstakes but will begin to look like either a contest or lottery.
              </p>
              <p>
               Using Facebook is not a requirement of sweepstakes or Contests.

               Hi! Thanks for this post. Im still a little confused. Can you confirm if I am understanding the law correctly?:
               <br/>
               Its ok for me to have a contest or promotion in which one enters for free and provides nothing of value to me.
               <br/>
               Its ok for me to have a contest or promotion in which I EITHER pick a winner at random OR pick a winner based on the merit of their entry (trivia question, best photo, etc.)as long as the contest is free and provides nothing of value for me.
               <br/>
               Is that correct?
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks! So much to learn in this new information age!

               So is it legal for a sports store to have such a contest in which you must make a purchase of $20 or more, and then customer can elect to be entered into a free throw contest? In which the person who hits the most basketball free throws wins a $100 prize. Obviously someone will shoot a brick and thus create a winner. It would appear that the contest is skill based, even though many dont play basketball.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or for the store to simply say $10 to enter the free throw contest and no store purchase of any product or merchandise.
              </p>
              <p>
               Either of those legal? If not how could they reorganize to make it legal?

               For a Sweepstakes, the promotion must provide a means of entry whereby the entrant does not provide compensation to the host or sponsor and the winner is chosen at random
              </p>
              <p>
               For a Contest, the promotion may require the entrant to provide something of value to the host or sponsor (such as a photo, drawing, video) and the winner is selected on some merit basis.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most people mix these two up or interchange the names. In the US, a sweepstakes winner is always chosen at random whereas a contest winner is chosen based on merit.

              <p>
               Since the hypothetical you present has the winner being chosen based on merit, the promotion is a contest and the rules are a bit different.
              </p>
              <p>
               The presence or absence of consideration paid by a participant for entering the promotion is often the determinate factor of legality of the promotion. In a few US states there are laws which state that requirement of any type of consideration by an entrant that would rise to the level of creating a contractual relationship renders the promotion unlawful.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why it is challenging to put out a blanket statement when it comes to entrants providing consideration.
              </p>
              <p>
               For the promotion to be a sweepstakes, the consideration element is removed.
              </p>
              <p>
               For contests its a bit trickier because of the laws regarding payment to enter promotions often run parallel to laws regulating lotteries.

               This question is a bit different in that I am the contestant. A company posted a contest on their FB wall announcing a $50 prize to their Top Fan for the month. I have worked for 3-1/2 wks promoting their site, posting to their wall, liking, and sharing. Now they have announced 1 person out of their top 10 fans will be chosen for the $50 prize, not their Top Fan. This is the last week of the contest, too. I have about twice as many points as the 2nd place person, so I was certain expecting to win. When I messaged them, they said it had been an erroran error that they are now trying to correct when the month is almost over??? It looks like they also removed their May 1st post announcing the contest, but I stayed one step ahead &amp; took a photo of it as well as copied &amp; pasted it into a Word document. Let me add that there are no official rules anywhere. They have also tried saying that one could only win one prize every 90 days for either of their 2 companies. I won a $25 prize from their other company in April, same kind of Top Fan promo. This rule is not stated anywhere on the 2 Facebook pages or the 2 company websites. Whom should I contact if they do not award me the prize on May 31st?

               Melanie, anyone can do a giveaway. It doesnt matter if you are the sponsor or if a brand is sponsoring. If your giveaway is a sweepstakes or contest (there is a difference between the two legally) then its best to be as compliant as possible. I wont lie and tell you that every blogger follows sweepstakes/contest legal rules because they dont. However, there is always a risk and you just have to be willing to take it.

               Renee, I think you emailed me with this concern but Ill reply here too. If you feel a contest or sweepstakes run in the US was not legally compliant with US laws you can make a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and the state attorney general in the state the company is physically located as well as their place of incorporation, if you know that.

              <p>
               What do you think of referral bonuses? We are a yacht brokerage and handle multi-million dollar items on a regular basis. Using the 6 degrees of separation principal (you know someone who knows someone. that will buy a large yacht) we would like to offer a percentage of our commissions to anyone that refers a yacht buyer to us. Its worth every penny to us to locate buyers, but are we doing anything illegal?
              </p>
              <p>
               Appreciate your thoughts.

               The rules relating to offering compensation or finders fee are different than those related to sweepstakes, contests and promotional marketing programs. You would likely be better suited than I to know what the laws are related to compensating non-brokers when such compensation is tied to commission. I know that in the Real Estate area there are very strict guidelines about who can and can not receive payment from the commission. I dont think those same legal compliance mechanisms exist within the auto dealer world though. As a yacht dealer Im not sure where that industry fits within the various regulatory programs.
              </p>
              <p>
               If there are regulatory/legal limits as to who can receive proceeds of commission on a sale those may preclude you from offering a finders fee based on receipt of commission.

               Hey Sara!
              </p>
              <p>
               First of all, I would like to say that this is really a great article that I happened to have just stumbled across doing some research.
              </p>
              <p>
               My question is: What if the giveaway is something that is given to every single person involved? For example, if one were to run a Twitter type campaign basically saying that for the next 30 days, they will giveaway a particular music mp3 file of theirs or an ebook pdf file of theirs to everyone who follows them on Twitter?
              </p>
              <p>
               What would somethign like this fall under?

               One more question for you to make sure I understand right. If the prize is valued under $600 no legal steps need to be takenaside from contest rulesright? (Like giving the winner a 1099 form.)  But over $600 requires a form?

               I cant say that no other legal steps need to be taken because Im not offering legal advice, nor do I know everything about the scenario. I can say that any time a prize is valued at $600 or more an IRS Form 1099 should be provided to the winner and filed with the IRS per IRS regulations.

               Hello Sara Hawkins, great material u have here. I count myself lucky to have stumbled across it. Can u please help me determine what category my contest falls in and what kind of safeguards i need to take before i land my company into trouble cos from what i read on this page i realize what u dont know could hurt u big time and ignorance is never an excuse.
               <br/>
               My Contest/Competition is similar to Miss USA/Miss UNIVERSE. And just like these competitions applicants(prospective contestants) are charged/required to pay application fees and participation fees. Its my companys intention to host the application, registration processes and public voting online(specifically Facebook &amp; Youtube). So i want to know if organizing such a thing(contest/competition) this way is legal or illegal. There is a selection of State Winners at the Preliminary Stage and then the 50 State Winners vie for the National Title. I am so confused right now after reading this becos my company was about launching this competition ending of this month. Aside advising me to get an attorney i need some expert advice from you. Thank you and ill be looking forward to a reply from u.

               Hello Sara Hawkins, great material u have here. I count myself lucky to have stumbled across it. Can u please help me determine what category my contest falls in and what kind of safeguards i need to take before i land my company into trouble cos from what i read on this page i realize what u dont know could hurt u big time and ignorance is never an excuse.
               <br/>
               My Contest/Competition is similar to Miss USA/Miss UNIVERSE. And just like these competitions applicants(prospective contestants) are charged/required to pay application fees and participation fees. Its my companys intention to host the application, registration processes and public voting online(specifically Facebook &amp; Youtube). So i want to know if organizing such a thing(contest/competition) this way is legal or illegal. There is a selection of State Winners at the Preliminary Stage and then the 50 State Winners vie for the National Title. I am so confused right now after reading this becos my company was about launching this competition ending of this month. Aside advising me to get an attorney i need some expert advice from you. Thank you and ill be looking forward to a reply from u.

               Hi Sara, thanks so much for the article. Its the clearest and most helpful one I have read. I have a question. I am hoping to run a contest (they have to work for it) on my blog. The winner will be voted for by readers. The first prize will probably be worth about $75.
               <br/>
               We can give prizes away to people in other countries right? I have lots of readers that would probably want to participate that are in Europe and Australia. Are there different rules about that?
               <br/>
               Thanks again!

               Eli,
              </p>
              <p>
               Many organizations host online contests without problems. The key is to have good rules and to follow them to a tee. Contests can have a consideration component because the winner is not chosen by luck but rather by a set of criteria (which are set out in the official rules).
              </p>
              <p>
               I am unable to comment specifically as to whether your proposed promotion is or is not legally compliant. If you are concerned, please seek the advice of competent legal counsel to ensure your promotion is compliant with all state and federal laws, as well as any laws that may apply if the promotion is open to residents outside the US.
              </p>
              <p>
               Best of luck!

               Christina, I have only addressed US laws. Allowing entrants from other countries mean you will need to determine what the laws are in that country and create your promotion according to the most strict set of rules/laws.
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, to be compliant in Canada a contest must have a skills test in addition to a number of other requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
               You will find that almost all US-based promotions limit participant to US Residents. This is done so that the promotion administrator does not need to take into consideration the laws and regulations of other countries.

               My wife
               <br/>
               and I have a gardening blog. One of the products we offer is an online garden
               <br/>
               design program. The program costs $25 per year however, new customers get a
               <br/>
               No Obligation 30 day free trial. They are not forced to pay after
               <br/>
               the 30 days, in fact they have to go back in and buy the one year subscription,
               <br/>
               it doesnt auto charge them (if that makes sense).
              </p>
              <p>
               We would
               <br/>
               like to encourage more people to sign up for the 30 day free trial by giving
               <br/>
               away a free one year subscription to 1 out of every 50 people who sign up. When
               <br/>
               they sign up then enter an e-mail address and that is all we have access to,
               <br/>
               and they dont have to make it viewable to us. They would though in order to
               <br/>
               qualify for the giveaway as we would need a way to get a hold of them.
              </p>

               I am
               <br/>
               really trying to wrap my head around the laws here that govern such a
               <br/>
               promotion. Would this be considered a sweepstakes? If so would covering the 9
               <br/>
               points you outlined in the rules be sufficient? What things should we be
               <br/>
               careful of?

               I am
               <br/>
               re-reading your article and it strikes me that requiring someone to sign up for
               <br/>
               the free 30 day trial may be considered consideration? If so, from what I
               <br/>
               described, would this be considered a lottery? The reason I ask is because then we would have a prize, chance (1 in 50), and consideration.
              </p>
              <p>
               The
               <br/>
               person would sign up for a 30 day free trial. After 30 days they have to go
               <br/>
               back in a complete the registration and pay, it doesnt do it on its own. Once
               <br/>
               the contest is over (less than 30 days from start so winners will have their
               <br/>
               free subscription before the promotion ends and no one feels obligated to pay) we
               <br/>
               will take the number of people who signed up, divide it by 50, and give away
               <br/>
               that many free subscriptions (rounding up of course so the odds are at most
               <br/>
               1:50 assuming we wont have a total perfectly divisible by 50). It would be
               <br/>
               random and have a definite end date.
              </p>

               What you describe could be construed as an illegal lottery. I have seen sites offer free subscriptions as a prize just for leaving their email. Whether or not the person buys a subscription to the site is not taken into consideration when determining the winner.
              </p>
              <p>
               Different sites use different methods, but it doest have to be complex and if the selected winner had obtained a paid subscription during the interim  from entry to award  then the price is refunded.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are ways to offer a free entry into the sweepstakes. If the promotion is changed to a contest and the winner is chosen by some merit, there are different rules for that.
              </p>
              <p>
               It may even be possible to just let all entrants click a box/radial button saying whether they want a 30-day free trial. If they do, great. If not, theyre still entered. But the entry is not conditioned upon obtaining a trial.

               Sara, I wonder what you know about Federal law concerning taxes? Most lawyers I write to, have a very small knowledge of Federal tax law. Lets talk about Federal income tax withholding. Can you agree that the word income is a legal term for Federal tax purposes? This term is NOT defined in the Internal Revenue Code. But, it has been defined by the US Supreme Court what income is. Not knowing whether you know or not, it is a gain or profit from Federal corporate activity. Knowing that, where do you think that the state lotteries have the required authority to withhold Federal income tax on prize winners? They dont, and the lotteries stand to be prosecuted for withholding the tax without the prize winners consent. All tax forms that contain a written declaration of under penalties of perjury are voluntary. You should know that no one can be lawfully compelled to self incrimination. The simple truth is that the IRS is collecting millions and doing nothing to deserve the cash from lottery wins. Title 26, subtitle C, section 3401 defines a employee for collection of income tax at source and section 3402 provides for withholding on a voluntary basis. When volunteered to pay the tax, the Federal employee becomes liable for the tax. Withholding is on employment and the prize winner is not a employee to the lottery as employer. Dont you plainly see the fraud here? Please do not reply as Im not asking for legal advice as the law is plain as day and is not void for vagueness.

               Sara, I wonder what you know about Federal law concerning taxes? Most lawyers I write to, have a very small knowledge of Federal tax law. Lets talk about Federal income tax withholding. Can you agree that the word income is a legal term for Federal tax purposes? This term is NOT defined in the Internal Revenue Code. But, it has been defined by the US Supreme Court what income is. Not knowing whether you know or not, it is a gain or profit from Federal corporate activity. Knowing that, where do you think that the state lotteries have the required authority to withhold Federal income tax on prize winners? They dont, and the lotteries stand to be prosecuted for withholding the tax without the prize winners consent. All tax forms that contain a written declaration of under penalties of perjury are voluntary. You should know that no one can be lawfully compelled to self incrimination. The simple truth is that the IRS is collecting millions and doing nothing to deserve the cash from lottery wins. Title 26, subtitle C, section 3401 defines a employee for collection of income tax at source and section 3402 provides for withholding on a voluntary basis. When volunteered to pay the tax, the Federal employee becomes liable for the tax. Withholding is on employment and the prize winner is not a employee to the lottery as employer. Dont you plainly see the fraud here? Please do not reply as Im not asking for legal advice as the law is plain as day and is not void for vagueness.

               @facebook-1849564061:disqus while I am knowledgeable in US Federal Income Tax law, a discussion on that topic is beyond the scope of this article. I can say that 26 USC 61 is where one would find the definition and discussion of gross income. The definition is very broad and inclusive.
              </p>
              <p>
               Section 3402(q)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that every person, including the Government of the United States, a State, or
               <br/>
               a political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentalities of the
               <br/>
               foregoing, making any payment of winnings which are subject to
               <br/>
               withholding shall deduct and withhold from such payment a tax as defined within the section. Use of the word shall in this provision means it is mandatory and not voluntary as you suggest.
              </p>
              <p>
               That the IRS is permitted to collect taxes on winnings has been well settled through numerous legal challenged. State legislatures undertake significant legal consultation when they establish lotteries to ensure that all tax obligations are met.

               Hi there Sara!
              </p>
              <p>
               Call it a bad case of, I dont want to get fined or arrested, but I recently looked into if what I had been previously doing for giveaways was legal. Apparently, one of my most recent events was far from it, and I guess you could call it good timing (and a little luck from a friend sharing this to me) that I decided to read up on the dos and donts of events and giveaways and all that like.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, maybe you can help me out here a little. As a small, self-published and independent author, I know that numbers with my books (sales) can make or break a career, as well as do nifty things like pay the bills. In my last event, I stated that if someone purchased a copy of one of my books and showed proof of purchase, that they would be entered to win a Kindle. I know now that, because I didnt offer an equally free method of entry, that this was probably illegal, no?
              </p>
              <p>
               But since Im still trying to sell books, especially when hosting events like release day parties, how can I achieve this without being slapped on the wrists?
              </p>
              <p>
               Heres a scenario. Lets say Im celebrating the release of my newest book, Bacon Bits on Facebook. Could I do a giveaway that, if you showed proof of purchase, youd receive a signed bookmark regardless, but youre also entered to win the big special basket of goodies at the end of the event? Or is that still not okay?
              </p>
              <p>
               To be honest, the whole consideration thing confused the crap out of me. Wouldnt consideration be constituted as the time they spend playing other prize game events on my event tab the whole day?
              </p>
              <p>
               Argh. I hate confusion.

               @facebook-1849564061:disqus there must be a means of entry that is free and all entries must be weighted the same and have the same likelihood of winning. If someone buys a book, makes a donation, washes your car, etc., they can be entered into the sweepstakes, too. But its not necessary. Many people are willing to buy something (books, magazines, notecards, etc) to support the person/organization, but the law says that there must be a means of entry that does not confer consideration to the sponsor.

               Thanks for the post, I know Im a little late to the party, but this article greatly helped me in mapping out a giveaway well over the $600 value you mentioned. I wasnt even thinking about the IRS until after reading your post (I found you on Google for giveaway requirements).

               So for a contest its OK to have consideration in the form of making them work to win in some way. We want to do a quiz  just like you mentioned in the Consideration example  where someone would have to go to our site and find info to answer about 11 questions. If they get them all correct they go into Round 2 which is judged based on the quality of feedback given to 2 new questions. Since this is judged and requires some skill its considered a contest and not a lottery, correct? THANKS!!

               @effdc0d8766b446c846c2c472383eaf7:disqus A lottery has: (1) consideration, (2) a prize, AND (3) the winner is chosen randomly.  A promotion that is judged and the winner chosen by some judged criteria would not fit the legal definition of a lottery because of how the winner was chosen. Contests, on the other hand, often do select winners based on some judged level of skill. Rules for contests are slightly different than those for sweepstakes, although, just as with sweepstakes a contest should have well defined Official Rules.

               Hi Sara,
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for the post. It is informative. I was wondering if you know of any official source for me to reference these information you have posted, as I am researching for my company business and I am afraid I cannot be referencing to a blog.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have been searching and finding it a huge challenge to find official publication online on such laws.
              </p>
              <p>
               This would help heaps!  Thank you!

               The the prize has not be fulfilled as required per the Official Rules (or if there are no official rules and a reasonable amount of time has passed), the winner should contact both the FTC (go to FTC (dot) gov and file a complaint) as well as the state Attorneys General for the winners state, the state where the company is physically located, and the state of incorporation, if different than physical location.

               The FTC may not specifically investigate and get you your prize, but they may if there is a history of complaints. Your state Attorney General, or the Attorney General of the companys location may be able to resolve this issue. Each state Attorney Generals office has a department of consumer affairs that handles matters such as this.

               Unfortunately, the laws are not all clear or easy to find in one place. Federal sweepstakes laws are mostly governed under law relating to the US Mail services. State laws vary by state and may or may not be specifically defined under contests/sweepstakes/lotteries.
              </p>
              <p>
               The easiest ones to find are NY and FL because of their bond requirements. Other states, you can begin your search with laws related to lotteries which often reference other provisions relating to other types of promotions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Each state has a set of statutes and that is where you will find these laws. For federal law you need to look in the Code of Federal Regulation.

               Contests may require compensation since its winner is not chosen by random draw but, rather, based on some set of criteria.

               Sara,
               <br/>
               I have looked at 47 USCA  509 but cant tell if this section only applies to radio stations or contests in general. I have a question about contest fixing. I have entered a contest on a site, and have an email from the owner or main contributor to the site that is acknowledging that if they can get people into a close contest they get more users. The email states that the owner/contributor would like people to vote for a specific user b/c they know that the usernmcan get more people to vote. Is this a violation? and if so what is the citation?

              </p>
              <p>
               I have an interesting questioncould a companys promotion be deemed a sweepstakes in one jurisdiction, a game of skill in another and a lottery in a third?
              </p>
              <p>
               For example, ClubWpt is an online poker site that allows its members to play for cash and prizes. Its $19.99 a month to be a VIP member with unlimited access. There is an alternate free method of entry as well and they dont have special rules for Canada.
               <br/>
               I could see this being a contest of skill in States or other Countries that allow or recognize online poker as a game of skill, a sweepstakes in others and prohibited as lotteries in others.
               <br/>
               Your thoughts? Is a free trial membership always looked at as consideration?
               <br/>
               Thanks.
               <br/>

               The section you reference is for Wire or Radio Communications only. However, the rules for sweepstakes/contests are often mixed within laws related to the mail and radio/wire communications because the laws for sweepstakes/contests have not been updated to take into consideration the internet and mobile platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regardless of the platform, the basic rules for fairness will always apply. What you describe may likely be a violation of both federal and state laws.

               Paid memberships, and their associated free trial memberships are not sweepstakes/contests/lotteries because they are not games. The underlying product/service maybe a game (i.e. poker) but the membership itself is a product/service.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the reasons a legal sweepstakes in the US would be limited to US residents/citizens is because in Canada, their definition of sweepstakes is what the US calls a contest thus creating problems in administering the promotion.
              </p>
              <p>
               Furthermore, the regulation, in the US, of online gambling is left to the states and most statues are vague in their laws. Only one state, Washington, explicitly makes online poker a crime.

               How does this affect personal/non-business raffles/drawings for items worth less than $600? We are raising money for our favorite charity, and have our own personal item as the prize. We would like to sell raffle tickets, or drawing chances online, but I want to be sure I do things correctly as well.

               <br/>
               I realize this article was written a long time ago and I might not get a response, but its worth a shot!

               In conjunction with a wine company, a travel company and a retail company, we are giving away a trip, a bracelet and a dinner/wine at a vineyard. We were told that giving wine away is illegal, but also that using the word wine to promote the sweepstakes may not be allowed  is that accurate?

               Excellent analysis, thanks for this article. Weve done some sweepstakes in the past, but are considering a larger one and were debating whether a sweepstakes or contest would be best. We were leaning towards a contest for this one, and thats probably what well do. But for sweepstakes in the future, this article is invaluable.

               I would like to suggest an economic driver for our downtown business district.  This raffle would be sponsored by the local business association and for every participating merchant a cash pool will be collected and raffled off to a lucky shopper.  The requirement would be a minimum $100 one time purchase to enter. Enter as many times as possible with each individual purchase.  Drawing to held at a year end event.  The winning pot depends on participation but goal would be $5,000 cash back.  Would this be a legitimate program in VA?

              <p>
               That being said, I would like to have an entry fee for several reasons:
               <br/>
               1. Limit the pool of participants to individuals who are serious musicians.
               <br/>
               2. Use the entry fees to pay for film festival entries for the artists complete video (as you know film festivals can cost anywhere from $20 up to $100 a pop).
               <br/>
               3. Use part of the entry fee to pay for overhead costs (i.e. set design materials, props , etc.)
              </p>
              <p>
               All that being said can I legally ask for a $20 entry fee? The winner would be selected by two filmmakers who determine the songs potential and consider their attached essay that would explain why they deserve to be chosen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks!

               Our company is wanting to do a small give away via facebook. Our plan is to giveaway a $50 voucher/coupon for our products. We were going to choose the winner at random from a pool of people who like our facebook page. Because it is under $600 and they dont have to pay to enter our giveaway, are there any laws that apply?

               Hey Sara,
              </p>
              <p>
               Awesome article. Very helpful. I have a question  if a company sells a product, but incentivizes customers to buy saying if you buy you will also be entered to win this bonus product does that constitute a lottery? Even though I am receiving an item for my original purchase and the giveaway is just a bonus?

               You would need to find out what the laws are in your state (VA) regarding raffles. Each state has specific criteria as to who can run a raffle since a raffle is basically a legalized lottery on a smaller scale.

               @disqus_D2geyBkglY:disqus  the laws relating to sweepstakes (random draw) are different than those for a contest (a game of skill). You should consult with an attorney to determine how best to structure your promotion.

               Many sweepstakes are limited to entrants who are members of specific groups and many companies have successfully run promotions that are hosted solely on social platforms allowing such promotions. Sweepstakes laws do not have any specific monetary threshold except in certain states that require a bond or registration.
              </p>
              <p>
               You should seek legal counsel to ensure your promotion is legally compliant, as I am unable to offer that type of advice within public comments.

               I know this is super late, but I was hoping you could answer a question for me. Im running an Instagram contest for my company and noticed in the Official Rules of several other Instagram contests that they require the winners complete an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability Release form in order to receive their prize. I was wondering whether it is necessary to have winners sign such a form when the prizes are under $600. Would it be okay to have them simply email us their full name, mailing address, and an original copy of the winning photo? Thanks in advance for your help!

               I prefer not to share my entry with my FB friends.  All contests ask you to share. I dont know if thats part of the requirements.
               <br/>
               1. Im wondering if I dont share my entry will I be invalidated?
               <br/>
               2. Or if I share only to myself will that counts?

               Ive been doing a lot of digging about this topic and am hoping to find a quick answer. I work for a car wash business and hope to trying some new things like a sweepstakes on our Facebook page. I have seen other businesses do small giveaways on Facebook without ever stating official rules or guidelines. Basically, what we were hoping to do if to post a question (e.g. What is your favorite car air freshener scent?) and giveaway a free wash to a random fan who answers the question. I just feel that the amount of work involved in drafting official rules or seeking legal counsel who be more than it is worth when it comes to running a small giveaway such as this. Any advice would be much appreciated.

               Can someone point me in the right direction regarding the legality of this situation?:
               <br/>
               My school help a contest, where after a scavender hunt, the picture with the most likes on facebook won. It was listed to end Thursday March 20, but didnt list an end time. I have several screen caps from that day showing I was winning (10am, noon, 5pm, 9pm.) When I looked on Friday morning, someone else had more votes, but I am fairly certain it wasnt until after midnite (hence Friday). According to a student gov worker, when she checked at midnight (this would then be FRIDAY) the other girl was winning. So they are callin her the winner (But they did not take a screen cap or have PROOF) of the actual time she checked. Lets say that she DID have more votes at 11:59pm, wouldnt I be the winner, as there is no documented evidence that she had more at any time Thursday? I dont think one student workers word about when she thinks she checked facebook is enough to determine a winner!
               <br/>
               Thanks in advance.

               The reason companies obtain an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability Release is to ensure that the potential winner is qualified to win and to then obtain an affirmative release of liability by obtaining a signature. This is done especially with photo/video contests and sweepstakes where a written copyright assignment or license would be required under the law.

               Both federal and state laws require entrants to be apprised of the rules. Just because companies and individuals choose not to create official rules does not mean theyre not. Lots of people violate the law every day (speeding, copyright, theft, violence). Its a risk analysis. For some the risk is too high, for others theyre willing to take the risk.

               That would likely be considered a lottery. Some states do have exceptions for charitable raffles, but youll need to check with your state to determine if your situation is covered by state law.

               This is why these promotions should have official rules. Without official rules there are situations like this and if you were to pursue any type of action they would need to defend themselves.

               If you want to give away concert tickets as a prize there is no prohibition to that type of prize if you bought the tickets. If they were provided to you gratis, you would need to determine if there was a prohibition on transfer. In addition, with concert tickets, if the ticket must be obtained at Will Call there may be requirements to provide identity of the ticket purchaser that could impede your giving them away. These positive identity rules are in place to deter scalping and re-sale and are legal. So, youd have to consider the entire circumstances.

               We keep sending out emails to people who have been chosen to receive sweepstakes prizes, but no one is responding. Legally, do we have to keep communicating and reaching out to find someone or at some point have our legal obligations been fulfilled? Thanks.

               I would think the implicit contract would allow for cause to elicit the same consideration as promisory estoppel. Being that you are working under the established understanding that the end of the implied contract is at 12pm pacific time not AM.

               Sirendipity, this is where having Official Rules is important. If you have Official Rules they should set forth the process that will be followed if the proposed winner does not claim the prize. Without Official Rules, its a bit of a Catch-22.

               If the promotion has Official Rules, that would be the first place to start in your determination of whether or not the Sponsor and/or Administrator are following their own rules. If there are no Official Rules you may need to look in to other options to get your answers.

               If there are Official Rules, check to see if there is a time zone specified as it may have been 4 hours earlier with regard to your time zone but compliant with the one stated in the Official Rules. If there are no Official Rules you may need to pursue other options.

               @Callmethequeen:disqus I cant provide legal advice or provide my opinion as to whether a specific situation is or is not compliant. Unfortunately, there is no law that specifically addresses how promotions should take place on Twitter and what is required due to the space constrain. This is something youd need to take up with a lawyer if you are seeking legal advice.

               Hi Sarah.  Very informative article! Stumbled upon your article while doing research on minimum age requirements for contests in the U.S. and Canada.  interested in doing a social media photo contest for the U.S. and Canada, and wanted to know what the legal minimum age is for eligibility in both countries. we are looking at allowing 13 yrs and older to participate.  the prize would be two roundtrip air tickets.

               Edna, in the US a sweepstakes or contest can be targeted at people of all ages. Its just a matter of ensuring that the laws regarding sweepstakes for those under 18 are complied with at both the federal and state level.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am not versed on the nuances of Canada sweepstakes and contest law relating to those under 18 so I am unable to comment.

               Hi Sara. Thank you very much for this useful information. A quick question: What do I do if I had already posted a sweepstakes that is illegal (for example, it required a purchase of a product to enter)? What are some of the ways I can fix it to make it okay? I am afraid that simply deleting it may be breaching the offer that I made. Any quick advice would be much appreciated!

               Hi, I was wondering if you could offer me some advise.  My mom was notified that she had won a grand price from a company called HelloWorld.  The Contest/Sweepstakes itself was sponsored by Twisted Tea.  Every since being notified that she was the winner, no one that represents either company has made contact with us.  We were notified back June and asked to sign and have some papers notarized in which we did.  Since then we have heard nothing.  The price itself was a 3 night 4 day all expense paid trip to the Sprint Cup in Dover, DE.  It was supposed to take place on 9/26-29.  We were all the way into the first week of Sept and hadnt heard anything form the company. After calling their corporate offices we had someone call us back and told us we could have the cash value of the trip (which is 10k.)  Since being told this we havent heard anything back and Im starting to suspect something fishy going on.  What do you suggest that I do?

               I enter lots of giveaways on facebook and notice a few pages/companies dont seem to ever announce winners. It is my understanding that it is unlawful to offer a giveaway and never announce winners. Is that correct?

               My apologies for commenting on an older post, but I read your article and was curious.  Can a company declare the list of contest winners as essentially private, and state that any one who requested them may not share them?

               I won a purse from a reputable designer in June of this year.  I quickly chose the purse of my choice as instructed.  I never heard back from her so I emailed her.  She never answered me so I IMd her during her next week giveaway.  She answered in saying that she had emailed me (which she hadnt) and said the purse I picked was out of stock, to pick another, so I did and asked her when I could expect to receive again.  She again did not get back to me.  I was wondering if you could please help me in knowing what to do:(  Susan Nicole Handbags is what I won

               @Sherry If you feel you have rightfully won something and did not receive your prize you can contact your state Attorney General consumer protection division, file a claim with the FTC, if they have a brick and mortar store file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. If its a high value item you may want to sue in small claims court. Many small businesses dont know there are laws pertaining to giveaways so often just by educating them and letting them know you will make a formal complaint with a government agency theyll get it together. Sometimes they job out the promotion and the company executives dont even know there is a problem.

               @David Every state requires a list of contest winners to be made available to the public. While the sponsor/administrator can limit the information provided (dont want to give out someones home address or private email) the winner information is public.

               Hi Sara! Thank you for the great information in this post. I am working with a massage therapy business on a sweepstakes/contest idea, and Id really appreciate your feedback. (Were in California.)
               <br/>
               Basically, the idea is to get current clients to refer new ones during a certain time period. As the end of that period, if the stated minimum # of new clients (say, 20) have been referred, then 3 prizes would be awarded. The current client who refers the most new ones gets a guaranteed prize. The new clients referred by the winner of that first prize will be entered to win a prize (random drawing among those people). And everyone who referred at least 1 new client will be entered to win a prize (random drawing among all who referred someone).
               <br/>
               I know you cant give legal advice, but do you see any red flags there? The only thing that I know of is no free way to enter for the random drawings. Any suggestions on a free entry option for those that doesnt defeat the purpose of the contest and/or create a huge flood of entries?
               <br/>
               Thanks!

               Can a company change the Official Rules during or after the contest if they put in the rules that they have the right to modify the rules at anytime? My
               <br/>
               husband was in 3rd place in a photo contest based on votes, but the
               <br/>
               entrants in 1st and 2nd place did not abide by the Official Rules. The
               <br/>
               rules stated the pictures are to be selfies and taken by the entrant.
               <br/>
               The pics are not selfies, one was taken by a 3rd party instead of the
               <br/>
               entrant, and one entrant is not even in a photo. When my husband and I wrote to the sponsor to say some
               <br/>
               pics should be disqualified (apparently none had gone through an
               <br/>
               approval processinstead, all pics were immediately uploaded to the
               <br/>
               contest page), we were told our suggestions will be useful for next
               <br/>
               years contest. After the contest, they added to the Official Rules that the sponsor had the sole discretion to approve pictures.  Theres also a part in the rules that if they are sued, the plaintiff just gets out of pocket expenses.  Can they do this?   Thank you.

               Hi Sara
               <br/>
               We are a non-profit based in Australia and are looking at running an international game of chance competition and actively promoting it via emails and post to a worldwide database. Entry is free and the prize is worth about $20,000. The entry website is based in Australia, and we will obtain all required Australian licences. Do we need permits for every jurisdiction that someone in our database is living? Any help would be appreciated as it seems prohibitive to run this at this stage.
               <br/>

               I had attended a Halloween event that offered cash prizes for best costumes after sharing pictures on their Instagram and Facebook. There has not been a winner announced after multiple people asking online. I have written them with no response. Is this illegal and if so, is there a way to report them? I had bought tickets to this event specifically for the contest.

               This is great! Any info on using photos of products or logos? I would like to purchase gifts to give away monthly on my website but dont want to infringe on any copyright issues. Whats the best way to do this? I would definitely include rules and that I purchased the product directly and that X is not a participant in or sponsor of this promotion but I do want to show what that product is. If could take my own photos of the product but its the logos that I couldnt replicate. Any advise would be great! Thanks!!

               Contests do not necessarily require a free entry because the winner is not chosen randomly (by chance), but rather based on some skill or objective criteria.

               Under federal and state laws, as well as FTC regulations (and other regulations for which sweepstakes and contests are covered) Official Rules can not be changed after a promotion begins unless there are exigent circumstances. For example, if the rules say the grand prize is $100000 when it should be $1000.00 and the period separating the dollars and cents is missing that can be corrected.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the rules are written to limit liability it all depends on if a court will enforce that provision, as Official Rules are deemed to be a contract between the parties.

               Sweepstakes and Contests can set the rules for entry and qualification. This is why well-drafted, legally enforceable Official Rules are worth having done.

               If there are Official Rules the sponsor must abide by those rules. If there are no Official Rules, there is significant liability because rules will be imposed upon them if someone sues.

               Thanks for this great info Sara.
               <br/>
               Just wondering:
               <br/>
               1. According to US low, Is there a limits about to the companies about making lottery / grant awards to their customers per a year? how many times in a year company can run a contests in her website?
               <br/>
               2. If a company said to their audience exactly the next thing  text us a message to our phone number, answer to one question and one or more of those that give the right answer will win in blh blh.
               <br/>
               Is it legal In the US? (In fact, the company collects a small fee for the text message as a participation fees And she informs of course the participants about that fee).
               <br/>
               Thanks!!

               Mark, there are no laws that limit the frequency of consumer promotions a company can undertake, except if consumer promotions are fraudulent. Raffle is not a legal term and so its unclear what you mean by the word.
              </p>
              <p>
               We usually see the word raffle used for church and school fundraisers. Often a raffle is where someone buys a ticket to enter a random drawing to win a prize. In this context, a raffle is another word for lottery. In every US state, lottery is highly regulated. There are usually exceptions for religious or charitable organizations, but you would have to review the laws of each state the promotion would be valid in to determine if it is applicable. No state allows commercial enterprises to run a lottery (even if its called a raffle).
              </p>
              <p>
               With regard to SMS/Text messages as a means of entry, there are no stated laws on the topic. To further the confusion, recent cases against television networks with regard to major TV shows using SMS/text messages as a means of entry into sweepstakes have been settled out of court so we dont even have judicial review to guide these decisions. Using SMS/text as a means of entry is certainly a grey area and I would suggest seeking legal counsel to determine viability and compliance if its undertaken.

               This a great and informative article!  Im going through an experience currently in which I had entered a sweepstakes on a Facebook page, followed the rules listed.  I recently received an email saying claim my prize but also that they had noticed many people did not follow the rules that you needed to be employed in a specific occupation and in order to claim prize I needed to send a copy of my CDL.  It was never in the rules to be employed by a trucking company.  I emailed them back with a link to their rules and asked them where it says that.  They replied back with a screen shot of an edit page with that restriction.  It was never made public.  Now on their Facebook page, they said today They will be drawing the 60 winners out of emails they received back with CDLs.  I feel that they have broken the law not only by changing the rules after the sweepstakes has concludedbut also by emailing more then 60 people to claim their prizes, when in fact, they were just trying to weed people out.  Am I correct on this?

               School fundraisers are often governed by separate laws that permit them to hold what would be considered a lottery if the same promotion were to be conducted by a commercial business.

               Official Rules should not be changed once the promotion begins unless there is an exigent situation requiring the change. Its unclear if this would be one of those circumstances. If you feel the company has not operated in good faith or has violated federal or state laws you may file a complaint with the state attorney general and/or the FTC. In addition, if you believe the organization has violated the Facebook Terms of Service there is a process by which you can notify Facebook.
