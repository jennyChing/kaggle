Ive received phenomenal service in every department: from the beer fridge to the butcher counter to the bulk aisle. I now know everything there is to know about lentils, for instance, thanks to a guy stocking roma tomatoes in the produce section of the downtown Milwaukee store, who took the time to explain why he used

           The problem with Whole Foods is their regular customers. They are, across the board, across the country, useless, ignorant, and miserable. Theyre worse than miserable, theyre

           They are quite literally the opposite of every Whole Foods employee Ive ever encountered.

           I was in line at the Wrigleyville Whole Foods in Chicago one night last spring, behind a thin, angular bird-faced man in his 40s who was beside himself that he hadnt already been magically checked out and bagged up. The place was a madhouse, every checkstand was open, and each one had a line, but that was not enough of an explanation for this guy. He wanted to know why things werent moving faster, why there werent more checkstands, why he was still here for crying out loud! He kvetched about it to anyone who would listen, screeching his complaints into the already deafening din of Americas angriest store.

           I was in a hurry too, so I was not without sympathy for those who had places to go and people to see, but circumstances were such that none of us were floating out of there effortlessly like when you hit all the lights riding up one of the avenues in Manhattan on your way to dinner or a meeting. All you needed was a pair of eyeballs to see that. Still, this guy was undeterred. If he had to be pissed off and unhappy, he was going to make damn sure the rest of us were pissed off and unhappy as well.

          <p class="graf--p" id="92e0" name="92e0">
           When I was in my 20s, I would have shut this guy up myself or changed lanes and let him know exactly why. But that doesnt really work in your 30s, and it certainly doesnt get you anywhere with insufferable dickheads like this guy. So instead of trying to resist him or ignore his protestations, I took a page from the martial arts playbook and used his momentum against him.

           We watched as he marched to the Customer Service desk and button-holed some unsuspecting manager. The conversation seemed to start well enough. Birdman spoke passionately, but not disrespectfully. The manager listened thoughtfully, nodding in all the right places, absorbing all of Birdmans self-important, self-indulgent demands. When it was his turn to speak though, Birdman afforded the manager no such courtesy. He interrupted every five seconds, his arms flailing like an inflatable dancing man on the roof of a mattress superstore, his head involuntarily thrusting toward the manager like a clucking chicken to emphasize his point.

           Are you kidding me? Wed been in line for at least 10 minutes. Instead of taking that time to make sure he had everything on his list that he stored on his grocery app on his new iPhone, he used it to bitch and moan. I couldnt believe it. The woman behind me could believe it even less. So she took matters into her own hands: she walked around me, fetched Birdmans basket from underneath the checkstand, swept all his groceries back into it and plopped the basket down at the end of the line. I could have hugged this woman. If I had the power, I would have crowned her Queen of America and her next move would have been to Washington DC to fix Congress (and the horrible people who shop at those Whole Foods stores).

           When Birdman returned, clutching a tub of plain yogurt, he walked straight to the front of the register and stopped dead. No one said a word to him. He said a word to no one. He could not have been more confused if hed come back and everyone was dead. He peeked his head over to the lanes on either side of us, like maybe hed come back to the wrong checkstand. He looked to the end of the counter, thinking maybe the checker had scanned everything and bagged it up already. He looked under the checkstand, like his groceries were a set of keys or a remote control that had fallen under a sofa.

Was his humanity being disregarded? Thats when he saw his groceries, back in his basket, on the cement floor slid to the back of the line.

           I think about that evening every time I walk into a Whole Foods during rush hour. I look for the tell-tale signs of another Birdmanimpatience, over-reaction, constipated rageand I find it every time. Then I wonder,

            why are these people all so angry?

           Is it something about Whole Foods that brings it out of them? Is it just their proximity to other miserable souls just like them? Is it the outward projection of inner self-loathing brought on by the feeling of utter helplessness in the face of social pressure to pay higher prices for organic, GMO-free, gluten-free, paleo, macro,
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">

          <p class="graf--p" id="eeb2" name="eeb2">
           Yet Whole Foods is not the only game in town. Wherever there is a Whole Foods there is always a Ralphs, a Pic n Save, a Safeway nearby. In some cities there are national and regional grocery chains that straddle the line between down market and up market: Trader Joes, HEB, Gelsons, Outpost, etc. There is always a choice.

          <p class="graf--p" id="11df" name="11df">
           As someone with a relative high up the ladder at Whole Foods, I feel for him and for the enterprise (as much as you can feel for a business, anyway). Whole Foods tries to bring to market the best products an areas surrounding farms and suppliers have to offer, in a socially conscious way with high-touch customer service at the point of sale. Yet in doing so, theyve brought out the worst in the people who are attracted to that idea. Or perhaps more accurately, their idea attracts the worst kind of people. I dont know. It is a frustrating irony for which they should not be held responsible. There isnt much to do, after all, when your core demographic happens to be a living, breathing hashtag.
