             See Leonard Cohen and his tour band at this very special concert in New York on February 19. He will play especially for his fans and US media. Later - in April 2009 - his World Tour will continue in the USA and Western Canada.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Thanks to Leonard, his management, and AEG Live, the best seats were allocated to our members. This will be a memorable, full-scale concert with all the beloved songs!
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The concert begins at 8 pm.
Before the concert, we will have a VIP reception at 6 pm at the Beacon for a limited number of special guests and members, who were lucky to get the VIP ticket at the pre-sale on January 14. (Leonard is not expected to attend the pre-show reception).

             About the venue
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <font size="-1">
              The Beacon Theatre was designated by Chicago architect Walter W. Ahlschlager and opened in 1928. The 2,800-seat Beacon Theater is a fantastic Art Deco treasure, built as silent pictures began talking and as vaudeville capitulated to the movie palace era. In 1979, the historic venue was designated a national landmark. The three-level auditorium is distinguished by 30-foot statues of Greek women on each side of the proscenium arch. Other features include an open-air lobby, bronze front doors, ornate moldings, white marble floors, and corridor murals depicting elephants, camels and traders. Known for its flawless acoustics, New Yorkers are anxiously awaiting its reopening in February 2009 after a $15 million restoration.
