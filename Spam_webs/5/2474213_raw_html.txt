          TruthOnPot.com  All marijuana users are faced with a common problem when they are asked to undergo a drug test. The issue is that marijuana can be detected in the body for days or even weeks after last being used.
         </p>
         <p>
          How long it stays in your system depends on how frequently you use marijuana as well as your bodys rate of metabolism.

          Urine tests are the most common way of testing for marijuana, but blood tests have been used as well, especially when driving under the influence is suspected. Blood tests measure levels of active THC and therefore can only detect recent marijuana use.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the other hand, urine tests measure levels of THC metabolites  the compounds that result from the breakdown of THC  such as THC-COOH. THC metabolites are known to remain in the body for much longer and therefore pose more risk to users being tested.

           study

          THC From Smoking Marijuana
         </h4>
         <p>
          Smoking is the most common way of using marijuana and also happens to be the fastest method of absorbing THC.
         </p>
         <p>
          THC has been

           found
          </a>
          to be immediately detectable after the first inhale of marijuana smoke, with blood levels of THC reaching a peak at around 9.0 min into smoking  just under a minute before the patients took their last puff (9.8 min).
         </p>
         <p>
          While patients seem to control their individual doses by varying how deeply they inhale, the average amount of THC in the blood dropped to 60% of the peak at 15 min after the last inhale and to 20% at 30 min. By the 2 hour mark, THC levels were below 5 ng/ml.
         </p>
         <p>
          It took between 3 to 12 hours for THC to drop below detection limits (0.5 ng/ml) for the low-dose group and from 6 to 27 hours for the high-dose group of the study. However, the subjects of the study were not regular marijuana smokers, which explains why THC levels fell so quickly.

          THC From Oral Ingestion of Marijuana

         <p>
          A less common form of consuming marijuana is by oral ingestion. Oral ingestion of THC leads to a very different pattern of THC levels. A

          </a>
          involving patients given 20mg THC cookies found the peak in blood levels of THC to occur between 1 to 5 hours following consumption. Another study conducted by Kim and Yoon (1996) using 10 mg THC capsules of Marinol identified a peak between 1 to 2 hours following ingestion.

           studies
          </a>
          involving hemp oils and dronabinol, THC blood levels were found to fall below detection limits (0.5 ng/ml) by 25 hours following intake. On the other hand, THC-COOH was still measurable for more than 50 hours after the last dose.
         </p>
         <h4>
          THC Absorption
         </h4>
         <p>
          THC blood concentrations decrease rapidly after you finish smoking due to its fast distribution into tissues and metabolism in the liver. THC is a fat-soluble molecule and is initially absorbed by organs with high blood circulation, such as the lung, heart, brain and liver.
         </p>
         <p>
          THC and its metabolites are usually retained by organs of the body for much longer than it remains in the blood.
          <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2539872" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov']);">
           Studies
          </a>
          show that THC is mostly stored in fat tissues and  with regular use  can stay there for up to 4 weeks.

         <h4>
          THC Metabolism and Elimination
         </h4>
         <p>
          THC is primarily metabolized by the liver, but other tissues such as the brain, intestine and lungs may contribute as well.

           Studies
          </a>
          show that within 5 days  80 to 90% of THC is eliminated from the body  mostly in the form of its metabolites. More than 65% is excreted in feces and 20% in urine.

           study
          </a>
          found that THC could remain above the limit of detection (0.3 ng/ml) in the blood of regular users for up to a month following cessation, although it varies by individual.

         <h4>
          THC in Urine
         </h4>
         <p>
          THC is not found in its active form in urine samples, but rather as the metabolite THC-COOH. The results of urine tests have also been shown to vary greatly from user to user, even in controlled laboratory settings.

           extreme case
          </a>
          , a heavy cannabis user of more than 10 years was able to test positive (20 ng/ml limit) for up to 67 days after last being exposed to marijuana.
         </p>
         <h4>
          How Long Will I Test Positive For?
         </h4>
         <p>
          Based on these findings, it is impossible to say for sure how long marijuana will remain in your system for. There are a number of factors that contribute to this uncertainty, such as the level of THC dose, method of intake, duration and frequency of use and your bodys metabolism rate. On top of all that, various drug tests have different levels of accuracy and cut-off limits.
         </p>
         <p>
          As studies have shown, the chances of testing positive for marijuana  even after a break in use  are much higher if you happen to be a regular user as opposed to someone who has just smoked once or twice in the past few weeks.

                   Possibly the governments way of pushing back; HOWEVER, just because you have a legitimate medical marijuana card does not give you a license to drive under the influence whether pot, alcohol or other Rx such as pain killers with opiates.  These are separate issues. Do not get heavily stoned, drive and expect a get out of jail free card. It does not work that way.  Any medical patient under narcotics should not drive if significantly affected  no brainer!  Legal levels of intoxication still apply.

               I have not smoked in nearly a year.  6 weeks ago, I smoked approximately 4 grams and have not had any since.  Today I tested positive on a strip test, and it was tested twice.  I am somewhat overweight, but I exercise some each day.  I need to know if the GC/MS test is also going to show positive.

                 As a chronic daily smoker i just failed a pee test at 104 days without smoking anything in that time period,with some of the new testing methods weed is one of the hardest things to get out of your system.I did everything i read and was told to get it out of my system,i do not have much body fat and drank water to flush my self out but no luck at all.

                   is it possible that even though you went 104 days without smoking you may have been exposed to marijuana smoke? or that your living areas still have 3rd hand smoke? Im not sure if this helps

                     Theres no such thing as second or third hand marijiana smoking. Once someone exhales marijuana smoke, it no longer has the thc in it. Therefore, you cant get second hand from it. Im 14 and even I know this lol

                       That isnt a true fact. I dont care how old u are you can get contact high. So who ever gave you that information is incorrect. I work at a k ab corp. And we have done numberous studies with persons who have never smoked. And had them in closed together in a room with four other persons smoking. And all but one tested positive on a 20ng test. Dont kid yourself kiddo

                      <p>
                       I know the answer
                       <br/>
                       First a 5 panel test will test fir vitamin count,an creatine.
                       <br/>
                       So I messured how much I pea on average an it was 8 ounces
                       <br/>
                       So I took an bought:
                       <br/>
                       1 bottle of liquid vitamin ( use citrus  flavor CUZ its yellow)
                       <br/>
                       1 bottle of creatine capsules $54at GNC)
                       <br/>
                       1 small travel shampoo bottle
                       <br/>
                       1 pack of hot hands (glove warmers)
                       <br/>
                       1 rubberband
                       <br/>
                       Half of each pill crushed that should show up like Adderal,ZANEX,any opiot pill ect.
                       <br/>
                       
                       <br/>
                       NOW HOW TO DO IT
                       <br/>
                       
                       <br/>
                       1)measure 8oz of hot water
                       <br/>
                       ADD
                       <br/>
                       2)1 teaspoon of liquid citrus vitamin
                       <br/>
                       3) add a creatine pill (but dont let the plastic capsule get in the water it wont fully desolve in time)
                       <br/>
                       IF YOU DONT TAKE ANY NARCOTIC,OPIOT,ANPHETAMINE  MEDS, then skip step  (4)
                       <br/>
                       4) add any MEDS crushed up into hot water half a pill if u use 4 oz of hot water instead of 8oz
                       <br/>
                       5) mix and add to 3 or 4 oz shampoo travel bottle
                       <br/>
                       6) seal shampoo bottle and place on measuring cup or larger cup an run under hot water shaking occasionally so to desolve an mix content.(water should look like yellow urine)
                       <br/>
                       7) Now when on the way to doctor or test open hot hands and rubberband them to shampoo bottle so they keep water hot.
                       <br/>
                       8) make sure on bottle u pee in, THE TEMPERURE GUAGE IS BETWEEN 98 to 100 or hold hot hands against the TEMPERURE GUAGE till says 98 or 100, Im to the point i just make it 100 but try to get 98
                       <br/>
                       And theres my secret
                       <br/>
                       O AN ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TALK CRAP THEN YOUR A FOOL THAT HAS NO LIFE BUT TO PUT OTHERS DOWN, Ive never failed
                       <br/>
                       You can also flood your system with water an drink a vitamin pill crushed with water till u puke then your ready just eat 2 creatine pilks after you puke with more water an vitamins, it sucks but pass a 5 panel test for the iron workers union.
                       <br/>
                       Id say good luck but u wont need it if u do what I said
                       <br/>
                       O AN IF ITS NOT A FIVE PANEL TEST JUST DRINK WATER TILL U PUKE FLUDSING YOUR SYSTEM AN DRINK MORE WATER ON THE WAY TO TEST.
                       <br/>
                       The worst that can happen is it comes back deleted for drinking to much water,
                       <br/>
                       Peace out friends

                       Yes you can fail a urinalysis from being around second hand marijuana smoke. IT IS FACT AND DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE YOUNG KIDS IN HERE BLABBERING ABOUT SHIT THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. ITS BEEN STUDIED AND I KNOW FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN EASILY FAIL A TEST FROM BEING AROUND YOU MUCH SMOKE. ITS NOT JUST THE EXHALED SMOKE, ITS ALSO THE SMOKE BURNING FROM THE LIT JOINT OR BLUNT IT BURNS SOME WITH THC IN IT AND WHEN YOU TAKE A LARGE HIT THAT BLUNT BURNS EVEN MORE THIS EMITTING VERY THICK SMOKE THAT HADNT BEEN INHALED. TRUST ME, DO NOT RISK IT. THE CHANCES ARE KIND OF LOW BUT THERES A CHANCE, BELIEVE ME.

                       NO YOU CAN NOT (am I doing it right? All caps so I appear to be yelling?)! Youre not talking about second-hand smoke Adam, inhaling smoke from a burning joint/blunt is NOT second-hand, its the same as hitting it yourself just not as direct and would take more. Geez, are you people all idiots?

                       Did you end a up passing that test a year ago Benson? I am in a similar situation now and just read your comment. I would have thought such a small dose youd be ok; mine is also about 60 days from having a few joints over the space of a month when I was bored shitless in Bulgaria doing nothing in the middle of nowhere

                       Im not an expert so take what I say with a grain of salt, but as this article and other studies suggest, you should be able to pass a test within 2 days. Worst case scenario would be a week. You should have no problem passing this test if you rarely smoke weed.

                       youll be fine as long as you give yourself 30 days of good hydration, meals and some exercise. Im an army vet and have been in your shoes.  I started smoking medicinally after i got out of my first 4 yr. was out for a few months before i was missing it and wanted to rejoin. 35 days after i had last smoked i got blood and urine taken. passed.

                       Dude, Im on the same page. I need to know exactly what you need to know. Someone reply to the question. I smoked approximately 6-8 days ago, and smoked like 3 joints worth. Ive been drinking water, not a shit ton though. I may have to take a urine screen on January 5th.. Its not known for sure yet. I wanna be better safe then sorry. I havent smoked in like 6, maybe 7 months. It was like my first time again. After that smoke session, I havent puffed on any ganja since. Will THC show in my system still

                       I smoke about a dozen hits on a friday, eat minimal amounts on saturday along with an energy drink or two and enough fluids to pee clear all day, eat a lot on a Sunday with same fluid intake, and on Monday morning I drink 48-60 Oz of water to flush out any metabolites built up overnight and wait til my pee starts to gain LIGHT color, and test by 830 am.

                       This is now my weekly ritual and its worked thus far. A few joints, even iif its dank af, should be out within 7-10 days given your low tolerance. Hope you passed your test brotha!

                       You may be ok, infrequent smokers can usually test neg after 4 wks or so.  But it depends also on your fat content, hydration, and the strength of what you smoked.

                       Infrequent smokers can test negative after a couple days, not four weeks. Retards, everywhere in this comment section.

                       If you just smoked a little bit and hadnt smoked in months it will be out of your system within a week but its always a good idea to eat fish or non fatty foods and dont be a couch potato get some excercise lol

                       I am our was a heavy smoker. I got a blood test for marijuana at doctors 3 months ago. I have been trying to quit and I have slowed way down. I take a small hit maybe once a day. It is hard to quit after 38 years of smoking. I have another appt may 20th. I will not be smoking anything else. Will it be out of my blood?  I told my doctor up front. Told him I smoked a long time. I am 5 feet tall,  weight 135 have back problems thats why I need to be clean. Will I have a clean blood test?  I drink allot of water. Thats all I drink. I pee alot thru out the day. I take vitamin shots and a bunch of other medications. Im scared to lose my pain meds. Ive had two Back surgeries and need them.!!!  Please reply asap!  In dire need to know!!

                       Hi, Im 53 and 110lbs and Im a very active softball player who drinks a lot of water. I havent smoked in a little over two weeks and I have a drug test next week. Is there any chance that I will be able to pass? When I did smoke I would only smoke about two bowls every weekend

                       cutting close. 4 weeks is a good clensing time. smoking a joint 10 days away from a drug test was not the best idea but lets say you were clean or close to clean after those 4 weeks you would be ok after a joint.

                       Today is Sunday June 14 2014 and for the first time in my life i took 3-4 hits on joint on Saturday 6-13-15 and may be called for an interview in the coming week for a job that im sure i will get and one in which there will for sure be a drug test. Will i be ok? Im 56 216 a little active and I immediately started drinking tons of water and taking green tea extract soft gels. Im not a smoker at all but it didnt hit me until later that i had forgotten about my upcoming interview.

                       OK so Doc I have a quick question. I have a drug test this week between July 1-6 and I havent smoked since last month around may 24-26 before I stopped I smoked maybe half a blunt a day but I work out maybe three or four times a week and Im drinking lots of water n taking niacin pills maybe three times a week since I stopped. Will I past my drug test?? Is there anything extra I can do to help pass the natural way??

                       height and weight helps me a lot. if you have all of june to clense that is a good time period. as long as your not obese which if your working out 4 times a week you either are in good shape or getting there. i would say you will pass. make sure you take enough niacin to the point your skin will flush and you will feeel like you have sunburn and a rash on your body. greent teas and or green coffee extract is also good. lots of fluids i personally side with orange juice and cranberry. natural cranberry not the cocktail kind.

                       that is  a very very sensitive test. hard to say with out further information. how recent was the most recent 50ng/ml home test that you passed? i would say it can take UP to 3 weeks to get your levels below 5ng/ml after passing a 50ng/ml test. its hard to say with these drug test because of how senitive they are. who ever is testing you knows they are super sensitive so they may let you take a retest you if you dispute a failed test. Hold off as long as you possibly can. the longer you hold off the better (obviously)

                       That is a reall small window to clense. i do not think you will pass that test although i have seen very interesting results i would not risk it. push the test back as much as possible. as many excuses as possible. it is much different when you are taking a drug test to get a job rather than taking a drug test for suspicion of drugs on the job. they will work with you they just want to see clean test results.

                       Dr. Carlos. I took one hit of some mid grade stuff on June 8 from a bowl. I have been working out and sweating as well as drinking energy drinks, coffee and h20. I used to smoke a dime bag a day from 9 months (but that was 3 years ago). In 2013, I took one hit of some middies and 13 months ago I hit a spliff. Since then, I have not touched it. I am 6 ft tall 205 lbs. I am around 17% body fat. I might be tested in a week or so. What say you? Pass or fail? It was literally 1 hit from a bowl.

                       Omg are you serious dude. You took 1 hit 13 months ago, why you even wasting peoples time with a stupid question like if it will still be in your system, come on seriously.

                       you are cutting it super close. i cant say you will pass but there is a possibility. delay delay delay  family emergency came up you will be away for 6 days and when you come back you have to take care of a nephew for 2 days give yourself some extra time

                       I stopped smoking for 4months or so(used to be a HEAVY smoker). Im 5 ft10 inches 130pounds. my fat percent is 10% or less. I have a very wiry physique, 6 pack etc. Muscle very easy to see because i have very little fat. I smoked a 4 blunts this weekend(probably around 3grams of weed) and before then earlier that week, 1 blunt. I dont go to the gym anymore but at least twice a week i do handstand pushups, jump rope(sometimes), crunches &amp; planks. Basically whatever i can to stay in shape without weights. My question is how long do you think it will take before i  can pass a piss test?

                       three weeks you should be clean no doubt. but to be on the safe side i would say 4. you can always go to your local drug store and get a 5 dollar home kit. just to test yourself out. i would get a few just so you can see how long it takes you. i always start my testing after 2 weeks and then i test every 2 days until i pass to see just how long it takes. usually takes me about 17 days and i have a slightly highter BFI than you do

                       Dr. Mitchell- Im a 61 lean 240 pound athelete who trains everyday anywhere from 4-6 hours per day, along with 4 baseball games a week, 2 softball games, and other assorted activities. So I am very active.  Drink plenty ofwater and rarely have dark urine. I smoke 2-3 times a week never over a gram per day. This has been going off and on for about 2 months. Last time I smoked was 1 small hit off a bowl 2 days ago and it was 5 days ago before that. How long should I wait before taking a drug test?

                       THC moves through the blood fairly quickly. it takes it time when it starts to get through fatty tissue because THC is fat soluable. cells are made of fat. therfore it will make its way through your blood into your fatty tissue in a week tops. a week being if you are a super heavy smoker and have a lot of excess thc-cooh. that is the reason body fat percentage is important and i make sure i ask everyone there high and weight and fitness activity so i can get an understanding of their body first and understand the metabolism and what not. the fatter you are the longer it take the thc to travel through the fatty tissues. as for blood. weight is not as much as a factor.

                       Smoked two days ago and a week before that. But yesterday I drank two cups of cranberry juice mixed with water and biked 20 miles in an hour and a half on a kids bmx bike. I have passed drug tests after smoking the day before and passed, two times under similar conditions. My fat capita is .5 to 1.0. And Ive been drinking tons of water and defecated multiple times due to diarrhea. Kinda gross I know but just so info is there. Will I pass my drug test I have in an hour or two?

                       Hi Dr. Mitchell,
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I was smoking about a gram, sometimes more almost everyday for maybe 7+ years. On May 27 I stopped for 5 weeks exactly until June 24. I smoked on the 24th and again on 26th and 27th but only very small amounts, probably about half a gram in total of quite strong skunk. I have now stopped completely.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I have a potential test late August / early Sept, roughly 2 months time. Do you think that will be enough time to pass considering I was smoking for such a long time before stopping in May?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I know when I stopped for 5 weeks in May my body would have made some progress in clearing out the THC but I do not know what affect the recent smoking would have on the process.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I am 511, weigh 126 pounds and I am skinny. I am not very active and I believe I have a high metabolism because I do not put on weight easily. I think my body fat is around 10%.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Thank you in advance, I appreciate any info

                       Your body can only have so much thc in it. once your levels reach certain amounts they dont keep going up so essentially smoking for 30 days is the same as smoking for 30 years. (roughly) in two months you should have no trace in your system especially since you have a 28 day clense prior to smoking that small amount. that did you good for sure. to be honest you could smoke a few more times with out a problem (but  please be on the safe side and just wait it out)  you can up yuor fluid intake acidic juices , any kinds of natural juice really is good. i would go with cranberry and orange and a lot of water will do you good. you should be just fine.

                       Hello Dr. Mitchell, I am a heavy smoker (smoke approximately a blunt a day, everyday for the past 4 years). I am 59 and 150 pounds.  I work out atleast 3 days a week and have a very fast metabolism.  Would you happen to have an estimate on how long it might take for the THC to be out of my system for a urine test?  I dont have an exact testing date yet, but am strongly considering taking a detox drink the day of, just in case I do get an early call from a job requesting for me to take a drug test.  Thank you in advanced!

                       some places do coprehensive testing and test for dilutes and what not so maybe no detox drink. you should be clean in 3 weeks from the last day yu smoked.

                       Hey doctor mitchell. I smoked for the first time in 3 months about 4 days ago. Before the three months i was smoking daily a lot if that matter. I only took about 3 or 4 hits but i was definately high. I wanna smoke again but i need to be good to pass a drug test in 2 or 3 weeks. Im 511 150 pounds pretty slim but i do have a lil fat. Just wondering what your thoughts are on how long it would take to be clean for a piss test if now and if i did smoke again if i hydrated boosted my metabolism with fish oil and sweated alot

                       Dont waste the recruiters time if youre going to smoke right before MEPS. Theyre going to do a drug test on you and depending on your MOS, they will do a deep background check if you need a clearance. So if someone tells the investigator that youre an avid smoker, youre not likely to get through (thats if youre a big smoker). But depending on your recruiter, they might say that youre not going to MEPS at all or to come back to the station when youre clean. The recruiter should be doing a drug test on you before taking you to MEPS anyway.

                       That could have been a false reading because being around smoke is not usually enough to test positive. How ever lets say you did smoke enough to have dirty pee. how long until your drug test? what is your body weight and height? what body type are you?

                       not a chance. marijuana leaves the blood qicker than the urine. even a urine test would be clean after 3-10 days depending on your health a BF% after a one time thing.

                       Dr. Mitchell, I took 2 puffs of a blunt (I did not inhale deep puffs) back on May 2nd. I am not a weed smoker and have never smoked before then. I have a drug test on June 10. Do you think I will be OK?

                       your best bet would be to research some effective cleansing meterials and techniques. just to be safe. blood should be ok but urine could be positive

                       3 months is time to clear out your system entirely so that has no affect. smoking on session like that i would say 2-5 day positive window and your test is right over the line. are you physically active ? 5 fr 4 inches 155 lbs could either be very physically fit or slightly over weight which could be the deciding factor here

                       were you a heavy smoker before that? its hard to say. if i had to bet on it i would say stay active for a few more days than waterload. make sure its not the first piss of the day and try to piss a little before filling the cup up i.e. pee in the toilet for a second then start to fill the cup. those are just a few little tricks ive heard from people cant back them. you are cutting it close but i think you will be fine.

                       Hi Doc,
                       <br/>
                       Before two months ago, I was a heavy smoker (more than one bowl a day) and I also ate a lot of edible before I quit. For two months now, Ive been clean up until a few days ago where I took a few hits. Will I be okay for a drug test in 1-2 weeks if I start working out and drinking water? Im 115 lbs at 55, and I believe to have a extremely fast metabolism (I eat a lot and retain the same weight). Please help!
                      </p>

                       as long as you done smoke and drink a lot of fluids. water, orange juice cranberry juice. you can take some green tea and or green coffee bean extract, lots of sweating and urination. you are essentually flushing your body. some say niacin helps too. however it is very uncomfortable and makes your skin burn and itch on your entire body. some like it though. do some research of your own and decide.

                       Today is Sunday June 14 2014 and for the first time in my life i took 3-4 hits on joint on Saturday 6-13-15 and may be called for an interview in the coming week for a job that im sure i will get and one in which there will for sure be a drug test. Will i be ok? Im 56 216 a little active and I immediately started drinking tons of water and taking green tea extract soft gels. Im not a smoker at all but it didnt hit me until later that i had forgotten about my upcoming interview. Im freaking out!

                       IT MAY take a bit longer due to your BFI THC is a fat souluable chemical. Meaning it travels through fatty cells. (lipids) that is why your blood will clear out no longer than a week for a heavy heavy smoker. the lipids surrounds a cell make it a quick entry and exit through the cells of your blood. Once it is through the blood it will travel through the body fat. This will take much longer to clear out of body fat because those cells are ENTIRELY made of fatty lipids, where as a regular cell like a blood cell would only have lipids surround the cell wall. so basically the more body fat=the longer the thc takes to travel through the fatty tissue. That is the dumbed down version there is a lot more to it then just thc moving around your body. the thc is actually is broken down and only metabolites remain after everything is done. that is what you are fighting to get out of your body. the metabolites store in fat hair bone marrow and blood. Blood is out thequickest hair is in your hair as long as your hair is there it grows into your hair from base then fatty cells and last but not least your spinal bone marrow. that stays for life! luckily there will never be a spinal bone marrow drug test available for any type of employer or governing body. that is inhumane

                       Hey Docso Im also in the same boat as dee (as far as height and weight) and I was a daily user for many years (would stop off and on and never smoke more than 2/3 bowls a day) but have stopped for 2.5 weeks now. I have a pee test 16 days from today. I plan on buying drug tests and a detox drink for my test, but what do,you think about the timing? I believe I will fail without the detox drink. Do,you have recommendations on what else to do? I have increased my water intake and plan on drinking a gallon a day until the test. Please give me some suggestions!

                       ingest tons of water. get a detox drink but they are no full proof method also be careful because some tests test for that type of stuff as well. make sure you drink tons of water if you can not do stenuos workouts try walking it will help metabolize. that is a good time frame to clear your system but i have seen some surprising results before. water water water. green tea extract green coffee bean extract acai extract cranberry extract all will help your metabolism

                       also stores in your waste. stool and urine. that is why they say certain minerals like zinc help bind with the metabolites and excrete them. also why they tell you to use diruretics and lots of water to help force out of your urine. one more step of advice piss a couple times before you piss for your test. the first few urinations of the day tend to be the most poluted.

                       Hi Dr.Carlos Mitchell. I smoked for a first time since February. I smoked on the 25th April and I have a urine test in June/July. I go to the gym 5-6 times a week and train weights, I am 511 and weight 70kg. I always drink water and eat healthily. I should be okay right?

                       Are you seriously joking? Have you done any research?!?!? Youre just making a joke out of yourself. If youre doing shit thats going to contribute to helping it get out of your system, whyre you so concerned?

                       Hi Dr. Mitchell, I hope you can answer me as youve answered others. Im 62, probably 230 pounds. I smoked almost every day for about a year. On March 2nd, 2015 I stopped smoking so I could find a higher paying job. I didnt smoke until April 14th. Since the 14th I smoked pretty regularly, give or take a few days, until the 30th. Since the 30th I havent smoked. How long do you think until I can pass a urine test? Thanks!

                       the stop on mach 2nd  april 14th definitely did a good job of cleaning out your body. however smoking regularly for 2 weeks i would say you are looking at clost to a full 30 days depending on your water intake and how often you exercise. lots of orange juice will help lots off water and green tea and green coffee bean extract will help. you can also start taking 15 grams of coconut oil a day all of that stuff should help speed up the process as much as possible.

                       Hi there,
                       <br/>
                       as a foster parent, I know that one failed drug test is not going to get your kids taken away. Stay straight laced and prove to them you want to be a father instead of smoking weed. They will test levels, so as long as your levels are consistently going down and then disappear altogether, they will not keep your kids from you. Thats if she even calls. best of luck.

                       being around smoke will not effect your screening unless it is drastic circumstances. 3x a week being a casual smoker i would say not longer than 3 weeks. depending on your body type

                       Forgot to mention I have been drinking lot of water for the past 4-5 months too. Since the weather is warmer I do tend to go outside and at least walk around or do yard work in which I sweat. How long would it take for me to get clean and what advice would you have for me in the future. Im not having a drug test anytime soon at my job but I have a feeling that they will be handing out one sometime this year.

                       Since you smoked two blunts that is atleast going to be in your system for two weeks to three weeks unless you smoke two blunts a day then it will be a month(it honestly ranges but i would just stop for a month to 45 days). That is if you dont take niacin,dondont exercise, and drink a lot of water and cranberry juice but if you do it takes 8 to 16 days. You should have niacin and a detox on hand always if your going to smoke and know your going to get tested. Also a week from the test dont be anywhere near someone who smokes because you could fail the test. They have synthetic urine too if you dont have anywillpower.

                       that is very tough to say. It is very possible you will pass but very possible you will fail too. if you are highly active and you stopped and are consuming lots of water and diaretics you should be pulling it close. If i had to bet based on what you gave me id say you hace a 20% chance of passing

                       Lol, ya maybe from touching weed, and the thc absorbs in your body. So youre telling me, I can touch lbs of the highest quality dro, get a contact high, then walk around spreading it? Once its inhaled, theres no thc. Which is why I laugh at some people inhaling when they shotgun. Yes its possible to get a contact high on your own, if you personally have had your hands all over it.. But not if someone else has been handling it, then shakes someones hand.. So, dont kid YOURSELF.. Kiddo.

                       Contact high has nothing to do with physically touching marijuana!!! Hahaha thats freaking hilarious someone would even think that. The term contact means literally came in contact with. If you are in a room and a blunt is being passed around, yet you choose not to smoke, you CAN still get highthere is active thc in the air.  hence the terminology  contact high. It is burning off of the end of the blunt or pipe or whatever, not every single bit is being inhaled by somebody, duhh! You can smell it cuz its burning, you can get high off of it if you take in enough. Studies HAVE shown that thc IS present in people who have been in the same room as other people who are smoking.

                       Side stream smoke is the only way you could get any sort of second hand smoke type of high. Or affect what so ever.. Which youd literally have to have a straw up the blunt, sucking up the smoke thats coming off the blunt free base .. Which could never even be detected even if you were to do something that lame. So yes, theres the tiniest bit that comes from the blunt, but thats not enough to stick in your system lmfao! But my point still stands.. You CANNOT get high off second hand smoke. Second hand meaning its been inhaled already.. Smh

                       Thats not true, my husband shares with me, he inhales then blows into my mouth so I dont cough so much n I get just as high as him. Not only that but each type of smoking bowl,blunt, vaporizer and bong all deliver a certain amount of thc, the rest isnt absorbed. Besides that your lungs can only process a certain amount. I failed a hair test 3 months after quitting after sharing

                       First off I just want to say I was put onto probation and had to quit smoking. It took me 4 weeks due to me being pretty FAT and I was a heavy user for 5 years. While on probation and tested weekly, I would sit in a car with 5 seats and 4 other were smoking nearly 1/8 (3.5 grams)in one sitting just about every day of the week with all the windows up (hotbox). We sat in the car for approximately an hour each time. Like I said the PISS POLICE tested me every week and not once was I ever dirty after the initial 4 weeks. I chose to sit with them because I enjoy the smell, and let me add I never got contact high. I just wanted to let people know they can be at ease when others are smoking around them. Now if your breathing the smoke thats coming directly out of the bowl (take the pipe and inhale the excess smoke thats burning off it) not just the side stream as mentioned below, I would assume that can make your piss dirty as well. I have three brothers in which have all been on probation and each one sits around while we all smoke and never had been tested dirty, might I add the room gets very smokey in other words hot boxed. With my personal experience you will not be dirty if you breathe second hand smoke.

                       So I smoked weed twice over thanksgiving break. Thursday and Saturday. I took a home drug test from Walgreens 23 days later and the results were negative. I dont really smoke weed. The last time before thanksgiving was about 4-5 before that. I had to take a lab pee test for a company right after I took the home pee test. The results havent come in yet and I have been dying to find out. Should I  be worried?

                       I am in your exact shoes right now.  I smoked a couple times over thanksgiving break and a few times before that.  I took a test my mom swiped from her work (she is a nurse) a week after the last smoke and it was negative.  I just had to take a test for a potential job and still cant shake the feeling that I might not pass.  The reason being is that I take ADHD medication which will show positive and if they do a second test to confirm it will be a more strict test.  My THC will be tested at 20 ng/dl on the second run instead of the normal 50 ng/dl.  I know for sure I will be getting a call from the MRO on the Amphetamines so I will keep you posted.  Let me know what you hear and good luck to you!

                       Naw thats bull, the kid is right. Dnt know what test u were doing but we also ran a test with a doctor and some of us were exposed to heavy amounts of second hand weed smoke and none of us came up positive. Not to mention I han out with people who smoke around me in closed rooms everyday once just before my drug test (no ventilation almost killed me) and I came out negative.

                       Im late to the party but BS information is never too late to dispel. The US Army tried to get soldiers to test positive by putting them in a closed room and basically filling it with second-hand smoke. Guess what? NONE OF THEM TESTED POSITIVE. A contact high is not the same thing as an actual high. Fact. You can work where ever you say you work, its the net, nobody knows for sure if youre blowing smoke or not. And besides, you probably have an agenda to scare people. Get out of here with your lies. You can look up the Army test if you dont believe me. Wheres your data published? Oh wait, its not public. Go away.

                       Actually you can just like from a cigarrette smoke most paint used in houses will absorb much of the chemicals and release them slowly thus the readon you can tell when you enter a smokers house marijuana/ciggarette .

                       Thats bullshit kid. More like its present in such low concentrations in diluted smoke that it has a low absorbance.

                       Actually speaking from experience I failed a test when asked I told them it was from second hand and I was told BY the CLINIC i took the test in that you CANNOT fail a test from 2nd hand smoking.

                       I think thats just mental.. As soon as thc hits your lungs.. Its done. What your goofy asses could be talking about is called side stream smoke which is the smoke that comes off the blunt itself, therefore still containing thc since your lungs didnt absorb it. Youre wrong..

                       See now, your right about one thing After thc is absorbed in the smokers lungs the exhaled smoke is stale BUT what about the smoke coming off of the joint or blunt or bowl thats not being directly inhaled? That still has thc in it. Contact high is hard to get but it is very possible. Im 21 and even I know this lol

                       How stupid can you be?? Have you ever been in close quarters with someone smoking? Probably not. You can get a serious contact high. Go sit in a car with someone who is smoking, bet you will end up with a contact

                       Im 14 and I even know this.  Youre a child and a idiot! Okay little girl, you are very wrong! As a medical doctor, it takes 30-45 days to be clear of THC. As well, THC is not what is tested in urine tests. They look for metabolitesnow you have educated!

                       That  is incorrect.  You still get contact high.  Im 18 and have friends who smoke it, I know this for a fact.  My eyes were bloodshot and I would feel light headed after being around them while smoking.

                       Thats not true. You need to educate yourself. If you deeply inhale and hold it in, the exhaled smoke has little to no thc, cbd or cbn but if you are in a car or a small room with Several individuals who are smoking joints and blunts, they burn when not being smoked and also when you take a large hit the end of the blunt or joint smokes greatly and releases fresh marijuana smoke that contains full amounts of thc, therefore allowing an individual to inhale that Un touched smoke that DOES CONTAIN THC. if the circumstances are right, you can ingest thc second hand and fail a recent urinalysis. Its happened before and itll happen again. Its fact. And you need to educate yourself before spreading bad information please. Thanks.

                   420victim I really need to talk to you. My fianc took a test for her prob officer and she receives 20 days in jail. She is the heaviest smoker Ive ever known and only smoked the best. She quit after she peed dirty. When she went to jail approx 50 days later she peed dirty again and now she is facing serious jail time. I know for a fact that she hadnt smoked in those 50 days and need to probe that it was still in her system. I need factual proof that it is possible for it to be in your system that long. I would appreciate any help we have 3 kids and she has an excellent job for 10 yrs. of shes convicted it will ruin her life. I will even give my phone number if anyone will talk to me about this.  Thanks josh

                     Dont rely on the states testing methods. Take her to an independant lab and pay them to do a real test to measure levels and not just presence. I dont know if this will help now because you have nothing to compaire it to before she went in but a combination of hair, blood, and urine should show active THC, THC metabolite and hopefully how long ago she smoked.

                     Hey there, if your fiance is having trouble burning THC from her system, try using a vitamin supplement called Chromium Picolinate. Although little is really known about it, it still increases metabolic rate (Which helps get rid of THC through metabolizing fats). Also, WORKING OUT! Workout 5 days a week for an hour with about half a mile of running and it will significantly reduce the potency in her. Im a 17 year old male who has smoked for 3 years+. I have an extreme diet and workout routine and have passed tests within 5-10 days, and I smoke around 3 times a week(only when I feel I need a pick-me-up). Avoid sugary foods because that will prevent the THC from being burnt as sugar adds to your fat cells. If she eats good, works out consistently, then she should have no issue passing a test. If it is a hair test then sadly there is NO way to reduce the content of THC, hair samples are there for a period of time and thats it. I hope everything goes well, also green to extract is a very beneficial supplement to have. If youre going to be a stoner is an alcoholic world, you have to be smart and know the short-cuts. Dont waste your money on fake piss or detox products, these are false. No matter how much water you drink or what you drink, it will be there. WORK YOUR BODY, BURN FAT!

                     Oh shit! I just applied for a probation position  today. Ive been a smoker for at least 20 yrs and Ive always worked with children and currently working on a degree in early childhood development. I will be working with children with learning disabilities and children with mental health issues. Ive never had to take a drug test until know!  My father who is a smoker ,but a few months away from retiring  referred the position to me. I thought if i sober up for a month Ill be alright. Im worried now because my father was hired almost 30yrs ago, the hiring process is very difficult and different. Can he get in trouble if I test dirty?  They know he referred me and Im his daughter.  What should I do?

                     I have burned chronically for 30 years am 55 years old and overweight 250 lbs at 62. I stopped and tested myself after 125 days and was still positive! Tried clean outs,herbs, flushing and its all bullshit. Im physically active and take relative good care of myself yet still came back positive. Fellow smoker who was skinny,active,ate healthy took 90 days to piss clean. I got caught with too clear a sample because too much water and Gravity was off.auto fail. Whats funny is I run a 11 mil company for 30 years yet life insurance is fucking me over because of this. Trying again to clean up and still hot after 80 days. Fucking bullshit

                   I was a user for about 14 years. I used about 2-3 times daily. I quit 74 days ago but just took a drug test and came back positive with 24 ng in my system. Ive done everything to try to clean it out of my body. Ive exercised, tried to lose weight, drank lots of water, and even spent $42 on a 2 day detox and cleansing treatment from GNC. Anything you put into your body that is toxic your body tries to fight it off as fast as possible, but it keeps and stores Marijuana? Since this is the case it cannot be that bad for you. Why wont it leave my body? Whatever happened to 30 days? Im so frustrated!

                 Depending on your diet and the amount of exercise and water you consume then it could be gone, or low enough to pass any drugs test  However, to be 100% sure Id say another 2 weeks maybe (I understand that this question was asked 3 months ago)

                 I need someone to please answer this question. I just took a drug test today(its Tuesday) I smoked last Thursday so 5 days ago. Before Thursday I hadnt smoked for 3 weeks  and before that 3 weeks I hadnt smoked for a month. Thursday I smoked like 2 bowls and 2 joints. Im a fairly healthy person i work out all the time and between that 5 day period I took two four mile runs and drank lots of water. I bought a Wal mart Marijuana drug test on Monday and it said I was clean but I dont trust those at all. What do you guys think honestly?

               I do not smoke often at all, once every few months tops, but I did smoke about 2 weeks ago. Im currently looking for a job and scared Ill fail a drug test. I really need some advice of I should be clear or not. Should I air on the side of caution and take an at home test?

                 You may or may not be, it really just depends.  THC stays in your fat, so the less fat you have the better.  Try to do some running, and drink lots of water.

               Hey guys, for anyone who can answer. I have not smoked for 8 weeks now. Prior to that, I was a fairly frequent user. I was smoking a decent amount, i suppose for a month, roughly from thanksgiving to Christmas. Prior to that, I took 7 weeks off. So in the span of 19 weeks, i smoked for about 4 of them. And I have a drug test next week. Would you think Im clean? To give you an idea, Im roughly 61 and 225 lbs.
              </p>

                 Re: subsequent dirty tests when she hasnt smoked in a long time &amp; is supposedly facing jail time as a result if she truly hasnt smoked since originally testing dirty, while she may continue to test dirty for some time due to previous chronic use, the tested levels will go down.  She should only have a problem if the tested levels go up (indicating recent use).  Everyone knows that pot can be detected in previously chronic users for months; so as long as the tested levels continue to decrease, she will be cool.

                 By the way, shot guns are the equivalent of taking hits &amp; so are not the equivalent of 2nd hand smoke.  But, 2nd hand smoke, ESP after continuous exposure, can get you high it may be from non inhaled smoke or whatever, but it happens.  So, face it 14 yr old, sitting with your stoner friends in a car, day after day, with the windows rolled up, will eventually cause you to cop a buzz.  At least get your facts straight before you speak.  Most of us have been in the loop since way before you were born.

               I am a fairly frequent smoker, probably 5 or 6 bowls a day for a few years. Im very skinny (510 135 to 140 lbs) and have a very high metabolism. I eat like a horse and havent gained a pound in 15 or so years. I have a test coming up but will have been clean 28 days by the time I take it. Ive had 4 or 5 good sweats recently and been drinking at least a liter of water daily as well as a gallon of cranberry juice in the past 5 days. Whatcha think, am I good?

               A few year ago I had a urine drugs test, I was so nervous like an idiot I lit up a dooby a few hours before. I panicked again and on route to the drug testing I drank two litres of water. Did the test and passed. I have another today but this is blood. I usually smoke like a joint-3 a day but Iv stopped for about a month. Im female 54 and weigh like 50kg. So Ill let you know if I pass

                 Yesnot worth the chance unless you have a secret desire to go to jail/prison! On probation equals not smoking or drinking or any other conditions of you terms.

               Hi guys,
              </p>
              <p>
               I know this post isnt active anymore for the individual who asked the initial question but I thought Id give some input from my recent experience within drugs testing (urine sample) which took place earlier today. I promised myself that if I passed my drugs test that I would post my story online so that people in similar situations could feel a little reassured and more aware.
              </p>
              <p>
               If youre from the UK or USA the general cut-off for instant urine sample testing is 50ng/ml  Therefore depending on the timescale in which you have until your drugs test, you DO have time to get it out of your system. IGNORE what all of these bloggers say about it taking 45 days or more to get out of your system (this is only true in EXTREME cases. E.g. A morbidly obese individual with a bad diet, does no exercise and is a chronic smoker). I cant speak for everyone but personally, I smoked 3/4 times per week sometimes more, sometimes less I never had a lot to smoke when I did smoke (2-5 joints between 3 people and it wasnt potent weed, just the regular stuff). Im 18 years old, 6ft4 and around 71kg, therefore I have a pretty good metabolism Id say.
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway, I got myself worried sick after finding out I had been assigned a pre-employment medical/drugs test 6 days in advance, I genuinely thought Id stand no chance of passing my drugs test as Id smoked every night for the previous 4 nights prior to the phone call informing me of my drugs test. I struggled sleeping etc purely because of the fact that none of my family members knew I smoked weed and therefore they would obviously be upset, as well as me not getting the job.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, straight away I began by cleanse by drinking 10-12 glasses of water per day (I timed it as 1 glass every hour or so) and although it may sound pretty grim, believe me, it was 100% worth it. I did this for 5 days straight, I also exercised (10 minutes cardio  some heavy lifting) every night, I ate as little sugary/fat foods as I possibly could. I recommend eating healthy cereal such as weetabix, porridge, corn flakes as much as possible and wholegrain/seeded bread with as much fruit as you possible can.
              </p>
              <p>
               I acknowledge the fact that I am fortunate enough to have a fast metabolism, however with a positive mindset and following what I did (more vigorously depending on how much you smoked/your metabolism/your current weight etc) you will stand a very good chance of passing your drugs test!
              </p>
              <p>
               PLEASE IGNORE WHAT THE BLOGS SAY (I RECOMMEND READING MEDICAL JOURNALS WHICH ARE BASED ON PURE FACT)  I LEARNT THE HARD WAY  I WORRIED MYSELF SICK  HOWEVER I AM SO RELIEVED NOW.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another tip, which I am sure most of you have read countless times already is to drink as much water as you can on the day of the drugs test, try to urinate twice or more before your actual drugs test as your morning urination will probably contain the most metabolites. Also, eat something light  dont have a big breakfast/meal (stick to fruit/cereal) and then when you actually have to urinate for the test, urinate a little in the toilet first, then the middle part of your urination into the container and finish it in the toilet as the beginning and end tends to contain the most metabolites. Dont bother buying ANY pills or cleansing kits from the internet, there is NO PROOF that these work. However, if you have the time then Id recommend purchasing a cannabis urine test kit (4 on eBay) and testing yourself as much as you can to test your progress and give you a piece of mind before you take the real one.
              </p>
              <p>
               I hope that my personal experience can help at least one person, Ive tried to put in as much relevant information as possible and all the information I gained took hours and hours of scanning the Internet and reading journals/blogs/etc.
              </p>

               Thanks for reading if you made it this far, I have faith in you all!

               I smoked every day for 11 months consecutively.  On the high end, Id smoke all day, about every hour or two, on the low end maybe just a bowl or two in the evening; either way I never missed a day.  I was able to pass drug urine tests after 27 and 35 days of not smoking in my two years of this study. Advice: sweat everyday, whether its running or lifting weights, just sweat the THC out, and go heavy on drinking water. (Im a Male 510 150lbs)

               I passed my thc test today and the last time i smoke was 12 days ago. I am a very very hardcore smoker for about 3 years. I took pots and at least 5 blunts a day. But right after I stop smoking, I do workout alot and not forget to mention that I am very careful with my diets. I drinks a lot of water too. Just workout, drink a lot and make sure u sweating like helll, right after that keep your finger crossed and do the urine/thc test. U will be fine. Trust me.

               Okay, i have a piss test in 3 days, i stopped smoking yesterday, I weigh 105.9 pounds, and im 56-57, do you think that if i drink lots of water and work out constantly and get a detox method that clears your system in two days would know the stuff out? Im very worried.

               After reading all these posts I am wondering whats the point of smoking this garbage if your busy trying to cover up your truth?? Wheres the integrity in that?
               <br/>
               I dont smoke it Never will.  My mind and job are safe and sound from any drug test.  I know I can sleep well with my truth.

               Hi Im 17 58 150. Im on probation for some hit n run bullshit. I told them I havent blazed since may 10th and the last time I smoked was may 12th they gave me a 30 day grace period. Ive been smoking everyday not sure how much it varies Ive brought a zip to a concert and smoked it before I left, Ive also only smoked a blunt to get to bed. Ive been smoking since I got off po last time and I wanna say that was last December (2012) or January. I also picked up dabbing in June since then Ive been smoking on average .6 a day give or take some depending on the day. How long will It take to get clean ill do just about anything I was charged as an adult so now I dont go to little boy jail anymore instead 90 days in county. Please help.
              </p>

                     No, you dont deserve to go to prison for smoking weed But you do deserve to go because you wont stop smoking for your future They give you a 30day grace period but you still continue to smoke.. That to me is why you deserve to go to prison. Smoking weed is worth more than your freedom, obviously

               Hey Guys. The first step to finding out the truth is disregard everything you have read here. I am a forensic scientist who has actually performed drug testing and most of this information is mainly speculation and is based on nothing. There are several ways to test for marijuana/drugs, and they all have an extremely low power of detection. Gas Chromatography is sensitive to points per trillion, and can be used on hair, urine, and blood. Disregard information about fat content. Yes, marijuana is fat soluble and therefore is stored in fat, but there is fat inside your bones and in your organs, not just under the skin. If you want more reliable information on the subject, check out google scholar, not google. Apply this to everything you want to learn. The best way to not fail a drug test is to not use illicit substances. Im sorry if this isnt what you wanted to hear.

               hi, I smoked weed 8 days ago, and I hadnt smoked over 5 months. They did a random drug test today at work and to my luck they picked me. Right after work I went to a lab to take a instant urine drug test and the lady told me that I came up negative. I also took one of those drug tests that sell at the pharmacy and also came up as negative what are my chances of testing positive on the lab test????

                 If I was you, I wouldnt get your hopes up Youve been smoking for 4 years? You need ATLEAST 28 days The only thing I think could help you is drinking a lot of cranberry juice. But I doubt that will work since youve been smoking so long

                   My bro pissed for 2 years on probation and smoked every day up to the test except that day. All he did was drank lots of water and mafe sure he pissed numerous times before his test piss. No food and only water, passed every time and I myself witnessed it.

                 Go to the drug store and self testWhy are people on this forum not commenting on the efficacy of drug store tests verses the outcomes of their formal testing?  Good information for all asking these questions.

               I see a lot of comments asking about how long it will stay in your system. The article above says:
               <br/>
               On the other hand, studies have shown that regular users can test positive (20 ng/ml limit) for THC metabolites for up to 46 consecutive days following marijuana usage. In an extreme case, a heavy cannabis user of more than 10 years was able to test positive (20 ng/ml limit) for up to 67 days after last being exposed to marijuana.
              </p>
              <p>
               Im pretty sure until a little more time passes, research will have been done in CO, or it needs to be done, which will illustrate a huge range of weights and smoking frequency. It could even be a chart that we someday just Google and can easily answer this question. Its a matter of missing research. The best way that we can help understand its metabolism is to continue to talk about experiences with drug testing. The above information seems the most credible and logical that I have seen. I have looked this topic up over and over. I wish relative terms like heavy were more stringently defined. As far as detoxes, I only know of one that worked before a test, but I also understand that tests are getting smarter since the time he tested 9 years ago. The easiest way for me to treat it in the end is to acknowledge that smoking pot is a lifestyle choice. I really enjoy smoking, but after being forced to quit, I didnt feel as different as I expected. In the end, I believe pot staying the above listed 46 days and varying upward based on extremity of regular use, i.e. pipe bowls vs. bong bowls. Like nicotine, the amount of intoxicant absorbed is relative to the depth of the inhale. Varying concentrations of THC also need further study. The difference between dank vs. mids and specifying strains, cultivation processes, etc. one aspect that definitely needs further study is pesticide use.

                 You should be clean after 21-30 days from july 11 session maybe give yourself a few extra days for peace of mind.

               I havent smoked since pregnant but now Ive had my baby (5 mths old) Id love to have a cone again. Is it safe to smoke while breastfeeding? What if I smoke and substitute with a bottle feed for a few hours? If its not safe Ill wait until I finish breastfeeding in a few more months.

                 Personally, I would hold off  the simple answer is that it really isnt known what sorts of things could happen Nothing solid out there about how long it would stay in your milk either Id think, though if you pumped and dumped and subbed for a week or so depending, there probably wouldnt be any in your milk, or your urine (especially if it is just a one time ordeal)  Not very concrete or conclusive tests have been done, there are a lot of contradicting opinions out there on the web, as Im sure youve probably sifted through some. It is known though, that the drug does pass very easily into breast milk, and infants feeding from mothers that have smoked, test positively for it. It has the potential to decrease your milk production, and have also read in several places that it can cause the baby to be really sleepy, and on one, mentioned that it could increase the risk of SIDS  Hope that helps!

                 Anything you digest transmits to your child via breast feedinganything and everything down to spicy foods. Be smart and do not contaminate your breast milk  baby first always.

               About a year ago I had weekly drug tests for court. I weighed roughly 275 pounds at the time. Good amount of body fat. Smoked daily, several times, a day. I was clean in 28 days. For urine tests, sweat like a motherfucker (dripping/soaked) and lots of water.

               i have been clean now for months, had an instant drug test a week ago and came out negative. I smoked 3-4 times since then and i just found out that i will have another instant urine test in 12 days. Would i be clean if i drank a lot of water and exercised? i smoked altogether about 0.6g not even more than a gram.

               Yea no shit qui ripping the 14 year old and answer the effing questions. I give the lil guy props for having an opinion. But unless you are locked in a closet with fifteen do oboes being smoked at once your chances of failing from contact are slim. But on the other hand it still is possible. Thc is very freaking tricky. If youre skinny and dont eat (just to be safe) I give you a week.(non smoker). But if youre skinny and smoke like a chimney then I give you a month and a half. Bigger ppl and non smokers I say two weeks. And bigger avid smokers two months. Not a scientific response just a guy that says better safe than sorry mates. I dont smoke really but just found some knockout had to try it so I puffed it a few times. Regret it now  but yea no one really knows. Peace yall. #wannagethigh

               30 days clean and still failing UA-put into intensive outpatient for relapse***
              </p>
              <p>
               I have been clean since about July 26th 2014, give or take 2
               <br/>
               days. I had a UA with about 188 ng/ml after my 2nd week of alcohol treatment,
               <br/>
               which I knew i would fail as it had only been a couple weeks since i quit. I
               <br/>
               totally expected to be cleared up with the next one. So, 30 days later I do a
               <br/>
               UA and fail again. This one comes back at about 80 ng/ml (8-19-2014). Now this
               <br/>
               is very confusing, and to them I have no defense in this and I just got bumped
               <br/>
               to Intensive Outpatient. Of course, they dont believe me at all, but i have
               <br/>
               not smoked a dang thing since starting treatment. It sounds to me that if in a
               <br/>
               month my THC level cut in half, then in 3-4 more weeks it would be clean. The
               <br/>
               treatment agency says that isnt possible and they and the LAB know all the
               <br/>
               science and it says i used after I started treatment!! I didnt know where to
               <br/>
               go for any advice so im just looking anywhere I can online. It seems like a
               <br/>
               bunch of BS advice everywhere. Any Suggestions? Here is some back info.

               So I have to go to a clinic and take a pee test for my job. I smoked regularly for about a year to 2 years 2 to 3 times a day, taking breaks of couple weeks to a month every now and then. The last time I smoked was on the 4th where I smoked one regular bowl with a friend. Today is the 15th if tomorrow I take the pee test will I pass ? I am 18 with high metabolism and only weigh 125lbs.

               i never have smoked pot before. I am 26 years old and i smoked for the first time sunday. There were 3 of us hitting it. we smoked one before we left for our destination and about an hour later we smoked the other one. The last one had chronic in it. (not sure how much but it did) so my question is, how long will it stay in my system? i am roughly 210-215 lbs at 51 tall.

               I think the best answer to this is just dont smoke or ingest THC if you want to be sure to pass a drug test. Otherwise youre putting yourself at risk to either not get a job you want or lose a job you have.

                 Excercise and lots of water will be your best friends between then. Since its your first time and with just one joint, youll be fine.

               I was an excessive smoker, smoked the really good stuff for over 3 years strait, and reggie for 9 years before that. Id say I probably smoked 3-5 times a day on the good stuff and 5-8 times a day with the reggie. I have been smoke free for 84 days now. I failed a urine test after 45 days so I figured I would give myself 75 days. I did a lot of cardio and strength training exercises since I quite almost 3 months ago, lost 25lbs! Feel great and had high spirits so today(day 84) I went to purchase a First Check home urine test for marijuana.and its still positive! Speechless.trying to figure out how to get rid of this crap! Any other ideas out there besides giving it more time? Wish this country would just decriminalize this stuff already!

               So i really need some help
               <br/>
               I have been smoking for about 3 years. nearly everyday, used to be 3 times a day but for the past 6 months its only been once a day. the past week i have slowed down to only when i feel like it which was about every other day. i stopped on Wednesday because i have a medical test next week for the reserves (Military). so am i completely f**ked? i kept doing it because i thought i was already screwed, but i snapped myself out of it and wanted to be clean. this is a huge huge deal to me. im really really worried. i just really hope maybe someone has a real idea on how i can get it out of my system just for the day at least. i know what everyone says to dilute it and drink lots of water and all that stuff but i dont know if it will really work. i just wish there was something, anything that will give me a big chance of success. even if i have to order something. if anyone can help its really appreciated.
               <br/>
               if it helps i have a very high metabolism and dont weigh much at all!

               Was clean for 2 months then ate one brownie and smoked a joint, then 2 weeks later smoked another joint. Used to be a heavy user before I quit then I was clean for 2 months. Then just wanted to relive old times. How long you think it will be in my system?

               Im not an avid smoker i smoke occasionally. But over the last 3 months i have smoked maybe once or twice and i have a hair test coming up. Ive read that those can see back as far as 3 months, but ive also read that they dont pick up one or two time uses but they look more for all the time use. So just curious if i should be worried or not any info would be appreciated.

               Second hand smoke is real guys. Depending on how much you take in, your lungs may or may not absorb it all. If you put 2 grams in a bong and did it all in 1 hit,  you would not absorb all the THC. Theres a certain max capacity that the lungs can absorb. Im not saying that you would get super high, but there is THC left over depending. My 2 cents.

               I quit smoking about three months ago. Didnt start smoking heavy till this past summer but was a light smoker for about a year before that. But i havent smoked for about three months. My friends smoke around me and I just helped clean a pot plant. Is it possible that I will pee dirty for my p.o meeting in 2 days?

               Im on probation,
               <br/>
               If Ive been clean since July (its December 11, 2014 currently), and decide to smoke once (as in a few hits), will I be clean quickly enough for my next PO visit? Im a big guy, 220+ lbs.
               <br/>
               Other words, Im clean, if I smoke, will it be out of my system in a week or few days OR stay in my system for a month?
               <br/>

               I used to smoke like maybe once or twice maybe sometimes three times a day but not everyday. Probably like 3-4 days out the week. I havent smoked for like 3 weeks do you think I would pass a urine test? I weigh about 125 and my metabolism is pretty fast. And I have been working out a little bit. And drinking plenty of fluids. Any thoughts???

I came across series of testimonies about this particular spell caster.

After reading all these,I decided to give papa a try. I contacted him via email and explained my problem to him. In just 3 days, my husband came back to me.

               As a chronic smoker of almost 20 years, getting arrested for less then half a gram after an anonymous call to the police,  I tested positive after 93 days of NOT smoking marijuana with a standard  urine stick test.  It had metabolized in my system, and I had to run to an urgent care to get a blood test, to prove at I had no marijuana in my system, only after I was told to wait for a warrant for my arrest.  Oh wait, that was a crooked probation officer who said I tested positive when in fact I was not allowed to see the urine being tested.  Most times, if a person is on probation or something that requires regular testing, I suggest that you request blood draws to prove the levels are lessening.

               So, heres my dilemma.  As much as I love the green stuff shes outta my life for awhile to come.  I either have a d-test Dec. 30th or Jan 8th.
               <br/>
               I was heavy smoker again for about 5 years, after I took a year off (08-09).  Was completely clean.  Then went on a 5 year bend of just smoking pretty hard in the evenings after work.  In August/September/October, I cut back heavily.  The amount, the potency and time.  In fact Id go clean for about 3 weeks at a time each month, then smoke lightly for a week.  I quit permanently from Oct. 21-Dec. 2nd.  During a night of drinking on Dec. 2nd, I slipped up and took 4 hits.  I coulda had more, but I stopped myself mid-pipe and said shit, no, got d-testing coming up in  month or so.  Ive been clean ever since.  Im pretty sure I should be fine.  My metabolism is pretty fast.  Im 230, but not a lot of fat and tall.  Probably will do a checker before.
               <br/>
               I know were all here looking for an answer that nobody knows, but I dont think I should have too much trouble.

               Look I smoked one hit of weed. If that even. And my levels are tested. Not a panel test. I tested 4 days after. I have been clean for two years prior. Will this cause my levels to be able to be detected 4 days after I smoked one hit of weed after being clean for two years Im 511 and 160 in weight. Please answer me

               I smoked every day for a week straight ending today.  I have a urine test at the end of the month at Quest Diagnostics for my return to work.  I am wondering if I will pass.  I am very very active.  I train jiu jitsu at least 5 times a week, also weight train 4 or 5 days a week as well.  I am 19% body fat and drink plenty of water.  Anyone else ever have something similar like this happen

               I used to smoke a lot for about 3 years of college then took a hiatus of a couple weeks and went on vacation and smoked again a decent bit. It has now been 54 days since I last smoked Im 61 210 and was wondering if I would pass urine test? In that span of 54 days I have been exercising &amp; running as well. Roughly 4-5 days out of the week. Would I pass?

               I am what would be considered a chronic user I smoke every day I have had it happen twice now where I have only not smoked for 2 or 3 days and the pee test came up clean. I was very confused as to how that happened especially after it happened a second time so I tried to do some research on it. I found a couple sources saying that in rare occurrences some chronic users had it out of their system extremely faster than most people. It makes some sense just because I have realized that the high does not stay in affect as long for me even half as long as when I have smoked with a friend, usually for most people it is a couple hours and for me its an hour tops. It seemed as if not enough research was done as to ascertain why though. I am to this day curious what is different about my body or the way it works as to where I have had that happen multiple times I would just think it would be interesting to have a more in depth study done and to find someone that has had this happen as well to use for such a study. With most people taking a month or more I just do not understand what makes my situation different.

               I have a question that everyone is going to laugh at.  Four days ago I was on a date.  My date blew about three puffs of weed, nice grade, into my mouth I took a really good drag and either two or three more small puffs.  Killer point, it was peer pressure.  I hadnt smoked in 349 days.  If I get tested for a job this week will I be okay?

               So Ive been a heavy pot user for over 20 years. My Dr said that there should be no sign of pot in my system within one month. The problem is that its been 26 days and wants me to test today. I know that it can stay in my system for over 2 months. He has told me that if my urine doesnt test clean that he will take my greatly need pain medication away. I have chronic pain and have for years. Hes the only Dr. that has given me problems with my pot smoking. Yesterday I used Rescue Detox Ice. Its supposed to be an instant cleansing product. It says not to eat or drink anything for 3 hours before drinking this product, then drink the rescue detox 17FL. OZ. Then drink 2 times that in water 32 FL. OZ. Within a half an hour. Then not to eat or drink for 3 hours after consumption. I took a home THC test this morning and its positive. Even after peeing like a race horse last night. I followed the instructions to a T and Im screwed, taking two tests this morning. So APPLIED SCIENCES LLC DID NOT WORK! I have to take my test this morning and Im going to test positive. Meaning my Dr will Not prescribe my pain medication. Does anyone know what I can do to get this out of my system?!?

               I never smoked marijuana in my life but I tested positive for marijuana yesterday at probation which I am on probation for a totally different reason they said they would send it off to a lab so why would I yest positive if I never smoked it.

               I used to smoke a joint at night, it was a better muscle relaxer for ms than anything Id ever been prescribed by prescription.  Seven weeks ago I decided that I want off all ms meds due to concerns about side effects, some are worse than the ms.  After seven weeks without the bedtime joint Im feeling good, even without the ms drugs.  Ive been told the ms drugs are no longer in my system but I wonder if the marijuana still is.  I feel great and would be excited to find out that with zero drugs on board, Im great.  Is it possible to still have the weed on board and IG so, would that give me a false sense of well being?

               Hey I need help , really fast metabolism , work out daily , had medicinally for extreme anxiety for about a year but only around .3-.5 a day ( around my bongs head filled with ground up erb). Recently shared a small jay with a buddy because Id only had 15 hours of sleep in 6 days due to anxiety , had been clean for a week and a day How long until it passes through my system ? Quite small with healthy liver , like 8-10% body fat and not much muscle.Im getting tested Thursday (its saturday had Friday night) want to know if it will pass if I detox and workout a lot , and Ill drink lots of water before the test ( standard shitty dipstick test that we have to just piss in a polystyrene cup and they put a piece of litmus in) thanks!

               I just found out I am preggers 5 days ago and of course, stopped smoking immediately. I have been a chronic smoker, 2-3 joints a day, for nearly 15yrs, only stopping for work related screens. 54, 200lbs. I am scared to go to MD as I dont want to have a positive screen at MD office. How long will it take to get out of our systems? Will I have to wait until the 2nd trimester to see my MD? Im a healthcare worker and my MD is at my job so theres many strings attached.

               Hey guys!
              </p>
              <p>
               Im about 62 and 210 pounds, and a heavy user( smoking for around 4 years with gaps of 2 months a year). I have a test in about 1.5-2 months, and was wondering what I should do to make an attempt to pass it? I stopped smoking about a few days back and have started exercising vigourously.
               <br/>
               Thanks!

               I just smoked an eighth this weekend and just found out i may be susceptible to a piss test soon. How long will this take to get out of my system? I have an extremely fast metabolism, not much body fat, and have been drinking lots of water, prune and cranberry juice. I used to smoke 3-4 times daily about 3 weeks before i smoked this weekend. Anyone know when i will be good for my test?

               Hello everyone! I just would like to give my experience to how long the psychoactive chemical (THC) stays in your system. Im currently in the military and an occasional to frequent smoker to help my appetite. I usually smoke around a bowl to three bowl packs of weed every other week, sometimes more. I also occasionally smoke d2e(aka spice) around 2-3 hits every day! I knew i had a drug test(urine) coming up on the upcoming saturday so I stopped smoking weed on Monday and then stopped smoking spice on Wednesday. Which gave me a few days to clear my system. Im 62 around 160lbs, and i spent the next few days taking 2 glasses of cranberrry juice everyday, as well as 2 glasses of water, 1 cranberry pill after each meal and 2 niacin pills everyday. I passsed my test, so its certainly possible. Hoped this helped, Good Luck and happy smoking!!

               Havent smoked or been exposed to THC for 52 days now and still test positive, using professional urine dip testers I purchased online. I am 65 and 345 lbs. I smoked every night for almost a year, but not during the day at all. I may or may not have to test for a new job, not even sure if I got the job, but have been proactive by testing myself. Thought the THC would be long gone after nearly 2 months, but I dont exercise or eat well so I just wanted to confirm that depending on certain factors, you can still test positive after a long time

               Dont know if this will get answered but I wanted to know how long it will take for someone who has not smoked for the last 4 months and did 3 bong rips and some puffs on about 5 joints and has been casually working out, drinking about 2 water bottles worth of water a day and some cranberry juice for the thc to leave the system?

               If I was clean, smoked weed, and then took a test and showed up clean, and then smoked again 2 weeks later, am I more likely to not pass? Btw I am about 110 lbs, 55 and drink plenty of water and excessive regularly.

               I only smoked it once and took one big hit.  Felt sick for 4 days. Weed is a drug so its very bad.  Best choice is to not do it.

               Needing help!! I was recently diagnosed with Adult ADHD and my Dr said that he is going to test me for THC, and if the test comes back positive he wont give me my scripts. I have been an avid smoker for 4+ years (3-4 times a day/night) since my appointment  (two weeks ago) I havent smoked at all =/ in fear that I wont get the meds I need. My next appointment isnt for another 2 and a half weeks will this be enough time for the THC to clear my system? Im 25 53.5 and 155 lbs.
               <br/>
               Help please!?!

               Hey Dr. Carlos. I was a regular smoker of about 4-5 days a week for a couple of years. I quit 6-7 weeks ago. But, about a week and a half ago I fell off the wagon and shared a blunt w a friend one drunken night and havent smoked since. Now I have a urine drug test in  7-8 days. Is there any chance Ill pass? Im a male 62, 230lbs definitely some fat on me but not crazy heavy just belly fat.
               <br/>
               Also, I have qcarbo with eliminex that I used successfully in the past, but this time the job is in the medical field and I feel like they may have a more legitimate and precise drug screening process and Im afraid the cleanse may show up as a masking agent even though its worked great for me before.
               <br/>
               Thanks for any help you can provide.

               I smoked for the first time in months about 6 weeks ago. Both by a brownie and a joint. I need to take a drug test in 6 weeks, meaning itll be just under 90 days. How likely is it that I will test positive for a hair test?
               <br/>
               Prior to 6 weeks ago I smoked 6 months before that.

               I know Im late to the party, but I have a 15 ng/ml drug test coming up on Thursday, I am 60 days smoke free but I had been smoking for 2 years daily before I stopped. I have exercised 2-4 times a week and I am 66 225 pounds with some body fat. I passed a 20 ng/ml drug test about 4 days ago but will I make the cutoff for 15? If someone could answer that would be awesome!

               <br/>
               Im 410 and have been smoking every day for about 9 months. Im about 140lbs maybe? A bit chunky but not too heavily overweight. I dont smoke multiple times a day but will smoke some potent stuff over the course of an evening. I have a urine drug test in early August. I want to enjoy the last few weeks of my semester which ends may 12 but Im wondering if I should start my regimen sooner then that. I had been planning on doing heavy cardio and weight lifting to not only get clean but to loose some of my school weight. Im wondering if I i had 80 days to get clean if itl be enough with tons of water and exercise daily and a 9 month smoking history. Please respond! Thank you!!

               I smoked and consumed edibles pretty frequently from last December until April 26th. Since then, I have been clean. Im a pretty active guy with a pretty fast metabolism, 510, 175 lbs, athletic build. Will I be okay for a urine test next week? And what can I do between now and then to help the results to be in my favor?

               I used to be a heavy smoker (at least once a day) but i quit exactly two months ago. I also ate a lot of edibles right before i quit for good. I got really drunk and took a few hits just the other day. I may have a drug test in 1 to 2 weeks. Will i be fine if i work out a lot and drink a lot of water? I am 55 at 115 lbs and have an extremely fast metabolism. Please help!

               Hi Dr. Carlos Mitchell.. Writing from Derbyshire in the UK. I was banned from driving last year for driving under the influence(Alcohol) Ive been clean of all alcohol for over 6 months now but have been a heavy cannabis smoker since 15 (Im now 29). when i say heavy, i mean maybe 3.5g per day. My question is.. I have to sit a medical examination and have a blood test with my doctor before i can reapply for my license, how long should i leave it before doing this? Ive not yet stopped smoking. I weigh 11 stone (154LBS), am just under 6 foot tall, Quite skinny and have a very fast metabolism. Im not very active and probably dont drink enough water. Thankyou
              </p>

               Hi, I am going to be given a drug test for an internship. I am unsure as to whether the test will be blood or urine. The last time I smoked was over a month ago (End of March) and I only took a few hits. Prior to that I was hardly smoking at all (less than a month). I dont even know when the test will be but I want to feel confident that I will test clean. Do you think I will be okay?

               Hi Doctor, I smoked almost daily from August 2014-January 2015. I stopped from February 2015 to March 20, then smoked daily for one week (until March 27), then stopped for one week. I then started smoking daily again (just under 1g per day) for over two weeks, from April 6 to April 22. I have not smoked since. In short, I smoked daily for 3 weeks out of the month before I stopped on April 22, after quitting for almost 2 months before that.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have a pre-employment urine test on May 20 or May 21, putting me at around 4 weeks since I last smoked. I am 21 years old, 511 and weigh about 175 lbs. My body fat is roughly 20%, give or take 3%. I would say I have an average metabolism.
              </p>
              <p>
               Am I cutting it close? If so, when should I have started drinking lots of water, cranberry juice, exercising, etc. in order to ensure my system is clear?
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks!

               Dr. Mitchell. I started smoking around end of March a couple times a week until May 5th. I stopped smoking after May 5th but will have a drug test at the end of may. I am a heavy girl 56 and weigh 280lbs. I have started drinking lots or water and cranberry juice. How do you think my odds are to passing this drug test?

               I smoked for a little less than a year. I would say 4-5 time a day. Not whole joints but maybe whole bowls a small one at that but I would smoke till I was good. I quit I think in March or April. Before that I hadnt smoke for over a year. I exercise everyday but I dont have the fastest metabolism and Ill need to pass a test soon. How long do u think I have left? Normally I was told it takes anywhere from 3 months or longer but I dont think il have that long.

               hi doc, I stopped smoking for a full month (used to some twice a week) and as soon as the month was over I smoked about 8 puffs off a blunt. This was 9 days ago and I have a test in 2 days. Am I good? I have been somewhat active and weigh about 160 and 57. My parents are taking me to a urine test facility. Thanks!

               Hello,
              </p>
              <p>
               I stopped smoking 2 1/2 weeks ago, after about a year of regular usage.  I took a home test this morning without dilution and passed it.  I have heard rumors of passing home tests but failing the lab tests.  Any thoughts or suggestions?  My test is in 2 days.  Im female 55 160pounds.  Thank you!

               I am 56 125lbs I smoked last weekend three or so blunts with 4 or 5 people and then smoked on a fat blunt for three days after. It has now been 5 days since I quit. I have not been around any second hand. I havent exercised but the weather is very warm and I have gotten sweaty. I have kept myself well hydrated all five days. Mainly water, lemonade and tea. I am done smoking because I need a good job. I went job searching today and surprise surprise I got an interview tomorrow. I did not expect that to happen quite so soon. The test will not be done that day but I expect it to follow shortly after. The last time I took a test I passed after 2 1/2 weeks of being clean after heavy use. What are my chances???

               I
               <br/>
               was offered my dream job and today I went into HR to fill out
               <br/>
               paperwork. At this time, I was told that I would have to carry out a
               <br/>
               drug test within the next hour (they called ahead as I left the
               <br/>
               building). I am nervous because I was not expecting a drug test today
               <br/>
               and I did not drink much water, flush my system, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               I live with my boyfriend who smokes almost everyday, so Im exposed
               <br/>
               to second hand smoke. I also took one-two drags from his vaporizer about
               <br/>
               8 days ago, but had not smoked in months before this. I hardly ever
               <br/>
               smoke, and never more than a few drags. After taking the test, I fell
               <br/>
               into a bout of paranoia and took a store bought THC test, which came
               <br/>
               back negative.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, I also ate an everything bagel (with poppy seedsopiates)
               <br/>
               yesterday, and was taking amoxicillin up until 5 days ago (I heard this
               <br/>
               drug can test false-positive for cocaine).
              </p>
              <p>
               I am 52 102 lbs. fairly active with a thin build.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is the likelihood of me passing this drug test?
               <br/>
               Thanks for your help.

               I have been clean for about 65 days now and I have a drug test tomorrow morning. I need to know if I will be clean. I have only smoked about 4 times and each time I smoked about a bowl. Will I be okay for a drug test?

               Am Gracie Robert Norman from Utah and It is a privileged for me to share with you about a bountiful healing concerning my Colorectal cancer. i wouldnt have believed that i would someday share my survival from Colorectal cancer with anyone because cancer place a total misery to my life. I bless that faithful day i went online in search of help and i found my Mrs Ellen Bates which educated more about Rick Simpson great medication oil which I had to choice to but to give it a try:
               <a href="mailto:cancermedicationcentre@gmail.com">
                cancermedicationcentre@gmail.com
               </a>
               who helped me via his email to defeat cancer that had almost sucked life out of me with his cannabis oil which was as effective as he said it was. I will also like to use this medium to appreciate Rick and his team:
               <a href="mailto:cancermedicationcentre@gmail.com">
                cancermedicationcentre@gmail.com
               </a>
               for his care, support and of course his cannabis oil because ibwould have been history if not for Rick Simpson discovery which is the world greatest Hero of the 21 century. i am so happy that i could remain with my beloved daughter Juliet who would have been left alone in this world.
               <br/>
               Thanks you so much Sir and God will bless you more.

               5 11 145 lbs. Im a fairly regular smoker, usually 1-2 times a day for the past 4, a few times a week for 5 months before that. Ive been clean for two weeks, and I had a standard blood screening today. Very little exercise, no form of detox. It wasnt a specific test, but it was for a wide range of possibilities. Kidney, liver, appendix, gallbladder, white and red cell count, viruss, etc. Should I be worried? If at all possible I need to know within a few days.

               Dr Carlos. I went to see my PO on the June 3rd and she didnt test me. I normally smoke heavy for a year now, but always stop 10-14 days before I see her. I smoked for 3 more days after I saw her this and then she called and told me she forgot to test me, I stopped smoking on that friday the 5th and drank alot of water before seeing my po today the 16th, to test. They said they had to send my urine out to the lab and that has never happened before. Do you think I failed? Im 62 and I weigh 211lbs.

               dear doctor just asking for your opinion, i smoked weed for a long time up until January this year then gave it up, i have been all around Australia and Asia so due to a lot of adventuring i have been sweating a lot and also drinking a lot of water.
               <br/>
               I just found out recently that i have to go for a medical this coming Sunday but smoked half a joint 3 weeks ago.
               <br/>
               i still drink a lot of water, Im physically fit although its been a few months since i have been to the gym due to traveling but i did used to go 3-4 times a week.
               <br/>
               i sort of quit smoking cigarettes in April but have had a couple since then.
               <br/>
               also i went to a festival last weekend and there was a bit of weed smoking going on around me.
               <br/>
               i have a urine test on Sunday, do i have a chance at passing it do you think?
               <br/>
               thanks for your help

               I had an edible about a month ago, and thats the only thing Ive ever done in my life. But I got pretty high. I was throwing up pretty much the whole day. I have a hair folicle test coming up within the next week, do I have a chance at passing since that was my first time using.

               Lol, third hand high.  3rd hand smoke only applies to cigarettes and mostly to babies who crawl on the floor and put their fingers in their mouths.  2nd hand exposure to weed does exist though, but mostly only in confinded areas.

               Dr. Carlos Mitchell, I was needing your advice. I have been clean for almost 2 months, and my last test came out negative. Before those 2 months I smoked every day for about 7 years. I smoked today, about 2 blunts of low grade, and I know it was a bad choice but I had been drinking and was convinced.My next drug test is in 28 days exactly. Do you think I will be clean by then just by not smoking anymore? Or should I do anything to help me get clean faster.. its not a test for a company, all I know is its a 12 panel UA. I imagine they send to a lab. Any advice is appreciated.
              </p>

               Dr. Carlos, I ate a 10mg piece of chocolate edible today and had one last week as well.  I tried Thc edibles for my PTSD.  That is the only time I have had anything in my system.  I dont smoke for it burns my lungs I am 510 and 220lb.  Athletic/muscular but have a small belly.  How long will edibles stay in my system?  Rough idea?

               Dr. Mitchell,
               <br/>
               I have smoked pretty much daily for the past two years or so. 130lb, 57, 9%bf and very active in cardio sports (3-5 days a week, high intensity). Usually 5-6 hits out of a one-hitter at night of higher grade weed; an eighth would usually last me three weeks to a month. I (very) occasionally did concentrates but that was several months ago. I havent smoked in eight days and will be tested in probably about 10 days. What do you think my chances are of passing? Any suggestions? Im guessing it will be a 50 cutoff as it is for a new job?

               Dr Mitchell, I am 5ft 10 285 lbs. Overweight but with a lot of mass as well (former powerlifter).
              </p>
              <p>
               I smoked for the first time in a year in the beginning of June a d then smoked a lot at a  weekend long party three weeks later. Im not overly concerned about the first one, but the second was a week ago.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a job I want to apply for Next week. Between the application process and potential testing, I can picture the test being three weeks post smoke.
              </p>
              <p>
               so again, heavy use but isolated.

               dear dr. carlos Mitchell, I am a 53 year old male and have been smoking strong pot for about 90 days. I just found out I will be tested on july21, smoking heavily btw. if I fail, they will stop writing my meds(clonopin). any thoughts, panic attacks cripple me and I have stopped smoking. I hope its not too late.

               I smoked 2 grams 2 days before a drug test for a job and had no problem here is why I 0.5 grams stays in ur system for no more then 24 hours if ur not a frequent user  but if u drink at least 2 gallons of water a days put a few blankets over u and and do push up or sit ups as much as u can till to basically are dripping sweat and I mean it needs to be dripping off ur face it will be gone from ur system. u are working ur metabolism a lot harder then when u do nothing all day so if u push ur metabolism to the max it will make u pee more and flush everything out. it also exits ur body through sweat so with the combination of peeing every hours and all that sweat it will leave ur body.when my friends and I were on probation we would do this smoke a few grams once a week then work out everyday to stay clean it works trust me but I dont recommend doing this if u dont have to this is just for those who happen to find out they have a drug test comin up and are in deep shit

               Hey doctor mitchell. I smoked for the first time in 3 months about 4 days ago. Before the three months i was smoking daily a lot if that matter. I only took about 3 or 4 hits but i was definately high. I wanna smoke again but i need to be good to pass a drug test in 2 or 3 weeks. Im 511 150 pounds pretty slim but i do have a lil fat. Just wondering what your thoughts are on how long it would take to be clean for a piss test if now and if i did smoke again if i hydrated boosted my metabolism with fish oil and sweated alot .

               Three days ago, I smoked weed for the first time I took two hits, the first time, I did not inhale. I have a potential drug test this week (four days after smoking) will I pass???? I am female, 54 and about 215
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, how long will THC remain in my system if I have neighbors who are avid smokers (we live in apartments that are poorly ventilated) Prior to my smoking incident three days ago, this is my only exposure to THC, will it show up in my system at all?

               104 days.  Thats fd up.  I know when I stopped in 2012 on March 1st, it took over 120 to 140 days for me to pee cleanly.  I couldnt believe how long it took!  I bought a ton of home testing kits.  I didnt bother to test myself after the first 40 days.  Day 42, I was still dirty.  I tested day 60, still dirty, day 90, etc.  I started taking Milk Thistle and Coriander pills, by day 145ish, finally, FINALLY, I was able to produce a clean sample.  Then I loaded up my own clean urine for storage.  Then all of the other jobs didnt require tests!  WTF?! LOL!  I have a new job coming up.  I quit smoking in mid-May.  It is now early July, I know Im not clean.  My body loves to hang on to THC.  Gee whiz!  I havent wasted money on test kits, because I know Im still dirty, like the poor person below who stopped for 104 days and didnt pass.  That sucks.  Thats why when people say 30 days  thats BS.  30 days if you smoked one fn time in your life, then sure.
