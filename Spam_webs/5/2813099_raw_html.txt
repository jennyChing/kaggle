       Rastafari is a movement of Black people who know Africa as the birthplace of Mankind and the throne of Emperor Haile Selassie I -- a 20th Century Manifestation of God who has lighted our pathway towards righteousness, and is therefore worthy of reverence.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Rastafari movement grew out of the darkest depression that the descendants of African slaves in Jamaica have ever lived in -- the stink and crumbling shacks of zinc and cardboard that the tattered remnants of humanity built on the rotting garbage of the dreadful Dungle on Kingston's waterfront. Out of this filth and slime arose a sentiment so pure, so without anger, so full of love, the Philosophy of the Rastafari faith.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Freedom of Spirit, Freedom from Slavery, and Freedom of Africa, was its cry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religions always reflect the social and geographical environment out of which they emerge, and Jamaican Rastafarianism is no exception: for example, the use of marijuana as a sacrament and aid to meditation is logical in a country where a particularly strain of herb grows freely. Emerging out of the island of Jamaica in the later half of this century, the religious/political movement known as Rastafarianism has gained widespread exposure in the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rasta, as it is more commonly called, has its roots in the teachings of Jamaican black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who in the 1930s preached a message of black self empowerment, and initiated the Back to Africa movement. Which called for all blacks to return to their ancestral home, and more specifically Ethiopia. He taught self reliance at home and abroad and advocated a back to Africa consciousness, awakening black pride and denouncing the white man?s eurocentric woldview, colonial indoctrination that caused blacks to feel shame for their African heritage. Look to Africa, said Marcus Garvey in 1920, when a black king shall be crowned, for the day of deliverance is at hand. Many thought the prophecy was fulfilled when in 1930, Ras Tafari, was crowned emperor Haile Selassie 1 of Ethiopia and proclaimed King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and the conquering lion of the Tribe of Judah. Haile Selassie claimed to be a direct descendant of King David, the 225th ruler in an unbroken line of Ethiopian Kings from the time of Solomon and Sheba. He and his followers took great pride in being black and wanted to regain the black heritage that was lost by loosing faith and straying from the holy ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rastafarians live a peaceful life, needing little material possessions and devote much time to contemplating the scriptures. They reject the white mans world, as the new age Babylon of greed and dishonesty. Proud and confident Rastas even though they are humble will stand up for their rights. Rastas let their hair grow natually into dreadlocks, in the image of the lion of Judah. Six out of ten Jamaicans are believed to be Rastafarians or Rastafarian sympathizers. The total following is believed to be over 1000 000 worldwide. 1975 to the present has been the period of the most phenomenal growth for the Rastafarian Movement. This growth is largely attributed to Bob Marley, reggae artist, and the worldwide acceptance of reggae as an avenue of Rastafarian self-expression. Marley became a prophet of Rastafarianism in 1975. The movement spread quickly in the Caribbean and was hugely attractive to the local black youths, many of whom saw it as an extension of their adolescent rebellion from school and parental authority. With it came some undesirable elements, but all true Rastas signify peace and pride and righteousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true Rasta eats only I-tal food. This is special food never touches chemicals or is natural and not in cans. This food is cooked, but served in the rawest form possible; without salts, preservatives, or condiments. Many Rastas are therefore vegetarians. Those who do eat meant are forbidden to eat pig because they are the scavengers of the earth. Fish is a staple I-tal food, however, not crabs, lobster, and shrimp, for these are the scavengers of the sea. The fish they eat must be small, not more than twelve inches long. Drinking preferences rest with anything that is herbal, such as tea. Liquor, milk, coffee, and soft
       <br/>
       drinks are viewed as unnatural. The term I-tal is rapidly taking hold in the consumer industry in Jamaica.

      <p>
       One of the more obvious symbols of the Rastafarians are the colors. These are red, black, and green. These colors were taken from the Garvey movement. The color red stands for the Church Triumphant which is the church of the Rastas. It also symbolises the blood that martyrs have shed in the history of the Rastas and the black struggle for liberation. The black represents the color of Africans. Green represents the beauty and vegetation of Ethiopia, the promised land. Yellow is also sometimes added to represent the wealth of their homeland.

        Dreadlocks

      </p>
      <p>
       The dreadlocks on a Rastas head also contains symbolism. This symbolizes the Rastas roots, contrasting the straight, blond look of the white man and establishment. It not only shows their roots, but it is supported in the Bible: Leviticus 21:5, They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in the flesh. The way the hair grows comes to represent the symbol of the Lion of Judah (explained further down). This has also come to symbolize priesthood and naturality.
