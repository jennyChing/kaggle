       ENGFENG, 
		  China - Well-worn flagstones lead up a gentle gradient, through an imposing 
		  gate, past huge statues of fierce guardian spirits. The tiled eaves 
		  of a temple loom behind a giant ginkgo tree, all but groaning under 
		  the weight of a heavy snow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly, the pounding of hammers and the whine of an electric saw 
		  interrupt the reverie. Only then does it dawn that this is no ancient 
		  temple but a re-creation. The impression is confirmed by a glance at 
		  the colors in the rafters, impossibly bright for anything truly old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discordant sensations may be forgiven. Like any temple, the birthplace 
		  of China's most famous form of kung fu is supposed to be a space of 
		  tranquillity and meditation. Yet Shaolin has become such a fixture of 
		  Chinese popular culture that much of the life of this holy shrine involves 
		  greeting paying tourists who arrive year-round by the thousands.

       For the monks of Shaolin Temple, identity crises are nothing new. Is 
		  Shaolin kung fu popular entertainment or solemn exercise? Is it a money 
		  maker or tool of spiritual mastery? Is this idyllic site in the Song 
		  Mountains of Henan Province a contemplative retreat or a theme park? 
		  The short answer to all these questions is, of course, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are even two versions of how it all started. The official account, 
		  a blend of history and religious lore, places the origins of the Shaolin 
		  tradition in the sixth century. A Buddhist monk from India named Bodhidharma, 
		  or Damo, settled here then and began instructing local monks in scripture 
		  and the physical drills that are still said to be the basis of kung 
		  fu. But if the question is more about when this country went kung fu 
		  crazy, then the origins trace back several thousand films to "Shaolin 
		  Temple," featuring the Chinese action movie star Jet Li.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Li, a four-time national martial arts champion, filmed mainland 
		  China's first kung fu hit here in 1979 (it was released in the West 
		  in 1982), just as China was embarking on its economic liberalization. 
		  The moviemakers borrowed as their plot the then-dilapidated Shaolin 
		  Temple's most famous legend, the story of 13 monks who rescued the Tang 
		  emperor from a vicious warlord.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is, as they say, history. The road to Shaolin Temple today 
		  is literally lined with kung fu academies, which at last count numbered 
		  over 50. The schools are huge, some with over 10,000 students who come 
		  from all over China to train throughout the year, including now in this 
		  season's bone-chilling weather, in hopes of becoming the country's next 
		  Jet Li.

       For the monks who run Shaolin, the explosive popularity of Shaolin 
		  kung fu has not been without problems. For one, anyone vaguely familiar 
		  with Chinese martial arts and with a little bit of business sense, here 
		  or abroad, can hang up a shingle claiming to run a Shaolin kung fu school.
      </p>
      <p>
       The temple's leaders say they have had enough of this debasement, and 
		  have persuaded the Chinese government to declare the name a recognized 
		  brand, protecting it under the rules of the World Trade Organization. 
		  The temple is also on a short list for recognition as a United Nations 
		  World Heritage Site, protecting the name, which they see both as a valuable 
		  brand and a term of spiritual import.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Shaolin wants to preserve our uniqueness, for the same reasons that 
		  developed countries value individuality," said the temple's leader, 
		  or abbot, who goes by the name Yongxin. "It's a process that the society 
		  has to go through, spreading standards. What Shaolin is trying to do 
		  is work from our origins, from the basics, and we're doing pretty well."
      </p>
      <p>
       The monks' life, he said, was simple and austere, with frequent meditation 
		  and chanting prayer services. "It is a lifestyle that has lasted over 
		  1,000 years," said Yongxin, a short, bald, pudgy man of 40 who pads 
		  about his chilly but ornate quarters in long, mustard-colored robes, 
		  attended to by tea-serving monks. "We get up at 4 a.m. and have breakfast 
		  at 7 a.m. and lunch by 11:30. There are morning and evening classes, 
		  prayers and scripture readings." There are also, he neglected to add, 
		  daily kung fu exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between Shaolin's distant Buddhist origins and its Hollywood-like revival, 
		  the temple has seen more than its share of ups and downs. It was nearly 
		  burned down in the 1920's, during China's civil war, and was damaged 
		  further under Japanese occupation 20 years later. Kung fu was banned 
		  under the Communists in the 1950's, and during the Cultural Revolution, 
		  in the 1960's, the monks, who were subjected to public humiliation and 
		  beatings, abandoned the temple altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current revival has been almost entirely overseen by Yongxin. 
		  Although he is reputed to be a kung fu master, like most of the monks 
		  here, his appearance is anything but fierce. Indeed, his most formidable 
		  weapon seems to be the mysterious government connections that have reputedly 
		  enabled him to reclaim the extensive lands surrounding the temple, clearing 
		  them of junky shops, hotels and other tourist traps.
      </p>
      <p>
       "All across history, Shaolin Temple has served the emperors," said 
		  Liang Yiquan, 74, the director of the nearby Shaolin Epo Martial Arts 
		  School, commenting on the abbot's influence. "Now they serve the Communist 
		  Party. There's a political element to it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Asked whether Shaolin's popularity was a blessing or a curse, Yongxin 
		  waxed philosophical. "Having so many schools teaching inauthentic kung 
		  fu may not be such a bad thing, as long as it can help promote Buddhism," 
		  he said. "We are not against pursuing commercial interests. We only 
		  hope we can play a positive role in the society, while not violating 
		  a spirit that is 1,500 years old."
