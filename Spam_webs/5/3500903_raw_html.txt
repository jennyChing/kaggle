       The Spitfire XIV was a short range medium-high altitude fighter combining the Spitfire Mk VIII airframe with a Rolls-Royce Griffon engine.  
 Armament was either: B wing - 2 x 20 mm cannon and 4 x .303 Browning guns, or E wing - 2 x 20 mm cannon and .50 Browning guns.
 The operational weight with full fuel and ammunition was 8,400 lbs.
 It was fitted with a two-speed, two-stage Griffon 65 engine of 2,220 h.p.
 Internal fuel capacity was 112 gallons with pick-up points provided for carrying of 30 gallon, 45 gallon or 90 gallon drop tanks.
 Later models could be equipped with a 33 gallon rear fuselage tank.  
 In appearence it was very similar to the Spitfire XII with normal wings, except that it had a five-bladed propeller.
 The fin and rudder were further modified.
 Production models entering service beginning in February 1945 featured a cut-back rear fuselage and teardrop bubble canopy.

       The first production Spitfire XIV was delivered in late October, 1943.
  No. 610 (County of Chester) Squadron was the first squadron to convert to Spitfire XIVs, re-equipment commencing on 4 January 1944 with the Squadron's move to Exeter.

       610 Squadrons first operational sorties with their XIVs occurred on 8 January 1944.   Spring brought moves to Culmhead, Bolt Head, and Harrowbeer.
  91 Squadron began trading in their Spitfire XIIs for XIVs on the last day of February 1944 when they moved to Castle Camps.
   They flew operations with the XIVs on 12 March 1944, moving to Drem that month, then West Malling in April.
  322 (Dutch) Squadron began re-equipping with Spitfire XIVs in mid March at Acklington, with the first operational flying coming after the move to Hartford Bridge in April.
  At this time 91 and 322 Squadrons comprised 24 Wing, 2nd TAF led by Wing Commander Bobby Oxspring. 
  Spring operations took the form of sweeps, patrols, scrambles, escorts etc.

        Operation Overlord
       </i>
       , the successful landings in Normandy, the Spitfire XIV Squadrons were engaged in anti-diver duties for approximately two months.


  On 9 August 1944 Nos. 91 and 322 delivered their Spitfires XIVs to 350 (Belgian) and 402 (Winnipeg Bear) Squadrons at Hawkinge, while No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron also converted to Spitfire XIVs that month at Lympne.

By mid August the V-1 diver threat had waned and the Spitfire XIV Squadrons went back to offensive operations over the continent.

       402 (RCAF) was first to move to the continent, arriving at Antwerp/Deurne, Belgium (B.70) in September followed shortly thereafter by 130 Squadron.
  These two Spitfire XIV squadrons then joined the Tempests of 80 and 274 Squadrons at Grave, Belgium (B.82) in early October to comprise No 125 Wing, No 83 Group, 2nd TAF before moving to Diest, Holland  (B.64) in November.
  No. 2 and 430 fighter recce squadrons, based on the continent with No 35 Wing, No 84 Group, 2nd TAF, equipped with Spitfire XIVs in November.
  350 and 610 Squadrons moved to Evere, Belgium (B.56) during the first week of December, while 41 joined 130 and 402 at Diest.
 At the end of the month 41, 130, 350 and 610 squadrons, comprising No 125 Wing, moved to Ophoven, Belgium (Y.32).
    402 transferred to 126 (RCAF) Wing at Heesch, Holland (B.88) in December, staying there into April.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
       In January 1945, 130, 350, and 610 squadrons moved to Eindhoven,  Holland (B.78), while 41 Squadron joined 122 Tempest Wing at Volkel, Holland (B.80).
  Missions over north-west and north-central Germany brought the Spitfires into occasional contact with the Me 109s of JG 27 based at Rheine, Rheine-Hopsten, Hesepe, and Achmer during the first few months of 1945.  
  The Me 109s of JG 3 may also have been encountered before they were moved to the crisis on the east front in January.
  Most combats, however, were with the Fw 190s of JG 26 and and to a lesser extent III./JG 54. 
125 Wing moved to Twente, Holland (B.106) in early April where 41 Squadron rejoined them.
 414 Squadron converted to FR XIVs in April as did 268 Squadron when they moved to Twente.
  In mid April 125 Wing moved to Celle, Germany (B.118) while 126 Wing moved to  Rheine (B.108), then Wunstorf, Germany (B.116), where they finished up the war.
  401 (RCAF) started to re-equip with Spitfire XIVs in mid April and was still in the process of fully converting to Spitfire XIVs when the war in Europe concluded.
  As of 26th April 1945 there were 667 Spitfire XIVs on strength with the RAF.

       At about the time of the Spitfire XIV's entry into service in early 1944 its Me 109 counterpart was the Me 109 G-6 with its DB-605 A engine presumably cleared for 1.42 ata take-off and emergency power.
  The DB-605 AS engine, with improved altitude performance, came into service during the spring of 1944.   MW-50 was introduced that summer in the Me 109 G-6/R2 and Me 109 G-14 enabling improved low altitude performance.

       The RAE commented on the Griffon 65 engine in Tech. Note No. Eng. 316 from July 1944 "Due to main bearing troubles, these engines are at present limited to + 21 lb./sq.in. boost pressure

       The same report gives 393 mph as the maximum speed at 3,000 feet altitude whilst operating at +21 lb boost.  This extrapolates to 377 mph at sea level.

       Calculated estimates indicate that actual performance was probably somewhere between the two, or approximately 370 mph at sea level.
 For comparison, the first production Spitfire 21 with a Griffon 61 engine operating at +21 lbs. boost achieved 368 mph at sea level,
although it should be noted that the report stated "As the aircraft had been engaged on a long programme of tests, both at this Establishment and at the Contractor's works, the external condition had deteriorated considerably when the performance trials were made.

  Unfortunately this feature is often missing from estimated performance curves. 
  The Me 109 G-5 and 6 curves at Start and Notleistung (take-off and Emergency) shown below are approximations, whereas the curve for the Me 109 G6/R-2 again accounts for the effect of the hydraulic coupled supercharger, 
although with rather less precision than that of the flight tested Me 109 G-5. 
  The Me 109 G-14/U4 curve is an estimate by Messerschmitt's Projecktburo assumming DB 605 ASM engine using MW-50, Gondelwaffen and weight of 7,817 lbs.

       Conditions in Germany during the last year of the war, however, were not conducive to aircraft achieving maximum theoretical performance levels.
  Hans Knickrehm of I/JG 3 recalled the condition of new Me 109 G-14/ASs received by his group in October, 1944:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p align="justify">
        The machines that were delivered were technically obsolete and of considerably lowered quality.
  The engines proved prone to trouble after much too short a time, because the factories had had to sharply curtail test runs for lack of fuel.
  The surface finish of the outer skin also left much to be desired.  The sprayed-on camouflage finish was rough and uneven.  The result was a further reduction in speed.
  We often discovered clear cases of sabotage during our acceptance checks.  Cables or wires were not secured, were improperly attached, scratched or had even been visibly cut.

       At a conference in Berlin on 20 January 1945, with the Chief Engineer of the Luftwaffe, it was reported  that the Me 109 airframe was extraordinarily bad and performance outrageously low.
  Daimler-Benz noted that there was no point in continually increasing engine power when the airframes were getting worse due to sloppy manufacturing.
  A comparison between the Me 109 and the Mustang was devastating.

       It didnt help matters that ground crews, who might have ameliorated these problems to some degree, were being transferred to the infantry in significant numbers.
  The primitive conditions existing at Luftwaffe airfields was an additional complication.
  Bombing and strafing attacks further taxed the ground crew's ability to maintain the aircraft anywhere near the degree necessary to even approach theoretical performance levels.

       , whereas efforts were taken to increase the output of the DB 605 D series in order to make the Me 109 K-4 more competitive.    
  Unfortunately, flight trials of Me 109 Ks appear not to exist.
  The following Me 109 K curves were produced by Messerschmitt's Project Bureau at Oberammergau.

       This translates as:  The MW installation serves to increase the emergency power of the engine. With 1,75 ata boost pressure, additional injection of MW increases emergency power (special emergency power) and can occasionally be used to increase level speed and rate of climb.
  The MW additive serves for  the interior cooling of the engine and for the avoidance of overheating during flight with special emergency power. The use of the special emergency power without MW injection is forbidden! The engine is endangered without MW injection.
 The use of the special emergency power is done via pushing the throttle lever forward to 1,75 ata boost pressure (number of revolutions 2850 U/min).

       The Projektbro estimate from 19.1.45 assumes 9-12159 propeller, and a weight of 7,496 lbs.  
  Documentation listed below demonstrates that newly delivered Me 109 K-4's were equipped with a DB 605 DB engine operating with 1.80 ata/2800 rpm engine limitations beginning approximately mid January 1945. 
  
  Various engine and propeller configurations were experimented with.  The 9-12159 propeller was the standard production propeller but various German curves are extant showing estimated performance of the Me 109 K-4 with 9-12199.10 and 9-17018.10 thin blade (Dnnblatt) props and Projektschraube with 4 light-metal blades.
  The 452 mph figure often cited as the top speed of the Me 109 K-4 derives from an estimate assumming an experimental 9-12199 Dnnblatt propeller.
  The DB 605 DC engine running at 1.8 ata boost without MW-50 was tried but did not find favour. (

       No evidence has come to light proving operational use of 1.98 ata by combat units, however, its clear from surviving documentation that the Luftwaffe felt a pressing need to increase the performance of the 109 and that 1.98 ata was tested and proposed for use.
  Prien &amp; Stemmer have written about the desperate situation confronting the Luftwaffe in 1945:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p align="justify">
        The start of the Russian offensive
        <i>
         (note: in mid January 45)
        </i>
        resulted in the biggest regrouping of forces by the Luftwaffe since the invasion of the Soviet Union.
  From this point on, the course of operations in the east dictated the employment of all remaining forces, especially of the air units and the flak.
  Russian breakthroughs everywhere threatened the very existance of the Reich.
  Faced with this, the German command reduced defensive operations in the west to a minimum, while the Defense of the Reich was virtually abandoned.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        The only units left in action over the west were JG 2, 26, 27, and 53, which operated mainly against the Allied fighter-bombers and twin-engined bombers but not against incursions by the heavy bombers.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        A Wehrmacht Operations Staff memo dated 19/1/1945 stated that 
        <i>
         a high degree of forces are to be concentrated for the great decisive battle in the eastern theater at the conscious acceptance of the associated serious risk in the western theater
        </i>
        .
  For the air defense that meant that the flak would bear the main of subsequent defensive operations in the west, while the bulk of the flying units were to be deployed in the east to support the army.
  To this end the units deployed in the east were to receive prioity in the allocation of the last remaining reserves of fuel.
  The memo went on to say: "
        <i>
         The available fuel is to be allocated accordingly
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        As a result of increased consumption in defensive operations in January and February the fuel shortage had again become acute, and on 4 March 1945 the OKW saw itself forced to issue another directive on future Luftwaffe operations.
 It decreed that apart from operations by the few jet fighter units, defensive missions against incursions over the Reich by the American and British heavy bombers were now to be halted completely, which nearly meant the end of the Defense of the Reich.
 There was also a rigorous concentration  of remaining forces for operations in the east,  in order to make the defensive effort there as effective as possible.

        By now deliveries of aircraft had slowed down, which is why, for example, that in March III
        <i>

        Das JG 27 blieb auch nach dem Abbruch der Kmpfe im Ardennenraum weiterhin auf seinen Pltzen im Raume Osnabrck; fortan lag der Einsatzschwerpunkt vor allem bei der Bekmpfung, der zumeist der 2nd Tac AF der RAF angehrigen Tief- und Artillerieflieger, whrend der Abwehreinsatz gegen die Einflge der 8 USAAF in den Hintergrund trat.

  Dies fhrte dazu, dass die deutschen Jger in die frhen Morgenstunden bzw. in das letzte Licht des Abends ausweichen mussten, wenn sie einigermassen sicher aus dem eigenen Gartenzaun herausstarten wollten.

       The following passages from the work of Werner Girbig provide insight, from a German point of view, into the plight of the Luftwaffe in the west during the last 6 months of the war:

        Review of November
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        Analysis of the Allied offensive air operations of November 1944 shows that, in addition to raids on communication targets, 
 the level of attacks on synthetic fuel production was greatly stepped up.
  In October the Americans had dropped 12.5% of their total weight of bombs on fuel targets and the RAF 5.9%; but in November these figures rose to 33% and 25% respectively.
  On the other hand the intensity of strategic operations fell off somewhat from that of the preceding months, as the Americans' attention was focused on the ground operations
 that were taking shape in Lorraine and across Belgium and Luxembourg.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        On the German side, by contrast, thanks to conservation and accumulation of fighter resources in the previous weeks, we could put strong forces into the air.
  But the figures are deceptive.  The "Big Blow" envisaged by General der Jagdflieger Galland never took place.
  For one thing the weather that November was not suitable for an operation of this kind; the bulk of the pilots lacked the requisite operational training;
 and in addition the results of operations were falling way below expectations.
  In the area of I Jagdkorps under Generalleutnant Schmid, 155 Allied aircraft were shot down for the loss of 404 German aircraft, while personnel casualties amounted to at least 300 on the four principal days alone.
  The November 1944 figure for day-fighter pilots killed or missing, excluding accidents, was 244.
       </p>

        Review of December
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        Even more than the preceding months, the past weeks had demonstrated the British and American pilot's' superior mastery of operational flying in the foulest of weathers.
  The result was, that on most days of December the home air defense fighter pilots were again faced with superior numbers wherever they turned.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Moreover the Allies succeeded in gaining not only the initiative on the fronts but along with it the control of the rear areas;
 as a result the month was marked by disruption of the communications system and destruction of air force installations.
  Thus in this last month of 1944, in bombing raids on as many as eighty airfields, 129 machines were destroyed on the ground and a further 140 damaged.
  In the last four days of the month the Allied air forces flew 5,500 heavy bomber sorties over Germany;
 I Jagdkorps shot down 63 bomber's and 23 escort fighters for the loss of 128 fighters.
 In the same period, according to Generalmajor Grabmann, AA artillery accounted for almost three times as many Allied aircraft.
 It follows that the German day-fighters could no longer be claimed to offer an effective defense.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        The losses were devastating.  From the beginning of the month to the opening of the German Ardennes offensive on December 16, 136 fighter pilots failed to return.
  In the four days from December 19-22, the figure was "only" 83.
  But in the week or so from December 23-31, the fighters units lost 316 pilots killed or missing, quite apart from the wounded.
  Over Christmas alone, Luftflotte Headquaters West and the units attached to it for the Ardennes offensive suffered 260 aircrew casualties.
  On these figures it would appear that German fighter force casualties for December 1944 amounted to 500 pilots killed or missing, 35 taken prisoner and 194 wounded.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <center>
        Bodenplatte
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        In Operation "Bodenplatte" the German day-fighter force alone lost 214 pilots.  
  151 were killed or reported missing (the cases of 48 of the missing still being under investigation); a further 63 were taken prisoner.
  In addition there were eighteen wounded , but these cannot be counted as a total loss, since most of them were able to return to flying duties sooner of later.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        While the casualties have now been established within a small margin of error, it is difficult to arrive at figures for material;
 no list of aircraft losses as such is available, if indeed one ever existed.
  In every unit there must have been machines which crashed as a result of enemy action, German AA fire or technical failures while their pilots escaped unhurt.
  It is thus safe to assume that, in addition to the 232 incidents which caused casualties, a further 60-70 aircraft were lost, bringing the probable total for the German fighter force on January 1, 1945 to around 300.
  This corresponds to a loss rate of 30% of all aircraft involved in the operation.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Operation "Bodenplatte" amounted to a total defeat.
  The home air defense formation equipped with the standard types of fighter never recovered from the blow.
  Their subsequent operations were insignificant seen against the situation as a whole and offered no further threat to the domination of the Allied air forces.

        January's End
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        After the transfer of large number of fighter units to the Eastern Front in mid-January, only four day fighter Geschwader remained available to the Home Defense Forces and Luftflotte Headquarters West.
  And all four were well below strength.
  The Allied bombers in their hordes droned their way across Germany every day.
  The raids continued with unabated weight.
  Augsburg, Hamburg, Magdeburg, Paderborn, Bielefeld, Mannheim, Heilbronn, Duisburg, Dsseldorf, Cologne, Kassel, Hamm, Mnster - these were just the main bomber targets for the second half of the month.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        The German air defenses in the I Jagdkorps' area had by now become virtually meaningless.
  Losses amounted to almost 30% of sorties flown, while kills did not even amount to 0.2% of the Allies aircraft committed.
       </p>

        February
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        The war had entered its final phase.
  In East and West alike Allied forces already stood on German soil and was pressing foward relentlessly to deliver the final back-breaking blows.
  By now the Soviet armies had closed up to the Oder and were concentrating for their final major thrust on Berlin,
 while in the West the Allied air effort continued to be mainly directed against communications targets and the fuel industry.
  But the Luftwaffe had little left to put up against the bombers' incursions.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        On February 14, the Americans put 945 heavy bombers into the overcast skies of Central Germany.
  To counter the three enemy incursions, Home Air defense could only muster 145 machines from IX Fliegerkorps (Fighters);
 and once again it was JG 300 and JG 301 who bore the brunt.
 On their own figures twenty of their aircraft went down.
  The Americans, on the other had, lost only two bombers, a further testimony to the impotence of the German fighter force.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        The closing days of February were marked by another period of unusually intensive Allied air activity over Germany,
  On February 24, strong US 8th Air Force Heavy bomber formations attacked hydogenation plants in the Hamburg and Hanover areas.
  These raids met no opposition and only two bombers failed to return.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        On the following day the Americans launched a major operation against the German communications system, at the same time attacking a number of airfields,
 mainly those used by ME 262 units.
  The towns of Aschaffenburg, Friedichshafen, Munich and Ulm also suffered raids of varying weight.
  The American fighter escort, over 600 strong, once again succeeded in holding off the German fighter defense and allowing the 1,177 heavy bombers used to reach their targets unimpeded.
  The RAF also flew another daylight operation, this time against Dortmund.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <center>
        March
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        Not the least of the indications that the Allies now sought to put a speedy end to the War was the further intensification of their air activity.
  On no single day or night of the Month did German airspace remain free of the intrusions; and only a few weeks before the end of the murderous worldwide conflagration many more cities had to suffer heavy air-raids with appalling results;
 among them Berlin, Dortmand, Chemnitz, Dessau, Essen, Janau, Hildesheim, Mannheim, Paderborn, Ulm, Unna and Wrzburg.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        The German air defense had been shattered.
  The Geschwader, most of them by now reduced almost to Gruppe strength, went down in a series of last desperate encounters... 
 For the IX Fliegerkorps (Fighters) units the day of March 2 ended with a loss of 43 aircraft against fifteen kills.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Figher sweeps against Allied fighter bombers and other ground-attack aircraft continued, but defense against the heavy bomber formations made little further impact.
  The jet fighter units, on the other hand, were rather more successful, even though Allied domination of German airspace and the effect of raids on fuel installations meant that they could only be used intermittently.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Both British 2nd TAF's Spitfires and American fighters in strength put in low-level attacks on German airfields.
  Jagdgeschwader 27, which at the time was just in the process of redeploying to the new airfields south of the Teutoburger Wald, suffered severely at their hands.
  For IV Gruppe, which had taken off from Achmer, March 19 proved to be the end of their existance as an operational unit.
  The Americans shot down virtually a whole staffel over the Osnabrck area, killing six pilots and wounding five.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Elements of I Gruppe took off about 1000 on their transfer flight to Strmede, but a group of Spitfires from No.130
        <i>
         (Spitfire XIVs)
        </i>
        were on them in a flash.
  Flying low over the field, they caught some machines before they were even airbourne.
  Two pilots were shot down in flames, and one crashlanded in a wooded area.
        <i>
         (See Combat Reports of F/O Lord and F/Sgt Hudson for 19 March 45 below)
        </i>
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        With the cutting to pieces of JG 301 at the begining of the month, 1st Jagddivision had already lost a substantial part of the force under its commnad,
 and on March 24 JG 300 also suffered a decisive defeat.
  On this day US 8th Air Force put up a total of 1,400 bomber sorties in a major operation against a dozen or more Luftwaffe bases east of the Rhine, some in Holland and some in West Germany.
  These raids were carried out in support of the Allied airbourne operations at Wesel, where Montgomery's British were about to cross the Rhine.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        It was about noon when the Americans, flying low, swept across the countryside between the Teutoburger Wald and the Lippe to take on the airfields in that area.
  There can be no doubt that the destruction wrought on the German bases and the loss of hundreds of machines on the ground very severly impaired the Gerrman day and night fighter effort.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Over Strmede, where I./JG 27 were based at this time, a major battle developed between a strong force of Mustangs and the Messerschmitts of I and III Gruppen.
  The unit had already been stretched to the limit, and now it lost another twelve pilots, four from I Gruppe and eight from III Gruppe.
  Over and above this, three pilots were wounded by machine-gun fire on the Strmede field.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        A little later Jagdgeschwader 300's turn came, just east of Gttingen.
  II Gruppe under the 24-year-old Oberleutnat Radener and small elements from I and IV Gruppen had flown west from Thuringia to be directed by ground control on to the reported American incursion.
  In a bitter action II Gruppe, the Sturmgruppe, was completely wiped out, losing twenty of its Focke-Wulfs.  5 Staffel lost five pilots, and 6 Staffel simply ceased to exist,
 six of its pilots were killed in action.
  With 7 Staffel also losing 2 pilots, II Gruppe casualties amounted to fourteen killed and wounded - a blow from which it was never to recover.
  American losses on the other hand were negligible.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Now the German fighter force was well down the slope of its decline.
  Another six costly weeks of attrition were to go by before Germany finally collapsed, and a further 200 pilots were to lose their lives.

        April
       </center>
       <p align="justify">
        The proof that home air defense was now effectively at an end came on Thrusday, April 10, when a massive American raid went in on the jet fighter fields in North Germany.
  Briest, Burg, Orianienburg, Lrz, and Parchim suffered extensive damage to installations and machines.
  This resulted in the move of the Me 262 units to Czechoslovakia, where US 8th Air Force could no longer get at them.
  Meanwhile Hitler raged away at the Luftwaffe; he simply could not understand why the runways could not be restored overnight.
  On Friday, April 13, the Americans really began to take the Luftwaffe on the ground.
  Thunderbolts from the 56th Fighter Group destroyed 95 machines on North German airfields, including Eggebeck in the northwest of Schleswig-Holstein.
  Three days later, on the following Monday, it was the turn of the South German fields, the 353rd Fighter Group destroying 110 aircraft on the ground.
  And 125 machines went up in smoke airfields in the Sudentenland.
  The next day the Mustangs were back again to send another 200 aircraft up in flames.
  This sealed the fate of the Luftwaffe, and the fighter force in particular.

        Im Laufe des Monats mu das Geschwader fast das gesamte Personal der jngeren Jahrgnge abgeben.  Sie werden allen mglichen Verbnden des Heeres, der SS und der Luftwaffenfelddivisionen eingliedert.
 In diese Zeit hinein erreicht das Geschwader ein Befehl, dem heute und an dieser Stelle einen Kommentar hinzufgen wohl berflssig is.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Aufgrund erhhten Abwehrverbrauchs im Osten sind durch das OKL neue Answeisungen fr den Luftwaffeneneinsatz im Westen befohlen worden:

        Aber wann bieten jetzt noch einmal solche erfolgversprechenden Lagen?  Und so wird gem der neuen Anweisung fast nicht mehr geflogen.

        Am 22. und 23. Februar sind alle vier Luftflotten der Alliierten in der Luft und demonstrieren ihre Strke durch das Unternehmen Clarion.
  Das ist die luftstrategische Vorbereitung der Grooffensive gegen den Rhein.
  Mit rund 9000 Bombern, Jabos und Jgern erscheinen sie ber dem Reichsgebiet.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Aus diesem Grund lebt die Einsatzttigkeit des JG 27 Ende Februar wieder auf... 
Mitte des Monats stoen die britischen Truppen nach schweren Kmpfen bei Goch vor und gelangen in den Raum sdlich von Kleve.  Von hier aus bereiten sie dann den Sprung ber den Rhein vor.
  Dieser Aktion wird ein groes Luftlandeunternehmen bei Wesel vorangeschickt.

        Um dieselbe Zeit macht sich das JG 27 zur Verlegung auf verschiedene Pltze im Teutoburger Wald bereit, nimmt aber auch an den Kmpfen am Niederrhein teil.

        Um den 18. Mrz herum kommt das Geschwader wieder in Bewegung und gibt seine Pltze um Rheine nun endgltig auf.  Der Stab verlegt nach Horn, die I. Gruppe kommt nach Strmede bei Lippstadt, die II. nach Lippspringe und die III. nach Gtersloh.

        Leutnant Beckmann rollt kurz nach 9 Uhr mit seiner 3. Staffel zum start, um von Rheine nach Lippstadt zu verlegen.  ber dem Flugplatz waren etwa 45 Indianer gemeldet.  Der Kommodore zgerte Startbefehl zu gebe.  Daraufhin gab Divisions-General trotz der schwierigen Lage Befehl zum Start.  Die 3. Staffel startete und wurde angegriffen.
  Die gesamte Staffel mit Ausnahme von Uffz. Horst, der als einziger in Strmede ankam, und Lt. Schreyer, wurde abgeschossen und grtenteils verwundet.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Fr die IV. Gruppe bedeutet der Frhlingsanfang am 21. Mrz 1945 das Ende.
  Am Morgen dieses Tages geht ber Achmer ein furchtbarer Viermot-Angriff hinweg, der Rollfeld und Liegepltze vllig zerstrt.
  Was durch die Bomben verschont bleibt, vernichten anschlieend die Jabos.  Anderthalb Stunden sind sie ber dem Platz.
  Nur einzige Maschine des gesamten Flugzeugbestandes von 38 Messerschmitt bleibt brig.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Nach der Tragdie von Achmer wird die IV./JG 27 nunmehr aufgelst, die Flugzeugfhrer werden auf andere Gruppen verteilt.
  Fr das Bodenpersonal kommt der Abmarschbefehl nach Braunschweig.  Die Stabskompanie unter Hauptman Neuberger findet sich im Erdeinsatz whrend der Kmpfe um Berlin wieder und erlebt nach dem Rckzug ber Mecklenburg dort das Kriegsende.
  Den brigen 400 Mann der Bodenteile ergeht es hnlich.
  Auch sie werden zu anderen Einheiten versetzt und nehmen an den Erdkmpfen teil.
       </p>

        Von den wenigen Einstzen, die von den Pltzen im Teutoburger Wald aus geflogen werden, bleibt nicht mehr viel zu berichten.
  Dem Abschu von fnf gegnerischen Jgern stehen nochmals schwere Verluste gegenber.

        Sechs Tage nach diesem verlustreichen 24. Mrz tauchen ersten amerikanischen Panzer vor Paderborn auf.
  Doch bis jetzt liegt noch kein Verlegungsbefehl fr die Jagdflieger vor.  Also Rcksprache mit Major Franzzisket, seit 30. Dezember 1944 Kommodore des JG 27.
  Dieser entscheidet, da das Geschwader die Pltze auf eigene Faust verlassen soll.
  Am Abend des 30. Mrz starten die Maschinen.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Jetzt liegen die E-Hfen in den Auslufern des Harzes und des Elm.
  Die Verteilung sieht wie folgt aus: Stab und I. gruppe in Helmstedt, II. in Vlkenrode bei Braunschweig und die III. in Goslar.
  Der Geschwaderstab verlegt in den nchsten Tagen gleich nach Gitter bei Salzgitter weiter.
  Auch in den neuen Rumen kommt es auer dem Abschu einiger gegnerischer Artillerieflugzeuge zu keinen greren Erfolgen mehr.
  Dagegen verliert das Geschwader bis 9. April weitere zwlf Flugzeugfhrer, und da sich die meisten Einstze gegen die amerikanischen Panzerspitzen im Gebiet des Harzes und westlich Hannover richten, fallen die meisten Piloten davon der gegnerischen Panzerflak zum Opfer.
       </p>
       <p align="justify">
        Die letzte Verlegung im Geschwaderverband beginnt am 8. April 1945.
  Das ergibt schon nach wenigen Tagen wieder ein anderes Bild, denn der Stab liegt nun in Breitenfeld bei Salzwedel, die I. geht direkt nach Salzwedel und mu diesen Platz wegen Panzerbeschu sofort wieder aufgeben.
  Whrend die II. Gruppe nun in Helmstedt einfllt, befinden sich ihre Bodenteile in Salzwedel.
  Die III./JG 27 trifft in Halferstadt ein.

        In raschen, unaufhaltsamen Vorsten erreichen die alliierten Truppen die Elbe und treffen bei Torgau auf die von Osten herankommenden Spitzen der russischen Armee. 
 Dadurch wird auch das Jagdgeschwader 27 gespalten und die Wege trennen sich von nun an. 
 Die im Nordraum verbleibenen Einheiten, bestehend aus Geschwaderstab, der II. Gruppe und kleinen Teilen der I. Gruppe, ziehen sich ber Rathenow, Perleberg und Schwerein zurck.

Even at +25 lbs. the Spitfire XIV still fell short of the sea level performance of the Tempest V and highly boosted Mustangs.
 There is clear documentation that
       <a href="http://www.spitfireperformance.com/125wing-replacement-aircraft.jpg">
        2nd TAF Spitfire XIVs had their Griffon engines set to +21 lbs boost.
       </a>
       Its also clear that the Griffon engine was approved for +25 lbs maximum combat boost before war's end.

       Although the Spitfire XIV's strength was in the medium and high altitude role, the paucity of Luftwaffe opposition led to the Squadrons engaging in ground attack, where flak was a much larger threat than Me 109s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ian Ponsford who was credited with 7 enemy aircraft destroyed, 1 probable and three damaged whilst flying Spitfire XIV's with 130 Squadron recalled:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p align="justify">
        The Spitfire XIV was the most marvellous aeroplane at that time and I consider it to have been the best operational fighter of them all as it could out-climb virtually anything.
  The earlier Merlin-Spitifre may have had a slight edge when it came to turning performance but the Mark XIV was certainly better in this respect than the opposition we were faced with.
  The only thing it couldn't do was keep up with the FW 190D in a dive.  
  It could be a bit tricky on take off if one opened the throttle too quickly as you just couldn't hold it straight because the torque was so great from the enormous power developed from the Griffon engine.
  One big advantage that we had over the Germans was that we ran our aircraft on advanced fuels which gave us more power.
  The 150 octane fuel that we used was strange looking stuff as it was bright green and had an awful smell - it had to be heavily leaded to cope with the extra compression of the engine.

       610 Squadron's Intelligence Officer recorded on 7 March, 1944 what may be the Spitfire XIV's first aerial combat:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       Black section, (P/O Hussey and F/Sgt. Harding) were patrolling on an east west line about 20 miles south east of Start Point 500 feet above sea level, under the control of Kingswear C.H.L. Station.
       <br/>
       At approx 17.30 hours the Section was told to investigate unidentified aircraft 15 miles ahead, on a vector 120 degrees.
  After two minutes this vector was changed to 150 degress (At this time Black one was using only plus 12 lbs boost with his jet tank still on, and the A.S.I. was clocking about 350 miles per hour.)
  The section was now outside G.C.I. cover, but after about a minute 3 F.W. 190's appeared from 9 o'clock approx 200 feet below, flying in a fairly close vic on a rough vector of 240 degrees;
 visibility was bad owing to haze, and the section had hardly seen the E/A before they had passed underneath to 3 o'clock.
       <br/>
       Black Section immediately pulled round to the right, and it seemed that the E/A saw them at the same moment, for as our section turned on their tails, black smoke was seen pouring from their engines as they pushed everything forward and dived to sea level.
  The F.W. 190 on the left of the section turned south, and the other two turned away and disappeared into the haze and glare of the sun.
  Our section gave chase to the single F.W. 190 which at this time, was about 800 yards ahead, right on the deck.
  We closed without difficulty but when 400 yards away, Black 1 noticed a F.W. 190 making a quarter attack on him from between 4 and 5 o'clock, so gave the order to "break right".
  As he pulled up he saw the E/A fireing at him with insufficient deflection, and it appeared that the turning circle of the Spitfire XIV was better than that of the F.W. 190.
  Black 1, at 1,000 feet, was now in the haze and lost sight of the F.W. 190 and his No. 2.
       <br/>
       Black 2, who was on the left of Black 1, saw the F.W. 190 break off his attack on Black 1, and dive south west to sea level, so he rolled down to the left and got on to the tail of the F.W. 190 at a distance of about 800 yards
  (The F.W. 190 that our section had been chasing originally, had disappeared by this time)
       <br/>
       At first Black 2, did not close on the F.W. 190 as fast as he would have liked (probably due to the excitement, he forgot to jettison his tank with Black 1 at the commencement of the first chase.
  The addition of the jet tank would probably take off 30 miles per hour.)
  Another F.W. 190 now appeared ahead at about 11 o'clock, and joined formation on the left of the aircraft that Black 2 was chasing.
       <br/>
       Black 2 now found that he was closing in quite fast, around 400 I.A.S. and opened fire on the left hand F.W. 190 from dead astern at 300 yards he saw strikes on both wing roots and panels flew off the port mainplane as he closed to about 100 yards.
  Not until the strikes were observed did the other E/A take any action.
  Even then he did nothing for some time, then pulled straight up and round to the left, and tried to get on the tail of Black 2.
  Black 2 took a final squirt at his target whose only evasive action was pitching slightly up and down, before he broke into the other E/A which was trying to get on his tail
 (although clocking 360 m.p.h. the turning circle of the Spitfire seemed superior to that of the F.W. 190)
  The F.W. 190 fired at Black 2 but allowed insufficient deflection then broke off his attack and disappeared into the mist.
  The E/A was not seen again.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       We were scrambled after Huns coming in from Venlo - Wesel area.
  I was flying Red 1 and led the squadron south.
  On following the vectors from Kenway we came up underneath the Huns as they were approaching Nijmegen.
  We climbed under a loose gaggle of 15 plus 109's when I sighted one 109 alone crossing in front of me.
  I turned into line astern and closed quickly.
  I fired one very short burst and the 109 went into a diving turn to starboard.
  I turned inside him and at about 20 off 200 yds. range I fired another burst of about 2 secs. 
  Strikes were observed on cockpit and engine.
  Pieces flew off, and white and black smoke poured out.
  The enemy a/c turned into a steep spiral to port.
  He dived into the ground two or three miles S. of Nijmegen.
  I saw no parachute.  I claim one Me 109 destroyed.  All observed by Red. 2.
       <br/>
       After this engagement, five of us reformed and headed S.E. climbing.
  Red 2 and myself observed a lone 109 flying east at about 18,000 ft.
  We headed towards him and he went into a dive which steepened to the vertical.
  When near ground level, he attempted to level off.
  On pulling out, his aircraft disintegrated and fell in just N.E. of Cleve.
  I claim this for the squadron.

  Red 1 however was not able to get a shot at the e/a which then passed directly in front of me turning and climbing steeply.
  I fired a two secs. burst from about 200 yds. at 40 - 50 angle off.  
  The a/c seemed to shudder and stall and went down in an almost vertical spin.
  The e/a then disappeared under my nose as I climbed to regain Red 1.
       <br/>
       F/Lt. J.B. Lawrence however saw the action and saw the strikes near the cockpit.
  He saw the e/a go down in the spin and hit the ground 5 miles south of Nijmegen near a small wood.  I claim this e/a destroyed.

  I picked out two that were diving away.
  I lost one of them but followed the other FW 190 from 20,000 ft. down to the deck.
  The Hun took evasive action by doing steep climbing turns to starboard and then diving down again.
  I kept on his tail and took one 1 sec. burst when he was in a turn but did not allow enough deflection.
  I finally got to within 100 yds. range line astern and as he was doing a climbing turn I gave him a 2 secs. burst.
  I saw strikes on the engine, cockpit and wing and black smoke began to come from the e/a.

       F/O Harry Walmsley of 130 Squadron recorded in his Combat Report for 8 December, 1944:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       On 8th December I was Yellow 3, and my squadron had been detailed on armed recce to cover Dulmen, Hamm, Munster.
  There were 9 aircraft airbourne at 1409 and W/Cdr. Keefer was leading.
  About 1505 we approached Burgstein.
  Red and Blue sections went to one side of the town and my section went to the other.
  We saw a locomotive with about ten trucks.
  We had made one attack on the loco. and two on the trucks and were preparing to make another when about a dozen aircraft appeared from the east and they dived straight past us as if they wre joining in the attack on the train.
  These aircraft had cigar-shaped drop tanks slung under the centre of the fuselage and I thought at first they were American aircraft.
  I then saw the crosses on the wings and I could see that they were Me 109's and FW 190's.
  A dog fight started with everyone milling round.
  After about five minutes I found myself alone.
  I saw another train pulled up in a station so I went down and had a squirt at it and saw strikes on the locomotive.
  When I pulled up I saw a Spitfire in trouble.  It was smoking and the undercarriage partly down.
  I joined up with it to protect it.
  There were five Spitfires there.
  I do not know what happened to the damaged Spitfire for suddenly six e/a probably some of the ones I had first seen came diving down out of cloud.
  They had obviously climbed and reformed after the initial attack.
  This second attack made from 10/10th. cloud at 1,500 feet was obviously directed against the damaged Spitfire.
  Some of the others in the Squadron chased them off.
  I went for two which were making an attack.
  I made a quater attack on one of them, an Me 109, closing to 300 yards and giving a two second burst with all guns.
  I saw strikes behind the cockpit the e/a dived straight into the ground.
  I found I was being fired at by two e/a so I used full evasive tactics for about five minutes and finally got away into cloud.
  I landed at Heesh as I was short of petrol and made my claim to the Intelligence Officer there.
  I then returned to base.  I claim this Me 109 destroyed.
       <br/>
       I am sure that on the sides of the fuselage there where white roundels.
  The e/a were very persistant, the leaders certainly were very well clued up, I have never seen Huns fight so well.
  Their tactics were good in that obviously after the first attack they climbed to cloud and reformed.
  They definately caught us by surprise.
  I think they had either been on patrol, or had been scrambled, and when they saw smoke from the train they knew where we were and attacked out of cloud.
  The Spitfire XIV is definitely better than the 109 as I could do a better climbing turn even with my tank on.
  With my tank on the e/a could almost follow me but could not get a deflection shot at me.
  The e/a were using tracer and self-destructing ammunition.
  The camouflage was earth green and brown and blended well with the cloudy weather.

       F/Sgt. G. W. Hudson of 130 Squadron recorded in his Combat Report for 8 December 1944:

      <blockquote>
       On 9th December
       <i>
        (actually the 8th)
       </i>
       I took off with the squadron (nine aircraft) on G.C.17 (armed recce. to Dulmen, Munster and Hamm).
  I was yellow 2.
  Near Burgstein we found a train and my section which was led by F/L. Hume and which comprised F/L. Walmsley and myself went down to attack.
  I was last to attack and as I flew through the smoke my windscreen became badly covered.
  I flew around for awhile and then I saw some aircraft coming from the S.E. at about 500 feet and they were diving on the train.
  I could not see very well and at first I thought they were Mustangs.
  They looked as if they were camouflaged silver-gray.
  Someone then called up and said they were Huns.
  I looked round and found that one of them was on my tail firing at me.
  I did a steep climbing turn to the right and evaded them by getting into cloud.
  I flew above cloud for a minute or two and then came down again but could see nothing of the e/a.
  I then heard some one call again saying "There are Huns up here".
  I went up but saw nothing.
  By this time my windscreen had cleared so I came down again and then saw a dog fight going on about two miles away behind me on my port side.
  I saw two Me 109's going away on the deck.  I could now see they were 109's.
  They had black spinners and there appeared to be a black ring behind the propeller.
  I went after them and I attacked what appeared to be the No. 1 of the section.
  I came in from the starboard side and fired from about 300 yds., but my first burst was behind. 
  My angle of deflection had been about 35.  
  I pulled the stick back hard and my next burst of about 1 1/2 seconds from 200 to 250 yards. at an angle off of 25-30 hit him.
  I saw strikes all over the wings and the fuselage.
  The e/a broke left and the other broke right.
  The one I had attacked was wobbling very badly.
  I nearly overshot as he broke and I got above him.
  I could see the machine wobbling, the pilot had the hood open, there was smoke coming from the starboard side and I could see the holes in the wings where I had hit him.
  I broke away to the left as the No.2 was now attacking and I climbed away into cloud.
       <br/>
       I claim this Me 109 as probably destroyed, as when I last saw it it was wallowing around and appeared out of control at about 150 feet.
       <br/>
       I could not get rid of my drop tank at first, but I found that even with the tank on I could turn inside the e/a.

       On 8th December, 130 Squadron led by W/Cdr. Keefer were engaged on an Armed Recce coevering Dulmen, Hamm, and Munster (G.C.17).
  At 1505 when just N.E. of Burgstein yellow section was attacking a train.
  F/O Lowe says " I was Blue 1, and my section, with Red section, were patrolling at deck level as Yellow section attacked the train.
  Yellow section reported Huns, so I turned my section to starboard and flew towards the train.
  I saw five e/a. at 2,000 ft. in line astern turning to port and I climbed up and picked the last one and came in at a rate two turn.
  I opened fire with all armament from 250 yards, using 1 rings deflection.
  I saw no result from my 3 secs. burst.
  I closed in to about 150 yards, the e/a. which was a 190 taking no evasive action.
  Allowing 10 - 15 deflection I again opened fire with all armament.
  I saw strikes on the engine and this caught fire.
  I pulled out to the side of the e/a.
  It hovered in the air and then dived straight into the ground.
  I saw what appeared to be the pilot get out, but no parachute opened.
  The e/a. was camouflaged dark green and appeared almost black.
  I claim this FW 190 destroyed.
  I lost sight of the other e/a. in cloud.

       I was Red 2 to W/Cdr. Keefer.
  I was with the squadron which was on an Armed Recce in the Dulmen, Hamm, Munster area.
  Between 1505 and 1510 we were near Burgstein when e/a appeared.
  I covered my No. 1's tail as he went up through cloud firing at one of the e/a.
  The cloud was thick so I came down below it again and while doing an orbit at about 1,000 ft. below cloud about six Me 109's came from the east in a gaggle.
  They obviously saw the Spitfires and they at once started to make for the cloud.
  I followed one 109 into cloud, got within about 300 yds climbing and in a slight turn to port.
  I fired with all guns at a slight angle and saw strikes on the cockpit.
  Smoke began to pour from the engine.
  The e/a dived very steeply through the cloud and I was unable to follow as I was occupied pulling out myself.
  I lost sight of the e/a.
  I do not think this e/a could have got home as he could not have pulled out of his dive.
  F/Lt. Walmsley confirms that he saw a 109 dive into the ground from cloud and crash south of Burgstein at approximately the time and place of my combat.
  I claim this 109 destroyed.

  He then opened up.  I closed to 600 yards.
  Much light and accurate flak came up from the river and I fired a 2 second burst.  This missed and only hit the ground.
  I fired again and missed and much white tracer came up.
  I fired a third burst as he climbed over a clump of trees.
  I saw strikes on fuselage and belly.  His flaps came down and as I passed over him I saw him crash into a field at a speed of about 250 m.p.h.

      <blockquote>
       I was flying as No.2 to F/Lt. YOUNG on a Tac/R of Amersfoort area.
  East of Amersfoort we sighted 2 Ju. 88's escorted by 30+ mixed Me. 109's and F.W. 190's flying west.
  We turned up sun of the formation and attacked the last section.
  I attacked a Me 109 from dead astern and above, the enemy a/c took no evasive action.
  I gave it a 5 sec. burst with cannon and machine guns, closing from 400 - 150 yds.
  I observed strikes on the cockpit and fuselage, the enemy a/c disintegrated, the starboard wing broke off and flicked over on its back and hit the ground in flames at E.3596.
  This was also observed by F/Lt. YOUNG.
  I pulled vertically upwards and broke off the engagement.
       <p>
        I claim 1 Me. 109 destroyed.

       I was leading Red and Blue Sections when flying along railway to MUNSTER on an Armed Recce after shooting up locos and MET when 12 FW 190's carrying 2 x 250 lb Bombs appeared on the deck flying S.W. from Munster.
  The a/c made for DETTELN and WALDROP Ballons in a gentle curve to their right at 360  M.P.H.
  We followed and just overhauled them with 18 lbs boost having previously dropped tanks.
       <br/>
       I closed on a FW 190 to 200 yds on a slight turn to port and opened fire 200 yds, with a half ring deflection.
  The FW 190 struck some trees, crashed and blew up at A 9543.
  Seeing other of our a/c chasing an e/a I looked in my mirror and saw an e/e firing at me, causing one hit on my starboard wing.
  I pulled back and climbed vertically, turning to starboard.
  My No.2 (F/O Hegarty) saw the FW 190 try to follow my manoeuvre but it flicked over and after stalling on its back, during which time the pilot baled out, the FW 190 spun in from 500 ft at A 9038.

       I was flying as No. 1 with F/O JEFFERIES on Tac/R in ARNHEM and had pulled up to 8,000-ft. when I saw 2 unidentified a/c at 200-ft. flying S.W. along the Canal towards LOCHEM.

       I went down followed by my No. 2 in order to identify the a/c and recognized them as ME.109Gs with L.R.T.  They were camouflaged dark and light green with the dark crosses showing clearly.
       <br/>
       As I positioned for attack the section broke to port  one very sharply and the other more slowly, dropping their tanks.  The latter was the one I attacked.  As we did a series of turns I gave him several short bursts and he finally flew straight with full throttle, climbing slightly.  I opened up and held him quite easily and from slightly on his starboard allowed  ring deflection, seeing strikes on his starboard wing; I closed to about 150 yards dead astern and saw further strikes on tail and fuselage.  The E/A pulled up to 400-feet., jettisoned his hood and baled out.  The a/c went straight in and was seen blazing on the ground by No. 2.  The pilots chute failed to open.

       I was flying Yellow 4 on an armed recce to Lingen area, when just south east of Rheine, "Music" a/c reported Me.109's above, in Rheine area.
  Yellow 1 immediately made for the area &amp; a gaggle of a/c was sighted at approx. 6000 ft, own height was 4000 ft., east of Rheine.

  We overtook on the climb &amp; came on the same level as E/A at approx. 15,000 ft.
  Four short nosed Fw.190's slightly above to my port turned in towards me &amp; I broke left.
  The fourth E/A was lagging slightly &amp; I got on to 30 &amp; opened fire at 450 yds., saw no strikes, increased deflection to 1 1/3 rings, still at 30, I saw strikes on wing root, continuing firing with more strikes, still at wing root &amp; E/A burst into flame, with black smoke issuing from under fuselage.
  E/A flicked over on back and dived earthwards in spiral, with black smoke issuing from under fuselage.
   E/A continued to spiral down to low scattered cloud, went through quite a large hole &amp; a couple of seconds later I saw large explosions on ground, almost immediately below point of combat.
  The other three Fw.190's dived away north as I broke to port.
  Being alone I asked for homing, but battery was flat &amp; I could not receive, so headed west on safety course 260, crossed Mass &amp; sighted Y.32 &amp; landed at Y.29.

  His hood flew off and his aircraft was wallowing badly, out of control.
  We were now down to 700 feet and suddenly he nosed straight in and blew up in a railway siding in or very near HAMM.

       I was flying as Spinner Blue 4, and when approximately 10 miles East of Hamm, Blue leader called that he was going down.
  I followed and saw 4 e/a in line abreast at 2,500 feet.
  The whole section chased the e/a for about 3 minutes.
  I selected one and when at 400 yards dead astern I opened fire but saw no strikes.
  The e/a commenced to weave and I closed to 250 yards firing another 2 - 3 second burst at about 10 deflection at which the e/a started to smoke.
  I noticed tracer passing over my port wing so I broke and, as I did so, the e/a started to burn.
  Almost immediately afterwards I saw a large explosion and fire on the ground.
  Whilst doing tight turns following this combat at 2,500 feet I saw 4 e/a orbiting at 1,000 feet.
  I selected one and dived.
  The e/a saw me and tightened his turn but I got in one burst at 80 yards with full deflection and saw a cannon strike on the left wing.
  I had no more ammunition and broke away.
  I claim one FW 190 destroyed and one FW 190 damaged.

       I was leading Black Section of 4 aircraft on a bomber escort.
  The Wing was flying as four independant sections of four aircraft.  
  The bombers were flying over 8/10 ths cloud at about 16,000 ft when I saw a gaggle of a/c through a gap at 6 o'clock travelling in the opposite direction, in the HAMM area.
  I rolled over and dived after them.
  On breaking through the cloud I saw a gaggle of about 20 a/c 1 mile ahead.
  They were travelling very fast and it took me about two minutes at full throttle to catch them up.
  I was not certain of their identity, so I attempted to pull up alongside the outside aircraft on the starboard side.
  The a/c turned into me and I recognised it as a FW 190.
  I got on to its tail and the e/a climbed up into a layer of wispy cloud.
  I opened fire from dead astern at 100 yds.
  I saw many strikes on the wing roots and fuselage.
  The aircraft then burst into flames from the port wing root and base of cockpit.
  I had to break sharply away to avoid flying through the debris.
       <br/>
       I claim this FW 190 Destroyed.

       I was Blue 1 and was with the Squadron on a sweep to the Rheine-Osnabruck area.
  When Huns were reported at about 0930 I dropped my tank and went down and saw a number of e/a circling the aerdrome at Rheine at about 1,000 ft.
  I went in behind one ME 109 and closed very fast.
  The e/a took no evasive action and I opened fire with all guns from dead astern from about 200 yards closing to 50 yards.
  I saw strikes behind the cockpit.
  I overshot this e/a and I saw him crash land on the aerodrome.  I claim this e/a damaged.
       <br/>
       After this I pulled round and saw another 109 but as I closed in I overshot him.
  The e/a was trying to turn so I pulled round on to him a second time and got behind him.
  The e/a was trying to do a tight turn.
  I turned inside him and fired from 200 yards.
  I saw strikes behind the cockpit and the machine blew up in the air.
  The pilot was able to bale out and I saw the parachute go down and finish up in a tree about a quarter mile to the east of the aerodrome.

  We were at 12,000 ft when Red 2 (W/O Edwards) reported e/a orbitting the aerodrome at Rheine.
  I saw the e/a about 10,000 ft below and went down with my No 2 (W/O Miller.)
  We were the first in and we went for six 109's which were orbitting the aerodrome.
  I picked out one e/a and attacked from almost dead astern; opening fire from about 200 yards.
  I saw strikes on the jet tank and on the underside of the fuselage.
  There was a terrific burst of flame and the e/a went straight into the aerodrome and crashed.
  I claim this e/a destroyed.
       <br/>
       A general melee ensued and I fired at several more e/a as they came into my sights but I did not hit them.
  Eventually I got on to one and I fired at him from about 30 degrees off decreasing to 15 degrees at a range of 300 yards.
  I saw strikes on the fuselage.
  Almost immediately I was hit by flak which had been intense and I had to break away.
  I saw no more of the second e/a which I claim as damaged.
       <br/>
       F/Sgt Hudson adds that during the combat he had time to see an enemy aircraft land wheels down on Rheine, but as it landed it pulled up over three others which were parked on the 'drome and it hit two of them as it passed over.

  I led the Squadron down and a dog fight began at deck level near Rheine aerodrome from which there was intense light flak.
  I found two ME 109's going round in a turn.  Eventually one straightened out and flew due east.
  I gave him a quick squirt from dead astern and saw strikes on the starboard wing. 
  Closing in further I fired again and this time there were strikes on the top of the cockpit and I saw that the hood was dragging.
  The e/a slowed, pulled up and he stalled in from about 20 feet.

       Lt. Helmut Beckmann of 3./JG 27 described the combat with 130 Squadron on 19 March 1945:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       In den letzten Tagen war es schon sehr schwer, berhaupt dem Platz herauszukommen, da der Tommy vom frhen Morgen bis zum Abend fast ununterbrochen unsere Pltze ausserhalb der Flakzone umflog, um uns mglichst gleich nach dem Start zu erwischen.
  Um diesem bel abzuhelfen, sollten wir auf einen Platz bei Lippstadt verlegen.
  Heute war es nun ruhig geblieben, da angeblich auf den Feindflugpltzen qbi wegen nebels herrschte.  So rollte ich mit meiner 3 Staffel zur befohlenen Zeit, etwa gegen 10.00 Uhr, an den Start, nachdem mir vom Gefechtsstand versichert wurde, dass unser Gebiet feindfrei sei.
  Nun weiss ich nur noch, dass ich Gas gegeben habe, einmal nach rechts rausschaute um festzustellen, ob alle acht Maschinen mitkamen, und dann riss der Film.
       <p>
        Als ich nach 36 Stunden im nahen Krankenhaus Neuenkirchen aufwachte, glaubte ich zunchst, ich sei in einen der frisch zugeschtteten Bombentrichter geraten und htte mich berschlagen.
  Wie erstaunt aber war ich, als ich mir am nchsten Tage von meinem mich besuchenden Staffeloffizier z.b.V. erzhlen lassen musste, was alles passiert war:
       </p>
       <p>
        Wir waren also mitten im Start, als ganz unangemeldet eine Staffel Spitfires ber den Platz raste und genau hinter uns sass.
  Bis auf die letzte Maschine, Uff Horst, der noch beim Rollen war und in Tiefstflug entkommen konnte, sind wir alle in kurzer Zeit abgeschossen worden, da wir ja wegen zu geringer Fahrt noch gar nicht handlungsfhig waren.
  Mein Katschmarek Oblt. Roth ist brennend abgestrzt und war sofort tot.
  Alle brigen sind mit Knochenbrchen und Verstauchungen, teilweise nach Fallschirmabsprngen, noch glimpflich davongekommen.
  Mich hat man im flachen Winkel in einen gegenber dem Platz liegenden Wald fallen sehen, wobei es so krachte, dass man annahm, es sei "kein Auge trocken geblieben".
  In der Nhe meiner Absturzstelle arbeitende Hftlinge haben mich dann zuerst gefunden und, bevor die Wachmannschaften heranwaren, grndlich gefilzt.
  Von einem, der die Absturzstelle spter gesehen hat, erfuhr ich, dass meine Machine zwischen zwei Bumen hindurch raste, an denen die Flchen hngen blieben, dann mit dem Motor durch den Stamm  eines mittleren Baumes schlug, wobei er ausgerissen wurde, und mit dem Schwanzende des verbleibenden Rumpfes so auf den Boden aufprallte, dass dieser hinter dem Tank noch einmal durchbrach.

An dem Mittelstck mit dem Tank hing ich dann, zum Glck fest angeschnallt, mit dem Kopf nach unten im weichen Moss, whrend mir dass Benzin des geplatzten Tanks den Rcken herunterlief, was durch das tzen Verbrennungen 2 Grades auf dem ganzen Rcken zur Folge hatte.
  Ausserdem hatte ich eine starke Prellung an der Innenseite des rechten Unterschenkels, wahrscheinlich durch das Herausbrechen der zwischen den Beinen liegenden Kanone hervorgerufen.
  Der Arzt, der mich untersuchte  ich soll mich dabei so gewehrt haben, da mich vier Mann halten muten, - sagte mir, dass aus meinem linken Auge einem stecknadelkopfgrossen Splitter enfernt habe.
  Ob das die Ursache meiner Bewusstlosigkeit war, ist mir allerdings nicht klar geworden.  Als wir am folgenden Tage wegen Fliegeralarm in den Keller mussten, hrte ich, wie hinter mir jemand, auf mich deutend, zu seinem Nachbarn sagte:
  "Das ist der, der immer geschrien hat:  Lasst mich doch los, ich bin ja lngst tot."

  They flew through Yellow Section so I called up and asked the Section what they were.
  The reply came "Huns".
  We broke into them and I could see that they were FW 190's of the long nosed variety.
  The Huns climbed into cloud, the base of which was about 4,000 ft. 
  We went after them and a dog fight followed with us chasing the Huns in and out of the cloud.
  Finally I got on the tail of one and from line astern opened fire.
  I saw strikes all round the cockpit and the engine and the e/a went over on its starboard wing and down to the ground.
  I saw it crash in a field just East of a little village and it caught fire.

       I was flying Yellow 3 with F/Sgt Woodman as Yellow 4, and the formation of eight aircraft was on an armed recce to the DUMMER LAKE - GUTERSLOH area.
  We were at 3,000 ft flying North when I saw about 15 aircraft at the same height coming towards us.
  I do not think they saw us and they passed us on our port side about 1,000 yards away.
  I identified them as FW 190's and my No 2 (F/Sgt Woodman) and I turned into them.
  We were then the first to attack.
  The Huns climbed for cloud, we climbed and passed through the Huns and they then came round back into us.
  I completed the circle and got on to one.
  I opened fire from about 300 yards at a angle off 30 and following strikes parts of the aircraft began to fall off.
  Then it caught fire and it went down vertically out of control with black smoke pouring from it.
  I last saw it at 1,000 ft going down vertically with flames and smoke coming from it and it would have been impossible for the pilot to have pulled out, that is if the pilot was still alive.
  I claim this e/a destroyed.
       <br/>
       Just as I broke away from this combat my guns stopped with the exception of one.
  I therefore climbed to 5,000 ft and I hung about up there.
  FW 190's kept popping up out of the cloud and I kept jumping on to them trying to get really on to one.
  Eventually one came along and from 20 angle off I fired from 250 yards.
  One cannon only was firing and as a result of my two second bursts I saw between 15 and 20 strikes all over the engine.
  Flame came from the engine and the Hun immediately went down into cloud and I lost him.
  I claim this second aircraft as probably destroyed.

  It finished up in a field where it continued to burn and there was just a mass of red embers.
  I claim this enemy aircraft destroyed.

       W/O Boulton states:- I saw this combat and after F/Sgt Woodman's attack the e/a came down falling to pieces and burning furiously.
  As it went down to the ground it passed within 50 yds of me and the whole thing was on fire.

  I saw him shoot down one of the aircraft and was at 3000 ft when I saw a FW 190 about 500 ft making for low cloud turning SOUTH.
  I immediately dived from above at 800 yds 45, fired a short burst into the enemy A/C which had just reached the low cloud.

       I was flying Red 5 on a parol of the Lingen area when I sighted and reported 12 plus e/a flying towards us on a westerly course.
  We broke into them and I attacked a ME 109 giving him a 3 second burest from 4/500 yards, 20 port deflection.

  At this time I had to break sharply to avaoid a long-nosed 190 who attacked from above.

       I engaged a F.W. 190 firing a 3/4 second burst from 150/200 yards 10/15 deflection port.

       When on patrol over LINGEN on course 350 we sighted about 20 F.W. 190 and 109 e/a.
  We broke into them to starboard, they broke and we followed.
  I chased one F.W. 190 into cloud and subsequently lost him.
  I and my No. 2 came below cloud and circled.
  A F.W. 190 broke cloud behind us during our second turn and I pulled up after him decreasing our range until the e/a fitted well into my Gyro Sight.
  On opening fire from line astern and long range (about 700 yards) I got in a 2 to 4 second burst seeing strikes all over the cockpit and wingroot, whereupon he started pouring thick black smoke and flicked to starboard and vanished into a cumulus cloud in a downward turn.
       <br/>
       I looked around to see if all was clear to follow him when I sighted a second 190 sitting right over the top of my a/c.
  I pulled up steeply and was closing too fast and steeply to use Gyro Sight.
  I just lined e/a up in the glass of the sight and fired from about line astern and 50 yards, observing strikes on both wings.
  E/A spun to starboard and I pulled my a/c to port to avoid him as my speed had dropped to less than 100 m.p.h.
  I claim 1 F.W. 190 damaged.  No more e/a were seen and we proceeded to base.  I claim 1 F.W. 190 probably destroyed and 1 F.W. 190 damaged.

  The W/Cdr led our section up sun where we waited for the E/A, which were ME 109's to take off.

  Debris flew up about 200 ft and as I flew through it my A/C was hit.
  I set course for base and on looking back I saw another explosion and there was a pillar of black smoke rising then to about 500 to 600 ft.

  Four A/C were hit and commenced to burn.
  I then orbited the aerodrome at 6,000 ft and saw several large explosions as the remainder of the tightly packed formations caught fire. 
  (In my opinion they were all bombed up).  All eleven aircraft were completely burned out and as we passed the aerodrome twenty minutes later a dense pall of smoke reached 10,000 ft.

      <blockquote>
       I was flying as Yellow four to S/L Shepherd D.F.C. when we saw 10 E/A at 6 o'clock below.
  We did a steep turn and dived down on to the E/A.
  I got on the tail of one and gave it a short burst at about 400 yards 45.
  I saw strikes on the fuselage and wing roots and the E/A tightened up his turn.
  When about 60 I gave another burst observing strikes on the cockpit, engine and starboard wing root.
  The E/A went into a shallow starboard dive and exploded in a sheet of flame on hitting the ground.
  The pilot did not bale out.  I claim one FW 190 destroyed.

       I was flying as Kudos Blue 5 on an Armed Recce in the area south of the MURITE LAKE.
  The section was flying north of a point about 32 miles up the BERLIN / WITTENBERGE road, when W/O Boscow reported an aircraft below at three o'clock.
  I saw the aircraft on a northerly course and recognized it as a long nosed FW 190.
       <br/>
       Blue 3 and 4 peeled down but overshot and were attacked by the FW 190,
 I followed down and using a gyro- sight fired a short burst from 40 astern to port at 200 yds seeing strikes.
  The FW 190 turned hard to port and I followed switching on my camera which I had omitted to do losing distance in the turn.
  I closed easily and opened fire from dead astern.
  At 300 yds at 1,000 ft, a 2 seconds burst, during which he flick rolled on to his back and baled out.
       <br/>
       The aircraft plunged into the BINENWALDE LAKE (U 3907) and the pilot landed in the trees of a wood to the S.E. and verge of the lake.
       <br/>
       I did not jettison my 45 gal. tank.
       <br/>
       FW markings and camouflage as usual.
       <br/>
       I claim one F.W. 190 destroyed.

       The Squadron was flying in formation as two sections.  Red section consisting of 4 A/C and led by F/L Muls, and Yellow section consisting of 3 A/C of which I was the leader, on a fighter sweep in the NAUEN - NEURUPPIN Area.
  At approx: 19.40 hours whilst on a north easterly course at 9,000 ft, Red 3 reported E/A below coming from the opposite direction.
  Yellow 2 immediately went down and I was on the point of doing so when I noticed 2 FW 190's coming towards me and my No. 3 slightly below us.
  I selected the one on the port side and made a sharp turn to port and gave a quick burst as E/A was overshooting me.
  I observed strikes on starboard mainplane.
  E/A then rolled on its back and in the process caught a long burst in its belly.
  E/A turned into a tight spiral and spun towards the ground when I saw it blow up.

  Yellow 2 F/Sgt Kicq went down and we were about to follow him when we noticed two more coming towards us on a reciprocal course and slightly below.
  Yellow leader and I went in to the attack - the leader taking the E/A on the port side and I selected the other one.
  The time was then about 19:40 hours.
  As soon as the E/A which I identified as a FW 190 saw me, it made a sharp turn to starboard and jettisoned its auxiliary tank.
  I turned to port and opening full throttle followed it as it started climbing very steeply.
  It then went on its back making a half roll during which time a had closed to within 200 yards.
 I fired twice a 2 second burst and E/A blew up.

  When in the NAUEN area I saw four F.W. 190's going in the opposite direction South below, but owing to R/T being in use was unable to report them for the moment.
  Eventually Yellow Section went down on them, and I was about to follow when I saw a F.W. 190 coming down on me from above.
  I pulled to one side skidding and he overshot me.
  I turned in and gave him a two second burst at about 100 yards closing and climbing slightly and turning starboard.
  I saw strikes on the engine and cockpit.  I broke away to avoid the debris.
  The pilot of the F.W. 190 left the cockpit but no parachute was seen to open.

  They were in line abreast at 30 yards interval some 300 yards from me.
  Every time I closed in the one on the Port side turned to Port followed 3 or 4 seconds afterwards by the other one.

       I was Blue 3 in a section of 4 aircraft on an Armed Recce to the KREMMEN area, and at 1510, when at 5,500 feet I saw approximately 8 aircraft above approaching on our starboard side.
  They were FW 190's of the long-nosed variety.
  We broke round on them and two of the e/a broke upwards and started to turn together.
  I got in shots at one of them from 100 yards at about 20 degrees angle off and I saw strikes round the wing roots and cockpit.
  The e/a caught fire and the pilot baled out.
  I claim this e/a destroyed.
       <br/>
       Afterwards I called Blue 1 and asked him where he was and he said he was down below with two of them.
  I dived down and started to turn with them.
  I got behind the second one and gave him a short burst from about 75 yards from 20 degrees off.
  I saw strikes round the cockpit.
  We were then at 3,000 feet and the e/a dived down at an angle of 40 degrees with smoke pouring out and it was still diving when I last saw it at 1,000 feet.
  I claim this e/a probably destroyed.
       <br/>
       I did not follow this aircraft down any further because I wanted to get the other one which was still turning with Blue 1.
  When the pilot of this e/a saw me coming up behind, he broke down.
  I fired at him as he was going down and I saw strikes on his starboard wing.
 My cannon ammunition had run out but I chased the e/a for about 10 miles firing with my machine guns only.
  I saw strikes on the fuselage and then my .303 ran out.
  I followed him for about another 5 miles and then gave up the chase.

       I was flying Red 6 and we were on an armed recce in the LUBECK - WISMAR area.
  At about 17.35 we were at 6,000 ft when I saw a F.W. 190 at 1,000 ft going West near HAGENOW.
  It was first attacked by Red 3 (F/O Trevarrow) and Red 5 W/O Miller without result.
  The e/a had gone down to about 50 ft when Red 5 broke away and the e/a broke right.
  I fired at once from about 150 yds full deflection and I saw strikes on the wing roots and cockpit.
  The e/a turned and went down in a gradual dive.
  I fired at him again as he went down and I saw him crash into a field.
  I claim this e/a destroyed.
       <p>
        W/O Miller confirms the claim:  He says: I saw W/O Coverdale firing full deflection.
  I saw the e/a crash into a field and turn over on it side.

       I was leading Blue Section at 1935 hrs we were 6000' West of RECHLIN Airfield when I saw 2 E/A crossing over the 'drome heading N.E.
  The Section started to attack these when I observed three or four F.W. 190's with wheels down about to land.
  I went for these and closed in on the last one firing from dead astern.
  I just had time to observe strikes and a big flash from the tail of the E/A.
  I was closing so fast I had to pull away.
  I did not see the E/A crash but Sgt Lewis who was orbitting the arifield saw the E/A which I had fired at, go in, crash, and catch fire.

       On the 25th April I was Red 4 in a section of 4 A/C led by S/L Walmsley and engaged on an armed recce in the WISMAR - ROSTOCK area.
  At approximately 12.50 hrs. a gaggle of 20+ E/A was sighted some 15 miles west of MURITZ LAKE at 8,000 ft.
  We were flying at 7,000 ft at the time on a course of 140 (M); apart from the four rear ones flying as a four two abreast,
 remaining E/A did not seem to be flying any particular course nor in any sort of formation.
  I had jettisoned my auxiliary tank as soon as E/A were reported.
  I opened full throttle and followed Red Leader as he went in first to attack.
  I selected two E/A on the port side which I identified as FW 190's, flying in line astern and started chasing them as they dived down.
  I closed in very quickly behind them and fired one long burst 5 sec. at the rear one from dead astern within 250 - 200 yds.
  I observed strikes on cockpit and on wing roots and debris flew off E/A with black smoke pouring out.
  The E/A went on its side and pilot baled out - a fraction of a second aferwards E/A blew up in the air.
  I claim this FW 190 destroyed.
       <br/>
       I resumed the chase for the front E/A which was at the time some 400 - 500 yds in front of me.
  I closed in and when within a range of 300 - 250 yds I gave another long burst with cannon and .5 machine gune fire - 6 second -, and saw strikes on fuselge and mainplane.
  E/A flicked and spun in towards the ground where it blew up.
   I did not see the pilot bale out.
  I orbitted the spot where the E/A crashed to make doubly sure the E/A was destroyed.

      <blockquote>
       I was Red 4 in a section of 4 A/C led by S/L Walmsley engaged on an armed recce in the PRITZWALW - WUSTROW Area.
  At about 13.00 hours whilst flying North at 7,000 ft in the PLAUER LAKE area, Red Leader reported E/A at 2 o'clock some 4 - 5,000 yds ahead flying North, north east and climbing, Red leader ordered the chase and we started climbing after them.
  We caught up with E/A, three of them, and still climbing, and when within a range of some thousand yards and some 1,000 ft below them, the E/A on the port side made a 180 turn to port to attack us from above.
  We allowed E/A which we identified as a FW 190 to come within range of 600 -700 yds and then climbed steeply and got on its tail.
  The E/A then made a 360 climbing turn but in doing so stalled.  We then saw the pilot bale out and the FW went spinning down towards the ground.
  This FW 190 is claimed destroyed by the four pilots of Red Section.
       <br/>
       We had by then lost sight of the other E/A. We set a course south and after a few minutes flight, slighted the two E/A at our own height (8000 ft) at 2 o'clock some 3,000 yds away.
  They did not seem to be steering any particular course but appeared to be orbitting a point some 5 miles N.W. of WITTSTOCK.  We closed in towards them and as soon as they caught sight of us, they flew a south easterly course line abreast gradually losing height.
  I had jettisoned my auxiliary tank when E/A were first reported and so I was able to catch up with these, also identified as FW 190's, the chase went on around the NEURUPPIN Aerodrome, which we reached at a height of less than 100 ft.
  When within a range of some 300 yds the E/A on the starboard side broke starboard with the apparent aim of getting on my tail.
  Meanwhile I had opened fire at some 300 - 250 yds at a 5 - 10 angle off on the port side E/A.
  I observed numerous strikes on the port wing.
  E/A then flicked violently to port and crashed into the trees at Z 4885.
       <br/>
       I then broke port as I thought that the other E/A was on my tail but it had disappeared.
  I called to Red Leader and rejoined the formation at 5,000 ft west of NEURUPPIN whence we set course for base.  I claim this FW 190 destroyed.

       I was flying as Blue 2 orbiting SCHWERIN aerodrome at 8,000' when F/Lt. Gaze saw 10 plus FW 190s.
  We tried unsuccessfully to drop our tanks and dived onto E/A that were about 3000' severeral of which promptly dropped their bombs on SCHWERIN.
  I saw F/Lt Gaze get into the tail of one but overshot as the E/A rolled over and went down.
  I throttled right back and went into fine pitch as I rolled over and followed E/A, which pulled up in a steep port climbing turn leaving wing tip trails.
  I fired a 3 second burst at him in the turn, but with incorrect deflection.
  I still had too much speed and had to roll around his tail as he straightened up.
  E/A was still doing gentle turn to port, when I fell in behind him again firing a two second burst from 250 yards, but missed.
  Opening up I closed to 50 yards, where I could clearly see that the E/A had a bomb under the belly.
  I gave him a two second burst, seeing strikes over the engine and cockpit.
  E/A immediately blew up and I ducked in my cockpit as I had to get through the wreckage.
  I felt the intense heat on my head and shoulders and everything was red.
  As I looked up, there was a bit of blazing wreckage falling into the buildings of SCHWERIN aerodrome and bits of flame trickling off my wings.
  The engine was vibrating badly so I got an emergency homing.  
  On returning I had to land fast as my A/C was wallowing.
  When I got out, one propeller blade tip was missing and most of the fabric on the elevators and rudders was burnt off.
  There were also little dents and holes all over the A/C.
       <br/>
       During the combats the E/A panicked and went into cloud.  One of them presumably lost control and spun in bursting into flames which I claim shared with F/Lt Gaze.

  I rapidly overshot the e/a so I pulled up, did a sharp turn to the left and came down on the e/a again, firing at him with my .5's as my 20 mm had run out.
  I saw some strikes round the wing roots and the engine.
  I overshot him again and I had to break hard to avoid colliding with the e/a.
  The next thing I saw was a parachute come out and the aircraft crashed into a wood.

        I claim this e/a destroyed shared with P/O Edwards.

      <blockquote>
       I was leading Blue section on a patrol in the Wittenburg-Ludwigslust area.
  We were flyig at 2,000 feet going south, when at 0945 I saw nine FW 190's short nose at zero feet going S/W.
  We were near Banzkow.
  We dived on to them and attacked them from astern.
  They continued to fly straight and level.
  I selected the last one in the bunch and opened fire from 700 yards and saw strikes on the tail and the fuselage.
  I gave two short bursts, closing to 300 yards and saw more strikes.
  I must have caught the engine because the e/a slowed right down, turned to port and made a force landing, wheels up, in a field near Salstorf.
  I then went after another e/a, and again making use of my gyro sight opened fire from 600 yards at an angle off of about 20 degrees.
  I saw strikes on the tail.  I closed to about 400 yards and fired again from the same angle off.
  As I saw strikes so the e/a blew up in the air.
  I then returned to where I had seen the first one force land, and with my No 2 went in to finish it off.
  I fired but saw no strikes.
  My No 2 (F/O Trevorrow) attacked and as he fired and got strikes the aircraft caught fire.
  I claim one FW 190 destroyed and one FW 190 destroyed shard with F/O Trevorrow.
       <p>
        F/O Trevorrow says:  I was flying Blue 2 to F/Lt Stowe.
  I saw him get strikes on the first e/a.
  He hit it on the tail and in the fuselage.
  It emitted smoke and force landed in a field.
  I followed my No 1 and he got on the tail of a second e/a.
  He gave it a short squirt and it blew up in the air.
  It went down into a field where it dissmeinated.
  We then went back to where the first one had force landed.
  I fired at it and it immediately went up in flames.
  I claim one FW 190 destroyed shared with F/Lt Stowe.

       I was leading Red section of 3 A/C on a Patrol in the WITTENBURG - LUDWIGSLUST area.

  At about 1045 hrs Red 3 (F/Lt Bangerter) reported A/C at zero feet flying S.W.;
  We were at about 8000' at the time and flying N.W.
  On investigating I saw some 30 plus E/A flying in two loose boxes.
  I led the section down out of the sun and engaged the E/A in the first box.
  I and No. 2 (F/Sgt Gigot) closed behind 3 E/A which I identified at F.W. 190s (Long nosed) to a range of about 100 yards.
  I opened fire on the Port E/A with a short burst dead astern.
  There were many strikes and No. 2 states that it rolled over and crashed into flames.
  At the time an E/A landing on a strip East of a wood at T/4554, worried by our arrival, cartwheeled and broke up on the strip.
  I claim the first F.W.190 Destroyed, and the second one claimed destroyed, shared by myself, Red 2 (F/Sgt Gigot) and Red 3 (F/Lt Bangerter).
  Meanwhile the main body of E/A had formed a great defensive circle over the strip.
  I made a series of passes at them; I was now alone.
  Shortly after Red 3 joined me and flew my No. 2.
  I engaged a FW 190 (short nosed) fires a long burst from dead astern and covered its starboard wing with strikes.
  It wallowed badly and crashed into the wood by the strip in flames.
  Confirmed by F/Lt Bangerter.  I claim this FW 190 Destroyed.
  I turned across the strip and strafed another FW 190 which was standing surrounded by personnel.
  I observed strikes and some smoke.  I claim this FW 190 Damaged.

  Flying N.W. at 8000' from the Patrol line I reported A/C below flying S.W. very low.
  Red 1 and 2 dived to attack and shortly afterwards Red 1 reported a second Gaggle of some 10 plus E/A behind the first gaggle.
  I positioned myself to attack an E/A on the extreme starboard side of the second formation.
  I dived on it - E/A identified as F.W.190, turned to Port.
  I gave a long burst but failed to obtain strikes.
  An attack on another E/A was unsuccessful.
  After this Red 2 called up saying he was returning to base as he had run out of ammo, so I found No.1.
  Shortly afterwards I saw an F.W.190 which he had been attacking, crash in flames in a wood nearby.
  I fired at another F.W.190 just as it was turning to Port some 300 yards ahead of me using two rings of the ring and bead of the Gyro sight.
  It straightened out, and then crashed in flames in the wood, confirmed by Red 1.
  Whilst I had been attacking an aircraft of the second gaggle, most of the remainder of both gaggles had formed a defensive circle over a landing strip at T/4854.
  After joining Red 1 I found myself astern of a FW 190, so throttled back, it commenced to weave violently, I followed without firing until it flicked and crashed in a clearing by the strip and went up in flames.

       I was flying as Kudos Red 4, but became separated from my section whilst identifying an aircraft.
  I decided to scout round Schwerin airfield before returning to base.
  I climbed to about 24,000 ft and worked around to the East along the Baltic coast, turning South at Rostock and finally decending to below the 7,000 cloud base and apporaching Schwerin from the East after jettisoning my 45 gallon tank.
  There was a 1000 ft blanket of thick, dark cloud over the lake area.
  Flying at 6,000 ft I observed nine plus FW 190's in no orderly formation, nipping in and out of the cloud above.
  I climbed to attack to rearmost of the gaggle, but found the two leaders on my tail firing at me.
  I evaded the formost in a climbing turn through the cloud, then swiftly descended again and found one FW in view.
  I attacked this one using the gyro sight, he climbed and my gyro sight disappeared below my vision, however I contined to pull my nose straight through whilst firing and observed strikes about the cockpit.
  The e/a went into a tight spiral towards the ground but I didn't attempt to follow up my attack until I saw it straighten out on an easterly course.
  I then pursued closing rapidly saw him jettison his hood, losing height all the time and finally bale out, I believe too low for the parachute to open fully.
  The e/a crashed in flames and I observed the pilot a motionless figure on the ground beside his chute.
  I used the independent camera switch and took film of the e/a on dive towards the ground and also burning on the ground S.W. of Plau.
  I climbed up above the cloud once again, making towards Schwerinen.
  Flying at about 200 ft above the layer I was attacked from astern by a FW.190 who I presume had been lurking just below the top of the cloud.
  I evaded by diving through cloud, the e/a did not follow.
  Whilst still diving I found myself over Schwerinen lake and observed two aircraft below flying N. in close line abreast, low over the water.
  I continued my dive towards them and recognised them as FW.190s, preparing to fire at them at 800 yards behind them I saw the left hand e/a turn sharply into the other.
  The two e/a, interlocked and plunged into the northerly waters of the lake, the cause, presumably, panic.
  I had informed Kenway control and also my C.O. leading another Kudos section of the Hun's position.
  I found the maltese cross markings on the first batch of e/a very difficult to discern against the dark green camouflage.

      <blockquote>
       On the 1st of May I was flying as Blue 2 in a section of 6 a/c engaged in a patrol in the Wittenburg - Ludwigslust area, and led by F/L Muls.
  At about 17.50 hrs Blue 5 reported e/a on the deck flying W just underneath us.
  We were at the time also flying west at 10,000 ft.
  Blue Leader told Blue 5 to go down and we followed him since we had not seen the aircraft.
  At height of about 6000 - 5000 ft we observed that there were some 20 + E/A which we immediately identified as FW 190's, flying in sections of three.
  I followed my No 1 as he went down on to the section on the extreme starboard side of the formation.
  He picked the port one of the section and I chased the starboard one as it was trying to break away starboard at tree top height.
  I fired a 2 second burst at a 20 degree angle off from a range of a 100 yds.
  I observed hits on cockpit, throttled back as I was going to overshoot, turned into line astern and gave three short bursts from about 80 yds, pieces flew off and I saw a big explosion in the cockpit, the E/A crashed into a field where it blew up.
  I claim this E/A destroyed.
  After having dealt with the first E/A (FW 190) I broke away to starboard climbing to about 300 ft when I noticed another FW 190 coming from starboard to port some 200 yds away.
  I turned into it and gave a short burst with a large angle deflection shot (about 45 degrees) from 200 - 150 yds.
  I did not observe any strikes and E/A started making a rather steep climbing turn to port.
  I followed it, and closed in to about 150 yds at 2,000 ft.
  I gave a quick burst from 25 degrees to 30 degrees off.
  I saw strikes on fuselage.
  It turned over and went straight down over Schwerin town, pulled up and started weaving at roof top height I followed it and closed in to about 120 yds and gave a 2 sec burst from line astern slightly above.
  I observed some more strikes on fuselage and cockpit and black smoke pouring out.
  As there was much flak at the time I started climbing steeply and when at 8,000 ft made for base.
  E/A climbed to 800 ft and pilot baled out.
  I claim this 2nd FW 190 also destroyed.

      <blockquote>
       I was flying Blue 5 in a section of 6 aircraft led by F/L Muls, and engaged on a patrol in the WITTENBURG-LUDWIGSLUST area.
  At approximately 1750 hrs as we were flying West at 10,000 ft in the Schweriner lake area, I reported some aircraft also flying West at nought feet below.
  I went down to investigate, followed by the rest of the section.
  As I drew near I identified these aircraft as being FW 190s, mostly short-nosed, and flying in sections of three.
       <br/>
       I chose the most forward section on the extreme port side, and selected the port E/A.
  I overshot owing to my diving speed, and after climbing a short distance to lose the speed, I came back again behind the same E/A.
  When within a range of about 300 yards, I fired a half-second burst from a 10 angle deflection, without noticing any strikes.
  At the same time I observed that I was nearer to the middle E/A of the section, so went behind it and fired a three second burst from dead astern at a range of 150 yards.
  I saw two explosions, one on each side of the fuselage; the E/A then started climbing steeply to starboard and I followed; pilot of E/A jettisoned the hood, rolled his aircraft on its back and baled out from about 1000 ft.
  The E/A went spinning towards the ground and crashed into a wood at M/R T4569.
       <br/>
       I claim this FW 190 destroyed, confirmed by Blue 6 F/L Bangerter.

      <blockquote>
       I was leading a section of 2 aircraft on a Tac/R mission in the Wismar  Schwerin area.  I Tac/Rd the roads from Schwerin to Wismer, flew east of the town and was making a 180 turn over the harbor at 1500 to get below some scattered cloud, when I observed two aircraft which presumably had just taken off the Wismar Airfield as they were at 800/1000 feet flying in a northerly direction and gaining height.  I immediately turned into the aircraft, and recognized them as FW.190s.  I at once closed and made a stern attack on the E/A on the left.  When at approximately 400 yds. I opened fire with a 3 second burst of .5 M.G. and cannon breaking off at approximately 250 yds.  many strikes were seen along the E/As fuselage, from the pilots position to the engine.  Pieces fell off and the E/A rolled on its back and disappeared into a cloud going straight down with a large amount of black smoke streaming from it.
       <br/>
       The other E/A had crossed beneath me and was being attacked by my No. 2, F/O Fuller.  I saw my No. 2s burst hitting the water and at the same time noticed an oily patch about 75 feet wide on the water and some debris in it which appeared to be parts of wreckage of the E/A which I had just attacked.  This was the approximate area that the E/A would have likely gone into.  The E/A being attacked by my No. 2 did a steep orbit and my No. 2 being unable to overtake it broke away.   I went after this E/A which had straightened out and was heading for the shore.  I made an astern attack and when at 300 yards opened fire with .5 MG and cannon using about a 5 second burst and breaking off at 150 yards, owing to pieces of the e/a hitting my aircraft  one cracking my windscreen.  A large number of strikes were seen and just before the E/A hit the ground, it burst into flames.
       <br/>
       No evasive action was taken by the first E/A and only moderate by the second E/A, weaving and turning.

       I was on a Tac/R mission which I was unable to complete owing to weather.
  I lost my No. 2 in the cloud and instructed him to return to base.  I went below cloud and while flying WEST at 0 at 1310 I sighted one FW190 flying NORTH at 50 at 100 plus m.p.h.
  I broke starboard and rapidly closed on his tail.  I opened fire at 250 yds using approximately 25 port deflection and closed to 100 yds.  I saw strikes on the fuselage and the e/a went straight in.
  Immediately in front I saw another FW190 which I overtook very rapidly and obtained only a short burst, opening fire at 50 yds. 
 I saw strikes on the a/c but was unable to observe the results due to the speed at which I passed him.  A further FW190 was immediately ahead and I opened fire at 200 yds and closed to 50 yds.  I saw strikes and flames and then observed port wing falling off.
  Once again there was another FW190 immediately in line and I opened fire at 200 yds closing to 100 yds.  I saw strikes on the e/a which broke to port began to pour black smoke and broke into flame.  I then broke starboard and saw 2 Me108s flying line abreast, South, at approximately 50.
  One broke starboard and one port.  I closed on the one which broke starboard opening fire at 200 yds and overshot, but obtained strikes on the a/c.  He continued to break starboard and I broke port and closed on the other Me108.  I opened fire at 200 yds closing to 50 yds.  I saw strikes and the a/c went in and exploded on the ground.

       On 14/2/45 I was leading Wavey Black section of two aircraft on standing patrol over NIJMEGEN.
  At about 1630 hours I sighted an Arado 234 pulling up from attacking the CLEVE area.
  I dropped my tank and attempted to intercept but despite the fact that I cut the corner it pulled away easily at 7,000 ft.
  After this we continually chased Arados over this area.
  I fired at two without result.
  At about 1700 hours when it was apparent that the jets were diving down through the cloud which was from 9 - 11,000 ft. I climbed up through it, leaving Black 2 below, hoping to warn him when they dived.
  Then I did an orbit at 13,000 ft. to clear off the ice on the windscreen and sighted 3 M.E. 262's in Vic formation passing below me at cloud top level.
  I dived down behind them and closed in, crossing behind the formation and attacked the port aircraft which was lagging slightly.
  I could not see my sight properly as we were flying straight into the sun, but fired from dead astern, at a range of 350 yards, hitting it in the starboard jet with the second burst;
 at which the other 2 aircraft immediately dived into cloud.
  It pulled up slowly and turned to starboard and I fired obtaining more strikes on fuselage and jet which caught fire.
  The enemy rolled over on to its back and dived through cloud.
  I turned 180 and dived after it, calling on the R/T to warn my no.2; on breaking cloud I saw an aircraft hit the ground and explode about a mile ahead of me, at E.9859.
  I claim this M.E.262 destroyed.  Black 2 also witnessed this explosion.

       I took off from B.80 at 0702 as Blue 1 with F/Sgt Kelly as Blue 2, to patrol Nijmegan.
  At approx. 0735 Planet reported a Jet aircraft N.E. of Weert.
  I flew towards Weert in thin layers of cloud, then returned towards Nijmegen still between cloud layers.
  On emerging near Nijmegan saw a single aircraft about one mile in front and about 1000 ft. above.
  I immediately gave chase instructing my No. 2 to slow down and drop his jet tank, being unable to do so myself due to high speed.
  The E/A turned slightly to Starboard and continued towards the North East, weaving slightly from time to time.
  I kept out of the enemy pilot's view by keeping under his tail plane and slowly overhauled him at an I.A.S. of 340 m.p.h. at 8/9000 ft.
  Whilst astern of the E/A I was only able to say it was jet propelled and not an Me.262 (or Meteor).
  I closed to 100 yards or less, firing with .5 M.G. and cannon whilst still overtaking.
  I saw strikes on the Port wing, Port jet engine and fuselage.
  E/A immediately emmitted dense clouds of brownish smoke, possibly jet exhaust.
  I continued firing and saw flshes in the smoke, breaking away at extremely close range, and being hit in the port radiator by debris.
  I next saw E/A going down in a wide spiral to Starboard with white smoke or vapour pouring from holes all along the Port wing, and dark smoke from the fuselage.
  I could then see the long nose of the a/c and the straight tapered wings with rounded tips and identified E/A as an Arado 234.
  A large piece of E/A suddenly flew off, and one person baled out, parachute opening.
  E/A steepened its dive and crashed somewhere near Enschede, being completely destroyed by explosion.
  Some fire from the ground was seen at this time.
  I returned to patrol being rejoined by my No. 2 who witnessed the destruction of this enemy a/c.

       I was leading Kudos Blue Section of six aircraft and had finished attacking a train near NEUMUNSTER and was orbitting with the rest of my section at 6,000 ft.
  prior to turning for a course for home, when I observed two ME 262's flying in line abreast, in an Easterly direction.
  I reported these aircraft and turned in sharply after them, as they passed over the top of me, at the same time jettisoning my long range petrol tank.
  The E/A were then 1-2,000 yards ahead and they opened up and dived for the deck.
  I followed them doing 440 mph in the dive and 400 mph on the deck and was closing slowly.
  The A/C were heading straight for LUBECK and obviously intended to lead us over flak area and it was obvious that we should not catch them before this happened.
  I then pulled up to 3,000 ft and observed the E/A making for the aerodrome south of LUBECK.
  The ME 262 on the starboard side did a turn to starboard and put his wheels and flaps down with the intention of doing a right hand circuit to land west to east.
  I was therefore able to cut him off and make a short head on attack.
  No results were observed.
  I then broke sharply to port and was able to make a 60 beam attack as he continued in his circuit.
  I observed strikes in the cockpit area and between the starboard nacelle and the fuselage, and a large sheet of flame issued from this point.
  The pilot of the E/A then landed his machine on the grass beside the runway where it slewed round to starboard and volumes of white smoke issued from it.
  The other machine landed on the runway in the opposite direction (W-E) and it appeared that either the starboard tyre burst,
 or the starboard leg collapsed for the aircraft slewed round off the runway on to the grass, dragging its starboard wing tip on the ground.
  Final results of the fire on the first ME 262 were not observed owing to intense light flak from the aerodrome defences.
       <br/>
       I claim 1 ME 262 probably destroyed and 1 ME 262 damaged.
