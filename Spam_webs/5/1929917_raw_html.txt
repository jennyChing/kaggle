        <strong>
         Life isnt aboutfinding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. ~George Bernard Shaw
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        I wanted a guarantee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wanted to know for sure that if I tried to do something, I would like it; if I devoted my limited time to it, Id end up somewhere good.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and I felt certain this was a phenomenal failingbecause if you dont know
        <em>
         right now
        </em>
        what you need to do to make your life count, life will pass you by before youve ever had a chance to do something meaningful or valuable. At least, thats what I thought back then.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I sat around thinking, analyzing, trying to identify something big enough or
        <a href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/7-things-to-remember-when-you-think-youre-not-good-enough/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tinybuddha.com/blog/7-things-to-remember-when-you-think-youre-not-good-enough/', 'good enough']);" title="7 Things to Remember When You Think You're Not Good Enough">
         good enough
        </a>
        , terrified that maybe Id spend the rest of my days feeling purposeless, useless, on the fringe; doing the same thing in my professional life as Id always done in my personal life: feeling like I was on the outside looking in.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         When youre sitting amid a vast expanse of possibilities, in the pressure cooker of expectations and impatience, it can feel almost paralyzing.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        What step do you take when you have a hunch but no solid sense of direction? If its only a hunch, then
        <a href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/finding-direction-when-youre-not-sure-what-choice-is-right/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tinybuddha.com/blog/finding-direction-when-youre-not-sure-what-choice-is-right/', 'maybe its the wrong direction']);" title="Finding Direction When You're Not Sure Which Choice is &quot;Right&quot;">
         maybe its the
         <em>
          wrong
         </em>
         direction
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        And what if you go in the wrong direction? Then you will have wasted time, and time is finite. And everyone else is so far ahead. Everyone else seems happy and successful. Everyone else is climbing the ladder, earning more money, making a difference,
        <em>
         mattering
        </em>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        What if you never matter? What if you never do anything important? And worst of all, what if you never have more than a hunch about whats important to you?
       </p>
       <p>
        What if you never feel a spark, a purpose, that elusive why that so many people write about?
       </p>
       <p>
        What if you never care about anything so strongly that it becomes the bliss you have to follow?
       </p>
       <p>
        Sitting in the Times Square Internet caf over a decade ago, searchingCraigslist for jobs and gigs, I felt a sense of panic and urgency. I needed to figure it out, and fast.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         I was blinded by the fear of never finding what I was looking for, and that made the lookingawfully ineffective.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        I thought there was something wrong with me for being so uncertain, so resistant, so unable to identify and commit to any path.
       </p>
       <p>
        In retrospect, I see
        <a href="http://tinybuddha.com/blog/10-ways-i-know-theres-nothing-wrong-with-you-or-me/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tinybuddha.com/blog/10-ways-i-know-theres-nothing-wrong-with-you-or-me/', 'there was nothing wrong with me']);" title="10 Ways I Know There's Nothing Wrong with You (or Me)">
         there was nothing wrong with me
        </a>
        , or where I was in life. And there was nothing wrong with living in the maybe, looking for new possibilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wasnt ineffective because I didnt yet feel a strong internal pull. I was ineffective because I consistently marinated my brain in anxious, self-judging thoughts.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         My biggest obstacle wasnt that I felt lost; it was that I felt I shouldnt be. I felt I should have known, right then, not only what I wanted to do but also how I was going to do it.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Because without knowing those two things, I felt adrift and incredibly out of control. How can you let yourself ease into the moment if you cant be sure its leading to a better one?

        If I were to walk into that Internet caf and approach my younger self, she would probably ignore me, immersed as she was in her frantic searching.
       </p>
       <p>
        But if I somehow had the power to command her attention, Id tell her a few things that maybe, just maybe, could relieve her constant worrying and provide both of peace of mind and focus.

       <h4>
        <strong>
         Youll never be effective if youre convinced tomorrow needs to be better than today because this belief stems from resistance to the presentand the present is where your power lies.
        </strong>
       </h4>
       <p>
        If youre looking for purpose from a place of inadequacy, you will likely be too overwhelmed by the need to do something big, that matters to the world at large, to identify what matters to you personally and start taking tiny steps toward it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of looking for a guarantee that tomorrow will be valuable, know that
        <em>
         today
        </em>
        is valuablethat youre not wasting time because you dont yet feel a sense of purpose. Youre using time well by starting (or continuing) the process of discovering it.

        And besides, what story will be more interesting to flash before your eyes in the end: one that unfolded in ways you never expected, with unique twists and turns; or, one that followed a specific, predetermined timeline with predictable steps from milestone to milestone?

         The best way to find direction is to trust your instinctsinstead offorcing yourself to do things because you think you should.

         Your intuition is a powerful compass
        </a>
        , and even if you think you arent making progress, if youre following your instincts, you are.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are always going to be opportunities that look good on paper; and that little, scared voice within may tell you that your life will only matter if you take them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other people may also tell you this, if not directly, indirectly; or, you may assume theyre thinking this, when really, theyre too immersed in their own confusing journey to pass judgment on yours for long.
       </p>
       <p>
        But sometimes the best opportunities are the ones you dont take, leaving yourself open for choices that better align with your own values and priorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know this may sound as impossible as growinganother lung, but try not to worry so much about what other people might think. They may have expectations, but they arent living inside your mind, or feeling your instincts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only one who can make wise decisions for you is you, and even if it makes you feel anxious at times, you will eventually thank yourself for being brave enough to follow your heart, not someone elses head.

         When it comes to creating purpose, there truly is no wrong decision.
        </strong>
       </h4>
       <p>
        You may think you only have one purpose and that you need to push yourself to find it. And you can continue thinking this, if youre okay with feeling chronically pressured and scared.
       </p>
       <p>
        Or, instead of aiming to discover the one thing youre supposed to do with your life, you could focus on discovering the one thing you want to try
        <em>
         right now
        </em>
        , knowing that you can change direction any time. And that changing direction wont be something to be ashamed of; it wont mean you failed at discovering your purpose before. It will mean you had one purpose then, and now your purpose has evolved.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will mean youre brave enough to

          yourself
         </em>
         evolve

        , repeatedly undertaking the sometimes-terrifying process of discovering what else you can do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maybe that in itself can be a purposeto live life in that vulnerable, uncertain place where youre not boxed into one way of being; unencumbered by the need to define yourself and your place in the world; free to roam when it would feel much safer to tether yourself to one role.
       </p>
       <p>

       <p>
        Ten years ago I thought I was a failure because I hadnt done anything that felt important. I now know it was
        <em>
         all
        </em>
        important, and not just because it brought me to this site.
       </p>
       <p>
        All those steps were important because those steps were my life. And my life is valuable and worth enjoying regardless of what I do professionally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ironically, adopting this mindset makes it so much easier to create meaning in life, because suddenly its not about what you
        <em>
         have
        </em>
        to do. Its about what you want to do. Its about where your hearts pulling you in this moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        And thats what it means to find directionto follow those pulls, without a guarantee, knowing that the goal isnt to end up somewhere good but to learn to recognize the good in this very moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This moment isnt merely the bridge to where you want to be. This momentthis crucial part of the processis a destination in itself, and now is your only opportunity to appreciate it, and appreciate yourself for living it.

           Really great post Lori!  I particularly like your line when it comes to creating purpose, there truly is no wrong decision.  I like your choice of the word creating.  Too many of us are trying to find our purpose.  So we waste time, hoping that somehow that purpose will somehow magically find us.  Meanwhile we could have been creating our purpose this whole time.
          </p>
          <p>
           And as you say, there truly is no wrong decision.  What matters, in my opinion, is that we commit to our chosen purpose and put energy into making it work.  All the while holding loosely so that we can change direction if/when the need arises.

           This is such an amazing post! I was just thinking about how I have achieved nothing in this summer vacation but its because I was always living in the tomorrow trying to figure out what big thing I can do and change my life. I forgot to live in the present! Although now I can change me mindset thanks to this great article. Thank you so much Lori xxx

           Wow Lori. I feel like I could have written this article. Im going through this process right now, and its even worse because I feel like Ive already found my passion (singing) because nothing else has ever made me feel the joy I feel when Im performing, and yetrejection after rejection, for over a year now. Im almost at my breaking point and I feel a mix of resentment, defiance, and yet resignation. To be honest I cant even picture a future without the stage, but circumstances seem to be forcing me to explore other options. In some way I think that this hurts even more than being directionless-being able to see your vision so clearly and yet having it be out of reach and watching others grabbing opportunities that you KNOW you could excel at.

           Hi Lori, Ive been an avid supporter of tiny buddha, the articles contributed here have helped and support me in ways that you cant imagine, &amp; I only wish that theres such a platform when I was younger with depression. And this article in particular has prompted me to comment and share with you how much your writing tugged my heart and at some point made me tear. The vulnerability is so familiar that it still haunts me. This year has been full of surprises so far, i lost an important relationship, still cant secure a job after 6 months of job-hunting, and losing myself. Even though I have the other articles to accompany through my doubtful times, none have been as accurate as this. Thank you, for writing this, for letting me come to terms, and giving me the courage to step into the unknown after seeing how successful you are. I am going to quit my job end of this month and embark on a solo europe trip. Im not sure what lies ahead, but I know its better to move to the unknown than remain comfortably with a steady but doubtful job, waiting in the fog. Thank you once again, Lori.

           Thanks Ed! Regarding the pursuit of finding our purpose, I liken it to the hunt for our one soul mate. Whenever we convince ourselves theres only right choice, and we may somehow fail at finding it, we create immense pressure that shuts us down to the many possibilities available to us. Ironic, for sure, that looking can be the barrier to finding.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hold loosely is wonderful advice! We are ever evolving, so it makes sense that our values, priorities, and desires would evolve, as well!

           I just want to be of service, really. By living my passion and inspiring others through my work, my life story, helping others to identify their higher purpose, to help them healso many things. I see myself being a healer, perhaps a motivational speaker, a trainer, a teacher, and also a performer. I cant shake the deep knowing I have inside of me that my gifts play a big part in what Im here to do, so thats why Im having so much trouble accepting this stagnation.

           I just lost my job and am taking two days to myself before trying out at a new place, and I was feeling as though I should be doing it RIGHT NOW, and that I should have more plans if each job I try to get fails, which could go on forever! This post is just what I needed right now! In this uncertain time of my life, there is nothing wrong with not knowing where Im heading or not jumping to it right away and wasting time. It makes me feel as if Im not a failure

           And thats what it means to find directionto follow those pulls, without a guarantee, knowing that the goal isnt to end up somewhere good, but to learn to recognize the good in this very moment. . . .OH such profound words!  I enjoy all your posts Lori but this one is so timely for me at the crossroads Im at with my life/work.  For years I have been directionless because I was too afraid to follow those pulls because of the unknown tied to it.  But here I am now, realizing my fears have stifled my growth and passed opportunities to the good in the very moment.  I will not dwell in the time wasted, but take now to act upon all the wondrous opportunities I still have available to me.  Thank you for your inspiring words!

           I recently sat down and wrote something similar to this in my journal.  I felt it pulling, tugging on me.  Ive recently been neglecting the present.  I found myself falling back into the trap of continually second-guessing my actions.  Critiquing my life and decisions.  Nothing is good enough I told myself.  Theres so many terrible things in the world and I need to prepare for them ALL.  Imagine not being able to eat.  Remember when we lost our house to foreclosure as a child?  On and on I would ramble in my head.  I brought myself to the edge.  Then it dawned on me all one day.  I was running from the Now.  I forgot the purpose and value which living in the present can bring.  Some might say, a peace that surpasses understanding.  To live with faith that there is value in my experience and even though I might have some debt, I choose not to allow negatives define me.  My childs mind is back online and I see with the eyes of imagination and possibility.  I will no longer second guess my narrative which Ive constructed to make sense of the world.  There is value in the mystical experience and I will not judge myself for acknowledging this fact.  Passion and purpose will lead me into deeper discoveries about myself and I will engage others on their own path in hopes that they, too, might begin to see themselves for who they truly are.

           Wow, this took me back!  It was only when I was brave enough to let yourself evolve, repeatedly undertaking the sometimes-terrifying process of discovering what else you can do. I finally came to the point where I realized that life was a grand series of experiments that I learned to embrace the moment.  Then life became joyful and more fluid!  Thank you for this lovely article.

           Coincidentally, a friend shared an Eckhart Tolle quote with me today that goes perfectly with this:
          </p>
          <p>
           Life will give you whatever experience is most
           <br/>
           helpful for the evolution of your consciousness. How do you know this is
           <br/>
           the experience you need? Because this is the experience you are having
           <br/>
           at the moment.

           Youre most welcome! I love thata grand series of experiments. I think of life in a very similar way. I hope to look back on my life and see a melange of different places, different experiences, and different people. Thats what matters most to me: that the adventure continues, and I continually live in the question of what could be.

           Everything we do matters.
           <br/>
           Sometimes we dont have the energy for giant leaps.
           <br/>
           We need a break.
           <br/>
           Zoom out.  Let the little things matter for a while.
           <br/>
           Its the little things that fill in the cracks.

           Loved this post, especially 
          </p>
          <p>
           But sometimes the best opportunities are the ones you dont take, leaving yourself open for choices that better align with your own values and priorities.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know this may sound as impossible as growing another lung, but try not to worry so much about what other people might think. They may have expectations, but they arent living inside your mind, or feeling your instincts.
          </p>
          <p>
           The only one who can make wise decisions for you is you, and even if it makes you feel anxious at times, you will eventually thank yourself for being brave enough to follow your heart, not someone elses head.
          </p>

           I was offered a job last week, Ive been unemployed for 3 months and studying psychology. I needed that job, but something screamed at me, dont take it!! It was a very strong feeling. I asked myself, would I want this person to be my mentor, is their practice the way I would want my practice to operate, feel and present.  Is it what I  would want the first impressions of my practice to be? My answer was no to all of those questions. So, I said thanks, but no thanks and back to the drawing board for me. Everyone was saying just do it for the experience, you can leave when youve had enough or dont like it but the feeling of no was too strong for me. The relief I felt when I told them, was enough for me to know I made the right decision for me. Im in the second year of a six year long road to changing my career and life purpose (at 39 yrs old!) and its articles like these that keep me going, and know that I am on the right path. Thanks Lori.

           This moment isnt merely the bridge to where you want to be. This momentthis crucial part of the process
          </p>
          <p>
           When I feel like Im just sitting here making no improvements whatsoever, hoping that my attempts will succeed, I think of it as the time that needs to pass for me to get where I want to be.  Its so hard for me to enjoy THIS moment, when I feel its not good enough not where I want to be. Of course, this stems from my thoughts that everything has to be perfect.
           <br/>
           If only I can learn how to live in this moment.living it just as happy as I would live the moments in my life of success &amp; contentment I would enjoy life so much more and realize now is where Ill always be.

           Wow.  Talk about hitting home.  I need I be easier on myself and stop worrying about reaching that place that does not exist.  I need to really find a way to lose my anxiety about the past, future, and my current place in life.  Thank you for easing my mind some on a very long, stressing day.

           Hello Lori,
           <br/>
           I am currently facing a difficult situation dealing with my future and career.This article describes some of my current feelings. You mentioned that sometimes we dont need to know our destination in life and just be present; that we have unlimited time to change and evolve. I must admit that I am so scare of failure, to the point that I sometimes force myself to do things just to prevent the pain that it might cause me, and I feel that to so many of us money and other social factors limit our evolution. Now I feel that my calling has evolved and my interest do not match my calling which I have known since I was a little girl. I am currently in college and as you now most of the time as student we live in the future. My question is, what can we do ( like a daily exercise) to let go of these bad behaviors and ideas? How  do I surrender the future and let go of the image that I had for myself?
           <br/>
           Thank you very much, it is a difficult process but your article helps a lot

           <br/>
           Nice and thoughtfully written post. The quote  by George Bernard Shaw fits so perfectly for purpose of life. Its not about finding the purpose of life, its about creating the purpose. Thank you for insightful article.

           Great post. I have come up with a thousand different configurations and directions for my life, and at the end of the day, I just have to accept that life is messy. Its not always perfect. And be ok with that. Ill land on something good someday. And learning to feel your way through life is important important too, it kinda takes the pressure off your mind!

           Hi Ambar,
          </p>
          <p>
           Do you meditate? Thats the best daily exercise I know to help you stay in the present and access your intuition. Yoga has similar effects. In fact, it was yoga that eventually helped me find clarity and direction during my time in New York, because it enabled me to find mental stillness and get out of my own way. Both of these practices help tremendously with letting go and moving beyond the ego.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can find all kind of guided meditations on YouTube by searching for guided mediation and other keywords, like acceptance, anxiety, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, you may still deal with these very normal fears at times, but making time for a daily mindfulness practice will go a long way!
          </p>
          <p>

           As a fellow perfectionist, I hear you! One thing I realized in New York is that I would only appreciate purpose/success, if and when I eventually experienced them, if I learned to be happy with myself and my life independent of those things. I had to get to the root of my inadequacy issues first, both to enable myself to create a purpose that wasnt based on my fear of not being good enough, and to ensure that when I chose a path, I was actually able to appreciate and enjoy it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive known so many people who imagined life would magically change when they reached their professional goals, only to one day realize theyd accomplished everything they hoped to, but still felt lackingand a sense that life was lacking.
          </p>
          <p>
           Have you ever seen the movie Memento? (*Spoiler alert*if you havent seen it and would like to, stop reading!)
          </p>
          <p>
           In it, the main character has short-term memory loss, and hes on a mission to find out who killed his wife. We eventually learn that he actually already solved the casebut he destroyed the evidence, knowing he would forget, so that he could keep looking, because that looking gave him a purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think that same thing happens to us. We get addicted to the searching, looking for something to fill an emptiness. And even if we eventually find it, we may still feel empty.
          </p>
          <p>
           So this is my long-winded way of saying we can save ourselves a lot of disappointment by using the road to purpose and success not just to get where we want to be, but to heal ourselves so that when we get there, it adds to our life, instead of magnifying the underlying issues we never addressed.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you think of it like this, it can almost seem like a blessing to have that time that needs to pass, because its an opportunity to work on the internal before the external changes.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope this helps a little!

           Thats wonderful, that you were able to follow your instinctsand with so many other people encouraging you to ignore them. Youre most welcome. Im glad this reinforced that youre indeed on the right path. =)

           Hello Lori, It seems that any Tiny Buddha post I see on  a given day directly relates with a current challenge that I struggle with. This one especially! Thank you for sharing your story and perspective as it has given me a new awareness and relieved some of that pressure.
           <br/>
           Cheers!

           Thanks for the article.  Ive gone back to school for a second degree after working only a year in the field of my first degree and now I feel lost.  While Im doing well in classes, I often question the real world aspect of my pursuits (audio engineering) and start to experience terrible doubt or fear that Im making yet another choice thats not going to satisfy what I think Im supposed to be.  The only days I feel confident about it are the ones I choose to enjoy the pursuit of the passion instead of dreading failures that may or may not happen.  Finding other people that feel lost in some sense eases up some of the despair of it.

           I discovered Tiny Buddha in the last couple of months and its been a real inspiration to know Im not alone in my struggles with finding purpose and passion.
           <br/>
           Im currently at a crossroads in life which some may call mid-life crisis I expect (crikey, how did I get to be middle aged?!!) after throwing in my job of 15yrs and doing nothing but reading, walking, chilling, taking up yoga/meditation,a wee bit of casual work and getting to know me over the last 6mths. Its been hard  firstly really leaning into my emotions rather than escaping them and secondly not being pulled into what some (including me) might think I should do  like get another fulltime permanent job, study, travel, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           Youre right about being patient with ourselves and our current path even when it feels we arent on one. Ive had to remind myself of this at times when I feel the pressure to do something else:
           <br/>
           The only one who can make wise decisions for you is you, and even if it makes you feel anxious at times, you will eventually thank yourself for being brave enough to follow your heart, not someone elses head.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanks for your encouraging article!

           Same herebut you seem to be quite aware of your own thinking patterns &amp; what seems to cause you painmost people dont even realize that until the last of their days &amp; even if they do; arent willing to admit to even themselves!  The mere fact that you know what you need to work on to find more contentment is a positive step in trying to get thereOne of the things I try to remind myself even when nothing seems to get me out of my emotional monkey chatter is, This too will pass  Just hang in there!

           Loved this blog, Lori Didibeautifully written &amp; one of the most insightful blogs that hit me to the core!  Really needed this with a lot of the hopelessness I been feeling lately; thank you so much for sharing your words of wisdom &amp; really glad to see one of your posts again:).
          </p>
          <p>
           Btw didi; what do you think about maybe starting a page in Tiny Buddha for movies/tv shows &amp; trying to analyze the messages that we can take out of the stories &amp; characters, for our own lives..? Just a food for thought, from a fellow movie buff:P

           Thanks so much for your support! I never thought of it as a good thing to be aware of what has been causing me emotional pain, now I can think of it as a foundation.

           I relate to this all too much! I have achieved what Ive been so determined to, but in the end, its not the goal at all, its the feeling of success..only to set a higher standard. Thanks for your advice!

           Hi Lori!
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanks for writing this beautiful article
           <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.tinybuddha.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           Very timely. This is what Im going through right now.
           <br/>
           But Im learning to trust that each of our experience is exactly what it needs to be and its molding us for the greater good.
          </p>
          <p>
           I love what you said And thats what it means to find directionto follow those pulls,
           <br/>
           without a guarantee, knowing that the goal isnt to end up somewhere
           <br/>
           good, but to learn to recognize the good in this very moment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Very powerful and reassuring

           This is beautiful. It was like I was reading the story of my life. And its reassuring to know Im not the only one travelling down this foggy path. Just excited to reach the light at the end of that tunnel, however I get there and wherever it takes me. Thank you for writing this.

           Youre most definitely not alone, and youre most welcome. Something potentially corny just came to mind that I feel the need to share, because I think theres truth in it: Though we seek the light at the end of the tunnel, theres also a light right where we stand, the light thats in each of us. Maybe its in realizing this that were able to find our way to that other light. (I know, I warned you it would be corny!)

           Youre most welcome, Angie. Im glad Tiny Buddha has been helpful to you!

           Sounds like you had a nice window of time to reconnect with yourself. Thats great! I think so often we feel tempted to rush from one thing to the next, when a little break to reassess can make a world of difference.
          </p>

           I wish you much peace and joy on your new path. =)

           Yeah Im studying to get ESL certified now, Ill see where that takes me. No idea whats gonna happen even a month from now, and that scares me because I always have a plan. Its been a lifelong struggle learning how to live in the present moment, but I guess this experience is forcing me to do that!

           Thats wonderful! (The ESL certification part, not the being scared partthough thats actually a good thing, too, since it means youre outside your comfort zone.) I hope the upcoming months are full of wonderful surprises and many beautiful moments. =)

           Lori,
          </p>
          <p>
           Every sentence of this post had me thinking, Yes, thats exactly how I feel! Its like you took the thoughts from my mind and translated them into words, and then added your own wisdom. Its such an overwhelming reassurance to know Im not alone in this struggle. I intellectually know that there are others feeling the same way, but this post makes me feel it and believe it to be true.
          </p>
          <p>
           I cant express how much this resonated with me  it would take many pages. Your words reached out like a hand to hold my own; thats how much comfort and understanding it brought for me. All I can say is thank you for sharing your experiences so openly and eloquently. You change lives every day with this website, and thats truly amazing.
          </p>
          <p>
           This post is one of my favorites and will be read many times. Thank you for everything you do. You help people every day, and Id say thats the best purpose there is.
          </p>

           This is a great article, Lori. Thank you! I recently stumbled upon your
           <br/>
           site and am so happy I did. Ive been struggling for years now to find
           <br/>
           my lifes purpose after having to leave behind my 16-year creative
           <br/>
           career in 2004 due to repetitive strain injury (RSI). Since quitting my
           <br/>
           day job, Ive been fortunate enough to travel the world twice for extended periods of time
           <br/>
           with my husband (14 and 16 months, respectively) and have amassed a
           <br/>
           wealth of amazing experiences, but somehow Ive returned home to the
           <br/>
           U.S. in November 2013 after our last adventure feeling even more
           <br/>
           unfulfilled and lost than ever. Your article was the first thing Ive
           <br/>
           read that really inspired hope and a new way of looking at my situation.
           <br/>
           Thanks again  Im off to read more on the Tinybuddha site.

           Hi Bellie,
           <br/>
           Just had to comment since I posted right above you. Congrats on the decision to travel. I champion it wholeheartedly, having done so several times now (not alone these past few times, but for long periods). Its liberating and life-changing and scary and amazing all at the same time. I wish you well!

           So glad to have stumbled upon this article. Reading it really helped me put a lot of things in perspective; a reframing of the mind much needed at the moment since my anxiety these days seem to mostly stem from the feeling that Im not doing what Im supposed to be doing in life  whatever that is! Am learning to live fully in the present, one day at a time, from hereon. Thanks for sharing, Lori.

           Hi Lori, Wonderful article! Every bit rings true, if only more people were aware of this I believe wed all be so much happier. Im just curious what your thoughts are about professions or societies that do not allow such flexibility which seems so counter-intuitive to our human nature. For example, being a lawyer or in terms of societies, countries like Japan where if you became a baker after you graduated college, it would almost be impossible to become a journalist afterwards, despite having a journalism degree due to the way the society thinks or functions. Would you say there are always exceptions? Would you say lead by example so others follow? I believe anything is possible when we are connected with the universe no matter what but just wanted to see what your thoughts are about this

           Thanks Lee! Its tough for me to answer your question, since I cant speak to this from experience. Id have a hard time advising someone who lives in Japan, since I dont know what options are available to them. I do believe, however, that we often have far more options than we think, and if were willing to do the work, we can find them.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also believe theres great power in leading by example. Its like that classic story of the four-minute mile. Everyone believed it was impossible until Roger Bannister did it. But once he did, others followed suit because he redefined what could be done.

           This doesnt sound anything close to Buddha or Buddhism, it sounds more like personal advice taking out of a popular magazine.

           Great article. Just wondering how you would feel though if you were still in that coffee shop searching and wondering what to do?

           Thanks KC. I imagine Id go through phases. Some days, Id feel frustrated and hopeless; and other days, Id feel patient and optimistic. Thats how I felt back then. Hopefully, if I were still in the same exact place now, a decade later, Id be a little wiser and better able to accept my circumstances and work to create new ones. And hopefully, as a result, Id feel patient and optimistic more often than frustrated and hopeless.

           Brilliant post! This is exactly how I feel right now. I have just started my first ever job but I am anxious if this is the right move. Whatever I do, I am always wondering whether I should be doing it or if I should be doing something else. And oh, I love this website. It is as if its my own self talking to me! Keep it up Lori.

Im trying to go to my desire college an art college and then i failed again. This years Ive been through many things suddenly my parents business having a debt amd my chance to go to art college again is impossible. I feel until now I havent created a great progress in my life and Im so lonely. Its like no one encourage me. But then I read your post its like Im talking to a friend. And your words are so accurately described how I feel. Thank you so much for writing this for me its really a big help. Ill try to living more at the present. May your days is filled up with happiness.

           Hi Crisan,
          </p>
          <p>
           Its definitely not only you. Im so sorry to hear about what happened with college and your parents. I know how hard it is to maintain hope and motivation when you feel like everything is working against you. Im glad this helped you, and I think its a wonderful goal youve set, to be more present. In my experience, Ive learned that everything gets easier from there.

           all good, you do the right thing following your instincts, the wisdom of the old and advice of the young outsiders and still the feeling is there. It is about the feeling, not about choices made, opportunities seized, directions taken. Every commitment to one direction means that you are not available to other mirriad of options, it is a limitation to freedom. Even if I was rich and famous Id still have the feeling that the real party is always happening elsewhere while Im wasting the times of my life in this party. The only way I can get rid of this feeling is contemplation of the nothingness inside me. I realize that the people are not different, the only thing is that they [in their wast majority] dont think about the passing time, or at least I dont think they think; they go about their daily life in a routine of coffee, work, entertainment, hangover, sickness and recovery and coffee, work And then I think that the passing of time and of life is good- a permanent spring without the warmth of the summer, the fruits of the trees, the melancholy of the amber falling leaves in the fall and the cozy hibernation of the soul inside you in the winter, will never be experienced [and they are worthy of experiencing as part of life]. Same with ages and the ultimate experience- death: things change constantly, just keep curious and enjoy all changes!

           Im sure that if you were barely getting by, with no friends, no family to turn to, no money, unable to find job or continue your education and being forcefully trapped in a island with no future nor possibilities you wont be talking so lightly of life.

           Its incredible how you are describing me in the first part of the article! I can definitely relate to every single word you wrote! I am 24 and I am constantly thinking that everyone is better than me because they already have a beautiful job, theyre beloved and confident while Im living anxiously feeling the pressure of my own expectations and fearing that I am wasting my time. I do want to make a difference and to matter but I feel stuck and I dont know which way to go! I hope Ill sort out this situation as you did!
           <br/>
           Thank you for sharing your thoughts.

           Im not allowed to live the life I want because I still live under my parents roof.  Im stuck at a job I hate, I have no money saved up, I have a car I will lose if I lost my job because I dont have enough to pay it off, but in my heart and in my soul I know its time to quit or get myself fired because management has become above and beyond delusional and irrational and unreasonable towards their associates.  If I made any sudden changes now, I will be unemployed, homeless, completely broke, and unable to travel because I currently live out in the boondocks.  Reading articles like this is only fueling even more panic, despair, and desperation.

           i am in the same situation, except i quit my job because the lack of logic and the overwhelming amount of BS that i was facing has started to manifest physically. mentally i was already a wreck, finding out about meditation is what kept my anger from bursting and causing me to kick someone in the head when they started to yell at me. now i am much better but i am facing the prospect of being broke. i am not sure what to do about it. going back to being someones lackey is out of the question.

           agreed. she does make some very fine points but having lower expectations of yourself does not solve your problems if you are broke. or if stupid people start waging war in your country.

           Its so amusing how they way you write literally spoke my mind and my life at the moment. Im only 19 going on 20 now and most of you might say Im still young, but having known how fast everyone is going with their life (some even completed their first year of degree already) scares me. Cause well, Ive been idle for the past year trying to find my purpose in life whereas everyone else is already on their way there!
          </p>
          <p>
           Im already having interest in a profession (dentistry) but getting there is no easy task in my country due to limited places. :/ I missed last years intake so im trying again this year, hoping everything will settle down (*crosses fingers!*) before the year ends.
          </p>
          <p>
           Im glad I came across this article, its really comforting knowing Im not the only one feeling this way although I feel like the only one in my circle having to go through this
           <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.tinybuddha.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
           but that quote about being proud of myself for going through the foggy road comforts me the most cause it is so relatable in every way! I really cant wait to finally get to another stage in life because waiting is so tiring it keeps making me feel worthless.
           <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.tinybuddha.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
           Thank you Lori, for comforting me in my hardest moment with your lovely writing.

           Hi Ling,
          </p>
          <p>
           Youre most welcome. Im glad this was helpful to you! You are most definitely not the only oneand not worthless. I think everyone goes through this at some point in time. We all feel that urgency to figure things out and catch up with other people. But it plain and simply takes time to find our way in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           There will come a day when you look back and think, If only I knew then that everything would eventually come together as it has, I would have cut myself some slack, relaxed, and enjoyed the ride. Perhaps it will help to remember this when you start feeling scared, anxious, or impatient. Sometimes it may not help, and thats okay too. Its natural to feel those things when faced with decisions and uncertainty. The important thing is that you dont let them overwhelm or paralyze you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hugs back to you,
           <br/>

           And THANKFULLY this site was born in your journey. What a wonderful resource for the world. Tiny Buddha always has quality, heartwarming and inspiring articles, and this piece, Lori, shines bright and speaks very strongly to not only me, but other lost souls (all of us at one point). This article especially hits home, and is a great personal reminder to myself not to panic. Thank you.

           Hi Lori,
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the first time I am writing any sort of comment/ review on the internet. You could say Im a spiritual guy, and quite stuck at the moment professionally.
          </p>
          <p>
           Your article is very helpful and has some great insights that relieve my super-anxious and overwhelming brain. I thank you and really appreciate your article.

           What posts like this, however beautiful and wise, never seem to address is the horrible pain of having to choose whether to shred someone elses lifesomeone you love, who loves you without holding back and who is giving as much as they can without giving what they cantbecause following those pulls without a guarantee will destroy your relationship with them. And you both know that if they came with you, they would have to let go of the self they have become. Someone has to choose to give that last piece. I chose to.
          </p>
          <p>
           I keep choosing my 4-year-old love with this person because they have taught me how to laugh and how to love, after I spent 27 years in a wrong relationship. But it also means that the wings I started to put on after my divorce went back into the box. To put them on, and fly away to chase the pulls, would end this relationship with someone who needs to stay, physically, where they are. .
          </p>
          <p>
           I have faced this conflict day after day. I continue to choose to stay. The cognitive dissonance feels impossible, yet I live it.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would move into the unknown if only it didnt mean pain for someone I love too dearly. I just cant do it. I hold loosely daily. My wings are still in the box. But Im 53. They may never come back out. So now I try to find other wings, every day. But lord, its hard, when you have the kind of mind that cares less about security and is more willing to feel adrift than does the person you love. I would love to roam. I have chosen to tether.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many of the posters below sound young. I hope they dont tether themselves to anyone, or any career, until theyve worn their own wings for a while.

           Hi Wendy,
          </p>
          <p>
           Thats a tough situation, and I can kind of relate, as I have a lot of freedom with my work and I like to roam, but my fianc needs to be in one place right now. Have you considered doing some travel on your own? Then you could feed the need for wings without permanently leaving your current home. Just a thought

           Youre right, Lori, a chance of scenery can help, and I love to travel alone! The whole world wide open feeling is strong when I can make ALL decisions about what when where how and why, when the who is just me. It can be hard to come back, though, as I had envisioned a rather minimalist life on my own, and that simply hasnt (and isnt really going to) occur with this partner. And  I havent been flying solo much lately as my extra energy is going towards taking classes and looking into a job/career change. I figure thats another way to change scenery, but its also a source of frustration as I have to limit my search to this area and I do see positions across the country that I would pursue if I didnt make the decision I did and continue to make.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today I went out to eat at a restaurant alone, which I also love to do, and simply sat and watched the present moments go by. And tried to remember that good and bad feelings and experiences will occur wherever I am
          </p>
          <p>
           Sometimes I can grab thoughts like that. Sometimes they slip by, and I return to my usual programming
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you for responding.

           Youre most welcome! Thats so true, what you realized at lunch. At times, Ive been guilty of assuming the gypsy lifestyle is not only carefree, but more consistently happy than a stable one, and Ive learned thats not true. No matter where I go, I will always experience highs and lows and everything in between. We all will.

           hey ! i do feel like studying for competitive exam and my regular studies but often end up wasting it up or totally killing it by thinking about somethin else. i get easily distracted by things around me or thoughts that creep in. i wasnt like this earlier but since last year i dont know happened to me im never able concentrate. i dont even remember when was the last time i studied with full concentration. and at last when i sit up studying having a book in front of me i fell i should proberbly study other book. say if im studying my regular course book , i feel like studying my competitive exam book n vice versa. this deadlock prevents me from getting out any output.
           <br/>
           PLZ tell me what should i do. main thing is i just end up killing my time and repent afterwards. im damn confused!!!!

           That moment you had in the Internet cafe resonates with what I am going through right now. I googled when you feel like theres no progress in your life and this came up. I found so much peace and relief after reading. I Found comfort Knowing that I am not alone in this world. And has reassured a few life changing decisions I have made based on intuition. Thank you for creating this.

           In my own recent experiences of jobsearching, I admit to feeling vulnerable and nervous. One particular day I was sitting by my handset, constantly checking in a cyclical manner, emails, SMSs, missed calls, emails, SMSsetc.
          </p>
          <p>
           That afternoon I sat with my father in the garden..feeling despondent for what seemed like an eternity. I asked him, Dad, whats wrong with me? Do I not have any ability that could get their attention to call me? To which he replied calmly, Let them come to you. And something clicked in me hearing that. Instantly all that insidious anxiety and worry, stress and sadness washed over. I stopped wanting that feeling to control the situation, not unlike holding ones breath.
          </p>
          <p>
           The call did come later that day to progress through!

           Hi Lori, what is your advice for someone who is still searching for the right job in their 30s. I am a trained lawyer, with no interest in practising. I cannot explain this feeling to my friends or family, because i have not found an alternative job yet. I have this deep feeling of being trapped in a life i do not want to live when i consider practising. I just want something different. Thanks.

           Hi Hettie,
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont know a ton about practicing law, but it would be possible to work fewer hours so you have time to try different things? If not, could you perhaps try some different hobbies or volunteer in your free time to see what else might interest you? If you have a lot saved, you could just take the leap, quit your job, and then see where your heart takes you, but this would certainly feel less risky.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sending good thoughts your way,
           <br/>

           Hi Lori,
           <br/>
           I randomly came across this particular article, while browsing online during a tough moment in my life (plus the overflow of emotions at 3 a.m. haha). But can I just say that I am blown away by how you took the words right out of my mouth and yet, nobody in my surrounding understanda the slightest point of what you just wrote. Your beautiful writing had definitely created a purpose for people like me and you are such a blessing along with your talent to write. I love love love this article so much. And Im a picky reader, so only a few writing usually move me. This whole article emobodies exactly what I have been feeling for the past few months and that instinct you mentioned is definitely what I am working towards and that feeling of wanting to try right now is exactly what is through my mind. AND YET, nobody understands and instead pressures me and pushes me into doing something that I HAVE to do and will probably will benefit me in the super long run but DEFINITELY not where my instinct tells me to go follow. So, yes. I would like to thank you once again for writing such a beautiful article. And I honestly cannot hesitate longer to follow more of your writing in the future. Many thanks, Lori

           Hi there,
          </p>
          <p>
           Sorry for the painfully slow response! Thank you for taking the time to write, and youre most welcome. I know what its like to feel like no one understands what youre feeling, and I also know how tempting it can be to give in to what other people want for you. Good for you for listening to your instincts! Im sure it will serve you well. =)

           Hi Lori,
          </p>
          <p>
           First of all thank you so much for your website ! It really helps me a lot, and ive been reading many posts these last few days. I am trying to find myself as they say, and dealing with a lot of anxiety. I graduated from high school (with great marks) at 17, my parents were then together. But as soon as I started college, my dad moved out because we got a great new house (and my parents didnt tell me they were having problems, so I didnt know he was actually leaving in that way). Not very long after, my mother tried to committ suicide. It affected me a lot, and I kind of stop caring about myself. Suddenly I wanted to have fun all the time and not worry about anything. She was at the hospital for several months, my dad was handling things as he could. And when she got cleared to go back home, they both moved in the house 800kms away from me. I was only 18, and even though I acted all tough, I realize now that I needed to rebuild trust with them, and not be left alone. Today I feel like they abandoned me at the time. Anyway, after these difficult times (and during), I was at college but I didnt attend. And step by step I failed. This first college year was surprisingly a great experience because I met my boyfriend and we moved in together, but at the end of the year, since nothing was keeping us there, we moved to Belgium (we were in France then) to start fresh. I struggled / had too much fun (yes those two can work together) so I failed again, and succedeed the next year. So, I was 3 years out of high school and only had 1 actual college year that mattered- in terms of recognition (BA1). I had developped some kind of phobia about studying, and going there. It was hard for me to want to go, I felt alone, I couldnt make real friends. I felt like an outsider. My BA2 went the same way. I didnt pass the exams, so I only have less than half of the credits. For work and personal reasons, we went back to France where I wanted to go back to music. Thats why I got back into my old music school  and repeating the same f*cking schema. It scared the hell out of me to take action, to be a part of my life. I was looking at my life, almost like it wasnt real. I suffered a lot from my own mistakes and actions. I didnt know why I acted in a way that made me so sad. I was disappointed in myself. My self-esteem is very low at the moment. I am 22 and have no idea how to live my life. I dont know where to go in september. I dont know if Im going to be expelled from my music school because they almost dont know I exist (I didnt go) and my main teacher is angry with me. Im not sure what to do. My parents are no help, cause they cant even help themselves. My boyfriend wants me to stop seing the negative side of things, and dare to be myself. He wants me to be happy, and to pursue my dreams. I feel very confused. I dont know how to build a path to the life I want. Thats why I read your posts, and try your methods. I listed my values, I underligned those that I need in my life, those I want Im really trying. I just want to feel confident again. I feel like I lost myself and its very difficult to just focus and look at myself.
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont really know where Im going with this. But I hope you can help, or at least my message is heard by someone. Thank you. Namaste.

           Hi Estelle,
          </p>
          <p>
           Im so sorry to hear about everything youve been through and what youre going through now. I can understand why youd feel lost and unconfident, given your past.
          </p>
          <p>
           It sounds like your boyfriend is a great support for you. How do you feel about his advice to go after your dreams?

           Thank you so much for answering my comment. It really means a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
           I feel mostly scared. Sometimes its like, the more I want something, the less I dare to reach it. Probably because Im scared of being even more disappointed. Going after my dreams seems so complicated I dream of making a career out of singing, I dream of being on stage, and shooting movies. And I keep hearing my dads voice in my head saying your dreams are supposed to be dreams, and then there is reality where you must earn a living and work.
          </p>
          <p>
           Right now I just want to belong somewhere, and I dont want to be expelled from my school at all I just wish for a second (or third, fourth, I dont know) chance. The phobia of scolar environments is not really recognized as such, Im afraid theyre going to think that I disrespected them.

           Youre most welcome. I understand that fear. Its not easy to follow a path that doesnt feel practical, especially when its not what others want for us. Still, Ive found Im the happiest and most satisfied when I follow my instincts and worry less about what others think and want.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you knew your father would support whatever decision you madeand that youd be fulfilled through the process of pursuing what you love, even if it doesnt pan out exactly as youve visualized itwhat would you choose to do now? You dont need to answer this for me; its just a question that may help you find some clarity about what you really want to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope this helps a little

           Hi, You have written a beautiful article. I always feel anxious about not having a purpose to my life. I still havent found the answer though.
           <br/>
           Somehow, I always find that people associate freedom with travelling. In our generation, solo Euro trip, go out, explore is the new mantra of happiness. I thought there was something to it. I went on a trip to Europe alone. It was a disaster. I was lonely, bored and frankly foreign to the food and language, so it was very difficult for me. I do not understand why living your life or having a purpose means travelling the world. Why cant I be at home and still have some meaning to life? Why do I need to travel to give myself a purpose? There has become this popular social pressure to travel and boast about it. People enjoy the travel much less than they like to post pictures of it and tell everyone they travelled- that telling people seems to be the whole point now. I disagree with the idea. I think- to each his own- people can be in one place all their life and still be very happy.
           <br/>
           Still, I thank you for writing a good piece.

           This is an interesting and fun site, I have to admit. As someone who just hit the 3-0 mark a few months ago, I think differently about this.
          </p>
          <p>
           My 20s were up and down but filled with possibilities and solid accomplishment. The main thing that I didnt like (which I can still do now) is be with more girls that I found attractive. Sexually, intimately etc. Im getting my degree done now and making TONS of my art that I took a big 5-10 year break on. Depending on who you ask about it. I had two startups with friends that I screwed up. The first one was just a passing fad that everyone is trying to make money from. But I blasted my friend online back in 2010 and I dont talk to him anymore. Its awful.
          </p>
          <p>
           My ex was a terribly lazy girlfriend who didnt know what she was doing at the time and now I dont really like girls at all. So to sum up, going back to school for associates, painting much more (although still not as much to make money that I want) and wanting to date and get out of Michigan but have no job besides my dads office. Im depressed and dont really know what to do. Life pretty much sucks for me and even though I have a therapist I trust, I know that all of my anger and depression comes from both living with a brother 8 years younger than me and the last 5-6 years. Before that I dont really care as it was too long ago to make the changes.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know Im an aware person but my depression and ADD dont allow for my Carpre Diem like it used to. Although even then, it was useless Carpre Diem. I basically suck at finishing things off or completing them. For me in 2015 right now, this is life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Dear fucking God lol.

           Hi lori,
           <br/>
           Im an utter failure who never got selected in any job interview despite of having a masters degree. Ive been graduated four years back and now ended up with a job which is kinda disgraceful and quite mismatch with my qualification, a salary im paid equivalent to a sweeper which is devastating me internally and its because perhaps i see my friends, or junior fellow in managerial positions. Though im struggling to create myself by doing something which isnt my field but again im struggling since 4 years and yet no success come across to me..

           I dont see any purpose of doing this job, feel like im wasting my time but at the same time hoping for the twist to come..im uncertain, moving towards the darkside and breaking my own expectations from myself..after reading all that you wrote im still unable to figure out my current position..tears**

           Hi there,
          </p>
          <p>
           My heart broke for you in reading your comment, as it sounds like youre being pretty hard on yourself. Even if youre not yet doing work that satisfies you, that doesnt mean youre an utter failure, or that your work is disgraceful. Sometimes it just takes time to find your way in life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let me ask you this: is it possible that youre learning things now that might help you later in life? Is is possible that this experience is making you stronger? Is there anything else you can gain from going through this that you might appreciate when you look back at your life (long after getting through this and finding work you love)?
          </p>
          <p>
           I know its tough to have this kind of perspective now, when youre right in the middle of the hardship and feeling the corresponding emotions. But try to remember that things wont be like this forever. And they will likely improve far sooner if you accept this time in your life for what it is, try to shift your perspective, and treat yourself with kindness as you work at creating change.
          </p>
          <p>
           You WILL get through this! Its not a matter of IF; its a matter of WHEN. And you will look back, like I have, and say, Back then, I wish I realized
          </p>
          <p>
           Sending good thoughts your way
          </p>

           Lori,
           <br/>
           Im short of words to praise you  for encouraging me, I just can only say Thanks to you. But to be honest, Ill feel myself an utter failure until  i find a through and garner  another better job. The question here arises What ill gain in future  when im doing a lowest level of job  that an uneducated sweeper can also does if he is explained about the responsibility of this job. Im not adding such value to the company where im working and i even dont think that other company would consider me for a better position if i add my disgraceful job in my resume.
           <br/>
           Now, what I see in myself after reading your comments is positivity. your encouraged words by saying  youll get through this making me more energetic and optimistic about my future, Because once i read somewhere  your hard working never gone wasted, and on the other hand, as you said  WHEN.This job is detrimental for  my personality, knackering me internally and  psychologically because all the time I compare myself with others whom i was studied with, or with junior in university or with those who I thought werent good in studies, they are today excelled in every field of life. They are married now, well settled, earning good money, enjoying and touring all over the world, having managerial positions.I never ever thought id be going through such phase of  life. If this experience im getting wouldve made me stronger , id have never complained about my job and my fate with you.
           <br/>
           Now, Prayers and positivity can change my fate..I have to keep my positivity above my fear of future  &amp; not to think what gonna happen with me which is quiet difficult, Who knows, Tomorrow could be my day. Now , the battle has been started  between me &amp; the question  when Ill get through this is very dangerous. This battle can be won if im psychologically rehabilitated. Need your constant prayers
          </p>
          <p>
           Cheers &amp; tears :'(

           I have a feeling this might be where your lesson lies. If your self-worth is dependent on your job, then it could easily be shaken throughout your life. And it may even taint the experience of having a job you love when that day finally comes.
          </p>
          <p>
           But what if when that day comes you already did a lot of work developing your self-worth, independent of your career? What if you are able to approach that phase of your life feeling you are already a successful person, regardless of your professional success? I have a feeling that would make the success all the more gratifying because youd be coming to it from a place of wholeness and peace with who you are.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thats the thing about all the people youre comparing yourself to: its not a guarantee that their success is actually leading to increased happiness. If they havent done any internal work, odds are, its not.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thats something Ive always appreciated about being a late bloomer in every regard: I had time to do some deep inner work, which meant I didnt get the work or the relationship and then have to ask myself: Why do I still feel so empty and unhappy?
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope the same turns out to be true for you!

           Youll never be effective if youre convinced tomorrow needs to be better than today because this belief stems from resistance to the presentand the present is where your power lies.
          </p>
          <p>
           Usually, when youve read the best thing you couldve read today,that gives you the best feeling, that writing is a solution for a mistake youve been doing many, many times. Therefore, to experience the best feeling, be grateful for your best mistakes, and never give up because youll find the best solution.
          </p>
          <p>
           I felt purposeless most of the time.
           <br/>
           But, your post made me understand/believe/taught me, this:
           <br/>
           If today i want to workout, I better give my best like theres no tomorrow.
           <br/>
           If tomorrow i dont feel or want to workout, thats fine. Instead, I just do what i feel i want to do. (my intuition, not the mind, or else i would be just sitting on the sofa).
           <br/>
           IF, few days later my intuition would tell me something like It was so cool to workout back then. I want to do it, again. I better start doing it again. But, always giving my best.
          </p>
          <p>
           Do i understand the message of that paragraph, right?

           Hi Lori,
           <br/>
           I cant thank you enough for this truly amazing post. Its truly life-changing. Ive just gratuated form high school to enter my first year in University. Being quite young, I always feel scared and so uncertain of what the future may have in store for me. Thank to your story, now I feel less scared, even a bit excited to try as many new things I want to do knowing that theres gonna be new opportunies open up in any decison that I make.
           <br/>
           Again, Thank you so much. It really does help me a lot!
