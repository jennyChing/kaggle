      Although the Melbourne Stars have started off their Bash T20 campaign on a losing note, the formidable men in green will be a handful for the visiting Hurricanes. Keep in mind, the ground is massive and clearing the ropes won't be that easy. Expect plenty of swift running between the wickets.

     <p>
      MLS- White, Wright, Pietersen, Maxwell, Hussey, Faulkner, Triffitt, Worrall/ Keath, Hastings/Boland, Bird, Beer

       <strong>
        L Wright
       </strong>
      </a>
      - The English all-rounder will continue to be aggressive with the willow opening the innings. When required, he can also be called upon to break crucial stands. Should be a favorite pick in most fantasy leagues.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://fantasycricket.dream11.com/IN/cricketer/Ben%20Dunk/1393">
       <strong>
        Dunk
       </strong>
      </a>
      - He was the player of the tournament last season and no boundaries in the world are too big for him. He has been a threat always to the opposition and is a hot pick in most fantasy cricket leagues.
     </p>

      <a href="https://fantasycricket.dream11.com/IN/cricketer/Alex%20Hales/1162">
       <strong>
        Hales
       </strong>
      </a>
      - He is a staggering opening batsman and has had a wonderful year in this format of the game. With him in the squad HBH will anticipate a good start to their campaign. Simply cannot ignore this champion batsman in fantasy cricket.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://fantasycricket.dream11.com/IN/cricketer/Cameron%20Boyce/1424">
       <strong>
        Boyce
       </strong>
      </a>
      - He is a leggie with serious potential and fanatics down under are fascinated by his talent and skill with the ball. He could turn out to be a real dark horse on the fantasy cricket front.
