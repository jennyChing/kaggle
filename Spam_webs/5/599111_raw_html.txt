    theory that the positions and movements of celestial bodies (stars, planets 
    [except the one you are born on or those in other solar systems],  Sun, and 
    Moon) at the time of birth profoundly influence a person's life. 
    Some forms of astrology claim that terrestrial events such as natural

    the innumerable relationships of celestial items, it would be surprising if

    etc., and an arrangement of planets in relation to the Sun or Moon. 
    Correlation does not prove causality, but it is good enough for most 
    astrologers. (For a classic example of this kind of reasoning, see

         By 450 BCE the Babylonians 
    had developed the 12-sign zodiac, but it was the Greeks--from the time of 
    Alexander the Great to their conquest by the Romans--who provided most of 
    the fundamental elements of modern Western astrology. The spread of astrological 
    practice was checked by the rise of Christianity, which emphasized divine 
    intervention and free will. During the Renaissance, astrology regained 
    popularity, in part due to rekindled interest in science and astronomy. 
    Christian theologians, however, warred against astrology, and in 1585 Pope Sixtus V condemned it. At the same time, the work of Kepler and others 
    undermined astrologys tenets.

         The most popular form of traditional Western astrology is sun sign 
    astrology, the kind found in the horoscopes of many daily newspapers. A 
    horoscope is an astrological forecast. The term is also used to describe a 
    map of the zodiac at the time of ones birth. The zodiac is divided into 
    twelve zones of the sky, each named after the constellation that originally 
    fell within its zone (Taurus, Leo, etc.). The apparent paths of the Sun, the 
    Moon, and the major planets all fall within the zodiac. Because of the 
    precession of the equinoxes, the equinox and solstice points have each moved 
    westward about 30 degrees in the last 2,000 years. Thus, the zodiacal 
    constellations named in ancient times no longer correspond to the segments 
    of the zodiac represented by their signs. In short, had you been born at the 
    same time on the same day of the year 2,000 years ago, you would have been 
    born under a different sign.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         <font face="Arial" size="3">
          Precession of the equinox is caused by the fact that the axis of the 
      Earth's rotation (which causes day and night) and the axis of the Earth's 
      revolution around the Sun (which marks the passage of each year) are not 
      parallel. They are 23 1/2 degrees away from lining up; that is, the 
      Earth's axis of rotation is tilted. This tilt also causes our seasons, a 
      fact that Ptolemy did understand but that many people do not understand 
      even today. Ptolemy understood that the rotation axis of the Earth was 
      slowly precessing, or moving in a circle, with an angular radius of 23 1/2 
      degrees with a period of around 26,000 years. He deduced this from 
      comparisons of data taken by the ancient Sumerians 2,000 years before his 
      time. He did not understand what was pushing the precession, but he did 
      understand the motion. We now realize that the Sun is rotating with a 
      period of around 30 days and that this causes the Sun to bulge at the 
      equator, which causes a torque to be exerted on the top like motion of the 
      Earth's day and night cycle. There is also a small 18.6-year variation 
      caused by the Moon's orbit around the Earth, and the Moon also has a small 
      effect on precession; however, the Sun's equatorial bulge is the main 
      cause of the precession of the equinox, which is why your sign listed in 
      the newspaper, by Sidney Omar for instance, in most cases is removed by 
      one sign from the modern, actual position of the Sun at your birth.

          The modern signs as listed here are further complicated when their 
      boundaries are those of the current constellations. A neater way of 
      dividing the signs would be to divide the ecliptic into 30-degree slices, 
      as Ptolemy did, but to keep the slices centered on the star patterns. This 
      would make the time interval for the signs more nearly 30 days each and 
      eliminate the [13th] sign of

         Traditional Western astrology may be divided into tropical and sidereal. 
    (Astrologers in non-Western traditions use different systems.) The tropical, 
    or solar, year is measured relative to the Sun and is the time between 
    successive vernal equinoxes (365 days, 5 hr, 48 min, 46 sec of mean solar 
    time). The sidereal year is the time required for the Earth to complete an 
    orbit of the Sun relative to the stars (365 days, 6 hr, 9 min, 9.5 sec of 
    mean solar time). The sidereal year is longer than the tropical year because 
    of the precession of the equinoxes, i.e., the slow westward shift of the 
    equinoctial points along the plane of the ecliptic at a rate of 50.27 
    seconds of arc per year, resulting from precession of the Earths axis of 
    rotation.

         Sidereal astrology uses the actual constellation in 
    which the Sun is located at the moment of birth as its basis; tropical 
    astrology uses a 30-degree sector of the zodiac as its basis. Sidereal astrology is used by a minority of 
    astrologers and bases its readings on the constellations near the Sun at the 
    time of birth.

         According to some astrologers, the data support the hypothesis that there 
    is a causal connection between heavenly bodies and human events. Appeals are 
    made to significant correlations between astrological signs and such things 
    as athleticism. However,  a statistically significant correlation 
    between x and y is not a sufficient condition for reasonable belief in a 
    causal connection, much less for the belief that x causes y. Correlation 
    does not prove causality; nevertheless, correlations are extremely attractive to 
    defenders of astrology. For example: Among 3,458 soldiers, Jupiter is to be 
    found 703 times, either rising or culminating when they were born. Chance 
    predicts this should be 572. The odds here: one million to one (Gauquelin 
    1975). Lets assume that the statistical data show significant correlations 
    between various planets rising, falling, and culminating, and various 
    character traits. It would be more surprising if of all the billions and 
    billions of celestial motions conceivable, there werent a great many that 
    could be significantly correlated with dozens of events or individual 
    personality traits.

         Defenders of astrology are fond of noting that the length of a womans

    then surely the Moon can affect a person. But what is the analog to the 
    tides in a person? We are reminded that humans begin life in an amniotic sea

    shells in accordance with the tides, which flow in accordance with the

    fit many people under many different signs. Even professional astrologers, 
    most of whom have nothing but disdain for sun sign astrology, cant pick out 
    a correct horoscope reading at better than a chance rate. Yet, astrology

         if we next hear from the astrologers demanding their "rightful" place in our 
    universities. Ivan Kelly, foremost critic of astrology, sent me a copy of a troublesome article by astrologer
    Valerie Vaughan. "Debunking the Debunkers: Lessons to Be Learned," appeared in
         <em>
          The Mountain Astrologer
         </em>
         (Aug/Sept 1998 issue). Vaughan claims that astrologers
    are persecuted by establishment science. That is why astrologers can't get "access to
    research funding." And that is why astrologers fail to design "research
    protocols and run controlled tests in order to supply evidence for their art." Yet,
    in the same article Vaughan also claims that "astrology is not a science in the same
    sense as chemistry or physics....At most, it might be considered a social science."
        </font>
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         Having firmly established that astrology is a social science, she then notes that
    "other social sciences, such as history, are not regularly attacked for their
    failure to apply scientific methodology in a laboratory setting." How true.
    Apparently, Ms. Vaughan does not understand that scientific methodologies can be and are
    regularly applied outside a lab in the social sciences. Some of these methodologies are
    based  on logical principles such as
         <a href="http://pioneer.netserv.chula.ac.th/~hsoraj/PhilandLogic/WeekFive.html#Mill">
          Mill's
    Methods
         </a>
         , which most astrologers do not seem to believe apply to their discipline. Some
    of these methodologies involve the use of statistical analysis of data. Vaughan
    understands the need for statistical analysis, but does not believe the usual scientific
    protocols apply to astrology. She says that scientists "insist on statistical
    analysis using random samples. But astrology cannot be proved or disproved using random
    samples because astrology is based on the premise that
         <em>
          conditions are never random.
         </em>
         " 
    Vaughn's logic is one I am not familiar with, but it sounds like
         <a href="http://skepdic.com/nonsequitur.html">
          non sequitur

       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         A scientifically minded person might think Vaughan is wrong, considering all the
    tests done using random samples of both subjects and astrological readings that have shown
    that astrology has no significant predictive value. But Vaughan has something else in
    mind. Those studies made the assumption

           that any time is just as good as another to perform a test of astrology, but
      what if you're testing whether Pisces is less aggressive than Aries, and it so happens
      that Mars is rising during the test? Or suppose that preliminary research does reveal some
      validity in astrology, but in a later attempt at replicating the results, the Moon is void
      of course or Neptune is rising? Of course the results will be inconclusive!

         Further complicating matters, she says, is that when scientists (read
    "non-astrologers") test astrology they test parts of a person's chart. They
    ignore "the wholeness of a chart." Thus they commit the
         <a href="http://www1.ca.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/composition.html">

           fallacy of

    parts."

           Astrology is incredibly complex; there are innumerable variables which must be
      considered before an astrologer can confidently make a statement. Practitioners of
      astrology know that no one factor, such as the Moon in Aquarius, can 'mean' anything in an
      absolute sense. That Aquarian Moon could be out-of-bounds, in a different house, opposed
      Saturn, or affected by any number of other conditions that modify its significance.

       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         Vaughan has no awareness that it is this very complexity which marks astrology as a
         <a href="pseudosc.html">
          pseudoscience
         </a>
         . Nothing could ever disprove it. Astrology can explain everything that
    happens, even contradictory events. There is always some ready
         <a href="adhoc.html">
          ad
    hoc hypothesis
         </a>
         to explain away any apparent refuting data.

       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         However, what is disturbing about Vaughan's article is not her profound
    misunderstanding of science and scientific methodologies, but her call to astrologers to
    take to the road like the
         <a href="creation.html">
          creationists
         </a>
         did a few years ago
    and go on the attack. She is outraged that there are now textbooks in our schools that
    "contain entire units or learning activities aggressively aimed at teaching students
    to distinguish between science and 'pseudoscience.'" Worst of all, astrology is often
    used as the prototypical pseudoscience. This must be changed, she says. The debunkers of
    astrology are "intellectual control junkies who cannot bear the thought of a
    phenomenon they can't explain." The reason astrology is so badly treated is 
    that
    mainstream academia is afraid of "losing control, power, and status. Because of their
    need for intellectual and financial control, they keep expanding their territory, applying
    the scientific approach to areas that are just plain none of their business."

       </p>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         According to Vaughan, "scientist debunkers [of astrology] have entered the realm
    of public school education, but what else would you expect with Pluto currently in
    Sagittarius?" (What was that about nothing can mean anything in an absolute sense?)
    That is not all. Vaughan invites us to go with her down the slippery slope to envision
    science "infiltrating" the humanities, religion, philosophy, ethics--where
    "even poetry and drama are at risk."

       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         Vaughan's article is primarily a call to action. She urges astrologers not to sit back
    and be persecuted by Science. She advises that astrologers try to get astrology into the
    public school curriculum under the guise of "multicultural frameworks."

         <font face="Arial" size="3">
          <strong style="font-weight: 400">
           Since every culture in the world has developed a form of astrology, it is
      inherently diverse....A possible tactic is to approach the school authorities about
      admitting Western Astrology as a valid cultural tradition, and see what happens.

       </blockquote>
       <p style="text-align: left">
        <font face="Arial" size="3">
         Another approach, she says, is to try to take advantage of "a new educational
    craze which emphasizes student participation."

       <blockquote>

           The idea here is that, if students show an interest in a particular question
      (no matter how unrelated it is to the established curriculum), teachers are supposed to
      follow the direction of inquiry and incorporate it into the lesson. In other words, if
      students in an astronomy class show an interest in astrology, the new standards stipulate
      that the teacher shouldn't say that this is a topic students are not supposed to be
      learning. It will be interesting to see how this kind of situation is handled, because it
      is in direct confrontation with the standards that allow science teachers to debunk
      astrology under the guise of instruction in science history, 'critical thinking,' and
      scientific method.

         Knowledgeable readers 
    might shrug and laugh at Vaughan's notions and suppose that astrologers aren't going to get that
    close to any school curriculum. Think again. Astrologers have children and can belong to
    the P.T.A. Their kids can bring them to school for show-and-tell. Or, they could have
    credentials like Vaughan. She has a master's degree in Information Science and is the
    director of a science education library, where her duties include staying current with
    "guidelines and trends in science teaching, and to review the latest curriculum
    materials available." I wish I were kidding, but it gets worse. 
    Astrologers now have their own college.
