               From childhood to adulthood, the knowledge we gain or the experiences we have in our lives only helps us to discover our outer personality and brings us closer to material things of this world. At the same time we sometimes get depressed or fall into a low self-esteem Problem. Spiritual Affirmations help us get out of these problems. Spiritual Affirmations leads us towards a happy and satisfying life with a peaceful mind.
               <br/>
               <span style="">

               <span style="">
               </span>
               Affirmations are a judgment that we pass or any thought we have. An affirmation is directly linked to our sub consciousness. Affirmations can either be negative or positive which can either guide our subconscious actions to a successful life or towards failure.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Spiritual Affirmations are a form of meditation which when mediated often, have a desirable results. For example if a person has a lack of confidence or self-esteem problem sit in a peaceful, quiet place with some spiritual affirmations in your mind, let the emotions flow to you and start saying the spiritual affirmations aloud, 'I believe in myself' or 'My inner self will always guide me towards right path with decisions that are beneficial to me and others'.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The key behind spiritual affirmations is to let go of all your negative thoughts and trust completely in yourself. Instead of thinking 'This project is too difficult for me' try thinking 'I am capable of anything and obstacles do not effect me or my work'. Once you adopting this kind of spiritual affirmation you will notice a positive and healthy change in your life.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               The best way to carry out spiritual affirmation technique is to release your mind of any negative thought, sit in a peaceful and quiet place, relax and visualize any positive spiritual affirmation such as 'My mind is at peace now'. At the same time try to use simple words and sentences which can easily be interpreted by our mind and mind can easily accept it to be true.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Spiritual affirmations not only help to achieve a peaceful mind and happy life but also helps us draw closer to God. Remember God and His blessings as much as possible while utilizing the spiritual affirmation technique. For example I let my renewed soul thank God for His blessings or 'I release my old self and reborn with a new pure soul'. The most acceptable and commonly used word in spiritual affirmation is 'Amen' meaning 'so be it'. While some of us use it to conclude our prayer, it can be used for spiritual affirmation.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               For a positive result spiritual affirmation needs to be repeated many times for effectiveness. Write down any positive thought you get maybe in a diary, on a piece of card or whichever way is convenient to you. Review them daily to get your mind to completely accept these thoughts. Preferably review them twice a day. Initially during spiritual affirmation technique we will also get negative thoughts. Note down these thoughts as well and at the end of the day review them and try replacing them with something more positive. Once you perform this spiritual affirmation technique on a regular basis you will find a positive change in yourself with a renewed spirit.

               Your natural-born attributes are no accident - they can be  attributed to an ancient goddess whose energy prevailed at the time of  your birth.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Just like astrology, goddess energy defines who you are and what your life purpose may be.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               The time of day, year and even moon cycle influences our  personalities, values and choices. Women born into the new energy of  spring, for example, are Venus-inspired and are natural lovers. They  can't help swing those hips or flutter those eyelashes - Venus energy is  impossible to resist.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Every action, thought, projection of self, and treatment of others is a reflection of your goddess sign.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               For example, if you react to a boyfriend's indiscretions by  punishing the other woman, you are displaying Juno energies - she went  to extraordinary lengths to avenge her husband's concubines.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Or if you like to lay low and stay out of trouble, your ruling  goddess is most likely to be Hestia - she only wants a simple,   uncomplicated, enriching and contented life.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               No matter whether you're pleb or celeb, your goddess sign defines how you manage your choices and destinies.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Many attributes of life have been described in this book so you  can see that no matter what the situation, understanding your goddess  sign is one way to ensure you get through each day smiling.

               Powerful and zesty Athena is the beautiful warrior queen who  stood guard over the ancient city of Athens. Born leaders,  Athena-inspired women know no fear, or that's the face they present to  the world at least. They experience trouble with self-expression,  resorting to politics and force to coerce a project off the ground. They  can be tough, independent, clever and resourceful women, but they  should not be afraid to ask for help if they need it, and more  importantly, allow people to help them.

               Comfort, warmth and material security are the things that keep  devoted wife Juno happy. Prepared to go to any lengths to protect their  relationships, Juno-inspired women fight for the elements they want and  deserve in order to preserve and enrich the home environment. They  sometimes show an inclination for revenge on anyone who threatens the  stable union or home life. Instead of feeling threatened by outside  influences, Juno-women should instead strengthen the relationship from  within themselves, focussing on loyalty, fidelity, intimacy,  inter-dependence and mutual respect.

               Vital and intelligent Persephone, erstwhile professional  victim, was the innocent girl that was kidnapped to the underworld by  Hades (yes, but was it really kidnap? Well, maybe, at first).  Persephone-girls tend to be fickle, meaning "yes" when they say "no".  They secretly enjoy being the scapegoat and having their life in a  shambles, and won't do anything about it while they are really waiting  for a rescuer to swoop in and save them. Persephone-girls should stop  playing the drama queen and come up from the underworld - it is time to  stop luxuriating in guilt and try honesty on for size.

               Powerful and protective, Diana is the Roman goddess of nature,  fertility, children, providence and harvest. Finely tuned to their  environment and the feelings of others, Diana-inspired women are hunted  for their natural empathy and sensitivity. Deep down though, they want  escape. They hunger for more than their daily routine, but can't see  their way past their busy lifestyle. Commitments and responsibilities  make an escape (and "time out") seem like an impossible dream.  Diana-women should take time to look after their own need for love  instead of always giving it away to others.

               The bright and fiery Pele is the Hawaiian goddess whose spirit  dwells inside the largest active volcano in Hawaii. Full of passionate  energy, Pele gals love being the centre of attention and the life of the  party. Their well developed ego is a mask, however, for the nagging  feeling that their energy is being misdirected. They work so hard for  the attention and admiration from other people, they allow flattery to  interfere with their otherwise balanced judgement. Pele-inspired women  should cut their losses and work to channel their energy in a more  rewarding way.

               Goddess of household abundance and well-being, Hestia energises  the home with a welcoming energy, healthy food and comfort. As such,  she is a creature of habit and organisation, purity, sincerity, sanctity  and safety. But just as the ancient goddess Hestia is depicted in a  pose of immobility, so too are her women immobilised by their own habits  and need for organisation - simply, they may  feel like they are "stuck  in a rut."  Their convictions keep them so absorbed in their work, they  can't imagine living any other way. They need to ask themselves,  "What's the self-sacrifice for?" and break from their obsessive  patterns.

               The perfect lover, Venus is the Roman goddess of love and  beauty. She rules over a woman's sense of style and her appreciation for  acts of love, pleasure and romance. Venus-born women find it difficult  not to walk with a sassy step as they search for heady relationships,  friendships and social acceptance. In their quest for perfection they  are prone to self-criticism, forgetting the aura they exude is the aura  they attract. And though they are insightful leaders, they can blur the  line between business and pleasure, which can result in diminished  professional success. Venus women should revel in their playful  character and strong personality, but keep it appropriate to each  situation.

She represents courage, strength and an abiding patience  in seeking vengeance for wrong doings. Medusa women need to be careful  they don't become obsessed with bearing a grudge though, or they will  emulate their namesake after her face became frozen with rage and her  hair a seething tangle of snakes. By articulating hurt or feelings of  betrayal, Medusa women can remain in control of creative expression  rather than physical destruction.

She was born  with the first moonrise, embedding her with an inner urge for adventure  and travel. As such, she rode her unearthly white mare between this  world and the Underworld to satisfy her thirst for discovery.  Rhiannon-inspired women can be so focussed on the horizon, they forget  about being sensitive to those around them. They could learn a little  tact occasionally, and anticipate others' needs rather than waiting for  them to ask.

               In Greek mythology, Demeter is the goddess of the harvest. When  her daughter Persephone was abducted by Hades, Demeter's search took  her on the path of poverty, abuse and eventually madness. It is typical  of Demeter-inspired women to put the perceived needs of others first, at  the expense of their own well being. They aspire to champion a cause in  spectacular style, but tend to "smother" (as opposed to "mother") the  project they feel responsible for. They are better off ignoring their  ingrained sense of frugality and self sacrifice and concentrate instead  on cultivating things that make them happiest - children, herbs, or a  comfortable home, for example.

Hathor-inspired women have the gift of shape-shifting -  the ability to transform themselves from a woman crippled with anxiety  to a creature shining with light and radiance. In fact, it is a gift  they use often in their quest for reinvention. They are constantly  seeking new and fresh inspiration, which does not always sit well with  more grounded people. With each new manifestation, they need to spare a  thought for those they leave behind - not everyone is flexible with  changing natures.

Oshun women are as flexible  and predictable as the tides, being generous with their time for  themselves during an "ebb", and for others during a "flow". They "go  with the flow" of their instincts in order to find inner tranquility,  but can lose sight of the real world in doing so. Sometimes it would be  healthy for them stop drifting along without direction or intent, and  instead to find a place where they can simply be.

               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               We all experience severe heart break at some time in our lives. For many it happens in childhood or adolescence, the time when we are most vulnerable. A cold mother, an absent father, being different in any way from our peers and ostracized for it - these are some of the reasons for the early feeling that something is wrong, inadequate and utterly disappointing about us. For others, it happens later, when a spouse betrays our love and trust, a child is hurt, or our dream of making it big in the world is shattered.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               It happens -sooner or later- to everybody, yet strangely enough, we tend to believe that other people have heaps of money, great careers, excellent health, and are blessed with devoted spouses and perfect children. Even if common sense tells us that this isn't true, we behave as if it were. We hide behind our painted faces and empty phrases, as if our wounded heart was a rare, shameful thing that had to be hidden at all costs. Even if we are the light of every party, our real self never shows up. We withdraw and disconnect while telling pretty lies in appearance, word and deed. Thus our hearts shrink and harden, and we live lonesome, inauthentic lives deep within the fortress we have built from pride and fear.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               From this point on, two things can happen: either we become depressed or cynical enough to believe that staying in this barren place and turning into dust is our only option, or we listen to the cries of our exiled hearts and become seekers. If you belonged to the first group, you would not be reading this book. So let's start the search for our true selves. In the following imaginative exercise, you will begin to restore the lost connection to your heart. You may feel some resistance reading these words. Won't this lead to an emotional breakdown, or to an eruption of pain and anger? It depends on your intention.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               If you want to explore your childhood or other severe emotional trauma, there are medical and psychological professionals who are trained to guide you through that sensitive process.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               What we want to achieve here is to find and free our spiritual hearts. There is the heart, and there is the true heart. There is our "pink" heart, and there is our "golden" heart. There is our low heart, and there is our high heart.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Qualities of the low heart: Passion, Extremes, Volatility, Attachment, Emotion.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               Qualities of the high heart: Compassion, Balance, Patience, Unity, Spirit, Soul.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Again, our intention is to connect to the high, the spiritual heart. This may happen instantly, at the first try. If it does, it is a profound, awe-inspiring experience, and you will recognize the level of truth instantly. You will realize that there is, behind your physically sick or emotionally broken heart, a heart that is completely whole and strong and wise. However, establishing this pathway could be a much longer process. You might connect to "pieces" of your heart at a time. Perhaps you will first experience an acute awareness of your heart's imprisonment, or your inner space may remain silent for a while. Take it easy. Whatever happens is just the right thing to happen for you at this point.

               Exercise: Listen To Your Heart
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Sit or lie down comfortably, making sure you will not be disturbed. Close your eyes. Breathe. Relax. If relaxation does not come easily to you, visualize a thick, golden liquid pooling in your head. Slowly, slowly, like molasses, it flows down into your whole body, making it slack and heavy.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               When you feel relaxed, shift your attention to your chest. Imagine breathing through your chest. In-out. In-out. In-out. Do this as long as you want to. When you are ready, focus your attention gently on your heart.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Your high heart, your true heart, your spiritual heart.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Now, and possibly for the first time, greet your true heart. Express your gratitude for its continuous, life giving service, its protection and guidance.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               When you have established a connection, you might want to ask questions. Then be quiet and listen.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Listen to the voice of your heart. This voice might express itself in words, in feelings, in images, in sounds, or just as a "knowing". Learning to recognize the unique voice of your heart may take time, so relax if you can't "get it right" at first.

               <br/>
               In ancient Greece there were many specially chosen Goddesses  that were worshipped and revered for their beauty and boldness.  To name  a few -Aphrodite, Athena, Artemis, Demeter, and Persephone - each with a  domain to oversee. Goddesses reigned over relationships. Highly  spirited, they could be quite brutal if crossed and were not averse to  seeking revenge if wronged.
               <br/>
               <span style="">

               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               In the 21st century, the idea of a Goddess is becoming more  universally accepted, with the added benefit that every woman has the  right to be a Goddess in her own world.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               A modern-day Goddess knows that she is part of God/Source/All  that Is.  She is comfortable with her I Am.  She has successfully  integrated yin and yang, feminine and masculine energies.  She embodies  strength, sex appeal, and intelligence. She gracefully walks her path  with passion, purpose, and possibility. She isn't above others but it  very much at peace with herself and values herself to the extent that  she designs her own destiny, balancing love, work, and play beautifully.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               She is a woman who has a presence, who radiates an inner light  that can sometimes attract and sometimes intimidate others. Above all,  she is who she is and doesn't make apologies for it.  Why would she?  A  Goddess of the 21st century is a wonderful, warm, and loving human being  striving to evolve and grow while on her life's journey.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               A Goddess is an alluring, aware, authentic, action-oriented, and allowing woman in touch with her divinity.
               <br/>

               The modern-day Goddess is on a journey to discover and access  her divine power.  Her essence is a bright light that shines forth to  empower others to shine their light.  She demands special treatment  because she is a unique and special human being.  So she wisely  surrounds herself with people who see her greatness and who she can  relax and let down her guard with.   When it comes to relationships, she has higher standards than mere  mortals. She is seeking soul connections.  And while she may be too  enlightened for revenge, she will cut away with a swift sword anyone or  anything that does not honor her.  Because of her discerning eyes and  ears, she can see right through the ego's defense mechanisms and will  easily let go of anyone or anything that is blocking her ability to give  and receive love.

               A Goddess deserves respect and admiration.  She will not accept  anything less than what she is worthy of, and since she is of God, she  desires only the best! To get to know your inner Goddess, start with giving her a name.  Look  within  and ask your heart what is your Goddess name.  Start a  relationship with her and invite her to be more present in your life.   Ask for guidance when you need it and watch as your dreams magically  come true.

               As a visitor to our Spirituality and Religion services, you may wonder what you can do to strengthen your own connection to spirit to enliven your life, reduce your anxieties and get closer to your purpose. You may even wonder what it means to "connect to spirit" and how a spiritual advisor cultivates the capacity to do so. Let's start there.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Connecting to spirit means that you utilize your natural capacity to quiet your mind and still your worries long enough to hear again the voice of the Friend within you who holds the greatest wisdom for your life, the warmest arms for your concerns, and the most courageous heart to help you on your journey. Each of us, no matter our history, religious background, personal preoccupations or prior "failings" can connect to that Friend within. Each of us has a relationship with that Friend, whether or not we have consciously cultivated it.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Before you try to purposefully connect with your inner Friend, you may want to check in to see how much focus you've put into the relationship in the past-this gives you a baseline from which to start in considering how to strengthen the connection in your future.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <ul style="">
                <li style="">
                 Ask yourself, do I take a moment each day to sit with myself? One moment dedicated to the cultivation of this relationship can create a ripple of positive outcomes in your life. You do not need extended time-one conscious moment to check in and affirm your importance is the first step to cultivating your enduring conscious relationship to source.
                </li>
                <li style="">
                 Ask yourself, when I am running into difficulties, do I pause and ask for help? Do I quiet my mind, form a picture of source, and directly request support for troubles? Imagine that the inner Friend is waiting to be helpful and is chagrined when the opportunity for that help goes by unrequested.
                </li>
                <li style="">
                 Ask yourself, when I celebrate my good fortune, do I acknowledge my Friend? Do I believe that nothing is accomplished alone, or do I assume my singular efforts paid off? If it is your efforts alone, then the path to future success requires more effort. If it is your efforts energized by source, then the path will never be too challenging and successes will be markers of the strength of your collaboration with the Friend.
                </li>
               </ul>
               <br/>
               If you wish to actively nurture your relationship to the Friend within, you will eventually need to set aside time for quiet contemplation or meditation on the connection. But, let's say your life or your heart is not in a place right now where it feels you can do so. Instead, here is an exercise you can do to begin the connection, in a manner that makes you feel well-held by the Friend, and encourages you to go deeper into the discovery of what the relationship might be.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Sit in a chair. Put your feet firmly on the ground. Close your eyes. Take a breath. Place your hands at your side. Now, lift your hands slightly, extending your arms, palms upward, as if you are waiting for someone to place something soft and warm in your hands, like a baby bird. Count to 5. On the 5th count, imagine the baby bird is now in your hands. Bring your hands gently together, as if you are cuddling the baby bird. Now, imagine that safe, warm hands are cuddling your hands, in turn, helping keep the chick warm.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               You have made a connection to the Friend. The chick is a gift to you. Put the chick, in your imagination, somewhere safe, and each day, for a moment, send the chick, with your imagination, goodness to grow with. As the chick grows, so does your connection.

               Relationships are a key element in most people's lives. As John Donne stated so poignantly in the late 1500's: "No man is an island." These words still hold true today. Thus far, however, most people have not learned how to have successful relationships and still feel complete within themselves. Relationships are challenging because they involve two distinct individuals with varying needs, desires, and opinions. When the needs and desires of the individuals do not match, there are usually disagreements, disappointments, and disillusionment. It is during these times that we question our relationships and wonder if we would be better off alone. What then can be done to create a more satisfying relationship?
               <br/>
               <span style="">

               <span style="">
               </span>
               With conscious intention and effort, we can use our relationships to heal and transform our lives. This new paradigm, or model, for relationships consists of three steps: 1) taking responsibility for our actions and reactions; 2) experiencing our feelings deeply; and 3) expressing ourselves clearly and honestly to our partner while having equal empathy for our partner's feelings. When we learn to do this, our relationships can reach a deeper level of understanding and become a vehicle for our personal growth and fulfillment.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               The first step in the new paradigm, taking responsibility for our actions and reactions, can be an unfamiliar and sometimes frightening experience. It involves looking at how we are contributing to or creating the disturbing situation, instead of automatically blaming our partner for the misunderstanding. When we are able to let down our defenses and accept responsibility, both parties breathe a sigh of relief and the door to honest communication opens. For many people, the risk of taking responsibility for their actions and reactions is the hardest part of working on relationships. Men may feel like they are losing power or abdicating their throne. Women may feel like they are giving in or being weak and submissive. In both cases, it usually feels like some type of loss, either of personal power or of a part of ourselves. Although difficult at first, this step can lead to a much greater understanding of our reactive patterns of behavior and can accelerate our personal growth dramatically.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               The second step in this model is experiencing our feelings deeply. This step involves removing ourselves from the immediate situation and taking a deep breath in order to reflect on what is happening inside of us. We may become aware of certain bodily sensations such as tightness in the throat, chest or stomach area. Emotions such as sadness, hurt, or anger might surface. Thoughts or memories may come into our awareness. Learning to focus inwardly will take practice since many of us have spent very little time focusing on ourselves and how we actually feel. As with all the steps of this new paradigm, we must be patient with ourselves and appreciate each little step we take.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               Feeling deeply can also prove to be challenging because our present feelings are often influenced by what has gone on in our past. For instance, if we have had a relationship in the past that left us feeling criticized or unlovable, chances are good that our new relationship will also bring up those feelings. Love tends to bring to the surface any past hurts that need to be healed. This is one reason the new paradigm for relationships is so powerful. Instead of blindly repeating old ways of being, we can use our relationships to work on ourselves - to notice the patterns of thought and behavior that we continually relive and begin to explore them within the safety of the relationship. The key is to take the time to remove ourselves from the situation and feel what is actually going on inside. This gives us time to calmly reflect so we can act instead of react.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               The third step of this new model is expressing ourselves clearly and honestly to our partner while having equal empathy, or appreciation, for our partner's feelings. This step involves telling our partner the truth about how we feel. It is important to avoid the tendency to fall back on old patterns of relating such as making our partner wrong, going numb, playing out dramas based on old hurts, or entering into power struggles. To communicate clearly we need to go beyond blame and judgment and tell the truth about our experience. We need to make the decision that being happy in our relationship is more important than being right. The only way to do this is to be totally honest with ourselves and our partner.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Equally important in this third step is having empathy for our partner's feelings. This includes allowing our partner the opportunity to express how they feel and then making an honest attempt to understand them. In other words, we need to put ourselves in their place and experience what they are feeling. This type of exchange is the beginning of authentic communication and the birth of an entirely new type of relationship. Both parties will begin to feel empowered and loved. As a couple reaches greater depths of feeling and understanding, their strength grows in all areas of their lives.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Practicing the three steps of the new paradigm - taking responsibility for our actions and reactions, experiencing our feelings deeply, and expressing ourselves completely - will result in an enormous shift in our relationships, both with our partner and out in the world. Our communication will be clearer and more honest, we will gain greater respect for ourselves and others, and we will experience a greater sense of personal power, love, and joy in our lives.

               Spiritual Healing and Divine GuidanceIn the dictionary, "soul mate" means one of two persons compatible with each other in disposition, point of view or sensitivity; someone for whom you have a deep affinity. This explains the basic qualities, but we all know the soul mate theory goes much deeper than that.
               <br/>
               <span style="">

               <span style="">
               </span>
               According to Celtic wisdom, our souls begin their journey together as one being that becomes broken apart. Two souls emerge and move on into their life journeys. Perhaps we find our twin soul in this life. Maybe we find it in another life. Throughout time, we seek to rejoin our anam cara, the Celtic word for "soul friend", a soul mate who was created as our perfect match.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               In order for our soul mate to appear we must be ready for them. You will not meet your soul mate if you are still coming from a place of fear or jealousy in relationships. You couldn't run before you could walk, and you won't meet your soul mate before you are ready to learn what she/he has to teach you. In order to find our soul mate, we must be emotionally secure and know what we want from life.

               Three Kinds Of Soul MatesDid you know there are three main kinds of soul mates? They are: Karmic, Companion and Twin Flames. Study the different kinds and discover which category your soul mate falls under. This will give you a broader understanding of why he or she has come into your life. To help you, I will explain the differences.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               Karmic Soul MateThe karmic soul mate experience is very common. You can have many of these in a lifetime. They enter your life to teach you an important lesson. Karmic soul mates can be co-workers, family members or close friends. One young woman particularly close to me comes to mind. Her name is Amanda Jane, and she is about twenty years my junior. She jokes that I must be her mother from another life. What makes our friendship special is that we touch on a spiritual level.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               I often wonder why Amanda was brought into my life. We are very close, but what lesson am I to learn from her? To enjoy life again? Amanda comes from a dysfunctional family. Am I here to teach her a lesson? Am I to show her that she is loved and cherished? It can and does work both ways.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Sometimes karmic soul mate relationships can be romantic in nature; but if so, they won't last long. That is because these relationships are solely meant for learning lessons and for growth rather than for obtaining a life partner.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Another thing we must keep in mind is that not all karmic relationships are human. Sometimes, pets we consider to be special members of our family can display the same karmic characteristics as humans. An example of this is Avis Townsend's story "Back With Eli" in the karmic section of the book. Ms. Townsend's story shows there are special relationships we can have with our pets to the point where the bond between pet and human becomes so deep it's hard to dismiss it as anything other than the true karmic soul mate relationship.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Another point to remember about karmic soul mates, as well as other kinds of soul mates, is that each one, whether human or animal, comes into our lives for a reason and to teach us a lesson about ourselves.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Companion Soul MateA companion soul mate relationship can be a relationship that is romantic in nature. It involves your wife/husband or someone you are intimate with. Oftentimes, these soul mates are not destined to be with us forever but, like Karmic soul mates, are brought into our lives for a purpose.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               It is possible to spend a lifetime with your companion soul mate if you haven't met your twin soul. However, when the twin soul is found, the companion soul mate relationship could suffer. When this happens, the companion soul mate relationship is generally short-lived or, if it continues, a non-satisfying one. However, this is no reason to jump ship when it happens. Remember, there is a reason your companion soul mate is in your life (for example, so you can raise children together).
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               When your twin soul comes into your life and you are in a companion soul mate relationship, it is important that you take things slowly. It may be that the companion soul mate relationship will come to an end--or it may not. One thing you must keep in mind is that ending an existing relationship solely because one feels one has found one's twin soul is never a good idea, because over time you will realize that both associations are meant to be and both have an important role in your life.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               An interesting aspect of the companion soul mate relationship is that we put more of our energies into it. The karmic soul mate relationship tends to go at an easy pace, without much effort from either partner, as it does with twin souls. The companion soul mate bond requires more work on our parts to sustain a healthy, loving atmosphere.
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               <br/>
               <span style="">
               </span>
               Twin FlamesThis is the highest form of soul mate connection. Your twin soul is your other half; to find your twin soul is like finding yourself. We go through our life searching and searching, and what we don't realize is that we are looking for someone just like us. Sometimes, we find them in this life and, other times, in other lives.

               I believe they are always around, but for some reason it is not apparent. Perhaps we close our eyes to them. We don't listen and observe. We go through life at such a hectic pace we don't stop and take in things that would otherwise be apparent, so the presence of a soul mate could hit us flat in the face and we wouldn't even know it. This is sad, because we have missed that one, rare opportunity for total bliss and happiness.
