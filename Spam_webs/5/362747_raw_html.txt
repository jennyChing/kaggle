   Anyone who has ever viewed the motion picture PATTON will
never
forget the opening. George Campbell Scott, portraying Patton,
standing in front of an immensely huge American flag, delivers
his version of Patton's "Speech to the Third Army" on
June 5th, 1944, the eve of the Allied invasion of France, code-named
"Overlord".
  </p>
  <p>
   Scott's rendition of the speech was highly sanitized so as
not to offend too many fainthearted Americans. Luckily, the soldiers
of the American Army who fought World War II were not so fainthearted.
  </p>
  <p>
   After one of my lectures on the subject of General Patton,
I spoke with a retired Major-General who was a close friend of
Patton and who had been stationed with him in the 1930's in the
Cavalry. He explained to me that the movie was a very good portrayal
of Patton in that it was the way he wanted his men and the public
to see him, as a rugged, colorful commander. There was one exception,
however, according to the Major General. In reality, Patton was
a much more profane speaker than the movie dared to exhibit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton had a unique ability regarding profanity. During a
normal
conversation, he could liberally sprinkle four letter words into
what he was saying and the listeners would hardly take notice
of it. He spoke so easily and used those words in such a way that
it just seemed natural for him to talk that way.
  </p>
  <p>
   He could, when necessary, open up with both barrels and let
forth such blue-flamed phrases that they seemed almost eloquent
in their delivery. When asked by his nephew about his profanity,
Patton remarked, "When I want my men to remember something
important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty.
It may not sound nice to some bunch of little old ladies at an
afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You
can't run an army without profanity; and it has to be eloquent
profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight it's way out
of a piss-soaked paper bag."
  </p>
  <p>
   "As for the types of comments I make", he continued
with a wry smile, "Sometimes I just, By God, get carried
away with my own eloquence."
  </p>
  <p>
   When I appeared on a local San Diego television show to
discuss
my Patton Collection a viewer living in a suburb of San Diego,
was very interested for personal reasons. Her husband had been
a lieutenant assigned to General Patton's Third Army Headquarters,
code named "Lucky Forward" and he had known General
Patton quite well.
  </p>
  <p>
   He had recently died and had left to his wife a box that he
had brought home with him from the European Theater of Operations.
  </p>
  <p>
   The lady invited me to her home to inspect the box to see if
there was anything in it that might be useful to me in my search
for "collectibles".
  </p>
  <p>
   Opening the box, I immediately thanked her. Inside was one
of only a couple hundred copies printed of the Official United
States Third Army After-Action Reports. It is a huge two volume
history of the Third Army throughout their 281 days of combat
in Europe. She said that she had no use for it and that I could
have it. I left with my new treasure.
  </p>
  <p>
   When I arrived at my office and removed the foot-thick,
oversized
books from the box, I had an even greater surprise. Under the
Reports lay a small stack of original Third Army memos, orders,
AND a carbon copy of the original speech that had been typed by
some unknown clerk at Lucky Forward and had been widely distributed
throughout Third Army.
  </p>
  <p>
   A few years earlier, I had discovered an almost illegible
xerox
of a carbon copy of a similar speech. This one came from the Army
War College and was donated to their Historical Library Section
in 1957.
  </p>
  <p>
   I decided to do some research on the speech to obtain the best
one possible and to make an attempt to locate the identity of
the "unknown soldier" who had clandestinely typed and
distributed the famous document. I began by looking in my collection
of old magazines, newspapers, books that have been written about
Patton since his death, and dozens of other books which had references
to Patton and his speech.
  </p>
  <p>
   I discovered some interesting facts. The most interesting
probably
being that George C. Scottwas not the first actor to perform
the speech.
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1951, the New American Mercury Magazine had printed a
version
of the speech (they would have usednew plastic printer
inkcartridges if they had them back then) which was almost
exactly the
same version printed
by John O'Donnell in his "Capitol Stuff" column for
the New York Daily News on May 31, 1945. According to the editors
of the New American Mercury, their copy was obtained from Congressman
Joseph Clark Baldwin who had returned from a visit to Patton's
Headquarters in Czechoslovakia.
  </p>
  <p>
   After publication, the magazinereceived such a large
reader
response asking for reprints of the speech that the editors decided
to go one step further.
  </p>
  <p>
   They hired a "famous" actor to make an "unexpurgated"
recording of the Patton speech. This recording was to be made
available to veterans of Third Army and anyone else who would
like to have one. The term "famous" was the only
referencemade by the editors about the actor who recorded the
speech. In
a later column they explained, "We hired an excellent actor
whose voice, on records, is almost indistinguishable from Patton's,
and with RCA's best equipment we made two recordings; one just
as Patton delivered it, with all the pungent language of a cavalryman,
and in the other we toned down a few of the more offensive words.
Our plan wasto offer our readers, at cost, either recording."
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately, a few years ago, their was a fire in the
editorial
offices of the magazine which destroyed almost all of their old
records. The name of the actor was lost in that accident.
  </p>
  <p>
   Only one master recording of the speech was made. The magazine
Editors, not wanting to offend either Mrs. Patton or her family,
asked for her sanction of the project. The Editors explained the
situation thusly, "While we had only the master recordings,
we submitted them to our friend, Mrs. Patton, and asked her to
approve our plan. It was not a commercial venture and no profits
were involved. We just wanted to preserve what to us seems a worthwhile
bit of memorabilia of the Second World War. Our attorneys advised
us that legally we did not need Mrs. Patton's approval, but we
wanted it."
  </p>
  <p>
   "Mrs. Patton considered the matter graciously and thoroughly,
and gave us a disappointing decision. She took the position that
this speeches was made by the General only to the men who were
going to fight and die with him; it was, therefore, not a speech
for the public or for posterity."
  </p>
  <p>
   "We think Mrs. Patton is wrong; we think that what is
great and worth preserving about General Patton was expressed
in that invasion speech. The fact that he employed four letter
words was proper; four letter words are the language of war; without
them wars would be quite impossible."
  </p>
  <p>
   When Mrs. Patton's approval was not forthcoming, the entire
project was then scrapped, and the master recordings were destroyed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton always knew exactly what he wanted to say to his
soldiers
and he never needed notes. He always spoke to his troops
extemporaneously.
As a general rule of thumb, it is safe to say that Patton usually
told his men some of his basic thoughts and concepts regarding
his ideas of war and tactics. Instead of the empty, generalized
rhetoric of no substance often used by Eisenhower,Patton
spoke
to his men in simple, down to earth language that they understood.
He told them truthful lessons he had learned that would keep them
alive.
  </p>
  <p>
   As he traveled throughout battle areas, he always took the
time to speak to individual soldiers, squads, platoons, companies,
regiments, divisions or whatever size group could be collected.
About the only difference in the context of these talks was that
the smaller the unit, the more "tactical" the talk would
be. Often he would just give his men some sound, common sense
advice that they could follow in order to keep from being killed
or maimed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The speech which follows is a third person narrative. From
innumerable sources; magazine articles, newspaper clippings, motion
picture biographies and newsreels, and books, I have put together
the most complete version possible that encompasses all of the
material that is available to date.

  <p>
   The big camp buzzed with a tension. For hundreds of eager
rookies,
newly arrived from the states, it was a great day in their lives.
This day marked their first taste of the "real thing".
Now they were not merely puppets in brown uniforms. They were
not going through the motions of soldiering with three thousand
miles of ocean between them and English soil. They were actually
in the heart of England itself. They were waiting for the arrival
of that legendary figure, Lieutenant General George S. Patton,
Jr. Old "Blood and Guts" himself, about whom many a
colorful chapter would be written for the school boys of tomorrow.
Patton of the brisk, purposeful stride. Patton of the harsh, compelling
voice, the lurid vocabulary, the grim and indomitable spirit that
carried him and his Army to glory in Africa and Sicily. They called
him "America's Fightingest General". He was no desk
commando. He was the man who was sent for when the going got rough
and a fighter was needed. He was the most hated and feared American
of all on the part of the German Army.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton was coming and the stage was being set. He would
address
a move which might have a far reaching effect on the global war
that, at the moment, was a TOP-SECRET in the files in Washington,
D.C.
  </p>
  <p>
   The men saw the camp turn out "en masse" for the
first time and in full uniform, too. Today their marching was
not lackadaisical. It was serious and the men felt the difference.
From the lieutenants in charge of the companies on down in rank
they felt the difference.
  </p>
  <p>
   In long columns they marched down the hill from the barracks.
They counted cadence while marching. They turned off to the left,
up the rise and so on down into the roped off field where the
General was to speak. Gold braid and stripes were everywhere.
Soon, company by company, the hillside was a solid mass of brown.
It was a beautiful fresh English morning. The tall trees lined
the road and swayed gently in the breeze. Across the field, a
British farmer calmly tilled his soil. High upon a nearby hill
a group of British soldiers huddled together, waiting for the
coming of the General. Military Police were everywhere wearing
their white leggings, belts, and helmets. They were brisk and
grim. The twittering of the birds in the trees could be heard
above the dull murmur of the crowd and soft, white clouds floated
lazily overhead as the men settled themselves and lit cigarettes.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the special platform near the speakers stand, Colonels and
Majors were a dime a dozen. Behind the platform stood General
Patton's "Guard of Honor"; all specially chosen men.
At their right was a band playing rousing marches while the crowd
waited and on the platform a nervous sergeant repeatedly tested
the loudspeaker. The moment grew near and the necks began to crane
to view the tiny winding road that led to Stourport-on-Severn.
A captain stepped to the microphone. "When the General arrives,"
he said sonorously, "the band will play the Generals March
and you will all stand at attention."
  </p>
  <p>
   By now the rumor had gotten around that Lieutenant General
Simpson, Commanding General of the Fourth Army, was to be with
General Patton. The men stirred expectantly. Two of the big boys
in one day!
  </p>
  <p>
   At last, the long black car, shining resplendently in the
bright
sun, roared up the road, preceded by a jeep full of Military Police.
A dead hush fell over the hillside. There he was! Impeccably dressed.
With knee high, brown, gleaming boots, shiny helmet, and his Colt
.45 Peacemaker swinging in its holster on his right side.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton strode down the incline and then straight to the stiff
backed "Guard of Honor". He looked them up and down.
He peered intently into their faces and surveyed their backs.
He moved through the ranks of the statuesque band like an avenging
wraith and, apparently satisfied, mounted the platform with Lieutenant
General Simpson and Major General Cook, the Corps Commander, at
his side.
  </p>
  <p>
   Major General Cook then introduced Lieutenant General Simpson,
whose Army was still in America, preparing for their part in the
war.
  </p>
  <p>
   "We are here", said General Simpson, "to listen
to the words of a great man. A man who will lead you all into
whatever you may face with heroism, ability, and foresight. A
man who has proven himself amid shot and shell. My greatest hope
is that some day soon, I will have my own Army fighting with his,
side by side."
  </p>
  <p>
   General Patton arose and strode swiftly to the microphone.
The men snapped to their feet and stood silently. Patton surveyed
the sea of brown with a grim look. "Be seated", he said.
The words were not a request, but a command. The General's voice
rose high and clear.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Men, this stuff that some sources sling around about
America wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight, is a crock
of bullshit. Americans love to fight, traditionally. All real
Americans love the sting and clash of battle. You are here today
for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend your
homes and your loved ones. Second, you are here for your own self
respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third,
you are here because you are real men and all real men like to
fight. When you, here, everyone of you, were kids, you all admired
the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the toughest boxer,
the big league ball players, and the All-American football players.
Americans love a winner. Americans will not tolerate a loser.
Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time.
I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed.
That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war;
for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American."
  </p>
  <p>
   The General paused and looked over the crowd. "You are
not all going to die," he said slowly. "Only two percent
of you right here today would die in a major battle. Death must
not be feared. Death, in time, comes to all men. Yes, every man
is scared in his first battle. If he says he's not, he's a liar.
Some men are cowards but they fight the same as the brave men
or they get the hell slammed out of them watching men fight who
are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who fights
even though he is scared. Some men get over their fright in a
minute under fire. For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes
days. But a real man will never let his fear of death overpower
his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood.
Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being
can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all
that is base. Americans pride themselves on being He Men and they
ARE He Men. Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you
are, and probably more so. They are not supermen."
  </p>
  <p>
   "All through your Army careers, you men have bitched about
what you call "chicken shit drilling". That, like everything
else in this Army, has a definite purpose. That purpose is alertness.
Alertness must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a fuck
for a man who's not always on his toes. You men are veterans or
you wouldn't be here. You are ready for what's to come. A man
must be alert at all times if he expects to stay alive. If you're
not alert, sometime, a German son-of-an-asshole-bitch is going
to sneak up behind you and beat you to death with a sockful of
shit!" The men roared in agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton's grim expression did not change. "There are four
hundred neatly marked graves somewhere in Sicily", he roared
into the microphone, "All because one man went to sleep on
the job". He paused and the men grew silent. "But they
are German graves, because we caught the bastard asleep before
they did". The General clutched the microphone tightly, his
jaw out-thrust, and he continued, "An Army is a team. It
lives, sleeps, eats, and fights as a team. This individual heroic
stuff is pure horse shit. The bilious bastards who write that
kind of stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more
about real fighting under fire than they know about fucking!"
  </p>
  <p>
   The men slapped their legs and rolled in glee. This was Patton
as the men had imagined him to be, and in rare form, too. He hadn't
let them down. He was all that he was cracked up to be, and more.
He had IT!
  </p>
  <p>
   "We have the finest food, the finest equipment, the best
spirit, and the best men in the world", Patton bellowed.
He lowered his head and shook it pensively. Suddenly he snapped
erect, faced the men belligerently and thundered, "Why, by
God, I actually pity those poor sons-of-bitches we're going up
against. By God, I do". The men clapped and howled delightedly.
There would be many a barracks tale about the "Old Man's"
choice phrases. They would become part and parcel of Third Army's
history and they would become the bible of their slang.
  </p>
  <p>
   "My men don't surrender", Patton continued, "I
don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured
unless he has been hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight
back. That's not just bull shit either. The kind of man that I
want in my command is just like the lieutenant in Libya, who,
with a Luger against his chest, jerked off his helmet, swept the
gun aside with one hand, and busted the hell out of the Kraut
with his helmet. Then he jumped on the gun and went out and killed
another German before they knew what the hell was coming off.
And, all of that time, this man had a bullet through a lung. There
was a real man!"
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton stopped and the crowd waited. He continued more
quietly,
"All of the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters,
either. Every single man in this Army plays a vital role. Don't
ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. Every
man has a job to do and he must do it. Every man is a vital link
in the great chain. What if every truck driver suddenly decided
that he didn't like the whine of those shells overhead, turned
yellow, and jumped headlong into a ditch? The cowardly bastard
could say, "Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands".
But, what if every man thought that way? Where in the hell would
we be now? What would our country, our loved ones, our homes,
even the world, be like? No, Goddamnit, Americans don't think
like that. Every man does his job. Every man serves the whole.
Every department, every unit, is important in the vast scheme
of this war. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns and
machinery of war to keep us rolling. The Quartermaster is needed
to bring up food and clothes because where we are going there
isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last man on K.P. has a job
to do, even the one who heats our water to keep us from getting
the 'G.I. Shits'."
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton paused, took a deep breath, and continued, "Each
man must not think only of himself, but also of his buddy fighting
beside him. We don't want yellow cowards in this Army. They should
be killed off like rats. If not, they will go home after this
war and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave
men. Kill off the Goddamned cowards and we will have a nation
of brave men. One of the bravest men that I ever saw was a fellow
on top of a telegraph pole in the midst of a furious fire fight
in Tunisia. I stopped and asked what the hell he was doing up
there at a time like that. He answered, "Fixing the wire,
Sir". I asked, "Isn't that a little unhealthy right
about now?" He answered, "Yes Sir, but the Goddamned
wire has to be fixed". I asked, "Don't those planes
strafing the road bother you?" And he answered, "No,
Sir, but you sure as hell do!" Now, there was a real man.
A real soldier. There was a man who devoted all he had to his
duty, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty might appear
at the time, no matter how great the odds. And you should have
seen those trucks on the road to Tunisia. Those drivers were
magnificent.
All day and all night they rolled over those son-of-a-bitching
roads, never stopping, never faltering from their course, with
shells bursting all around them all of the time. We got through
on good old American guts. Many of those men drove for over forty
consecutive hours. These men weren't combat men, but they were
soldiers with a job to do. They did it, and in one hell of a way
they did it. They were part of a team. Without team effort, without
them, the fight would have been lost. All of the links in the
chain pulled together and the chain became unbreakable."
  </p>
  <p>
   The General paused and stared challengingly over the silent
ocean of men. One could have heard a pin drop anywhere on that
vast hillside. The only sound was the stirring of the breeze in
the leaves of the bordering trees and the busy chirping of the
birds in the branches of the trees at the General's left.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Don't forget," Patton barked, "you men don't
know that I'm here. No mention of that fact is to be made in any
letters. The world is not supposed to know what the hell happened
to me. I'm not supposed to be commanding this Army. I'm not even
supposed to be here in England. Let the first bastards to find
out be the Goddamned Germans. Some day I want to see them raise
up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl, 'Jesus Christ, it's
the Goddamned Third Army again and that son-of-a-fucking-bitch
Patton'."
  </p>
  <p>
   "We want to get the hell over there", Patton continued,
"The quicker we clean up this Goddamned mess, the quicker
we can take a little jaunt against the purple pissing Japs and
clean out their nest, too. Before the Goddamned Marines get all
of the credit."
  </p>
  <p>
   The men roared approval and cheered delightedly. This
statement
had real significance behind it. Much more than met the eye and
the men instinctively sensed the fact. They knew that they themselves
were going to play a very great part in the making of world history.
They were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness
lay behind the General's colorful words. The men knew and understood
it. They loved the way he put it, too, as only he could.
  </p>
  <p>
   Patton continued quietly, "Sure, we want to go home. We
want this war over with. The quickest way to get it over with
is to go get the bastards who started it. The quicker they are
whipped, the quicker we can go home. The shortest way home is
through Berlin and Tokyo. And when we get to Berlin", he
yelled, "I am personally going to shoot that paper hanging
son-of-a-bitch Hitler. Just like I'd shoot a snake!"
  </p>
  <p>
   "When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays
there all day, a German will get to him eventually. The hell with
that idea. The hell with taking it. My men don't dig foxholes.
I don't want them to. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep
moving. And don't give the enemy time to dig one either. We'll
win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and by showing
the Germans that we've got more guts than they have; or ever will
have. We're not going to just shoot the sons-of-bitches, we're
going to rip out their living Goddamned guts and use them to grease
the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun
cocksuckers by the bushel-fucking-basket. War is a bloody, killing
business. You've got to spill their blood, or they will spill
yours. Rip them up the belly. Shoot them in the guts. When shells
are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt off your face
and realize that instead of dirt it's the blood and guts of what
once was your best friend beside you, you'll know what to do!"
  </p>
  <p>
   "I don't want to get any messages saying, "I am holding
my position." We are not holding a Goddamned thing. Let the
Germans do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested
in holding onto anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going
to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all of
the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep
on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under,
or through the enemy. We are going to go through him like crap
through a goose; like shit through a tin horn!"
  </p>
  <p>
   "From time to time there will be some complaints that
we are pushing our people too hard. I don't give a good Goddamn
about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that
an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push,
the more Germans we will kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer
of our men will be killed. Pushing means fewer casualties. I want
you all to remember that."

will all be able to say after this war is over and you are home

your Granddaddy shoveled shit in Louisiana." No, Sir, you
can look him straight in the eye and say, "Son, your Granddaddy
rode with the Great Third Army and a Son-of-a-Goddamned-Bitch
named Georgie Patton!"
