Certainly, scientists search for origins of life on other planets, but astrobiology also uncovers new forms of Earth life we've never imagined before. The scientific tools to do so are advancing faster than ever, and as outer space travel increasingly becomes the domain of SpaceX and other private companies, NASA and foreign space agencies are focusing more resources on inner astrobiology. \nSpecifically, the study of and uses for alien-like life on Earth. \nIn 2010, geobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon's team found a strange form of \"arsenic life\" in California's Mono Lake. Unlike all other earthly life, it subsisted on the poisonous element arsenic instead of phosphorous. It was alien.\nThe science community raised serious questions about her team\u2019s paper, encircling her and fellow authors in controversy. However, it was an unprecedented finding. Even if Wolfe-Simon and her group were wrong, their research helped pioneer a process to suss out microbial life not of this earth \u2014 on Earth.\n\nCalifornia's Mono Lake is roughly 760,000 years old and contains high salt that harbors extremophiles, or alien-like organisms that thrive in environments that would eviscerate most other Earthly life.Image: Flickr, Dhilung KiratA year later, Richard Hoover, an astrophysicist at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center who helped found NASA\u2019s astrobiology program, made a startling claim: Some Martian meteorites showed proof of extraterrestrial life. According to Hoover, an asteroid uncovered by scientists in Antarctica in 1996 contained \u201cmicrofossils,\u201d tiny, microscopic gaps and fibers that indicated the presence of microbial life on Mars. This was the third time since 1997 Hoover asserted he'd found proof of extraterrestrial life in meteorites. \nSoon, however, NASA officially distanced itself from Hoover\u2019s claim after major issues arose with the peer review process. Hoover retired shortly after and is currently a visiting professor at the University of Buckingham in Great Britain.\nNeither Hoover nor Wolfe-Simon managed to convince the larger scientific community that they had proof of extraterrestrial life. But both came closer than anyone before. \nAstrobiology research, conducted mostly under the aegis of NASA and a few other space agencies, is attempting to answer the big, existential questions of humanity \u2014 where we came from, how life came about, the origins of the solar system and whether there's anything else in space lifelike at all. In an age when the vanguard of space travel is transitioning from governments to private corporations like SpaceX, NASA is redefining itself as a cutting-edge research institution. \nBonus: Discovering alien microbial life would be the holy grail of all funding goals. \nIn the meantime, though, what are we finding? And are astrobiology discoveries helping humans?\nTurns out, the study of alien life and life\u2019s origins has huge industrial applications here on Earth. Astrobiology research is helping everything from recycling to oil prospecting. And astrobiologists are using these applications to justify their continued search for extraterrestrial life. If researchers keep serving everyday industrial needs in sectors like health care, for example, it helps to secure funding from skeptical government bureaucrats and create revenue streams for these scientists to conduct their unusual research in the first place.\nThe alien catch-22. The search for E.T. depends just as much on heavy industry or big health care as it does on NASA.\nLife (and patents) on Mars\n\nPersonnel walk on the \"Mars Yard Test Area,\" a testing ground where robotic vehicles (ExoMars Rover at left) of the European Space Agency ExoMars program scheduled for 2018, are tested in Stevenage, England, Thursday, March 27, 2014.Image: Lefteris Pitarakis/Associated PressBy 2020, the European Union and Russia \u2014 if God, the European budget crisis and international geopolitics cooperate \u2014 are expected to launch a Martian rover called ExoMars. It will complement the American Mars Curiosity Rover and its successor in surveying the Red Planet\u2019s surface. When ExoMars begins its slow path across Martian soil, it will search for evidence of past microbial life.\nSome of the ExoMars equipment comes from a device called the Mars Organic Analyzer (MOA), a system built to find amino acids that could indicate the presence of life. Created by Alison Skelley and Richard Mathies of the University of California, Berkeley, in conjunction with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, MOA searches for amino acids that spiral to the left instead of the right, like most other amino acids. Many scientists, Mathies and Skelley included, feel this \u201cright-handedness\u201d is a hallmark of organic life. \nWhile the device was being tested in the dry, Mars-like deserts of Chile, Mathies says, \"This instrument is a thousand times better at detecting biomarkers than any instrument put on Mars before.\u201d\nBut a machine originally meant to detect alien life on another planet soon found different uses. \nThe MOA helped Mathies develop something completely terrestrial, even ordinary: A way to predict (and thus, avoid) the headaches and flushed skin associated with red wine.\nThe same biochips MOA used to analyze organic material could detect amines that contribute to red wine headaches. Mathies eventually spun the technology into a suitcase-sized prototype, which could determine in a number of seconds whether a particular variety of wine contained certain amines.\nMathies\u2019 discovery is just one of several industrial advances made by astrobiologists, after studying outer space and extremophiles (that is, \u201cstrange\u201d life that lives in underwater thermal vents, the far Arctic or other inhospitable environments). Other applications: bacteria used to manufacture super-strong plastics, polymers used to clean oil spills and detection mechanisms for counterfeit pharmaceuticals.\n\nScientists drilled into Lake Vostok, Antractica, a frozen lake covered by nearly 4,000 meters of ice. Once they reached the lake, they collected samples of some of Earth's strangest life, which can be used to help create biodegradable plastic-like materials.Image:  North Carolina State UniversityTake the extremophiles in Antarctica\u2019s Lake Vostok. The mysterious body of water is covered by approximately 13,000 feet of ancient glacial ice. Before scientists completed drilling core samples in 2012, Vostok was undisturbed by the surface world for at least 15 million years. They soon discovered, however, Vostok is home to some very unusual small organisms that thrive in salt-rich environments.\nResearchers Ram Karan and Dahe Zhao found that these creatures \u2014 called halophiles \u2014 could help produce biofuel, chemical waste treatment or even biodegradable, plastic-like materials. This strange new organism, which humanity only unearthed within the past few years, turned out to have multiple applications.\nSimilarly, enzymes found in the alien ecosystems of searingly hot Yellowstone National Park geysers can treat wastes from chemical bleaching processes and are unusually useful at degrading hydrogen peroxide. They thrive in the high-temperature, pH-rich chemical stew of industrial bleaching solutions.\n\nScientists study strange forms of microscopic life found in Antarctica, in hot springs in Yellowstone Park and in the Chilean desert to get an idea of what extraterrestrial microbes could be like.Image:  Nicole Ragger Fuller,  National Science FoundationAccording to Lynne Rothschild, an astrobiologist and synthetic biologist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center, the study of extremophiles has surprising commercial potential. In 2012, she told an audience at Stanford University that research into extremophiles could lead to important scientific discoveries in deflecting ultraviolet radiation (thanks to strange bacteria that live in radiation-rich environments), protecting ancient historic sites like the Lascaux Cave paintings in France from bacteria, and developing new antifreeze proteins for \u201ceverything from blood preservation to ice cream preservation.\u201d\nWhen scientists search Earth like they would search for extraterrestrial life, the industrial (and monetization) potential is vast.\nAnswering the big questions\n\nPaul Davies is a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, astrobiologist and author.Image: Flickr, Christopher MichelPaul Davies, an English-born physicist and cosmologist, is one of Arizona State\u2019s best known scientific figures. The author of a successful line of pop science books with names like How to Build a Time Machine and Are We Alone?, Davies heads up the University\u2019s Beyond Center. Beyond focuses on answering big questions traditionally addressed by philosophy \u2014 \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d and \u201cWhere did we come from?\u201d \u2014 using the tools of scientific inquiry. \nDavies explained his theory that the origin of life will be discovered through information theory rather than chemistry. In layperson\u2019s terms, that means Davies and his colleague Sara Imari Walker believe that humanity will best understand life\u2019s origins on Earth through analytical approaches typically used in computer science and mathematics \u2014 not, like most scientists believe, through chemistry or biology. \n(Walker\u2019s lab at Arizona State is deeply involved in this hypothesis. Her published papers would sound familiar to any tech geek: \u201cThe Algorithmic Origins of Life,\u201d for example.)\nIt is an unorthodox opinion, but one that falls within the range of scientific plausibility. And it certainly attracts today's innovation-hungry media and an all-star roster of bold-faced scientists. Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins, Microsoft Research\u2019s Eric Horvitz and Craig Ventner all appeared onstage at one of Arizona State's recent astrobiology-focused events, run by Lawrence Krauss' Origins Project. The project centers around public education about developments in cosmology, biology and physics \u2014 the building blocks of astrobiology. \n\nTheoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss speaks at The Amazing Meeting (TAM) in Las Vegas, Nev. in 2011.Image:  Lawrence KraussKrauss described the purpose of Origins: \u201cIt brings together scientists from vastly different disciplines to look at forefront questions,\u201d and uses astrobiology and the questions of humanity\u2019s origins as an attention-getter that ropes the public into attending talks and conferences.\nSimilar research takes place a few hours\u2019 flight away at the University of California, Berkeley. Mathies and colleagues work with NASA to conduct astrobiology research in conjunction with ASU and a few other universities. NASA\u2019s astrobiology program is tasked with funding and promoting research into what they call the \u201cstudy of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.\u201d Astrobiology researchers at Berkeley have conducted groundbreaking research to try to find proof of extraterrestrial microscopic life here in the solar system.\nCraig Stark is an astronomer at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who studies the atmospheres of planets outside the solar system. That means he studies clouds on other planets. In a conversation with Mashable, Stark said these clouds are far different than any hovering above Earth. \u201cThey aren\u2019t clouds made of droplets of water; they are made of drops of magnesium, silicates, fancy minerals similar to what you'd see in a volcanic ice cloud on this planet.\u201d\nEverything, for astrobiologists, comes down to the question of answering how life first arose \u2014 or if they can\u2019t do that, connecting the dots of the conditions that led to life coming into existence. Because NASA and the European Space Agency are constantly fighting for funding, astrobiologists have to fight an uphill battle for their share of the cake. The patents that come with studying strange, novel forms of life help justify their funding. By finding industrial applications, astrobiologists are able to subsidize their research into E.T.\nAnd the occasional huge outer space discovery doesn't hurt.\nSince the Hubble Space Telescope was deployed, scientists have identified 1,732 exoplanets outside the solar system. It's a game-changer, Stark says. Because researchers are now able to observe and record data about exoplanets, it\u2019s meant a shift from hypothetical guesses to a more substantial, evidence-based approach toward extraterrestrial life. It has made astrobiologists\u2019 research efforts far easier.\nAnd NASA wants to keep paving the astrobiology roadmap \u2014 whether it\u2019s theorizing the origins of life or searching for extraterrestrial life.\n\nThe Habitable Planets Catalog uses a ranking called the Earth Similarity Index. It identifies which of the discovered exoplanets are potentially habitable by humans.Image:  Planetary Habitability LaboratoryThe bureaucrats who love science\nSince the end of the Space Shuttle program, though, NASA\u2019s role has changed. The venerable space exploration agency, which has had funding challenges ever since the Apollo program, is now part of a space ecosystem in which private players like SpaceX play an increasingly bigger part. More than ever, NASA is a scientific development agency, which means engaging the public to ask legislators for more funds.\nFor astrobiologists, NASA serves as a clearinghouse. It distributes funding, connects similarly minded thinkers and coordinates research across multiple universities and continents. And because of limited funding, NASA relies mostly on university partners to conduct astrobiology research, says Mary Voytek, head of NASA\u2019s astrobiology program.\nBack in 2008, NASA put into place an astrobiology roadmap [PDF] for the next five years. The plans were stretched past the five-year deadline, reportedly due to the 2013 government shutdown. Voytek says her section was mostly unaffected, but that although \u201cgovernment agencies did as much as they possibly could to protect our greatest assets, we're still recovering \u2026 When everyone\u2019s gone, things grind to a halt.\u201d\nAcademics are now working with NASA to develop a new astrobiology strategic plan, which will determine the future of America\u2019s biological search for alien life. NASA\u2019s new astrobiology roadmap is expected to release in late 2014.\n\nDr. Mary Voytek, director, Astrobiology Program, NASA Headquarters, and Dr. Mike Mumma, principal investigator for Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Center for Astrobiology, examine one of the stations that is part of a new astrobiology exhibit at the GSFC visitor center.Image: Flickr, NASA Goddard Space Flight CenterVoytek spoke before the House of Representatives last year to promote her department\u2019s extraterrestrial mandate. In what was essentially a request for more funding, she explained to the House Science committee that her scientists weren\u2019t chasing little green men. Astrobiology is an investment in humanity\u2019s future, by detecting potentially habitable Earth-sized planets, finding proof of water on ancient Mars and developing technological innovations that lead to further mapping of Mars.\nThe discovery of life outside Earth, whether microbial or otherwise, would at least be the biggest scientific advance since we decoded the human genome, and at most would be the biggest single event in humanity\u2019s history. It would cause NASA\u2019s astrobiology funding to swell, to say the least.\nBut without that game-changing discovery, astrobiologists continue to struggle for money, both due to NASA\u2019s limited budget and a lack of public understanding for their research. \nAnswering the existential questions\nThe astrobiologists I spoke with saw their work as twofold: Their goals are finding biological signatures of life beyond Earth and discovering how life came about on this planet. But that work requires funding, which sometimes must be garnered from skeptical or hostile politicians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 11:37 SETI explains why the search for aliens has just begun, that the total number of people in the world working on search for extraterrestrial life is extremely small. At 40:48 Congressman Collins asks scientists what they think of \"Ancient Aliens.\" At 12:51 they discuss astrobiology funding.\nWhen two astrobiologists affiliated with another government-funded program called SETI, which searches for intelligent life beyond Earth, testified before Congress in May (video above), the hearing was packed. But some of the reactions were skeptical or puzzling. Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) asked the researchers about their thoughts on the sensationalist Ancient Aliens television program. Although many members of Congress, such as Reps. Donna Edwards (D-MD) and Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) asked insightful questions, most appeared to understand astrobiology mainly through science fiction movies. \nTo be sure, astrobiology's industrial spinoffs help keep researchers on safe funding ground.\nThe interim solution is smaller, more niche astrobiology applications \u2014 temporary band-aids for a long-term problem. Industrial applications and commercial patents keep funders happy, while scientists continue to search for those magical Martian microbes. \n\u201cWe'd be surprised if a little green man walked out [on] Mars,\u201d Voytek says. Instead, she characterized the goal of her department and astrobiology researchers as a whole as finding the origins of life and clues to Earth\u2019s place in the universe. If alien life is found in the process, well, it would only sweeten the deal.\nHave something to add to this story?

               Humanity is closer to discovering extraterrestrial life than we ever expected  or, at least, life that shares a different origin than anything we know on Earth.

               Astrobiology isn't about chasing flying saucers, necessarily. Certainly, scientists search for origins of life on other planets, but astrobiology also uncovers new forms of Earth life we've never imagined before. The scientific tools to do so are advancing faster than ever, and as outer space travel increasingly becomes the domain of SpaceX and other private companies,

                NASA
               </a>
               and foreign space agencies are focusing more resources on

               astrobiology.
              </p>
              <p>
               Specifically, the study of and uses for alien-like life on Earth.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2010, geobiologist Felisa Wolfe-Simon's team found a strange form of
               <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1163" target="_blank">
                "arsenic life" in California's Mono Lake
               </a>
               . Unlike all other earthly life, it subsisted on the poisonous element arsenic instead of phosphorous. It was alien.
              </p>
              <p>
               The science community raised serious questions about her teams paper, encircling her and fellow authors in
               <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/science/14arsenic.html?_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">
                controversy
               </a>
               . However, it was an unprecedented finding. Even if Wolfe-Simon and her group were wrong, their research helped pioneer a process to suss out microbial life not of this earth  on Earth.

               A year later, Richard Hoover, an astrophysicist at NASAs Marshall Space Flight Center who helped found NASAs astrobiology program, made a startling claim: Some Martian meteorites showed
               <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/08/nasa-disavows-its-alien-life-claim_n_832873.html" target="_blank">
                proof of extraterrestrial life
               </a>
               . According to Hoover, an asteroid uncovered by scientists in Antarctica in 1996 contained microfossils, tiny, microscopic gaps and fibers that indicated the presence of microbial life on Mars. This was the third time since 1997 Hoover asserted he'd found proof of extraterrestrial life in meteorites.
              </p>
              <p>
               Soon, however, NASA officially distanced itself from Hoovers claim after major issues arose with the peer review process. Hoover retired shortly after and is currently a visiting professor at the University of Buckingham in Great Britain.
              </p>
              <p>
               Neither Hoover nor Wolfe-Simon managed to convince the larger scientific community that they had proof of extraterrestrial life. But both came closer than anyone before.
              </p>
              <p>
               Astrobiology research, conducted mostly under the aegis of NASA and a few other space agencies, is attempting to answer the big, existential questions of humanity  where we came from, how life came about, the origins of the solar system and whether there's anything else in space lifelike at all. In an age when the vanguard of space travel is transitioning from governments to private corporations like SpaceX, NASA is redefining itself as a cutting-edge research institution.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bonus: Discovering alien microbial life would be the holy grail of all funding goals.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the meantime, though, what are we finding? And are astrobiology discoveries helping humans?
              </p>
              <p>
               Turns out, the study of alien life and lifes origins has huge industrial applications here on Earth.
               <span class="microcontent" data-description="Astrobiology research is helping everything from recycling to oil prospecting." data-fragment="astrobiology-research-is-helping" data-micro="1">
                Astrobiology research is helping everything from recycling to oil prospecting.
               </span>
               And astrobiologists are using these applications to justify their continued search for extraterrestrial life. If researchers keep serving everyday industrial needs in sectors like health care, for example, it helps to secure funding from skeptical government bureaucrats and create revenue streams for these scientists to conduct their unusual research in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
               The alien catch-22. The search for E.T. depends just as much on heavy industry or big health care as it does on NASA.

                Mars Organic Analyzer
               </a>
               (MOA), a system built to find amino acids that could indicate the presence of life. Created by Alison Skelley and Richard Mathies of the University of California, Berkeley, in conjunction with NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, MOA searches for amino acids that spiral to the left instead of the right, like most other amino acids. Many scientists, Mathies and Skelley included, feel this right-handedness is a hallmark of organic life.
              </p>
              <p>
               While the device was being tested in the dry, Mars-like deserts of Chile, Mathies says, "This instrument is a thousand times better at detecting biomarkers than any instrument put on Mars before.
              </p>
              <p>
               But a machine originally meant to detect alien life on another planet soon found different uses.
              </p>
              <p>
               The MOA helped Mathies develop something completely terrestrial, even ordinary: A way to predict (and thus, avoid) the headaches and flushed skin associated with red wine.
              </p>
              <p>
               The same biochips MOA used to analyze organic material could detect amines that contribute to

                red wine headaches
               </a>
               . Mathies eventually spun the technology into a suitcase-sized prototype, which could determine in a number of seconds whether a particular variety of wine contained certain amines.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mathies discovery is just one of several industrial advances made by astrobiologists, after studying outer space and extremophiles (that is, strange life that lives in underwater thermal vents, the far Arctic or other inhospitable environments). Other applications: bacteria used to manufacture super-strong plastics, polymers used to clean oil spills and detection mechanisms for counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

               According to Lynne Rothschild, an astrobiologist and synthetic biologist at NASAs Ames Research Center, the study of extremophiles has surprising commercial potential. In 2012, she told an audience at Stanford University that research into extremophiles could lead to important scientific discoveries in deflecting ultraviolet radiation (thanks to strange bacteria that live in radiation-rich environments), protecting ancient historic sites like the Lascaux Cave paintings in France from bacteria, and developing new antifreeze proteins for everything from blood preservation to ice cream preservation.

               Craig Stark is an astronomer at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland who studies the atmospheres of planets outside the solar system. That means he studies clouds on other planets. In a conversation with
               <em>
                Mashable
               </em>
               , Stark said these clouds are far different than any hovering above Earth. They arent clouds made of droplets of water; they are made of drops of magnesium, silicates, fancy minerals similar to what you'd see in a volcanic ice cloud on this planet.
              </p>
              <p>
               Everything, for astrobiologists, comes down to the question of answering how life first arose  or if they cant do that, connecting the dots of the conditions that led to life coming into existence. Because NASA and the European Space Agency are constantly fighting for funding, astrobiologists have to fight an uphill battle for their share of the cake. The patents that come with studying strange, novel forms of life help justify their funding.

               outside the solar system. It's a game-changer, Stark says. Because researchers are now able to observe and record data about exoplanets, its meant a shift from hypothetical guesses to a more substantial, evidence-based approach toward extraterrestrial life. It has made astrobiologists research efforts far easier.

               Since the end of the Space Shuttle program, though, NASAs role has changed. The venerable space exploration agency, which has had funding challenges ever since the Apollo program, is now part of a space ecosystem in which private players like

And because of limited funding, NASA relies mostly on university partners to conduct astrobiology research, says Mary Voytek, head of NASAs astrobiology program.

               Voytek spoke before the House of Representatives last year to promote her departments extraterrestrial mandate. In what was essentially a request for more funding, she explained to the House Science committee that her scientists werent chasing little green men. Astrobiology is an investment in humanitys future, by detecting potentially habitable Earth-sized planets, finding proof of water on ancient Mars and developing technological innovations that lead to further mapping of Mars.
              </p>
              <p>
               The discovery of life outside Earth, whether microbial or otherwise, would at least be the biggest scientific advance since we decoded the human genome, and at most would be the biggest single event in humanitys history. It would cause NASAs astrobiology funding to swell, to say the least.
              </p>
              <p>
               But without that game-changing discovery, astrobiologists continue to struggle for money, both due to NASAs limited budget and a lack of public understanding for their research.

               The astrobiologists I spoke with saw their work as twofold: Their goals are finding biological signatures of life beyond Earth and discovering how life came about on this planet. But that work requires funding, which sometimes must be garnered from skeptical or hostile politicians.

               </a>
               in May (video above), the hearing was packed. But some of the reactions were skeptical or puzzling. Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY) asked the researchers about their thoughts on the sensationalist
               <em>

              <p>
               To be sure, astrobiology's industrial spinoffs help keep researchers on safe funding ground.
              </p>
              <p>
               The interim solution is smaller, more niche astrobiology applications  temporary band-aids for a long-term problem. Industrial applications and commercial patents keep funders happy, while scientists continue to search for those magical Martian microbes.

               We'd be surprised if a little green man walked out [on] Mars, Voytek says. Instead, she characterized the goal of her department and astrobiology researchers as a whole as finding the origins of life and clues to Earths place in the universe. If alien life is found in the process, well, it would only sweeten the deal.
