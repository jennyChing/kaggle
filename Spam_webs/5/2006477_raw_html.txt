        "I know there are many people in Germany who feel sick at the very
      sight of this black (SS) uniform," said Himmler in 1936. "We
      understand this and we do not expect to be loved...All those who have Germany
      at heart, will and should respect us. All those who in some way or at some
      time have a bad conscience in respect to the Fhrer and the nation
      should fear us. For these people we have constructed an organization called
      the SD (SS security service) and in the same way...the Gestapo (secret
      state police)..."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Unconditional and highest freedom of will," Himmler instructed
      his SS, "comes from obedience, from service to our Weltanschauung
      (world view), obedience which is prepared to render each and every sacrifice
      to pride, to external honor and to all which is dear to us personally,
      obedience which never falters but unconditionally follows every order which
      comes from the Fhrer or legally from superiors..."
       </p>
       <p>
        Thus, when the order came from Hitler to exterminate the Jews, they
      obeyed.

        <font color="#000000">
         In October of 1943, in a speech to SS group leaders,
      Himmler spoke candidly. "...
        </font>
        It is one of those things which
      is easy to say. 'The Jewish race is to be exterminated,' says every party
      member. 'That's clear, it's part of our program, elimination of the Jews,
      extermination, right, we'll do it.' And then they all come along, the eighty
      million good Germans, and each one has his decent Jew. Of course the others
      are swine, but this one is a first-class Jew. Of all those who talk like
      this, not one has watched, not one has stood up to it. Most of you know
      what it means to see a hundred corpses lying together, five hundred, or
      a thousand. To have gone through this and yet - apart from a few exceptions,
      examples of human weakness - to have remained decent fellows, this is what
      has made us hard."
       </p>
       <p>
        "We have taken from them what wealth they had," he continued.
      "I have issued a strict order, which SS-Obergruppenfhrer Pohl
      has carried out, that this wealth should, as a matter of course, be handed
      over to the Reich without reserve."
       </p>
       <p>
        "We had the moral right, we had the duty to our people, to destroy
      this people which wanted to destroy us. Altogether, however, we can say
      that we have fulfilled this most difficult duty for the love of our people.
      And our spirit, our soul, our character has not suffered injury from it."
