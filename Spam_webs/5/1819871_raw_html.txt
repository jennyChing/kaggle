           The idea that young children under four should not spend any nights away from their primary attachment figure usually the mother, is a hotly contested idea.

          <p>
           English parenting guru Penelope Leach has quoted Australian researchers in her new book about separated families, but the researchers say they are unhappy with her interpretation of their research.

           What does this Australian research actually say and how is it being used in the Family Court?

            : Hello, welcome to the
            <em>
             Law Report
            </em>
            , Damien Carrick with you. When families separate, should children under four have overnight stays with the non-resident parent? Social science research plays a big role in such family law disputes, and it also has a big influence in forming the publics understanding. One of the most prominent voices in this space is English parenting guru Penelope Leach. In her new book,
            <em>
             Family Breakdown
            </em>
            , she spells out some forthright views, and she uses Australian research to back them up. Heres the best-selling author and developmental psychologist spruiking her book.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Penelope Leach
            </strong>
            : Fathers really matter, but when you talk about shared parenting, theres an horrible tendency to see children as...like dinner; Im going to share it. So we get situations where children are spending a week in Mums house and a week in Dads house and all kinds of horrible arrangements. I call them horrible because we do know that they are desperately wrong for children who need the security of a place called home and who when very little shouldnt be taken away overnight from what is usually the mother, the person theyre attached to.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>

            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Now, the idea that young children under four should not spend nights away from their primary attachment figure, usually their mum, is a hotly contested one, and Penelope Leachs position has reverberated throughout the UK and around the world. To support her claim, Penelope Leach quotes 2010 Australian research. That reports lead author is Jenni McIntosh, an adjunct professor at La Trobe University. Shes currently on leave. One of her co-authors is ANU Associate Professor Bruce Smyth. So, does Bruce Smyth think their work has been correctly represented in Penelope Leachs book?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Bruce Smyth
            </strong>
            : No.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Is that a cause of concern for you?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Bruce Smyth
            </strong>
            : Very much so, and its a cause that I know Jens been in contact with Dr Leach, and were currently working through a process to make sure that the findings and research is being reported accurately in the book.
           </p>
           <p>

            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Can you clarify for me what you think the misquote is, or the misrepresentation is?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Bruce Smyth
            </strong>
            : I read the book last night, and one sentence that leapt out at me, which is, Findings strongly suggest that shared care that includes spending nights or even a single night at a time away from home and mother is seldom in the best interests of children under four years of age. Our findings dont show that, we never said that, so Im not quite sure how you reach...for the Australian study to reach a conclusion like that.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : More from co-author Bruce Smyth later. So, what does the McIntosh report really say about overnight stays for children under four? Its a crucially important question in family law. Well, it seems that depends on who you talk to. Here in Australia two leading experts arent surprised that Penelope Leach got the wrong end of the stick. Patrick Parkinson is Professor of Family Law at Sydney University, and hes also President of the International Society of Family Law. Judy Cashmore is a developmental psychologist and shes an associate professor in socio-legal research and policy at The University of Sydney. Other social science experts have also raised red flags about the interpretation of research. Judy Cashmore is also one of 110 expert signatories to a document titled Social science and parenting plans for young children: A consensus report.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Judy Cashmore
            </strong>
            : It was written by Dr Richard Warshak, whos a US academic at The University of Texas in the department of psychiatry. Hes a very well respected academic whos been involved in the debates about early childhood development and particularly the debate about overnight stays with fathers since the early 2000s. Why was it written? Because there has been a great deal of concern, I think, about the way in which the research has been misinterpreted and used to support suggestions that its dangerous or harmful for children to stay overnights with their father before the age of three. And that conclusion is not well substantiated; its not supported by the research evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : So thats the take-home message from this expert consensus report, that research which suggests that children should not have overnight care with the dad or the absent parent because it could be harmful...theres not enough evidence to support that conclusion.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Judy Cashmore
            </strong>
            : Yes, thats right.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : What does the Richard Warshak consensus report have to say about research that currently is very influential here in Australia; its research by adjunct professor and clinical psychologist Jen McIntosh, and its on this issue of overnight stays for very young children.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Judy Cashmore
            </strong>
            : Yes, that research was an attorney generals report based on the longitudinal study of Australian children, but only a small proportion of those children were actually in separated families, so its not the 10,000 children but a much smaller group of children comparing those who had different arrangements. Basically what it was suggesting, using some of the measures that were not necessarily designed for that purpose, is that children were more distressed or more irritable if they were in a shared or overnight stay arrangements with their fathers before the age of four, and that research has been challenged on the basis of the research design, the sampling and going beyond the conclusions or the data analysis.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Now, Patrick Parkinson, if I can bring you in here, I understand that Jennifer McIntosh has said in recent times that she never suggested that children under three should never stay overnight with the father. Whats your view of the research and how its been interpreted and repeated and sent out into the world?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Patrick Parkinson
            </strong>
            : The first question is what does the research itself say. I think the research is quite equivocal with regard to children under two, and Im referring here to the McIntosh research in particular. Clearly there are some children who do not handle overnight stays with their fathers well, and theres all sorts of reasons for that. If theres high levels of conflict between the parents, if the child doesnt know the father, theyve never lived together, for example, then some children are going to have difficulty with overnight stays. So what the research does tell us is what a lot of other research tells us, that children sometimes do not manage transitions between their parents terribly well, but it is not the basis for any blanket rule about children spending overnights with their fathers.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : What specifically do Warshak and the other 110 people who endorse the paper, specifically what conclusions do they reach about that McIntosh research?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Patrick Parkinson
            </strong>
            : Well, they dont just focus on the McIntosh research; theres other research by Tornello and colleagues in the States which has also looked at these issues. What the papers really saying is, Look, there is a broad consensus from a large body of research that children need both parents, children do fine in childcare, for example, away from their primary carer, and there is this research which appears to say the opposite, but we need to understand its limitations and not to draw conclusions from it, which contradict the rest of the body of research out there. Thats essentially what Warshak and others are saying.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Now, if course, its important because its influential. This sort of material is used in decision-making and negotiations when it comes to the care and responsibility arrangements for children. Patrick Parkinson and Judy Cashmore, you are the joint authors of a just-published article in
            <em>
             Psychology, Public Policy, and the Law
            </em>
            titled, The use and abuse of social science evidence in childrens cases. What role does this social science research that weve just been talking about play in our family court system here in Australia?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Patrick Parkinson
            </strong>
            : Whatever Professor McIntosh has herself said, her work has been widely understood amongst family lawyers and their clients to represent a view that it is not wise to have young children spending overnight time with their fathers. So thats been the take on it, but its important to emphasise that first of all Dr McIntosh herself hasnt said thats what her research shows, secondly the body of research doesnt show that, and so theres been a misunderstanding of what that research says and what all the other research on this area shows us.

            <strong>
             Judy Cashmore
            </strong>
            : Yes, I think theres an issue here. Theres a responsibility both on social scientists to communicate their research very clearly and to correct any misunderstanding, and secondly a responsibility on those who are the receivers and users of that research in courts and decision making, to make sure that they are intelligent consumers of that research.

            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : And do you think shes done everything she can to make sure that her research has been correctly understood and the context of the research has been correctly understood by people in the courts and professionals in the area?

           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Patrick Parkinson
            </strong>
            : Just in the last couple of months Dr McIntosh has published a joint article with two leading experts in the United States, Joan Kelly and Marsha Pruett, which is extremely helpful in clarifying not only what Dr McIntoshs own position is but also what is a shared view amongst three leading experts. And what it says is that there is nothing inherently problematic about overnight stays with fathers. Thats a very important clarification. But it sensibly says, Weve got to look at each individual family.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : How well do you think lawyers and judges understand the research which underpins the conclusions reached by report writers, be it Warshak and the 110 experts or McIntosh and her collaborators?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Patrick Parkinson
            </strong>
            : I think its fair to say that Jen McIntoshs own work has attracted very widespread attention in the family law community, certainly in Australia, but I think also beyond, because its fed into a narrative that mums should be the only ones looking after kids and mums should be the gatekeeper to spending any time with Dad. So, its attracted, I think, a lot of attention because its fed into a broader sort of point of view. I dont think that it has been widely understood amongst judges and lawyers that that is just one view.
           </p>
           <p>

            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Is it also that perhaps we need to be looking not at just the experiences of children as reported by researchers when theyre having overnight care but the impact of that overnight care in the longer term in terms of strengthening relationships, investing in their children and having a deeper relationship with their children?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Judy Cashmore
            </strong>
            : I think thats absolutely critical, and thats why there is so much concern about this, that if you cut fathers out of the picture very early on then its more difficult to build up their relationship later. If they havent had that experience of looking after the child and dont feel confident, then that needs to be built up over time. Like any of us, we need a scaffold to help our learning and our transitions, and so do the children, too.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : These debates, as they swirl around the zeitgeist, do they become quite important in shaping the parameters of what people will ask for in negotiations, what people will ask for in court cases if they reach that point? Is that part of the issue here, that they really help determine the parameters of what becomes possible?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Patrick Parkinson
            </strong>
            : Yes, certainly, and there are many, many situations where Mum will come in and say, No overnight time for Dad because we understand that children were being harmed by having overnight stays with Dad under three. Youll have Dad saying, But I want to have a relationship with my kids. And so, I think what we are experiencing now is unnecessary conflict in the courts and between lawyers based upon gross misunderstandings of the research. So let me be clear that neither I nor, much more importantly, the psychologists who are expert in this field are suggesting that equal time for one- or two-year-olds is remotely sensible; its not. Children need stability, they need routine, they need a primary care giver. So were not talking about equal time, were not talking about even nearly equal time; were talking about, say, one overnight a week, or if theres a strong bond between father and child maybe, you know, two overnights, whatever. But were not talking about equal time or shared parenting here. Were just talking about building or maintaining that bond between a non-resident dad and his child.

The pair also have concerns about how the McIntosh research has been adopted by bodies such as the Australian Association for Infant Mental Health, which cites the McIntosh report to support the general proposition that infants under the age of two should not be separated overnight from primary carers.

            : Were surprised by the amount of attention our studys received, and the extent to which the findings have been mangled and misinterpreted, and I think the findings have been interpreted in a very black and white manner; theyve been boiled down to a crude, divisive gender message: any overnights damage children. The truth is, were puzzled by this; were not sure why theyve been interpreted this way and why theyve been boiled down that way. Those whove actually read the original government report will know that weve never said that, and were surprised that no ones picked up on the glass-half-full message that once kids turn four theyre actually able to cope with a variety of parenting arrangements.

            : Some people would say, though, that the study also participates in the gender wars by maybe overreaching with the data and maybe seeing everything through the prism of attachment parenting, which is perceived by some people as being an argument or a theory put forward by mothers at the expense of fathers.

            : Well, weve tried to get in the shoes of children and look for signs of stress, and weve tried to take a very dispassionate investigation into the issue. We know that science moves slowly, we know that some people have strong views and are tempted to over interpret the findings, but at the end of the day were trying to get into kids shoes and get a sense for what the experience of shared times like when youre very young.

You know, thats a concern for us too, and this debate around the stability of relationships versus the stability of place is a really tricky debate, and its been raging conceptually for a long time now, and now weve injected some data into that debate.

            : Im really surprised by the consensus report. In fact, all three of us are very surprised by that report, and I guess the key question for me is, why has the scientific method seemed to have failed in this particular instance? Why, when a piece of research comes out, rather than replicate or have a discussion with the authors or go and collect some data and see what the findings look like, do you actually write a lit review and then send it off to a whole bunch of people saying, Do you agree with my lit review and my conclusions? Its a very unusual way; its not the way science normally works. A petition approach isnt science. Im not quite sure why Dr Warshak didnt just publish the review and let it stand on its own two feet. There are question marks about whether the piece was peer reviewed, which is of some concern, and we have no idea how many people Dr Warshak wrote to, exactly which version they saw, whether they agreed or not... And his qualification, and not everybody agrees with every detail, we wonder whether might no one have agreed on some of the points and whether its a true consensus. So, weve got a lot of concerns about that particular piece.

            attempts to clarify exactly what weve found. Were also currently writing another piece that looks at ten falsehoods around the way in which the data have been interpreted and reported. So were kind of doing our bit to make sure, in terms of research translation, that the messages are very clear, but at the end of the day there are still limits as to whether you can stop people interpreting results a certain way or cherry-picking things to suit their own ideas.

            : Theres been the use of the research in the courts, and we might come to that in a moment, but do you think that the Penelope Leach use of your work goes to the wider issues, why Warshak and Cashmore and Parkinson feel a strong need to put out into the world what their views are of the 2010 report? Doesnt it go to this issue, that the work has been, as you would see it, widely misrepresented?

            <strong>
             Bruce Smyth
            </strong>
            : Yes, thats true, but I mean, were very happy for people to challenge our methods, look at other explanations for the data, which is the way science moves forward. I guess our big concern is why simply rail against the findings because they dont like the results, as if we had no right to ask the question. We think there are elements of that with our research and we firmly believe that that needs to be challenged and resisted; otherwise were just stuck in a position of where we have no data, wild anecdote flies around in family law frequently and were left in a position of ignorance.

            : It is a concern insofar as this was a small study, there are a number of limitations that mean we are very keen for people to replicate. Bob Emery and Tornello in the US have replicated and come up with very similar findings, which is heartening, but there are very few studies in the world that look at this. Theres no doubt that parents and policy-makers and decision-makers need to resolve problems in front of them right now, and there is a temptation to over interpret and push these data too hard, which is certainly something that were mindful of.

            : Well, the earlier report was, I think, responding in part to the earlier 2006 reforms which introduced the equal Shared Parental Responsibility bill and changed the whole ball game in family law. So the social science that McIntosh authored was then, I think, seen and used as a way of preferencing and preferring attachment theory based social science, which, putting it bluntly, is putting the relationship between mother and child ahead of the need to build a bond between father and child.

But of course the other half of the equation is that youre very often going to be in a position where you want to use a social research of that sort to assist the interests of your client, and if your client is a client who has a particular attitude towards overnight time and doesnt want it, then social science that McIntosh was the author of previously was useful.

            : Absolutely, and I think the whole problem with this debate is that what is embedded is either embedded openly and explicitly, and therefore youve got a whole range of legal problems about whether its admissible or not, and is it actually evidence, or is it embedded implicitly simply in the choice of language we use? For example, referring to things like attachment theory, which has a particular meaning and significance and social science related to it, but nowhere appears in the Family Law Act.

            : Do you think that some lawyers and judges in the Family Court subscribe to attachment parenting more than others?

             Tom Reeve
            </strong>
            : I do, and I think some consultants are more wedded to attachment theory than others. So, short answer, yes.

             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Does that mean that there will be inconsistent outcomes dependent on which judge you appear before, and maybe which lawyers are arguing your case or what have you?

            : Tom Reeve, these issues around overnight care, theyre very much in the zeitgeist at the moment because UK developmental psychologist Penelope Leachs new book
            <em>
             Family Breakdown
            </em>
            has just been released, and shes said that even one night a week can lead to damage to a child. Whats your view of that kind of view being put out in these kinds of very well-selling books?
           </p>
           <p>

           <p>
            <strong>
             Tom Reeve
            </strong>
            : I think its really problematic.

           <p>
            <strong>
             Damien Carrick
            </strong>
            : Penelope Leachs book quotes Jenni McIntosh and her co-authors, the 2010 research, but its difficult, because again McIntosh says shes never said never. But the research is now being used to argue for a particular line on the other side of the world. What does that say to you?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Tom Reeve
            </strong>
            : Well, it says to me that the job just got a bit harder when you represent the next father in court who wants to have time with an 18-month-old child, because youre going to turn up at an interim hearing and youre not going to have a family report writer there that you can ask any questions of or cross-examine. You wont have a choice; youll be met with a particular judge who may or may not be in favour of a certain view, and youll be confronted with the comment, Well, doesnt the social science say something about this, Mr Reeve? And to be able to then sort of combat the way the tide is flowing at that point is very difficult. So you have to have the tools at your disposal to effectively argue back. Yes, I think what the profession should be saying is, Look, the social science shouldnt be used in that way.

             I am currently going through the family court to try and get access to my 3 year old son. I have read all the documents refered to in the discussion, and to suggest that Jennifer Mcintosh is a passive author who does not know how her research is being used in entirely false. She is a prolific author and continually pusher adjenda to who ever will listen. Her research has no statistical validity and she herself has said that it should not be used to formulate policy. If she truely believed this then she should imediately contact the Australian institute of infant mental health and insist they they withdraw her document from their website.
             <br/>
             The notion of primary attachment figures is false, childern often develop multiple attachment figures and to suggest that that there is some form of hirachy to this is at best crazy.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Fathers deserve access to their children and their children deserve access to their father. There is a legislated requirement to consider equal or significant time with each parent and to deny this on the basis of wether that person is male or female is sexist in the extreme.
             <br/>
             I suspect the the reason there is so many delinquent children and young adalts in Australia is that past policies that deny fathers their rights to be involved in their childrens lives have erroded that relationship with disasterous effects for the children, the fathers and society as a whole.
             <br/>

                I am definitely not an expert but, re the remarks of Justin Benton, what I have read from the real experts (Professor Bruce Perry in 'The Boy raised as A Dog' for eg.) it seems that babies are affected from conception by their parents and why the marriage broke up could also be pertinent. Children can be deeply traumatised by family rows and violence. I believe what a child needs first and foremost is love and security, not necessarily a father, or even a mother. Not everyone should have children, not unless they are ready to put in the hard yakka of being there for an infant.

                Justin, you are absolutely spot on. As a High School teacher for more than 30 years I have witnessed the damage done to children, and boys in particular, by denying or limiting access to fathers. Nurturing is not just a female role; both parents nurture effectively, but in different ways. Children who are problematic in schools come from homes where parents are bickerring and where one parent is often demonised by the other parent. I have seen well adjusted children from divorced parents but who are amicable and where children have equal access to both parents.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Any theory that promotes or favours one parent over the other is nothing but a biased theory based on  wrong conclusions.
                <br/>
                My comments are based on the assumption that parents are normal with no record of child abuse.

             There wasn't enough information in this report for me to understand what is really going on. For instance, what about breast fed babies? Are they expected to switch to the bottle to suit a father? That hardly seems fair to the mother and baby.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Also, why is there so much opposition to Penelope Leach just because she talks about the mother-child attachment?

                If you do some digging into Leach's background, she is the product of a broken home; her parents engaged in partner-swapping and her father was an alcoholic. When her mother eventually deserted the family for another man the court ruled that she had to live with her father (this was the late '40s / early '50s). Then she was shipped off to boarding school which she despised.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                It's not surprising that she has developed personal feelings that are anti-father and mother-worshiping, but alarm bells should sound when she publishes literature such as she has.

                Thank you for taking an interest in my post. Your comments have prompted me to research Penelope in order to check out what you said. I found the following:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                .Born 1937 in war torn London
                <br/>
                .Separated intermittently  from mother because of the war evacuation
                <br/>
                .Mother was a distinguished author and archaeologist
                <br/>
                .Father was novelist Nigel Balch
                <br/>
                .Penelope describes her father as authoritarian
                <br/>
                .Parents divorced when she was 12
                <br/>
                .Penelope traipsed between parents to care for a younger sister
                <br/>
                .Loved her stepfather
                <br/>
                .Penelope graduated with honours from Cambridge; PhD in Psychology London School of Economics
                <br/>
                .Year in Home Office - studied juvenile crime
                <br/>
                .Past President National Childminding Association
                <br/>
                .Penelope's book: "Your Baby and Child" won CableACE award; nominated for an Emmy award
                <br/>
                .Penelpoe married Gerald Leach; they have two children; a boy and a girl
                <br/>
                .She worked intermittently while they were infants
                <br/>
                .She found her employer impatient and callous in regard to her time off to care for her seriously ill son
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I have found no evidence for your claims. Penelope's background does not fit the profile of a dysfunctional person. If anything, it shows quite the opposite; i.e. that she is an exceedingly strong, intelligent and caring person with a genuine understanding for the parent-child relationship. She acknowledges that there is by far not enough regard for the mother-baby bond, which I heartily endorse.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I know men who would agree with me, and would not like to see our society slip back into an authoritarian 19th Century concept of women with no rights to the care of their children, with women and children controlled as the property and chattels of men, to dispose of at their whim. Such a society is an abomination.

                It is facile to say that there is not enough regard for a mother-baby bond in circumstances where a father is denied time with his toddler because of misinterpretations and misrepresentations of research. It is in fact the father-child bond that is held in low regard.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Leach draws conclusions from the work of McIntosh et al that are not supported by the source material and in fact are specifically refuted by the researchers themselves. To misrepresent academic works in this manner is indicative of an agenda, and the criticism of Leach by peers and others is well deserved.

                Quote from trained clinical child psychologist, Oliver James, who says that Penny was providing "good advice":
                <br/>
                ...All the evidence suggests that younger children should not be separated from their primary caregiver who in the vast majority of cases is the mother...In most cases, you should do nothing to disrupt the relationship with the primary caregiver. To do so can affect the child's brain development. I'm particularly glad Penny is taking aim at the family law profession, where there is appalling ignorance about these affects on children...
                <br/>
                <br/>
                British Baroness Walmsley quote:
                <br/>
                "A happy mother means a happy baby".
                <br/>
                <br/>
                My son and partner split up when my grandson was two. My son never fought about overnight stays. He put the child's welfare before his own wishes. I agreed with him and we both maintained good relations with the child's mother. As a result, there was no ugly court battle and my grandson has grown into a happy teenager going freely between both families.

             All separations are not the same so I cannot see how one can generalise on how much love and care each parent will provide.

             Usually I find the Law report's approach informative and reasonably unbiased - even on contentious topics.  But to me this edition was appallingly unrepresentative of what I would call pro-child views.
             <br/>
             You know that Patrick Parkinson is the 'architect' of and apologist for 2006 shared parenting 'reforms' that - no matter what was alleged - did not really put the interests of the child first.  The changes to Family Law from 7 June 2012 attempted to remedy this and brought in some .  considerations such as the UNCoRC.
             <br/>
             "On 7 June 2012 changes to the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) will take effect. These changes will provide better protection in family law cases where there is family violence and abuse." Violence and abuse were apparently not mentioned by you even though they are often the reason why protective parents don't want kids to stay overnight.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             There are many attachment studies about the effect of separation especially in stressful and conflict-ridden situations.  After 2006 so many parents (usually fathers) who had never shown any positive interest in their kids before suddenly realised (thanks to FRights info) that if they had overnights with the kid now and then, they would pay (or not because many didn't) a lot less Child support. Tom Reeves touched briefly on this.
             <br/>
             You didn't give any counterbalance to the views which, from my experience, pretty much represent Fathers' Rights angle.  Many fathers are being given overnights and even sole custody many mothers and kids are being separated either permanently or only allowed contact under cruel conditions.  But Bettina and others choose to ignore this fact.Children are little elephants in every courtroom.Why not ask what is the actual situation for all kids removed from their primary carer(if she or he hasn't committed any crime - except alleging violence or abuse? instead of starting another round of "he said, she said" this time with 'professionals' badmouthing each other?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Meanwhile child abuse in many forms continues unabated.

             The Family Court's mandate is to operate in 'the best interests of the child'. Between 60-70% of families before the Court for parenting orders  are families citing a history of doemstic violence; most often the father against the mother - and by default - against any dependent children living in that home. Such children, be they in utero, 2, 4 or whatever age will be adversely impacted by that situation, and for younger chilren, the mothers capacity to provide a secure attachment will be compromised as she focuses on trying to keep her child(ren) and herself safe. In such families (which are the NORM in Family Court contested cases)contact with the perpetrator of FDV not only further damages the child and their relationship with their non-violent parent but also supports the DV parent in seeing no need to address his violence and work to become a better father and human being.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The majority of fathers of young children  are not domestically violent and it is right that young children have the opportunity to develop strong and sustaining relationships with these caring and loving fathers after parents split up.   - but again I stress that this group falls outside the NORM of Family Court involvement.

             As far as I remember from my 12 years as Chief Librarian at the Family Court, the child development literature said that children under four don't really have an understanding of time, so that if  their usual carer  leaves them with someone else, and says "I'll see you tomorrow", they may think they are  being abandoned forever, so overnight access may not be a good idea for toddlers - it's nothing to do with whether the child is better off with their mother or father.
             <br/>
             The other issue is that their routine may be  upset by chopping and changing living arrangements, and this can affect children of any age.  These are things that parents need to be sensitive to when making arrangements about the children, rather than getting into arguments about their own "rights".
             <br/>
             When I first starting working at the Family Court, the then judges did not want to know about the social sciences literature -because it wasn't law.  I draw some satisfaction from the fact that I exposed them to the social sciences literature - they didn't like it, and I was regarded as highly suspect for most of my tenure, but I think it has contributed to much better informed decision-making over the years - regardless of the fact that there are controversies between experts. This is equally the case in criminal law, where I now work.

                For Goodness sakes, leaving with the father is not "someone else".
                <br/>
                "their routine may be upset by chopping and changing living arrangements, and this can affect children of any age" Another false assumption. There was a time (still some hold the view) when it was believed that children get confused when more than one language is used in the home. We now know that was not the case. Children are more flexible than bigoted adults; they pick up any language easily. My neihbour comes form a multi-racial family. The child speaks Italian to his maternal grandmother, Chinese to his paternal grandmother and English with his parents.
                <br/>
                I feel sorry for fathers; they are often ignored or treated as second class. Every child is worthy of love from both parents and fathers do love their children too, as much as mothers.

             I am an accredited specialist family lawyer who works in collaboration and mediation and never goes to Court. What is most disturbing about this whole debate is that the focus is on the strategic use of, in this case social science research, for the elevation of one parent's wants over the others wants, with little focus in the adversarial system on what is actually in the best interests of children. This debate is very worthwhile for parents to be aware of, but is only useful for kids wellbeing when the knowledge is used to co-operatively construct a parenting plan in an informed manner. Lawyers need to remember, and parents need to know that the Act does not give them any rights as parents, and that to brandish this kind of research in pursuit of their imaginary rights is perverse. Lawyers who are too lazy to do their research, and Judges who accept evidence from the bar table, have fed into the perception that McIntosh's research has been used to allow mothers to be the gatekeepers of children's relationships with their fathers, as expressed (wrongly in my opinion) by Patrick Parkinson. McIntosh cannot be responsible for the way her research has been used, but the lawyers who are misusing it can be.
