          <strong>
           Regardless of who you are, or what youre into, I can pretty much guarantee youre familiar with the base ten female rating scale.
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The problem with this scale is every man has created his own definition of what each number represents. This is somewhat understandable as one mans 2 can be another mans 10. This is a quirk of life we should all be thankful for as every time a guy takes a dive we not only pull the grenade from the game, but its just one less guy to usurp in the field.
         </p>
         <p>
          For this reason alone, any guy happily out hogging should be left to do so in peace. While you might not want to see your buddy leave with Jabba the Hut, hes doing a service to everyone else in the game. Plus if thats what gets him off, who are you to deprive him?
         </p>
         <p>
          If youre one of these men, then this scale is not for you personally, but as a point of reference to be used when talking to other Men. Nothing will label as an outcast quicker than claiming Rosie ODonnell as the top of your celebrity fuck list.
         </p>

         <h2>
          Setting the Limits
         </h2>
         <p>
          The biggest mistake men make with the base ten rating scale is not applying hard limits. If your scale goes from 1-10, no girl can be an 11. This is science people, and in science everything has to fall on or within the limits of your scale.
         </p>
         <p>
          This means a 1 has to be the ugliest girl in the world, and a 10 has to be the sexiest. If you label a girl as a 10, and then find a sexier girl who clearly trumps her, she will take the top slot, bumping everyone else down to their appropriate categories. You dont add new numbers to scale or the entire thing becomes diluted and frivolous.
         </p>
         <h2>
          The Law of Averages
         </h2>
         <p>
          Since the straight sexual appeal of a girl is completely subjective, and every girl can move up or down the scale by a point or two depending on when and where you see them, the scale needs to be populated by the average score of the girl in question.
         </p>
         <p>
          Weve all taken home an 8 from the bar, only to wake up next to a 6. Thanks to high-heel shoes, low-cut tops, soft lips and hard drinks the girls original score can be greatly inflated. Its up to you to take the average of the good, the bad and the ugly versions of the girl; then adjust her score accordingly.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ive known girls who walk around as a 6, but will turn every guys head once the sun has set and the girl has performed some sort of sex-appeal witchcraft in the hours before heading out. In a scenario like this with a 6-8 split its best to simply take the average and slot her in as a 7. This way your rating is always in the ballpark, regardless of the time of day.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Efficiency &gt; Accuracy
         </h2>
         <p>
          The entire point of this scale is to have a quick, and accurate, way to rate girls and relay that rating to our friends. Accuracy is always important, but the subjectiveness of the scale makes it a waste of time to get too anal about the issue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Focus on being efficient, and bend the rules when need be. Technically our top limit of 10 should be reserved exclusively for the hottest girl in the world. In reality, the 10 slot will fit for any of the hottest girls in the world. For example, it would stupid to spend the time trying to slot the girls below into their own rankings, when they can all be lumped into the top slot.
         </p>

         <p>
          Pro Tip: If theyre an official Victorias Secret model, theyre a 10. Dont bother putting more thought into it than that. To be honest, the difference between a 9 and a 10 is almost negligible. It really just comes down to public opinion. There are many models out there just as beautiful as the best Victorias Secret models, but its that official validation which puts them over the top.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Dont Fear the Fraction
         </h2>
         <p>
          There are billions of girls in this world, and only 10 slots on our scale. Youre going to come across girls who just dont fit well at any rank. In cases like this its fine to rock a fraction. That being said there are a couple of rules when it comes to female rating fractions.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Rule 1: Rounding
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Any girl landing below the halfway point of two rankings must be rounded down to the lower ranking. For example a girl rated as a 7.3 would be relegated to a 7.
          </li>
          <li>
           A .6 is always rounded down to .5
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           Rule 2: Mid or High
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Referring back to Efficiency &gt; Accuracy, it doesnt make sense to fret over a girl being a 7.8 or a 7.9. If shes more than midway, shes simply a high seven. Trying to nail down an exact decimal is a waste of time.
         </p>
         <p>
          In short: A girl is a 7, a 7.5 or a high 7. Any other options are frivolous.
         </p>
         <h2>
          Dont Waste Time below the Median
         </h2>
         <p>
          If a girl is less than a 5, shes not worth the energy of slotting into the scale on the fly. Slots 1-4 are there in case you need them, but when youre in the game those girls are simply not worth the ink. Then again if youre lucky enough to come across a legitimate 1, thats definitely something worth taking note.
         </p>
         <p>
          Im not sure who or what the ugliest girl in the world would look like, but Im pretty sure its epic-as-fuck. In fact if you come across it, take a picture and ship it my way. You can get at me on twitter or email me.

          There you have it; the finer workings of the base ten ranking scale. Its up to you to decide where your range of acceptability fits. Where you put your personal basement is up to you, just know this: this is the way the scale works, it is how girls are judged, and depending on the girls you spend time with it is how you will be judged.
         </p>
         <p>
          If youre happy below the median, thats your choice. Just be prepared to weather the bro-back.

          My time is divided between writing, women, whiskey, and pinball. I give lots of advice, and coach men on how to reach their potential. As for whiskey, I am a descendant of Johnnie Walker himself, you could say it's always been in my blood.

             Its great to see someone putting their 4H or FFA skills to use and rating a person who is female instead of rating hogs and cattle!  Love it!

             I was reading through the comments. It seems all the angry/ annoyed women are college age or younger. lol I would have been angry, too. I think I might have been an 8 to 8.5 based on the attention I got.
             <br/>
             Now in my 30s, Im guessing a 7. Can only go up from there! Lol although one nighters are no longer on the agenda.

             # 4 and 5 are messed up. #4  should be a 5 and vice versa. #9 is pretty face wise but not hot. #8 and #7 have the i-m really hot look in their espressions which i like which in turn makes them hotter than 9 and 10 in some respect. Well, thats my opinion.

             Id just like to point out that while this article is mostly accurate, guys, most of you are gonna marry/end up with 4s, 5s, 6s, and maybe a 7 if youre good looking and got game. If you look at this and say not me man, i got an 8. or imma get at least a 7, nah nigga, thats you. youre gonna get one but you will argue that shes hotter than she is so you dont look like weak shit by comparison. Its just your stupid mentality that if you push other shit down youll stay above water. And 60% or more are 4,5, or 6. it exponentially decays to form a bell curve of population/rate. Also that grades mentality where 7 is average is stupid. Whats halfway between 1 &amp; 10? 5 dumb shits. Take a math class. Which is probably where half of you will meet your plain wives/ girls and pretend for the rest of your life like you werent staring at the goodlooking guys girl. Dont be a retard, you probably cant pull and 8 or higher. And you would not get balls deep within 15 minutes of meeting a 9 or 10. Youd piss yourself and then carry her bags to her car and from then on youd drive her and her handsome boyfriend around whilst they fuck in the backseat and you try to sneak a look and hope shell pick the nice guy like this is some shitty romantic comedy. Nice guys dont finish last. Dumbasses and Beta-Bitches do. And they will most likely end up together. Sorry to be realistic.

             This scale seems wrong to me.
             <br/>
             But a girl thats a 5 with no make-up can make herself look like a 9 with it.
             <br/>
             I find girls who heavily edit themselves with superficial stuff like make up less attractive.

             I must have really low standards because I think all of the 4-10 girls are hot, the 3 girl is neither attractive nor unattractive, and the 1-2 girls are the only truly ugly ones.

             The scale doesnt take much account of personality. You could be with an 8 who thinks she is better than you and constantly put you down, but stays with you for your money etc. Will that make you hapy? Good luck, guys.

              the entire purpose of this scale was to evaluate women with out the pleasure of getting to know them, or even speak to them.since its impossible to know a personality of a girl youve never met or will never meet it would be unfair to take into account personality for the girls you do know and not the ones you dont.

             Sometimes the base 10 scale is too much work, ESPECIALLY when youre deployed. You have to switch to the binary system. 1s and 0s. Either youd bang her or you wouldnt. You cant afford to be too discriminating. Just make sure to switch back when you redeploy, and try to avoid the 1s who remain 1s!

             I really dont see how girls are offended by this. It is laughable to hear girls banter about how the guys she knows wouldnt ever do this, or my boyfriend doesnt do this. Its complete bullshit. All guys do this, not because we are misogynist and insecure, but because it is the easiest and most sensible thing to do when your bro asks how hot the girl is that youre hooking up with is. The rating system is simple, effective, and efficient. Its not like that and that alone is the deciding factor in a relationship, but it plays an important part. YESappearance matters!!! You girls wouldnt hook up with a guy that turns you off either! To love your partner is to maintain an appearance that is attractive to them  man and women both. Hell, we guys would rate personalities if we could, but that really doesnt work out to well  so we just say is she bitchy and delusional or fun to be around. Guess which one you girls on here fall under?

             Great article!  One of the best on the subject I have ever read.  I was pissing myself laughing most of the way through.  I own a website that does just this, only with a twist.  Instead of a scale of 1 to 10, it is a simple yes or no to the question, would you do me?  Not surprisingly the guys are a little less picky.  Its a great way to score where you are in the game.

             Heres the scale most of the people I know use. Its centered around 5, with the far ends being reserved for very rare occurences (akin to a Gaussian distribution).
            </p>
            <p>
             A scale for INDIVIDUAL opinion on sexual attractiveness
            </p>
            <p>
             10  perfect, hottest possible girl (no, you probably will never see her)
             <br/>
             9  very hot Hollywood starlet, pageant queen, top porn star
             <br/>
             8  average hottest girl in whole school, district, personal circle of aqcuaintances, hot actress / porn star
             <br/>
             7  average hottest girl in a school class, workspace
             <br/>
             6  above average, threshold at which one makes a real effort around her
             <br/>
             5  average, would fuck if she makes an effort as well
             <br/>
             4  below average, would fuck if horny
             <br/>
             3  ugly, would fuck if drunk and desperate
             <br/>
             2  really ugly, would never fuck
             <br/>
             1  repulsive puke-inducing trainwreck
            </p>
            <p>
             Accordingly, Id personally rate the Victorias secret models in your first pic as 6, 8, 7, 7 and the last one probably 7 (cant see her well enough).
            </p>
            <p>
             95% of women (in your age bracket, ignoring 15 year older and the like) would fall between 3 and 7.
             <br/>
             If were honest, the average guy would bed a lot of females when lonely, sex-starved, feeling horny and being really drunk. The few percent that he wouldnt sleep with even in this state are 2 and below.

             I like the phrase particular taste. I dont go for the Barbie look, and the typical runway girl does very little for me. What I like are real, substantial women. Of course most men dont want a girl who doesnt take care of herself, and lets herself go to hell; likewise, a good woman doesnt want a dude who doesnt give a rats ass about his appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
             It boils down to libidic needs and emotional needs. Care to venture which gender caters to which need the most?
            </p>
            <p>
             Women look for security from a man, in some form or another. If a pretty boy cant offer some stability to a woman, chances are hes going to get a one night stand for his dick, and the woman will offer nothing substantial  but hey, if all a guy is looking to do is get his nut off, more power to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Taste is ultimately subjective  we can say all we want about universal ideals regarding beauty, but in the end it is a matter of taste. With that being said, if a guy has to choose between the toothless crack whore from the East side, or the hot stripper from the club.well, you get the point.
            </p>
            <p>
             Extremes, in any case, are ridiculous. Most dudes should be happy with what they can get. Look in the mirror, gauge your expectations accordingly. Look in your wallet, gauge your expectations accordingly. Look in your mind..

             How do guys rate a body? Do guys like a lot of muscle? Im seeing more women with men like biceps.

              Depends on the guy,  but most men dont like a lot of muscle. Fit and lean,  not built.

             A very interesting analysis. For all the feminist posts about how awful this is, Id have to agree  that is, I agree that its awful that the world we live in places so much value on shallow physical appearance. However, I would not condem this post, as all it is guilty of is commenting on a fact of the world, and personally I find it interesting to get a better idea of what the psychology of most guys is like. As much as many of us girls might wish that guys didnt judge by appearance, there are plenty of girls who do actually like being judged by their appearances. Generally Id say the more attractive girls are more likely to agree with these sorts of ratings, whereas if a girl was generally rated lower on this scale (at least, if she was told she was unattractive) she would almost certainly have a fit. Not to say that there arent plenty of attractive girls with feminist mindsets as well. The fact is, I have many talents and Im highly intelligent (according to a test my IQ is in the 140s), and I want to be appreciated for these, but at the same time, when my boyfriend tells me Im physically beautiful, it makes me smile. I think most every girl wants to be perceived as beautiful, at least by someone. And as Sean Lind pointed out, there is plenty of subjectivity in male opinion, which is good for all of us. But even with subjective varience, males want to try to categorize things. Its how they organize their mental world and how they express their thoughts. So as much as the feminist side of me cries out against this notion, its beat out by the scientific side of my mind which is fascinated by this description of psychology, and the (all things considered) well-done effort at expressing them in a scientific way.

             Found this topic interesting as I (a girl) hang out with mostly guys, and recently the topic of number ratings came up. Personally I rate other girls in relation to myself, as I consider myself to be average or a 5 (though on your scale I think I might lie closer to a 7). So I had the guys rating friends of mine, that I consider hotter than me and it was interesting to see how their opinions differed. Some of them seemed to be using your sort of scale, though I would say most of them were considering a 5 to lie somewhere between your 6 and 7. I always feel like, when a guy asks me if one of my friends is hot, I always have to respond with well what do you consider hot? because there is obviously a huge discrepancy between what people consider hot. Reading your responses to peoples comments I understand your reasons for placing your numbers where you do, though personally I still think it makes more sense to have 5 actually be average, whereas the 5 you put is really ugly, not fat, but still uglier I think than even the one you have as a 3. Personal opinion though 
            </p>
            <p>
             I also thing the rating system idea is a little flawed since I would say there are 3 factors to consider, body, face, and personality (though if its not for a relationship personality can be ruled out I suppose) faces are the reason I think your list of ratings are a little off. I just wish there was a more easily understandable rating system since yours seems to be based purely off body and I know a lot of guys (most guys I know) who if they see an ugly or even slightly strange face no longer care about body.

             I appreciate the ten point system as an easy way to categorise what everyone does when they judge anybody for attractiveness (girl or guy).  One thing that gets overlooked is that your hot everyday girl, I.e. an 8, will often easily be a 9 or 10 if given some hot lingerie and a good photoshoot.
             <br/>
             Also, your 4/5/6 feel like poor examples.

             There are definitely two schools of thought on rating on the 10 scale.  This one is like school grading.  9 and 10 are As.  8 a B 7 a C 6 a D 5 an F
            </p>
            <p>
             My friend and alphagameplan seem to use a more bell curve type scale where  yes 9s and 10s are As obtainable by men with something out of the ordinary (Top say 3% of men- money fame etc)  But they rate tier 2 women as 6-8 obtainable mostly by men with good to great game (say top 15% of men).  Normal men get tier 3 women ?3?-5 or 3 to 5.  Sorry I dont know many men who would date the 3 pictured.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most normal men would be happy with the 7 and 8 above.  The 7 is clearly not an elite female.  No I wouldnt say no.  On your scale she is the girlfriend of Joe Regular.  On the other scale she is the girlfriend of a fairly high ranking male.

             To just a human.. I wonder if the ugly woman scientist you reference would agree in with MacDaddys theorem?  It actually looks to be a sound math equation that even an ugly woman who is handy with a calculator would agree with.

             Dear 20 year old female,
            </p>
            <p>
             beauty is in the eye of the beholder
            </p>
            <p>
             You said that, I have to assume you believe it. This means one persont 3 is another persons 8. Correct? Okay good.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now since youre going to see/meet well over a million people in your time, its utterly foolish to think you can get to know every single one of them, then decide purely on the merit of their feelings, hopes, ideals, intelligence, personality etc who you would want to bring into your life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since I highly doubt you just close your eyes and say whatever, I can be happy with someone I find truly disgusting you need to grow the fuck up and realise that you already judge people based on their looks. Its how society functions (or doesnt).
            </p>
            <p>
             While it may not be ideal, or pretty, its reality. Wake the fuck up, youre no longer in highschool.

             First of all: who owns the patent on beauty? Dont forget, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second of all: its disgusting to say that you shouldnt bother with a women who rates under 5. We are not ornaments, we are not decoration. We women are people, with feelings, hopes, ideals, intelligence, personality etc. So all ugly female scientist should be brushed aside because they are not hot enough? All female nobel prize winners, writers, artists, singers, mothers, CEOs etc. who are rated under 5 by some internet troll are not worthy of our time?
            </p>
            <p>
             I could write a whole essay on how sexsist and misogynistic this blog entry is. But I hope youre smart enough to figure that out by yourself. Cause god forbid you need a WOMAN to help you figure something out lol! One little hint: from now on youre just a number, not a person. And if youre unlucky youre a number that will make you be ridiculed and harassed for being ugly. If youre lucky youll just get harassed (and that SUCKS) because youre pretty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Get realistic and dont judge someone you dont know by their appeirance. Thanks a lot, a 20 year old female.

              the 1-10 scale is a rating system for *sexual purposes*. it by no means excludes personality or anything like that, and its not misogynistic either. its for quick judgement, bar nights and one-night-stands, not for evaluating who youd want to marry or some shit. we live in a shallow generation but come on??? this is a scale for ATTRACTIVENESS. where does it say that it negates everything tha has nothing to do with looks??

             I like the system Mackdaddy explained with the body being most important, it explains how a super cute girl with great hair but an unattractive body shape would struggle to rate higher than a 7.

             Nice work!  But looks like you might have too much time on your hands.

            <p>
             No where near enough meat and potatoes here to render an opinion on a girl, I have some ideas that I was actually thinking of starting a blog to discuss.  For me, it is rooted in the observation of how I married a solid 7, but unfortunately for me, I ended up with a weak 6.it really breaks my heart.  I love her, but men need the physical side to click too!
            </p>
            <p>
             So I have given a lot of thought on the variables that contribute to the overall score, and would like to hear some feedback.  This I real science I tell you!  Test it out.  Here are the variables
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Body shape
             <br/>
             2) Face
             <br/>
             3) Hair
             <br/>
             4) Butt shape
             <br/>
             5) Boobs
            </p>
            <p>
             Each category is rated on a scale of 1-10, then take the body shape number and multiply by 2.5.  With this new number for #1, add them all together and divide by 6.  Walla!  You have your rating.
            </p>
            <p>
             For my wife, as an example, I rate her in order:  6,7,6,4,6. Take the body rate and multiply by 2.5 for a 15.  Now add them all up and divide by 6 for a rating of 6.17.  Using this method for what she used to look like, she was a 7.33 when we dated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now this method gives bonus points to the body rating, and can yield a result above 10.  In this rare example, you would simply consider the woman a solid 10, not a 10 point something.  Some woman are cursed with poor genetics and lousy body shapes, not much hope for them.  But others simply need to work out and watch their diet and can make substantial gains in how we men view them.
            </p>

              Wowincredible.you are so cold, that it actually makes me want to vomit. You married this woman and you rate her a 6.17?. what is that matter with you. If you have kids, this woman birthed your babies! and if you dont then this is the woman that deals with your bullshit. You are disgusting.

             Im bi and I see how this scale is accurate but it really depends on taste. Like if youre not into black girls then obviously they would be a 1. And if you pork then the bigger girls are a 10. Its really all about perspective. And I dont think this is sexist at all.

             A Victorias secret model isnt necessarily 10 they all have small boobs, and ribs on display. if a man likes curvacious women with big boobs, those models would be rated asaverage, just a pretty face , and thats all. nothing special.

             I had a 9 and lost her. Cheerleads for the Bobcats now : (. Oh well, it is the Bobcats lol. I have had a few 8s, but Im getting a lot of 7s lately I feel like Im slipping Sean. Oh, and alos include that you well never have a real relationship with 9-10s unless youre ridiculously rich. They are either whores or true bitches.

             Will all the girls back off, you all are acting and sounding like you dont rate guys on their looks which is complete bullshit and everybody reading the comments knows it. Get over yourself you self righteous fools.

              Hell yeah girls rate guys too! Im a girl and a friend of mine spent one of our uni classes the other day rating all the guys in the class. I think its just that some girls, like me, are more openly aware of our tendency to rate people, and to be honest, as much as I rate guys attractiveness a mediocre (ie 6 in my books) looking guy with a good personality will pretty much always win out over a 10. Since Ive never met a 10 that wasnt full of himself.
             </p>
             <p>
              (and I probably couldnt get a 10 anyway  )

               <br/>
               loved your comment, being a 20 year old girl I have to agree that girls rate guys too all the time, my friends and i frequently do it when we first meet guys. The main difference between guys doing this and girls doing it is that when I meet say a 6 who is really fun and interesting, he can then go up to a 9, and vice versa. my friends and i agree that a personality can change a guy by up to 4 places. Whereas when guys rate girls they see a 10 and the personality doesnt really make that much difference. I think thats probably because girls instincts are to settle and guys just want sex so a girl can be much more easily influenced by the others things.

              I understand where this is coming from and that it is an inevitable reality  of course we all compare potential mates. I dont agree with the idea of framing rating in this way though. Its way too subjective. Also, does anyone REALLY want to be assigned a number to define their physical worth in relation to others? Its pretty shallow. Just saying.

             Hi,
             <br/>
             Great article. I find it very true.
             <br/>
             Now, question, how would you rate a girl based on her quality? Because we all know that there are full of bitches out there. She might look somewhat good on the outside, but she is destroying every IOI that men know, just to show how special she is. And to attract attention.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, a quality rate scale is needed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you.
            </p>

             Would love to see a girls rating guys version. Because lets be honest, we do it too. I rate based on body, face, clothes, grooming/upkeep, and initial personality impression.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would be good for guys to know how to pick up that 8 or 9 that men are so obsessed with :p

             One more comment on the statistics side.  Not every distribution is normal, and follows a bell curve.  There are non-normal distributions.  This scale follows a lognormal distribution.  That is a distribution were 1s &amp; 2s would be rare, and rapidly rises to 5s at the highest frequency, then tapers off to make 9s and 10s rare.  I believe the reader above was also confusing average looks with the numerical value of 5.  Five would be the median, not the average in such a distribution.  7 could considered average looks, with 5 still being the median.  Scales of this type are often used in statistics to determine the quality of something, even with a subjective method.  Basically they can determine how good or bad something is.  These are called operational definitions, and typically require are large sample population to determine.

             You touched on the day/night and cloths modifiers, by taking the average, but I think these modifiers should account for more.  A girl riding a motorcycle could add a .5a women with lingerie could also add a .5.   Now two women at once (both 6s) would get bumped to 7s in my book.  Off course this only works with 5 or higher.  So technically, if you had two 6s both in lingerie, riding a motorcycle, they may appear to be 8s.  Add a few beers and they would be close to 10s.

             WOW! Why not be with a girl you like or are naturally attracted to instead of rating them, and what about where you are on the scale? Do you deserve anything above a 6? I dont think you do! What makes you guys think you are worthy of a hot girl? We girls judge you guys based on your dicks ability to please us or your money or status! Im a hot girl and in my experience only insecure men rate women, because they have low self worth and feel they need to be with a hot girl to feel ok about themselves. SAD FOR U! and in many cases many 6or 7s can be highly satisfying in bed, as a lover or girlfriend and you guys are depriving yourselves for the sake of pleasing your egos! how pathetic for you guys!

              Jamie, youre completely missing the point and apparently ignorant about how the world functions.
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess I should say the human brain, not the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              You see humans like patterns and organization. I cant say if this is a result of our structured society or vice versa, but thats how we are. When youre going to buy a new blender you head to the blender store and take a look. You see shitty black and decker cheap ones, then you see the super deluxe pro ones. You think well that ones a lot better, but I dont really need the best and you go find something in the middle. Youve just rated/ranked these.
             </p>
             <p>
              When looking for partner we are in essence shopping for people. For someone to be acceptable to take home they need to qualify under your own personal ideals of what is acceptable. One of these is going to be Appearance. If two identical guys are in front of you, one is a hunk of Brazilian sex shaped as a man, and the other looks like his face got ran over by a tractor. You arent going to say Whatever, Ill just flip a coin youre going to take the sexier guy. Congratulations, you just rated and ranked them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every guy youve ever met has done just that with you and every other girl hes met.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now most of the time you dont put a value on this, you just let your brain do its thing and go by feel. But when a friend asks how hot is she you now need to put a value on it to convey your opinion. Dont fool yourself, every guy you have ever hooked up with has told at least one friend how hot you were.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately everyone uses their own version of the scale, many of these guys will have said shit like she was a fucking 10!, which is bullshit. They clearly dont understand how a finite scale works. The goal of this article is to clear that up and help standardize the system.
             </p>
             <p>
              So no, Im not pathetic or sad. My girlfriend is more amazing (and probably sexy) than you will ever be. Id say shes a high 8. In fact she IS #8 above on my scale, only shes gotten far sexier (at least according to me. I love short, died hair and tattoos).

              Im a teenage girl in high school and I was curious as of what standards would you rate someone based off. Recently this guy I know rated me a 5 and Ive never gotten a five so I was not sure what a five meant. I dont have an interest in him or anything so Im not really upset or nothing. I read this and I do think the scale is off and I cant be a five based off this.Based off this a 8 in my opinion. I dont wear make up or get dolled up either and I do dress up but nothing form fitting and head tunring but for a small outting like the movies. If that makes me a 5 then oh well.

               Any guy who would tell you that you are a 5 is just being an asshole. Dont take him too seriously. If you think you are an 8, you probably are,  and you should be proud.

             Why not use a bell curve, with 10s being the extreme, 1 in 1000 level of attractiveness and say 66% of people within 4-6 and 95% between say 3-7? That way, even SuBo might be a 2, and when Keri Hilson says shes a 10, scientifically she could be about a low 8.

              This makes entirely too much sense.  After all, the normal distribution is used in essentially everything statistical.  Why would levels of attractiveness not follow normal distribution?  it is something that is almost entirely genetic.

             Its kind of sad that guys actually obsess over making this scientific, in any case shouldnt style be included into the equation? For most girls how a guy dresses is extremely important. If you want the female perspective, and by that I really mean if you want some pointers on what girls are looking for in a hookup here they are:
             <br/>
             1. Face, bad skin is not hot, facial hair can be hot if its trimmed.
             <br/>
             2. Body, most guys dont like guys too thin or too fat. Despite all the feminist crap we want a guy who makes us feel like a girl without being too much of anything. Toned with a six pack would be my ultimate description of a good body.
             <br/>
             3. Fashion sense, yes if you are incredibly hot and I mean the hottest man on earth you can pull off an ugly unfitted top with boring unfitted jeans and disgusting trainers, but seriously guys have to understand that fashion (though it may seem boring) is your best friend when trying to get the hottest girl. No ones perfect, but that is why clothes are so good, find the right stuff for you, something that shows who you are as a person whiles covering up different issues you might have with your body, if your very skinny go for a chunky knitted sweater, if you have a six pack show it off, if your butt looks like a girls then find jeans that dont draw focus to that area etc etc.
             <br/>
             4. Personality: (Normally Id rate this as the most important factor for a guy, if I was speaking about a friend or a boyfriend, but this is a hookup and contrary to popular belief girls dont have to meet you for coffee afterwards nor do they always call you a million times) Oldest tip in the book, be yourself. I suppose loads of guys who want to get girls have read The Game Neil Strauss. Im not saying that stuff doesnt work, but seriously most guys have a great personality without needing to create a pick up alter ego. Sure openers are good to have, but when youve started talking to a girl dont use stupid made up lines, just show her who you are without being too intense, be confident not overly cocky, compliment her if you really mean it, but dont sit there complimenting her every five minutes. And negging, seriously, wtf is that, it might work but I think it sucks bad that thats how people have to get girls. Also ask the girl about herself, most of us love to talk about ourselves and of course when you do this even if shes the most uninteresting person in the world listen to her and ask follow up questions otherwise it wont work in your favour.
            </p>
            <p>
             So that was my extremely long addition to this post  And yes I am aware that Im obsessing just as much over the subject as anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
             P.S This is entirely subjective, Im classifying this as general opinion, because I think most girls share my point of view, but everyone thinks differently

              Thanks for the comment, though long it was definitely worth the read. I like the idea of the same post, but for girls rating men. Im going to email a friend and see if she wants to run with the idea on her blog, since Im clearly not the best person to write it.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for style/clothes, it does matter but only to a point. For the most part nice clothes can help a girl limp along half a point higher than she should rank. Ugly clothes can detract, but its somewhat rare as guys typically dont care. Were highly superficial by nature, and too distracted by your boobs to really notice most of the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said, if youre looking for a boyfriend and not just a hookup, then the clothes really come into play. If youre looking for a guy whos going to really take a close look at who you are and what youre like, style will be a huge part of that. Just depends on what youre looking for, and where youre looking I guess.
             </p>

             I sort of agree w Vince  in a different way.  Instead of a strict straight-line curve, how about an algorithm? For example, in your pix above, #1 &amp; 2 are completely equally hideous; theyre both #1s. And #3 &amp; 4 should be swapped due to face value consideration. The body should push the tolerable range up  as your selection of #6 shows; and the face should push the ugly range down. So, I propose a more moderate curve at the top, proceeding to a more rapid cliff downward to the fugly ones.
             <br/>
             imho
             <br/>
             Otherwise, very worthy post.

             Youre doing it wrong, the 8 and all others below should be taken off 2 points. 5 is supposed to be average, not ugly as shit. (not saying id go for a 5).

               Average means half look better, and half look worse , 7 could never be average unless you are grading rather than rating. 5 is average.

              7 is the average and it can  only go up slowly. 5 is normally the middle for other thimgs but this is the the scale and this is how it works.

              While 5 is obviously the middle, 7 is average for good looking girls. 8s are even better, while 9s and 10s are goddess like.
