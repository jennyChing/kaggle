       MacBook Pro is a Solid Machine
      </h2>
      There's a post on Digg today that links to a list of MacBook Pro defects. That post and the page it points to gives the impression that the MacBook Pro is some sort of extremely fragile machine that just barely holds together, which is
      <i>
       absolute insanity
      </i>
      .
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The only thing I've encountered as a real, tangible issue is the high-pitched whine, which is unfortunate but easily worked around. It also doesn't seem to be specific to the MacBook Pro, and is perhaps a Core Duo issue.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The MacBook Pro is a very fast machine with a great screen, great features and an elegant design.
      <i>
       This is from someone who actually owns one.
      </i>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The page of defects appears to list every single problem that anyone has ever had with the machine, regardless of whether we know it to be a build flaw or something that happened after purchase.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Furthermore, a number of the issues are diagnosed by people who may or may not know what they're talking about. I haven't had kernel panics, blown speakers, swollen batteries, melting adaptors, electric shock, or anything of that nature. I'm not sure how many of the digg commentors actually own a MacBook Pro but I suspect it's very few.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      People,
      <i>
       common sense
      </i>
      . This is a solid machine. If they were actually that bad, Apple would be overwhelmed with returns and would almost certainly pull them from the shelves.

        I'm a bit worried by your statements. Very plainly, enough people are having a host of several problems too widely spread to be explained by happening "after purchase". Hopefully you're not denying that there exist issues (beyond the whine) that are real, pressing, unacceptable issues needing to be fixed. I see no conflict in acknowledging the superiority in the functioning part of the machine while confessing that problems do exist and are not made up or statistical deviations.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        However, as any reasonable person would, I agree with you that it's not wise to sum them all up in one document, including minor uncollaborated issues, and say "here, if you buy a MacBook Pro, this will all happen to your machine, and oh, your toe will fall off and any fetus within 50 feet of the thing will suffer immediate miscarriage". (Due to a poor Internet connection, I don't know if the article *does* read like that or not - hopefully not - but you get the point.)

        This is pretty vague so I don't know how to respond succinctly. My main beef here is the way the internet makes certain issues seem. A handful of people have an issue and blog about, the whole internet links to those blogs and then suddenly it looks like there's an epidemic. Please.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are minor bugs that
        <i>
         are
        </i>
        widespread, and major issues that are very rare, but I personally can't identify any one issue present in the current machines that is
        <i>
         both
        </i>
        major and widespread. That's just my perception, and I could be wrong.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The "excessive heat" issue has puzzled me for some time because my PowerBook G4 seems to get just as hot. There are always tradeoffs to make between performance, noise and heat. You may not agree with the decisions but to call them flaws is a big leap. The X1600 clocking comment is particuarly odd to me in the context of the same document that complains about heat.

        Funny, it doesn't mention the problems with the left shift key. I know I'm not the only one that ran across this problem as a quick Google of "macbook pro left shift key" confirms.

        Still you're right, I solved the shift key problem myself with a bit of scotch tape under the key, but apart from that, it's been a decent machine.

        True: Yes. Not what I was talking about: also yes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm talking about things like "mooing" (where the fan turns on to a high RPM very fast and powers off very fast) and the heat of the machine. Your comment about the PowerBook parallel is correct. However, that doesn't change the amount of thermal grease that's *actually* applied to these things, or reported by instructions in the repair manual.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At the end of the day, I suspect that if you were to look into any support department of any major computer maker, you'd run afoul of many similar issues with most computers. I think the MacBook Pro is fairly pedestrian in its error rate for a first-generation product.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The longwinded point: I'm uneasy with people *seemingly* blowing most problems off as delusions or within the margin, and I think your post very easily could be fit into the "Mac user defends Apple, disregards and discredits user error reports" category, and once people affix that label to you, you know how much they'll believe anything you write. I'm not asking you to stop writing what you write, how you write it - it's refreshing and very often very right, and this case is no exception.

        I have been using a MacBook Pro for over a month now. The main things that annoy me are (in order):
        <br/>
        - it gets very hot
        <br/>
        - sound is distorted on loudest setting
        <br/>
        - screen flickrs when on darkest setting
        <br/>
        - high pitched whine (have noticed it about 2 times so far)
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Despite these issues I'm quite happy with it.

        I don't discount those having issues with their machines.  It clearly happens.  But as you mention (and as I wrote about recently at TheAppleBlog) - it's tough to gauge the severity.  50-ish discolorations on MacBooks doesn't qualify as an epidemic problem....

        I have been using Apple products for 27 years (ages me) and never had a failure except do to extreme age or accident. I read these posts by people who have had problems and don't know what to think. Maybe I am lucky?

        Today I have a MacBook (non-Pro) with 2G of memory running OS X, WinXP, and Linux. It is a blast to flip between them with virtual screens (I am using Parallel's Mac Desktop instead of Boot Camp). The unit can get hot, but that is the only issue I have. The machine is so quiet I sometimes wonder if it has a hard drive at all. I never hear the thing.
        <br/>

        While I happy you are happy with your MacBook Pro, I honestly don't see the "Pro" advantage. I think Apple made a mistake here - in the low end favor. If I did a lot of graphic intensive work I might have a different opinion.

        How about some comments from somebody who works for an Apple retailer (not a true Apple store however, just an authorized reseller) ?

        <br/>
        Since the MacBook Pros were released, we've seen exactly *one* come back with a problem; a battery that would not charge. We've sold hundreds (literally), and have had zero complaints about whine, bad screens or any such thing. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen, but I'm saying that either Apple is shipping pristine units to Canada (because we're so nice up here), or the reports of MacBook problems are *greatly* exaggerated.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Do they get hot? Yes. So does my G4 Powerbook, although the MacBook Pro does seem a tad warmer. Speaking of other models, let's talk about MacBooks ... they've been flying off the shelves here and we've had none returned due to stains, "mooing", or heat.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Yes, hardware can be flakey, and yes the machines run hotter than before. But as Scott has pointed out and I have experienced, they are overall very solid machines.

        I have a MacBook Pro. It has the intermittent nails-on-chalkboard screech, which according to AppleCare is caused by a defective inverter. I have an open ticket to send it in for repair.

        <br/>
        I also had random shutdowns happening when running battery power, with the battery professing to have 1:50 left. Inspection of my battery revealed it to be bulging and misshapen. It was promptly replaced.

        I think this was largely due to the fact that this is a bleeding-edge technology for Apple and they weren't able to get a product of consistent quality out the door in time. It's disappointing for me, but I understand it's not everyone's experience. In hindsight, I should've waited until a few months after the release, and I advise others to do the same.

        I believe you are right it is a solid machine if and if used the way apple is now describing it as a "notebook" and not a "laptop" then you will have no other issues than the hissing noise, which may be Intel's responsibility to resolve. However, that said, under the pre-conception that it should be used as a laptop, which I'm sure is a pre-conception most have, the machine is too hot to use,
        <i>
         I too speak as an owner
        </i>
        . Henceforth if you try to remedy this issue to use it as a laptop you may, given that you have the knowledge to do so, pull the laptop apart to find that in fact the thermal compund is rediculously applied in excess. Then upon putting the system back together, and I believe this is not a poor design issue so much as a ignorant technician problem, you may notice that the system bluges in spots. Again it's not meant to be taken apart and doing so voids the warranty (it was just so damn hot I did it anyway and applied a proper amount of Arctic Ceramic). As far as the other issues I feel for the people who had them because it is a $2,000+USD laptop, but I can't speak for those issues as I haven't had them. Once I made the fixes I did though I noticed quite a difference in the usability of my Macbook Pro and I love my Apple LAPTOP. Here's to hopeing you never see any further issues with your machine, like the others from the list. -Blank

        Out of interest at work here we've had four (4) new Dell Inspiron 6400 (core duo) laptops go out to our support staff and every single one has had a squealy-whine emitting from the device. The squeal is high-pitched and so very very annoying. It's a noise within minutes of listening to would give users a severe headache.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Dell laptop gets extremely hot, very hot, so very very hot.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The screen has a silly reflective coating over it (a reflective coating so reflective it makes the macbook look like a matte finish) and to the point where the office lights make it hard to see the screen from some angles.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Why have I pointed out some faults I've encounted with a Dell laptop, seeing as they have no relation with the Apple Macbook Pro? Perhaps I will let you think about that one.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These two (2) entirely different companies with different designs, different circuit designs, differing hardware, and a totally different Operating System. Yet they are plagued with problems, some the same and some problems different.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But yet I don't see the animosity for the Dell Inspiron 6400 as the Macbook Pro. Why?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I know there are many reasons why people are up in arms re: faults with Apple goods (high expectations, perhaps rejection from Apple support, perhaps hatred?), but why the directed assult on Apple goods? I mean I've bought a my fair share of goods (and services) and many times been bitterly disappointed but you see me making whole websites against the brand/product? Nope.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        On a personal note, I think a lot of people need to grow up and this includes those anti-apple people out there (yes, they exist *sigh*) who may be propagating this propaganda against Apple products/services. And those Apple-loving people who are bitching about Apple, take your complaints to them and not behind their back.

        What's happened here, and for some reason isn't mentioned at all, is that macbooks and apple in general is more popular than ever. The heat of the macbook is no different than my g4, but how many pc users had a powerbook a year ago? Very few of course. Now it's almost the default developer's machine.

        <br/>
        That's a huge problem and almost no one talks about it.

        This is obviously a format war but how in the world could apple win this one? It's a pure loss for every macbook owner.

        The MBP is a solid machine.  Hot, though.  Very hot.  I run boinc in the background, so the machine idles at around 104F.  I love the machine, but 'laptop' is probably not a realistic description.

        I own a MBP, and my battery did balloon, but Apple replaced it right away, no questions asked. As for the other host of problems, yeah, I bet some machines have had them, but not the majority, or even a large minority. Plus, Apple has been really bent over backwards to replace faulty hardware, doing as much as swapping out whole logic boards for some of the hissing problems.

        <br/>
        And it's not like other manufacturers don't have problems with their own machines. I just think Apple gets a bad rap for whatever reason. Have a problem like a battery ballooning or a computer making strange noises with Dell or HP, and I doubt they would do too much about it.

        about the thermal paste complaints....
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At Mac Geekery, we're currently writing an in depth expos on claims that the thermal paste is being over-applied is causing the machines to run warmer. While we're not done taking data from all of the machines involved, so far it's looking like this issue is a complete and utter bust.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        On the one completed machine, we've found no difference between the factory amount of the factory paste, Apple's technician documented amounts with the Apple provided paste (acquired from a local AASP), sane amounts of Apple's provided paste, or sane amounts of Artic Silver. In fact, we've found that the torqued washers Apple positioned around the board ensure that a uniform, razor thin layer remains diretly on the chip, regardless of amount applied.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first machine tested showed a net wash, no change. On the second machine we're testing, about halfway through, and there may be a 2 degree difference at the current rate. We're acquiring a 13" MacBook this week to test, as well.

         Here's my beef with the new machine (also not mentioned). You can't run windows media files or stream windows media on it. This means at least 50% of the video I'm emailed or follow links to do not play.

        it is true that quicktime cannot play wmv or divx files, but luckily a couple of plugins solve those issues. www.divx.com www.flip4mac.com

        i too own a 15.4 in MBP, and after updating the firmware on it, starting having the problem where the machine would just shut off randomly while running on battery, then eventually the battery started to balloon. i called applecare, and they checked the inventory of the local apple store and put a battery on hold for me. i drove over there and picked it up - no questions asked. i couldn't have been in the apple store for more then 5 minutes. if i wanted, they would have shipped me a new battery, but it was getting late on saturday and i'd have to wait until monday to get it. aside from that, i haven't had any problems. the new battery has been working like a charm.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        i use the machine in bed at night on my chest reading the web and getting some work in before going to bed. although the machine does get very hot, its never gotten to the point where i was concerned with getting burnt, and i really can't say it gets any hotter then any comparably spec'd machine, although the metal case seems to eminate heat more then a regular old plastic laptop.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        id highly recommend this machine to anyone, its been amazing, extremely fast, and very quiet..

        The continual and persistent reports of actual MacBook/MacBookPro problems indicates that this is more than just Mac bashing. Despite the warm and fuzzy ads, etc. these are sub par notebooks being sold to the Mac faithful.

        Any other brand would have been bashed and held accountable by the press and the consumers. The cult like following of the multitudes of Mac owners and unsuspecting new buyers are being duped by Apple.

        As a owner of two Powerbook G4s (15" and 17") and a MacBook Pro (15", 2GHz, 2GB RAM). I completely agree with Scott. Its not that the machine does not have issues. But it is miniscule compared to how many units have been shipped. As a percentage, it is a much smaller number compared to other manufacturers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        My MacBook Pro has had the whining problem but that went away after the firmware update. The heat issue didn't bother me since I'm used to heat from PowerBook G4, Dell Latitude, IBM ThinkPad, and Sony Vaio. However, I could notice that it was a little hotter than the older PowerBooks. After the firmware update, it runs cooler and is certainly not a problem anymore.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In a way its a compliment that even isolated problems in Apple products get so much attention - shows how consumers except Apple products to be flawless. From another perspective its also annoying that some others would take these correctible glitches to hyperbole how these products are supposedly crashing and burning.

        I think the comments reflected towards the Macbook are the same that plagued the 360.  There were many broken 360 and I am sure a fair amount of Macbooks.

        However, since they are both "it" products, people will enjoy reading how they have failed.

        Some failings are probably due to user tinkering with the system and then trying to blame MS/Apple.

        What's so bad about naming and shaming poor engineering?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        As Apple (and other companies) are in denial about weaknesses of their designs or manufacturing, they won't list the common or even rare problems with the machines. Instead they'll declare those problems to be 'within spec' later on. So someone has to document how far reaching their mysterious 'spec' is. This helps other people to make a more informed decision when buying the machine and to gauge the risk of running into problems which normal people wouldn't consider to be expected behaviour of an expensive high tech product.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        If a friend asked you about how well your computer works and is built and plans to get one himself, wouldn't you make sure to list all the problems you ran into to make sure your friend doesn't run into the trouble of having to return the machine or run through the hassle known as 'customer service'? Particularly with 'customer service' being unwilling to help, in denial or incompetent with many of the problems? I would for sure (particularly for Apple products as I've been burned badly by their customer service in the past and I don't want to recommend anything like that to friends).

        This quote from a FatBits post should convince you that CPU's can make noise, or trigger noise to be made in other components:

        <blockquote>
         <i>
          Let's think a bit deeper about this problem. Sure, all computers make some sort of noise. Even without fans there's still the hard drive spinning with its disk heads moving to and fro. Moving parts mean noise. But a power supply? The only things moving in a power supply are electrons, right? AC in, DC out. What's to move?
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If you owned one of those 150-in-one kits from RadioShack as a kid (or if you have a degree in electrical engineering...pretty much the same thing, surely) you know full well that analog electronic components can and do moveever so slightly, mind youand therefore can make noise. The transformer, in particular, was quite a noise-maker in my 150-in-one kit. Perhaps not surprisingly, one of the many things a transformer can do is convert AC to DC and vice versa. Hmm. [Update: Transformers may be part of a circuit that converts AC to DC, but they cannot do so alone.]
          <br/>
          <br/>
          But even the more boring electronic components can make noise under the right circumstances: resistors, capacitors, you name it. Throw enough energy through these tiny bundles of conductors and insulators and yes, Virginia, they can start to vibrate. Vibration == motion == noise!

Re-application makes a tiny difference, but too much thermal paste isn't the reason MacBook Pro's being so hot. It's a fast cpu running in a confined space, it *will* get hot.

        I got my macbook pro 17" two weeks ago.

        <br/>
        two days ago, it DIED.  the logic board went kaput and I rather suddenly had a shiny paper weight on my hands.  I brought it into my local Apple retailer though, and inside of 3 hours they had me a new laptop with my ram upgrade and a complete migration of my files (except my windows files GRR)
        <br/>

        anyway, i'm back up and running no worse for wear.

All we see here is the fact that this negative feedback, no matter HOW accurate the number of cases that justify it, has been disproportionally magnified by the duplication and hyperlinking to copied threads and articles.
