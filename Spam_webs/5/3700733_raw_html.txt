        43. you fly in to meet the in-laws for christmas and your mother in law has (after being reminded beforehand) decided to forget what "vegan" means and serves an opulent spread of roast chicken, a ham, mashed potatoes with plenty of milk and butter, sweet potato pie with ice cream (the pie has condensed milk in it) and some sort of cake (eggs) and cocacola and wine to wash the whole mess down.  then she watches you closely and asks you why you are not eating her food.
