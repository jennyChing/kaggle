         <p>
          Myra sighed.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          This was getting
          <em>
           ridiculous.
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Sure, she said she was a babysitter, but that didn't mean she
  didn't have a life. Myra glared at the wall clock, and checked
  her phone again, refusing to believe that it was this late.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Where the hell were those parents anyway?
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           Probably still out drinking. I sure hope your kids don't grow
  up to be like you, booze thumpers,
          </em>
          she thought.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Oh well, as long as she got paid, she could care less.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Even so, Myra looked longingly up the stairs, which she knew led
  into the kids' room. It took her an hour to get into their
  pyjamas, another to get them into bed, and one more to get them
  to stop crying because their parents weren't there to tuck them
  in, to soothe them with lullabies and tell them bedtime stories.
  As much as she hated to admit it, she had a connection with those
  kids. After all, wasn't that what her parents did to her when she
  was young as well?
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          She frowned. No point dwelling on the past.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          "Damnit!" she swore as she checked her phone incessantly for the
  time. It was nearly 1:30 in the morning, and her employers had
  yet to return.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Sighing yet again, Myra left the house and decided to sit on the
  porch, staring up at the serene night sky.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          It was a starless night, the blanket of midnight vapour obscuring
  all the celestial bodies that took up residence. And yet, it was
  a calming sight: just purplish-black darkness, drifting softly
  across the sky, carrying the thoughts, wishes and hopes of
  countless dreamers.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          She closed her eyes, and just for a moment, was in a better
  place.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           Huh?
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           Why's it getting brighter?
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          <em>
           I don't recall any street lamps around here. Must be some
  car's headlights
          </em>
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Myra opened her eyes.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Then it began.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          It started at the top first - at various intervals along the
  entire sky, pockets started to appear, deep ones, tiny ones, big
  ones, of all shapes and sizes. It was as if someone was scraping
  away the velvety substance that had once lay across it and tossed
  it aside, leaving a gaping maw in place. This was happening
  across the entire sky, as far as the eye could see.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          It was a strange sight: Literal holes being dug out of the sky,
  empty abysses left behind in their wake.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Then came the light.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          As if to allay all worries and fears, soft, bright spheres of
  light started to cluster around the holes; ten to twenty of them
  at each hole, all waltzing around the same ugly abyss, dancing
  and rotating and spiraling, filling the gap, expanding their
  luminescence, glowing benevolently. Soon, each hole was
  completely immersed in light.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Myra found herself breathless. As she continued to stare, the
  entire sky started to glow with the heavenly incandescence of the
  lights. People were now emerging from their houses, awakened from
  their slumber by the luminous trumpet call of the lights.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Silence.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Myra clasped her hands to her chest, and took a deep breath.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          It was beautiful.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Was it a sign perhaps, from Heaven?
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          That they were finally here, to rescue the chosen ones, to bring
  the good ones to eternal bliss and reward them forever----
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          The lights fell.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Without warning, each light portal in the sky extended with
  frightening alacrity, forming giant pillars of pure luminosity.
  Each of these pillars crashed to the ground, disintegrating
  anything they touched. Buildings, houses, roads, people -
  whatever the light touched, it destroyed. One moment they were
  there, and then the white light engulfed them, embraced them, and
  the next they were wiped out of existence.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          The light pillars from each portal continued to sweep across the
  land, disintegrating anything they touched in a wave of
  destruction. Screams now, terrified yells, desperate pleas, as
  the previously enraptured people now fled the area. Some got into
  their cars, some ran back to their houses, some literally ran for
  their lives down the streets.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          But the lights were merciless.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Each of the pillars rotated and swiftly descended upon the
  residential neighbourhood, leaving nothing in their wake.
  Nothing. An empty void, just a frightening black abyss. It was as
  if someone had taken an eraser and decided to rub out parts of
  the land, leaving behind non-existence in its purest form. As the
  pillars continued to devastate the land, Myra stood there,
  trembling in fear.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          The lights were no longer benevolent, a seemingly malicious force
  sent from the sky that was intent on eradicating everything it
  touched. It had a fury, a sentience, a consciousness unlike
  anything she had ever seen.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          "Oh God," she cried out, "why is this happening?"
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          She knelt down, clasped her hands together and started praying.
  Memories, repressed ones, forgotten ones, old ones, all came
  flooding back as she recalled the words. They flowed desperately
  from her lips, in a desperate but futile attempt.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          It got brighter and brighter.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          So bright, she didn't dare to open her eyes.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          So bright, it felt like---
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          *******
         </p>
         <p>
          About half an hour later, the pillars of light suddenly grew
  fainter and fainter.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          They receded from the land, withdrawing upwards back into the
  holes in the sky.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          A slight shimmer, a soft glow - and then they were no more.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Then the holes themselves closed, velvety soft cloud once again
  coalescing together, back into the deep dark blanket of the
  night.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          The sky looked completely the same as it had been nearly an hour
  ago - peaceful, tranquil, serene.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          A cloaked figure looked up at it, and watched emotionlessly.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          Then she smirked, her lips curling with devious delight.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Revolution had begun.
