             finalists ActLight has developed a photo diode solution, which delivers significantly higher sensitivity combined with dramatically reduced power consumption as well as lower manufacturing and design costs. ActLight will leverage the new round of funding to continue enhancing its products and to further expand co-operation with partners and customers.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             ActLights Dynamic Photo Diode is the most powerful solution for low power, high sensitivity, and on-chip integration for new light sensing solutions for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches and portable MedTech solutions. Low power consumption is key in solutions for heart rate measurement, gesture control and 3D sensing, explains Serguei Okhonin, CEO and co-founder of ActLight. Our investors share our vision to create the next generation of light sensing solutions and we are now entering the market with key industrial partners and customers, commented Fredrik Uddegard, co-founder of ActLight.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             As mobile and wearable devices are getting ever more pervasive, the importance of light sensors to measure and interpret the surrounding environment will be fundamental to extend functionality and increase the user experience. With this Dynamic Photo Diode, we believe that Actlight has developed a truly disruptive solution, which will greatly benefit the advancement of personal computing, said Pr Lange, Investment Director at Swisscom Ventures.

             <br/>
             Controversial topics always have pro and con opinions, especially on the web. People often lack knowledge to exchange, balance or take a decision. The opinion-based and vizualisation platform ObViz helps people in this process, thus exploring and understanding controversies. It addresses the lack of structured information on the internet on controversial subjects using cutting edge artificial intelligence.

             <br/>
             Just as the Press for More Award described on their website:"If you need to make a decision, like vaccinating your child or not, the outcome will be very different depending on what article you happen to read first. Most people don't have an expert that they can just ask, so they need trustworthy information. And that is exactly the role which

             </strong>
             <br/>
             Over one third of all marketed drugs target G protein-coupled receptors. Dissection of drug-induced signaling requires understanding and access to complexes composed of receptor and signaling protein. These complexes are transient and dynamic in nature. InterAx Biotech, a spin-off of ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institute, provides stabilized complexes for drug discovery. Their products are the missing tools necessary for comprehensive drug-induced signaling analysis contributing to qualified decisions before entering clinical trials.

             Emile de Rijk is the CEO of SWISSto12, a spin-off from EPFL created in 2011. First active in the field of scientific equipment, the startup focuses since 2014 on the market of antennas for satellite telecommunications, which promise is to equip our planet with broadband Internet access. SWISSto12 manufactures its antennas thanks to a 3D printing process in plastic material before they are metalized on the basis of a patented process (Metal Coated 3D printed Plastic Antennas). The recent contract that SWISSto12 signed with the European Space Agency (ESA) enables it to foresee a market worth more than a billion dollars. The startups expertise is among others based on an EPFL PhD thesis. The young company could also count on the support of startup programs, such as Venture Kick and venturelab, since its beginning....

             <strong>
              Hats off for your contract with ESA: how did it all start?
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Last year, we applied to a program of the EPFL Swiss Space Center, which collaborates with ESA. Our application file retained the attention of ESA experts, who invited us to meet them. We discussed a lot about the potential of our 3D printed antennas for satellite telecommunications. Today, we are the only ones to possess this manufacturing technology in the domain of antennas. The initial conversation led to a concrete project.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <strong>
              What is the potential of your technology for ESA?
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Current satellite antennas, entirely crafted in metal, are complicated to assemble and rather expensive due to their weight. Today, 1 kilo of antenna costs a few tens of thousands francs to launch into space, and a telecommunication satellite contains a few hundreds kilos of components. Our 3D printed plastic antennas allow a reduction of weight by a factor 10. They are manufactured in one piece, so no assembling is required. ESA believes in the commercial potential of our technology, and this is why they support it. Their goal is to one day use our technology for ambitious space missions, such as the launch of the space probe Rosetta in 2004.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             <strong>
              What are the perspectives of such a project, for SWISSto12?
             </strong>
             <br/>
             This project allows us to establish our credibility in the space domain. Our antennas can also be used on ground, which allows us to sight the market of movement connectivity, enabling plane, trains, boat and vehicles to stay connected to the Internet. We will also be able to reinforce our engineering team in a near future.
             <br/>
             <p style="text-align: center;">
              <em>
               Our potential clients are called Airbus, Boeing, Space X or Thales Alenia Space

             <strong>
              You started in 2010  tell me about the evolution of SWISSto12 until today and your vision for the future.
             </strong>
             <br/>
             When we started in 2011, we were focused on the development of terahertz components for the market of scientific instruments (medical imagery, quality control of electronic chips, magnetic resonance, etc.) Despite its technological advancement, this market is still a niche market. This acknowledgement led us to take an ambitious turn towards the domain of telecommunications, in 2014.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In the evolution of SWISSto12, the main difficulty was to identify the right market. Our technology was promising sincethe start, but we were not aware of its exact commercial potential. Despite an increasing economical basis in the first domain of activity, which we will keep in the future, we decided to enter a market which was in line with our ambitions.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In the long run, our objective is to become an actor of reference in the domain of antennas for satellite telecommunications, in space and on ground. Our potential clients are called Airbus, Boeing, Space X or Thales Alenia Space. We are currently seekingSerie A fundings from European corporate VCs active in space industry and aeronautics. These funds will help us mark the first milestones toward our growth objectives, to work on the aeronautical certification of our products and to open a sales office in the US, where most of our market is present.

             <br/>
             <br/>
             In 2012, we had the great opportunity to be part of the Swiss national startup team in Boston thanks to the acceleration program for world-class startups,

             which enabled us to reinforce our credibility.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             All this contributed to our impulse, together with amazing internal competences. Although the entrepreneurial adventure is hard, I would start the adventure exactly the same way if it was to be repeated.

             For Martin Haefner, supporting Venture Kick is aninvestment that yields great return for the future of Switzerland: Getting seed capital is often a hurdle for many innovative, dynamic and aspiring startups. Venture capital from the private sector is the key to overcoming it. As a member of a materially privileged class I'm happy to support in this way as many high potential business ideas as possible, which bring our country forward.
             <br/>
             <br/>
             In 2005, Martin Haefner took over the chairmanship of the family-owned Careal Holding AG from his father and AMAG founder Walter Haefner. Since 2003 he holds the chairmanship of AMAG Automobil- und Motoren AG. Prior to that, as a member of the board of directors, he worked - after his studies in mathematics at ETH Zurich - as a mathematics teacher at the cantonal baccalaureate schools in Baden and Lucerne from 1981 to 2005.

              Initial startup financing: The key to success
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Pascale Vonmont, Delegate of Venture Kick' strategic committee and Deputy Director of Gebert Rf Stiftung, is welcoming Martin Haefner'scommitment: The access to a national network of experts, entrepreneurs and investors enables those who hold innovative projects to reinforce the commercial quality of their idea, since the start. The quality of the supported projects, such as Abionic, Climeworks, Composyt Light Labs or InSphero, together with the commitment of outstanding entrepreneurs such as Andr Hoffmann, Hansjrg Wyss and from now on, Martin Haefner, shows the strength of the Venture Kick approach".

              Venture Kick: A strong demand
             </strong>
             <br/>
             Beat Schillig and Jordi Montserrat, responsible for the operational management of the Venture Kick initiative, are very happy about the positive development of the program, launched in 2007: The interest of Swiss academy members (i.e. students, postgraduates, researchers and professors) has strongly increased. In 2014, 30 startups applied each month to the program, whichis50% more compared to the year before. Today, only four projects can be financed every month. The support from Martin Haefner will enable more talented Swiss scientists to embrace the entrepreneurial path.
