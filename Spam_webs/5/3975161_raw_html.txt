Mr. Kelly has been in the advertising business since 1977, has 100+ brand development experiences, and has been part of some great success stories like VW \"Drivers Wanted\" and the \"truth\" anti-tobacco campaign. He was gracious enough to answer a few of my branding questions, the answers to which I believe are useful insights for any&nbsp;modern CMO, particularly when it comes to engaging their&nbsp;respective CEOs. &lt;!--donotpaginate--&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;How does great creative work get done in a typical client organization?&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom my experience, when great work gets done it is never just about great creative, it always results from smart strategy, a good team and an open minded client coming together around some great creative. Good timing and a little luck are often involved as well!\r\n\r\nInside this complex recipe for greatness, one of the biggest things I have seen is the critical role CEOs often play in great brand success stories. I am a firm believer that more CEOs need to become \"Brand Champions&rdquo; if they want to be the most successful CEO they can be. What I&rsquo;ve learned&nbsp;is that the critical first step in getting a firm grip on the road to great work is to get the CEO to want and demand superior branding.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Who are some quintessential examples of CEOs who are \"Brand Champions\"?&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nNo brand has ever become great and stayed great by accident. To do superior branding the firm needs to strive to be great, and that requires support from the top. Phil Knight was a branding champion. Paul Fireman was a successful shoe guy. Lou Gerstner turned IBM around by making better marketing his first priority as CEO. Steve Jobs called Arnold, Chiat and Goodby to pitch him within days of returning to Apple. Two months later he launched \"Think Different.\" BMW has branding in its soul. GM not so much.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Why aren't all&nbsp;CEOs playing along?&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nLet's start with the&nbsp;reason CEOs &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;be motivated to&nbsp;become Brand Champions:&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;can make them a ton of money/ deliver them a big ROI. Nothing makes a CEO sit up and pay attention like delivering more revenue, profit and stock price appreciation. That is exactly what great brands like Nike, Apple, Under Armour, Google, Facebook, Jack Daniel&rsquo;s, BMW, the Super Bowl, the Boston Red Sox, ESPN and Harvard University deliver for their leaders. But most CMOs and agencies suck at understanding true brand ROI and how to get CEOs to become brand believers.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;How can CMOs get their CEOs on board?&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen the CEO&nbsp;sees how rich superior branding can make them and their shareholders, they&rsquo;re all in. It's about speaking the CEO's language&nbsp;and&nbsp;accomplishing the CEO's mission. Very few agencies or CMOs think this way. They recommend campaigns based on research or consumer insights or segmentation studies or the need to create buzz. VW's \"Drivers Wanted\" was engineered to do everything our VW CEO needed to do from 1995 through 2001. \"Think Different\" supported Jobs&rsquo; five year turnaround mission. \"Expect More. Pay Less.\" supports all of Target&rsquo;s offerings vs most retailer ads which sell a sweater for 20% to 50% off, or 5 bucks back for every $25 spent.\r\n\r\nCEOs will buy great creative all day long if it makes them money and helps them succeed.\r\n\r\nMore companies need great branding. Every agency wants to do better creative. Every investor wants their stock to outperform. Every consumer wants to meet a few brands they love. Every creative wants to do the next truth campaign.\r\n\r\nGetting more CEOs to be Brand Champions is a mission our entire industry should embrace!\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3269\" align=\"\" width=\"1293\"]&lt;img class=\"wp-image-3269 size-large\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/willburns/files/2015/02/Fran-Headshot5-e1424882306409-1293x1940.jpg\" alt=\"Fran Headshot5\"&gt; Fran Kelly, President &amp; CEO at CEOVIEW Branding[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;","text":null,"description":"If you want good branding, you must turn your CEO into a \"Brand Champion.\"That's according toFran Kelly, founder of a new brand consultancy called CEOVIEW Branding.

you want good branding, you must turn your CEO into a Brand Champion.&nbsp;Thats according to&nbsp;&lt;a title=\"Fran Kelly, LinkedIn\" href=\"www.linkedin.com/pub/fran-kelly/9/19a/a5\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Fran Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, founder of a new brand consultancy called CEOVIEW Branding. Mr. Kelly has been in the advertising business since 1977, has 100+ brand development experiences, and has been part of some great success stories like VW Drivers Wanted and the truth anti-tobacco campaign. He was gracious enough to answer a few of my branding questions, the answers to which I believe are useful insights for any&nbsp;modern CMO, particularly when it comes to engaging their&nbsp;respective CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does great creative work get done in a typical client organization?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From my experience, when great work gets done it is never just about great creative, it always results from smart strategy, a good team and an open minded client coming together around some great creative. Good timing and a little luck are often involved as well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Inside this complex recipe for greatness, one of the biggest things I have seen is the critical role CEOs often play in great brand success stories. I am a firm believer that more CEOs need to become Brand Champions if they want to be the most successful CEO they can be. What Ive learned&nbsp;is that the critical first step in getting a firm grip on the road to great work is to get the CEO to want and demand superior branding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are some quintessential examples of CEOs who are Brand Champions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No brand has ever become great and stayed great by accident. To do superior branding the firm needs to strive to be great, and that requires support from the top. Phil Knight was a branding champion. Paul Fireman was a successful shoe guy. Lou Gerstner turned IBM around by making better marketing his first priority as CEO. Steve Jobs called Arnold, Chiat and Goodby to pitch him within days of returning to Apple. Two months later he launched Think Different. BMW has branding in its soul. GM not so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why arent all&nbsp;CEOs playing along?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lets start with the&nbsp;reason CEOs &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;be motivated to&nbsp;become Brand Champions:&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;can make them a ton of money/ deliver them a big ROI. Nothing makes a CEO sit up and pay attention like delivering more revenue, profit and stock price appreciation. That is exactly what great brands like Nike, Apple, Under Armour, Google, Facebook, Jack Daniels, BMW, the Super Bowl, the Boston Red Sox, ESPN and Harvard University deliver for their leaders. But most CMOs and agencies suck at understanding true brand ROI and how to get CEOs to become brand believers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can CMOs get their CEOs on board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the CEO&nbsp;sees how rich superior branding can make them and their shareholders, theyre all in. Its about speaking the CEOs language&nbsp;and&nbsp;accomplishing the CEOs mission. Very few agencies or CMOs think this way. They recommend campaigns based on research or consumer insights or segmentation studies or the need to create buzz. VWs Drivers Wanted was engineered to do everything our VW CEO needed to do from 1995 through 2001. Think Different supported Jobs five year turnaround mission. Expect More. Pay Less. supports all of Targets offerings vs most retailer ads which sell a sweater for 20% to 50% off, or 5 bucks back for every $25 spent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CEOs will buy great creative all day long if it makes them money and helps them succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More companies need great branding. Every agency wants to do better creative. Every investor wants their stock to outperform. Every consumer wants to meet a few brands they love. Every creative wants to do the next truth campaign.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Getting more CEOs to be Brand Champions is a mission our entire industry should embrace!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div
