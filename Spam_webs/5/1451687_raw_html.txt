          As far as I know, the only person ever to put Japanese lyrics to the Beatles song Yesterday (and to do so in the distinctive Kansai dialect, no less) was a guy named Kitaru. He used to belt out his own version when he was taking a bath.

          This is how it began, as I recall, but I havent heard it for a long time and Im not positive thats how it went. From start to finish, though, Kitarus lyrics were almost meaningless, nonsense that had nothing to do with the original words. That familiar lovely, melancholy melody paired with the breezy Kansai dialectwhich you might call the opposite of pathosmade for a strange combination, a bold denial of anything constructive. At least, thats how it sounded to me. At the time, I just listened and shook my head. I was able to laugh it off, but I also read a kind of hidden import in it.
         </p>
         <p word_count="50">
          I first met Kitaru at a coffee shop near the main gate of Waseda University, where we worked part time, I in the kitchen and Kitaru as a waiter. We used to talk a lot during downtime at the shop. We were both twenty, our birthdays only a week apart.
         </p>
         <p word_count="10">
          Kitaru is an unusual last name, I said one day.
         </p>
         <p word_count="10">
          Yeah, for sure, Kitaru replied in his heavy Kansai accent.
         </p>

          The Lotte baseball team had a pitcher with the same name.

          The two of us arent related. Not so common a name, though, so who knows? Maybe theres a connection somewhere.
         </p>
         <p word_count="108">
          I was a sophomore at Waseda then, in the literature department. Kitaru had failed the entrance exam and was attending a prep course to cram for the retake. Hed failed the exam twice, actually, but you wouldnt have guessed it by the way he acted. He didnt seem to put much effort into studying. When he was free, he read a lot, but nothing related to the exama biography of Jimi Hendrix, books of shogi problems, Where Did the Universe Come From?, and the like. He told me that he commuted to the cram school from his parents place in Ota Ward, in Tokyo.
         </p>
         <p word_count="13">
          Ota Ward? I asked, astonished. But I was sure you were from Kansai.

          No way. Denenchofu, born and bred.

          Then how come you speak Kansai dialect? I asked.

         <p word_count="24">
          Yeah, I studied hard, see? Verbs, nouns, accentthe whole nine yards. Same as studying English or French. Went to Kansai for training, even.
         </p>
         <p word_count="52">
          So there were people who studied Kansai dialect as if it were a foreign language? That was news to me. It made me realize all over again how huge Tokyo was, and how many things there were that I didnt know. Reminded me of the novel Sanshiro, a typical country-boy-bumbles-his-way-around-the-big-city story.
         </p>
         <p word_count="71">
          As a kid, I was a huge Hanshin Tigers fan, Kitaru explained. Went to their games whenever they played in Tokyo. But if I sat in the Hanshin bleachers and spoke with a Tokyo dialect nobody wanted to have anything to do with me. Couldnt be part of the community, yknow? So I figured, I gotta learn Kansai dialect, and I worked like a dog to do just that.
         </p>
         <p word_count="9">
          That was your motivation? I could hardly believe it.
         </p>
         <p word_count="39">
          Right. Thats how much the Tigers mean to me, Kitaru said. Now Kansai dialects all I speakat school, at home, even when I talk in my sleep. My dialects near perfect, dont you think?
         </p>
         <p word_count="10">
          Absolutely. I was positive you were from Kansai, I said.
         </p>
         <p word_count="31">
          If Id put as much effort into studying for the entrance exams as I did into studying Kansai dialect, I wouldnt be a two-time loser like I am now.
         </p>

          He had a point. Even his self-directed putdown was kind of Kansai-like.
         </p>
         <p word_count="7">
          So wherere you from? he asked.
         </p>
         <p word_count="5">
          Kansai. Near Kobe, I said.
         </p>
         <p word_count="3">
          Near Kobe? Where?
         </p>
         <p word_count="3">
          Ashiya, I replied.
         </p>
         <p word_count="12">
          Wow, nice place. Why didnt you say so from the start?
         </p>
         <p word_count="85">
          I explained. When people asked me where I was from and I said Ashiya, they always assumed that my family was wealthy. But there were all types in Ashiya. My family, for one, wasnt particularly well off. My dad worked for a pharmaceutical company and my mom was a librarian. Our house was small and our car a cream-colored Corolla. So when people asked me where I was from I always said near Kobe, so they didnt get any preconceived ideas about me.

          Man, sounds like you and me are the same, Kitaru said. My address is Denenchofua pretty high-class placebut my house is in the shabbiest part of town. Shabby house as well. You should come over sometime. Youll be, like,

          Until I graduated from high school, I spoke nothing but Kansai dialect. But all it took was a month in Tokyo for me to become completely fluent in Tokyo standard. I was kind of surprised that I could adapt so quickly. Maybe I have a chameleon type of personality. Or maybe my sense of language is more advanced than most peoples. Either way, no one believed now that I was actually from Kansai.
         </p>
         <p word_count="17">
          Another reason I stopped using Kansai dialect was that I wanted to become a totally different person.
         </p>
         <p word_count="226">
          When I moved from Kansai to Tokyo to start college, I spent the whole bullet-train ride mentally reviewing my eighteen years and realized that almost everything that had happened to me was pretty embarrassing. Im not exaggerating. I didnt want to remember any of itit was so pathetic. The more I thought about my life up to then, the more I hated myself. It wasnt that I didnt have a few good memoriesI did. A handful of happy experiences. But, if you added them up, the shameful, painful memories far outnumbered the others. When I thought of how Id been living, how Id been approaching life, it was all so trite, so miserably pointless. Unimaginative middle-class rubbish, and I wanted to gather it all up and stuff it away in some drawer. Or else light it on fire and watch it go up in smoke (though what kind of smoke it would emit I had no idea). Anyway, I wanted to get rid of it all and start a new life in Tokyo as a brand-new person. Jettisoning Kansai dialect was a practical (as well as symbolic) method of accomplishing this. Because, in the final analysis, the language we speak constitutes who we are as people. At least thats the way it seemed to me at eighteen.

          The first time I heard Kitaru sing Yesterday with those crazy lyrics he was in the bath at his house in Denenchofu (which, despite his description, was not a shabby house in a shabby neighborhood but an ordinary house in an ordinary neighborhood, an older house, but bigger than my house in Ashiya, not a standout in any wayand, incidentally, the car in the driveway was a navy-blue Golf, a recent model). Whenever Kitaru came home, he immediately dropped everything and jumped in the bath. And, once he was in the tub, he stayed there forever. So I would often lug a little round stool to the adjacent changing room and sit there, talking to him through the sliding door that was open an inch or so. That was the only way to avoid listening to his mother drone on and on (mostly complaints about her weird son and how he needed to study more).

          And he launched into the chorus, his voice carrying loud and clear. He hit the high notes especially well. I could hear him lightly splashing the bathwater as an accompaniment. I probably should have sung along to encourage him, but I just couldnt bring myself to. Sitting there, talking through a glass door to keep him company while he soaked in the tub for an hour wasnt all that much fun.

          There was a girl Kitaru had known since they were in elementary school together. A childhood girlfriend, you could say. Theyd been in the same grade in school, but unlike him she had got into Sophia University straight out of high school. She was now majoring in French literature and had joined the tennis club. Hed shown me a photograph of her, and she was stunning. A beautiful figure and a lively expression. But the two of them werent seeing each other much these days. Theyd talked it over and decided that it was better not to date until Kitaru had passed the entrance exams, so that he could focus on his studies. Kitaru had been the one who suggested this. O.K., shed said, if thats what you want. They talked on the phone a lot but met at most once a week, and those meetings were more like interviews than regular dates. Theyd have tea and catch up on what theyd each been doing. Theyd hold hands and exchange a brief kiss, but that was as far as it went.
         </p>
         <p word_count="132">
          Kitaru wasnt what youd call handsome, but he was pleasant-looking enough. He was slim, and his hair and clothes were simple and stylish. As long as he didnt say anything, youd assume he was a sensitive, well-brought-up city boy. His only possible defect was that his face, a bit too slender and delicate, could give the impression that he was lacking in personality or was wishy-washy. But the moment he opened his mouth this over-all positive effect collapsed like a sandcastle under an exuberant Labrador retriever. People were dismayed by his Kansai dialect, which he delivered, as if that werent enough, in a slightly piercing, high-pitched voice. The mismatch with his looks was overwhelming; even for me it was, at first, a little too much to handle.

She was as attractive as in her photograph, but what really drew me in person was less her looks than the kind of effortless vitality that seemed to radiate from her.

          Im really happy that Aki-kun has a friend, Erika told me. Kitarus first name was Akiyoshi. She was the only person in the world who called him Aki-kun.

         <p word_count="10">
          Dont exaggerate. I got tons of friends, Kitaru said.
         </p>
         <p word_count="63">
          No, you dont, Erika said. A person like you cant make friends. You were born in Tokyo, yet all you speak is Kansai dialect, and every time you open your mouth its one annoying thing after another about the Hanshin Tigers or shogi moves. Theres no way a weird person like you can get along well with normal people.
         </p>
         <p word_count="27">
          Well, if youre gonna get into that, this guys pretty weird, too. Kitaru pointed at me. Hes from Ashiya but only speaks Tokyo dialect.

         <p word_count="14">
          Thats much more common, Erika said. At least more common than the opposite.

          Hold on, nowthats cultural discrimination, Kitaru said. Cultures are all equal, yknow. Tokyo dialects no better than Kansai.
         </p>
         <p word_count="36">
          Maybe they are equal, Erika said, but since the Meiji Restoration the way people speak in Tokyo has been the standard for spoken Japanese. I mean, has anyone ever translated Franny and Zooey into Kansai dialect?

         <p word_count="11">

          Theres a girl in my tennis club whos from Ashiya, too, she said, turning to me. Eiko Sakurai. Do you happen to know her?

         <p word_count="54">
          I do, I said. Eiko Sakurai was a tall, gangly girl, whose parents operated a large golf course. Stuck-up, flat-chested, with a funny-looking nose and a none too wonderful personality. Tennis was the one thing shed always been good at. If I never saw her again, it would be too soon for me.

          Hes a nice guy, and he hasnt got a girlfriend right now, Kitaru said to Erika. His looks are O.K., he has good manners, and he knows all kinds of things. Hes neat and clean, as you can see, and doesnt have any terrible diseases. A promising young man, Id say.
         </p>
         <p word_count="22">
          All right, Erika said. There are some really cute new members of our club Id be happy to introduce him to.

          Nah, thats not what I mean, Kitaru said. Could

          go out with him? Im not in college yet and I cant go out with you the way Id like to. Instead of me, you could go out with

          Erika stared at Kitaru as if she couldnt quite believe what she was seeing. Finally, she spoke. So youre saying its O.K. for me to go out with another guy if its Tanimura-kun here? Youre seriously suggesting we go out, on a date?

          After the movie lets have a nice meal together, Erika said, cutting him off. She wrote her phone number down on a sheet from her notebook and passed it to me. When you decide the time and place, could you give me a call?

         <p word_count="41">
          I didnt have a phone back then (this was long before cell phones were even a glimmer on the horizon), so I gave her the number for the coffee shop where Kitaru and I worked. I glanced at my watch.

          That Saturday, Erika and I met in Shibuya and saw a Woody Allen film set in New York. Somehow Id got the sense that she might be fond of Woody Allen movies.

          We strolled around the twilight streets for a while, then went to a small Italian place in Sakuragaoka and had pizza and Chianti. It was a casual, moderately priced restaurant. Subdued lighting, candles on the tables. (Most Italian restaurants at the time had candles on the tables and checked gingham tablecloths.) We talked about all kinds of things, the sort of conversation youd expect two college sophomores on a first date to have (assuming you could actually call this a date). The movie wed just seen, our college life, hobbies. We enjoyed talking more than Id expected, and she even laughed out loud a couple of times.

He was a bit of a child prodigyhis personality just isnt suited to the daily grind of studying. Hed rather go off and do crazy things on his own. Im the exact opposite.

          I think Kitaru is honestly seeking something, I went on. In his own way, at his own pace. Its just that I dont think hes grasped yet what it is. Thats why he cant make any progress. If you dont know what youre looking for, its not easy to look for it.

           might

          be doing). He didnt seem that strong a person to me. But it would be even harder for him if she kept a secret from him or lied to him.

          Erika stared at the candle flame flickering in the breeze from the A.C. I often have the same dream, she said. Aki-kun and I are on a ship. A long journey on a large ship. Were together in a small cabin, its late at night, and through the porthole we can see the full moon. But that moon is made of pure, transparent ice. And the bottom half of it is sunk in the sea. That looks like the moon, Aki-kun tells me, but its really made of ice and is only about eight inches thick. So when the sun comes out in the morning it all melts. You should get a good look at it now, while you have the chance. Ive had this dream so many times. Its a beautiful dream. Always the same moon. Always eight inches thick. Im leaning against Aki-kun, its just the two of us, the waves lapping gently outside. But every time I wake up I feel unbearably sad.

          Erika Kuritani was silent for a time. Then she spoke again. I think how wonderful it would be if Aki-kun and I could continue on that voyage forever. Every night wed snuggle close and gaze out the porthole at that moon made of ice. Come morning the moon would melt away, and at night it would reappear. But maybe thats not the case. Maybe one night the moon wouldnt be there. It scares me to think that. I get so frightened its like I can actually feel my body shrinking.

          kinda things. But going to a therapist hasnt helped, far as I can see. It sounds good in theory, but therapists dont give a crap. They look at you like they know whats going on, then make you talk on and on and just listen. Man,
          <em>

          About two weeks later, Kitaru quit working at the coffee shop. I say quit, but he just suddenly stopped showing up. He didnt get in touch, didnt mention anything about taking time off. And this was during our busiest season, so the owner was pretty pissed. Kitaru was owed a weeks pay, but he didnt come to pick it up. He simply vanished. I have to say it hurt me. Id thought we were good friends, and it was tough to be cut off so completely like that. I didnt have any other friends in Tokyo.

          The last two days before he disappeared, Kitaru was unusually quiet. He wouldnt say much when I talked to him. And then he went and vanished. I could have called Erika Kuritani to check on his whereabouts, but somehow I couldnt bring myself to. I figured that what went on between the two of them was their business, and that it wasnt a healthy thing for me to get any more involved than I was. Somehow I had to get by in the narrow little world I belonged to.

          I recognized Erika Kuritani right away. Id only seen her twice, and sixteen years had passed since then. But there was no mistaking her. She was still lovely, with the same lively, animated expression. She was wearing a black lace dress, with black high heels and two strands of pearls around her slim neck. She remembered me right away, too. We were at a wine-tasting party at a hotel in Akasaka. It was a black-tie event, and I had put on a dark suit and tie for the occasion. She was a rep for the advertising firm that was sponsoring the event, and was clearly doing a great job of handling it. Itd take too long to get into the reasons that I was there.

          I looked around the room. People in formal wear were scattered about. Corks popped one after another from expensive bottles of wine. A female pianist was playing Like Someone in Love.

          The answer is yes, Erika said. I had sex with him a number of times.

          She looked down and fingered the pearls on her necklace one by one, as if making sure that they were all still there. She gave a small sigh, perhaps remembering something. Yes, youre right about that. Aki-kun had a very strong sense of intuition.

          As far as I know, hes still single, Erika said. At least, he hasnt told me that he got married. Maybe the two of us are the type who never make a go of marriage.

          When Im driving and the Beatles song Yesterday comes on the radio, I cant help but hear those crazy lyrics Kitaru crooned in the bath. And I regret not writing them down. The lyrics were so weird that I remembered them for a while, but gradually my memory started to fade until finally I had nearly forgotten them. All I recall now are fragments, and Im not even sure if these are actually what Kitaru sang. As time passes, memory, inevitably, reconstitutes itself.
         </p>
         <p word_count="91">
          When I was twenty or so, I tried several times to keep a diary, but I just couldnt do it. So many things were happening around me back then that I could barely keep up with them, let alone stand still and write them all down in a notebook. And most of these things werent the kind that made me think, Oh, Ive got to write this down. It was all I could do to open my eyes in the strong headwind, catch my breath, and forge ahead.
         </p>
         <p word_count="123">
          But, oddly enough, I remember Kitaru so well. We were friends for just a few months, yet every time I hear Yesterday scenes and conversations with him well up in my mind. The two of us talking while he soaked in the bath at his home in Denenchofu. Talking about the Hanshin Tigers batting order, how troublesome certain aspects of sex could be, how mind-numbingly boring it was to study for the entrance exams, how emotionally rich Kansai dialect was. And I remember the strange date with Erika Kuritani. And what Erikaover the candlelit table at the Italian restaurantconfessed. It feels as though these things happened just yesterday. Music has that power to revive memories, sometimes so intensely that they hurt.

          But when I look back at myself at age twenty what I remember most is being alone and lonely. I had no girlfriend to warm my body or my soul, no friends I could open up to. No clue what I should do every day, no vision for the future. For the most part, I remained hidden away, deep within myself. Sometimes Id go a week without talking to anybody. That kind of life continued for a year. A long, long year. Whether this period was a cold winter that left valuable growth rings inside me, I cant really say. At the time I felt as if every night I, too, were gazing out a porthole at a moon made of ice. A transparent, eight-inch-thick, frozen moon. But I watched that moon alone, unable to share its cold beauty with anyone.
