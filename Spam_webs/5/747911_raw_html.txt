           Hillary Clinton has always been at the head of her class. That includes being among the leading edge of the80-million strong baby boom generation that firststarted arrivingin 1946-1947.
          </p>
          <p>
           She did everything they did: Got out for Barry Goldwater in high school; gotupwardly mobile to Wellesley and social liberationduring college; gotClean for Gene and manned the anti-war barricades in the late1960s; got to Washington to uplift the world in the 1970s; got down to the pursuit of power and position in the 1980s; joined the ruling class in the 1990s; and has helped make a stupendous mess of things ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            The baby boom generationwhich started with so much promise when it came of age in the 1960s has ended up a colossal failure.
           </strong>
           It hasturned America into a bloody imperial hegemon aboardanda bankruptSpy State at home where financialization and the 1% thrive, half the populations lives off the state and real main street prosperity has virtuallydisappeared from the land.
          </p>
          <p>
           Quite a deplorable legacy, that. And all the while Hillary has been our class president.
           <strong>
            God help the world if she becomes our nationsPresident. She has betrayed all that was right about the baby boomers in the 1960s; and has embraced all the wrong they did during their subsequent years in power.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           It starts during our defining moment when peace finally had a chance in the spring of 1968. We drove a sitting President from office, and, at that, onewhose megalomaniacal will-to-power was terrifying.
          </p>
          <p>
           We called bull on the cold war hysteria that had once put us under our desks at schooland now claimed that peasants in far offrice paddies threatened our security. We stopped the VietnamWar cold, dented the Cold War deepand put the whole warfare state apparatus on the runthe Pentagon, CIA, the generals and admirals, the military-industrial complex. Within a few years the warfare state budget was down by40% in constant dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
           So
           <strong>
            itwas an epochalchance to break the deadly cycle of war that had started a half-century earlier
           </strong>
           in the bloody trenches of northern France during the Great War; that had been rebooted for a future reprisein the vengefulfolly of Versailles; that hadbeen madeinexorable by the rise of nationalism, statism, autarky and militarism during the 1930s; and that had been unnecessarily and dangerously extended by the clash ofmilitary machines that both victorsrefused to demobilize after they won the peace in 1945,supplanting the silence of the German and Japanese war guns withthe nuclear nightmare of theCold War.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            True enough, thedefeat and retreat of the American Imperium by the idealism and defiance of the baby boomers was interrupted bythe Reagan defense and Cold War revival. But that historicalerror is what makes the Clintons all the more culpable.
           </strong>
           As I argued in the

            At the dawn of the 1980s, the Soviet empire was dying under the weight of its statist economic yoke; its militarized state-within-the-state was sucking the larger society dry. What the United States needed to do at that juncture was to wait it outsafe behind an ample strategic retaliatory force of Minutemen missiles and Trident submarines. That this more benign courseupon which history had already firmly embarkedwas denied at the eleventh hour can be blamed on the neocons primarily...
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            While there were clues and signs everywhere of Soviet industrial decay, the neocon branch of the military-industrial complex trumpeted a new version of the phony missile gap that John Kennedy had promoted during the 1960 campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            But the neoconservative version of the alleged gap in military capabilities was portrayed as pervasive, ominous, and intensifying. The Soviet Union was hell-bent on acquiring nuclear warwinning capabilities...
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            In truth, this Soviet nuclear warfighting strategy never really existed. Moreover, the huge US military buildup mounted to counter it allocated almost nothing to strategic weapons and countermeasures.

              Instead, the Pentagon poured hundreds of billions into equipping and training a vast conventional armada: land, sea, and air forces that were utterly irrelevant to the imaginary Soviet nuclear first strike.

           Ironically, right thereafter two American politicaldynasties arose, and both of them did just that. The elder Bush was born with a cloak and dagger and christened Magog by the Yale Skull and Bones-so maybe he did honestlythink there was a difference between the corpulent, tyrannical Emir of Kuwait and Saddam Hussein that made worthwhilethe spilling of American blood and treasure in Gulf War 1.0. We now know there wasnt.

           But you cant exonerate the Clintons, and that includes Hillary who even in 1993 was not baking cookies in the White House mess. It was their job as the first baby boom co-Presidents to finish the work of 1968, and by the time they entered the White House it was a lay-up. The Soviet Union was no more and Mr. Deng had just declared that to getrichis glorious.
          </p>
          <p>
           Their job was to have at least the vision of Warren G. Harding.After all, he diddemobilize the US war machine completely, eschewed the imperial pretensions of Woodrow Wilson and actually launched a disarmament movement which resulted in the melting down of the worlds navies and the Kellogg-Briand treaty to outlaw war.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Yet the opportunity at the Cold Wars endwas even more compelling.
           </strong>
           Therewas absolutely no militarythreat to American security anywhere in the world. The Clintons could have drastically reduced the defense budget by mothballing much of the navy and air force and demobilizing the army. Theyshould have cancelled all new weapons programs anddismantled the military-industrial complex. Theycould havedeclaredmission accomplished with respect to NATOand made good on Bushs pledge to Gorbachev to not expand it by an inch by actuallydisbanding it. And, as legatees of 1968,they were positioned tolead a global disarmament movement and toend the arms export trade once and for all.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            That was their job-the unfinished business of peace. But they blew it in the name of political opportunism and failure to recognize that the American public was ready to end the century of war, too.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           So they capitulated to the pork barrel politics of the Pentagon, plunged into the lunacy of the Balkan wars, launched the misbegotten project to expanded NATO, failed to bring Iran back into the community of nations when its leaders reached out to Washington, and kept America in harms way by keeping our war machine in the Persian Gulf andextending the pointless campaignagainst Saddam Hussein thatcould only openthegates to hell inBagdad.

           <strong>
            Needless to say, allof this betrayaldid not pacify the neocons and Republican Right. It just egged them on to full-throated imperialism, and enabled the madness of Cheney-Bush to be put into operation without the politicalinconvenience of raising a war budget. The great sin of the Clintons was that they left theReagan conventional armada of invasion and conquest in tact and ready to roll.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           To wit, at the height of the cold war in 1961 Eisenhower had left in place a defense budget of $380 billion in constant dollars(2005$) and a speech warning about the military-industrial complex. The Clintons left behind a budget of $400 billion a fulldecade after the Cold War ended after having capitulated to the very forces that Ike warned about.What the only general to lead the nation duringits century of war thought was more than enough at the peak of Soviet power,the Clintons did not even bother to challengeat a time when theKremlin was occupied by a harmless drunk.

            And you cant let Hillary off the hook on the grounds that she had the health care file and Bill the bombs and planes. On becoming Senator she did not miss a stride betraying the opening for peace that had first broken-through in 1968.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           She embraced Bushs shock and awe campaign in Iraq and was thereby complicit in destroying the artificial nationcreated by Sykes-Picot in 1916. So doing, Clinton helped unleashthe furies ofIslamic sectarianconflict that eventually led to the mayhem and brutality of the Shiite militias and the rise ofthe ISIS butcherson the backsof the dispossessed Sunni tribes and the demobilized officer corps of Saddam.

            Tellingly,Hillary Clinton made a beeline for the Senate Armed Services Committee, the domain of the Jackson wardemocrats, not the Foreign Affairs Committee, where Frank Church had exposed the folly of Vietnam and the treacherous deeds of the CIA. Undoubtedly, this was to burnish her commander-in-chief credentials, but it spoke volumes.

           By the time Hillary got to the seat of power, the idealism and defiance of thewarfare state that had animated her and the baby boomers of 1968 had dissipated entirety. For her and most of them, itwasnow all and onlyabout getting and keepingpower. In that respect, Hillarys term at the State Department was adownright betrayal.

           Whatthis untutored and inexperienced idealistneeded to hear from his Secretary of State was a way forward for peace and the dismantlement of a war machine that had rained havoc on the world, left behind 4 million damaged and disabled veterans who had sacrificed for no good reason anda multi-trillion dollar war tab that had bloated the national debt.

           When Obama took Bushs already bloated $650 billion war budget (2005$) to a level that was almost 2X Eisenhowers, Hillary was completely on board.When Obama was bamboozled into a surge of forcesin the god forsaken expanse of the Hindu Kush, Hillarybusied herself rounding up NATO support.When her neocon and R2P (responsibility to protect) advisers and Administration compatriots urged making peace by starting wars in Syria, Libya and the Ukraine,Hillary lead the charge. All of them have been disasters for their citizens and a stain on Americas standing in the world.

          <p>
           <strong>
            When the Deep State began lining up the next enemy, Hillary joined the gumming brigade, warning about the China threat.
           </strong>
           My god, were the red capitalists of Beijing to actually bomb 4,000 Wal-Marts in America their system would collapse in six months and their heads would be hungfrom the rafters in the nearestempty Foxcon factory.
          </p>
          <p>
           Heres the thing.
           <strong>
            Hillary Clintons sell-out to the Warfare State is not just about war and peace-even as it fosters the former and precludes the latter. Its also about the nations busted fiscal accounts, its languishing main street economy and the runaway gambling den that has taken over Wall Street.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The one thing that I learned during my time on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue is that thedefense budget, and the military-industrial complex which perpetuates it, is the mothers milk of fiscal irresponsibility. One of Hillarys predecessors,Alfonse DAmato, whowas known as Senator Pothole, symbolized it succinctly. There was not a weapons system made inGeorgia, Texas, California or Washington thathe wouldnt support if he could trade his vote for another pothole appropriation for New York.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Since the time of Reagan there has been no fiscal responsibility in Washingtonbecause there is no longer a party of fiscal rectitude.
           </strong>
           The GOP spends half its political capital defending the defense budget and the neocon agenda of permanent war and the other half pretending that deficits dont matter or that they are solely caused by too many democrats in Washington or too little growth on main street.
          </p>
          <p>
           And so the Clinton democrats have had a free political ride. Unlike Tip ONeill of circa 1980, they do notfear a political attack from the right on the issue of deficits, debt and big spending. So nothing is done to defuse the generational time bomb known as social insurance-even though means testing the wealthy recipients of social security and Medicare would ameliorate much of the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           Likewise, nothing is done toput in place a 21st century consumption tax that could pay the nations bills before it is too late orpermit the elimination or sharp reductionof the jobs destroying payroll and corporate income taxes before the US economy grinds to a complete halt.
          </p>
          <p>
           As it is, the day of fiscal reckoning is being forestalled by an artificial,destructive and unsustainable monetary regime that has drasticallylowered the true cost of the national debtand monetized trillions of public debt with central bankcredit plucked out of thin air.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            After all this time, however, Hillary doesnt get any of this. She thinks war is peace; deficits dontmatter; the baby boom is entitled to the social insurance they didnt earn;and that the Feds serial bubble machine is leading the nation back to prosperity.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            <u>
             Actually, its leading to the greatest financial bubble in human history
            </u>
           </strong>
           . After 75 months of ZIRP and a decade of Wall Street coddling and subsidization by the Fed, the windfalls to the 1% have become unspeakable in their magnitude and illegitimacy.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Soon 10,000 people will own a preponderant share of the wealth
           </strong>
           ; 10 million people will live grandly off the droppings; 150 million will live off the state; and the rest of America will be left high and dry waiting for the house of cards to collapse.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hillary rose to fame delivering an idealisticcommencement address at the beginning of her career. But
           <strong>
            like the generation she represents, she has betrayed those grand ideals over a lifetime of compromise, expediency, self-promotion and complacent acquisition of power, wealth and fame
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
