       wake up in  the morning in a traditional riad, tucked away at the end of a long, dark  pedestrian alley in the old medina. The  staff have lit incense, scenting the small three-story Moroccan courtyard. Today, I begin an exploration of orange; the  fruit, the taste, and the color. While  orange plays a role in many places around the world; nowhere is it infused so profoundly  into a city as it is here in Marrakech.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The old city  of Marrakech; the thousand-year-old walled center, is the busiest place in  Africa, but on a crisp, sunny morning, the labyrinthine back alleys appear  empty. I arrived at the small  five-bedroom riad last night. Now, on my  own, I need to be conscious of where I am; to be able to find my way back. I cant even pronounce the name of the riad,  or its street. I cant place north from  south, I dont have a good sense of exactly where in Marrakech I am, and even  detailed maps are meaningless in the narrow back lanes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My sole  wayfinding technique is to stop, look in all directions, take a mental note of  the scene, and try to remember how it relates to the last time I recorded my  position. I find my way out of the back  alley, continue to move; then, stop. Mental note. Move. Now, I am on a street that is bustling with  life: Smoke from old mopeds, street  vendors filling up every free space, chants of prayer, music. Fabrics in hues of honey and saffron drape  the ancient sandstone walls. Stop. Mental note.  Move.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where am I?

       street peddler,  sensing I am lost, moves in. Where are  you looking to go? He asks. I ask him  which direction the Jemaa el-Fnaa Square might be. Thank you, I say, but, Oh, I dont need you  to show me.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And then, a few streets later, he asks if I would like to meet his father.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Your  father? No, not particularly. But then we come to a dark, covered alley;  the edge of the famous Marrakech souks, and the street peddler urges me to meet  a man who looks nothing like him  the boy is black, the man is Arab, and  introduces him as his father.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The man is  excited to meet me. Why? Will you read  to me these letters in English? Oh, he  needs somebody to translate some letters, no problem. He opens up a large manila folder, stuffed  with hundreds of letters, all in English.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here, he says, this is from Jenny Linkletter, Charlotte, North  Carolina. Tapping on the lined paper, Read  this one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Okay, I  say, holding up the ratty, old paper.  Mr. Hirboush is an amazing  man. His skills transcend all knowledge  and power. My life was changed the  moment I entered through his door...
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Excuse me,  but can you please use an American accent.  The way you normally talk.
       <br/>
       But this is  the way I talk. Oregon accent. Maybe I look befuddled when I say, Pacific  Northwest English! Somehow he doesnt like to hear this. Okay, read this one, he says, trying to  hold back an underlying impatience.  Alistair McLeod, Medford, Massachussetts, and he hands me a piece of  paper dated June 14, 1996.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I was  another person before I entered the souks of Marrakech and met Mr. Hirbousch,  the letter begins. Instantly, as he  began his work, I entered a new state of being as he worked my feet... And then it dawns on me, this jerk just conned  me into reading his own testimonials. Wait  a minute, I say. Are you a reflexologist? Are you trying to get me to pay for a foot  massage? And I leave, moving quickly through the souk, the street peddler hot  on my trail, saying, Wait, wait!

       dodge this  way, and that way, and into a narrow alley, and I see the street peddler eyeing  the crowds. Then, stop. Mental note.  Wait, I have completely lost my position. I have no idea which direction I came from.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I continue  to walk, thinking about how, if reflexology seeks credibility, why a practitioner  of it may be so quick to play a scam with a street peddler? But thats the thing about credibility, isnt  it? A few gushing testimonials, a warm  smile, and a bunch of dumb foreigners, and who needs credibility. But then, if, as reflexology asserts, nerve  fibres run through our whole body, interconnected, could I not get a heart  attack from stepping wrongly on a thousand-year old Marrakech stepping stone?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To avoid the  street peddler, I light down a lane, out of the crowds. The bare sandstone walls are fully visible  here, and the light, reflected off two surfaces, brightens the alley. Like in the
       <a href="../desertsouthwest/">
        Desert Southwest
       </a>
       , sandstone in  Africa changes its tone the more surfaces it has to reflect off; roseate hues brighten  into yellowish-oranges and orangish-reds.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Quickly, day  turns to night, I find a restaurant. The  waitress seats me at the rooftop terrace, four stories up, where I sit alone  under moon and stars. I do not know why  she put me up here, away from the other guests, who are seated among empty  tables on floors one through three. But  the view is spectacular. At the end of the meal, a waitress brings a bowl of  couscous flavored with orange and cinnamon.  The way orange, and other citruses, are used here is unusual, but each  time it works. Salads are sometimes as  simple as orange slices, with radishes and salt. Orange is infused in tea, in chicken tagines,  in desserts, appetizers, lamb, even bread.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The  exploration of orange in food and drink has always compelled me; it goes back  to a very early time: My earliest memories are of orange popsicles. Not just the sweet, artificial citrus taste,  but the bright, wonderful color. Frozen around a wooden stick, and  representative of all things good. The  orange popsicle meant summer, the warmth of the sunshine, and big days, where  the sun was up early in the morning and not down until late in the evening.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I equated different  colors with different numbers, and orange, which I considered the sweetest and  most optimistic color, represented multiples of three  three, six, nine,  twelve, eighteen. I associated certain  tones and melodies with color too. When  I hear classical East Indian music, I imagine dark orange; when John Coltrane  and Miles Davis play, I hear orange on blue; like that color combination that the  impressionists so adored. For followers  of the Grateful Dead, the live performances from the spring and fall of 1977 most  sounded like a warm summer evening captured in music. I can never separate the tangle of sounds  from this era to a range between yellowish-orange and orangish-red.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pay for my meal, and begin the hopeless quest  to find my way back to the riad.

       t's fashionable for travelers to explain why they like to  travel.They will say, I like to get lost in other cultures!Or, I  want to embrace their food.I want to immerse myself in authenticity. My  wanderlust inspires me to seek the new!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These may be good reasons to travel, but I do not always  believe that these stated themes really explain why someone is  traveling.To me, they seem like Twitter-era advertisements for the  traveler's view of the world or even how they want people to perceive  them.A traveler may truly immerse himself into a culture, may get lost in  its cuisine, and have an infectious wanderlust, and yet, the most significant  learning, or discovery, or joy in a person's travels rarely seems to have much  to do with any of these stated themes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Foodies don't eat continuously during a trip, I've noticed,  and I've met culture-conscious backpackers who spend much travel time reading a  good paperback, in their own language.A common theme among travelers is  the joy of meeting someone that comes from where they come from.I once  asked a traveling hunter what his favorite part of the trip was.He said  it was seeing all the different species of songbirds!
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When I set out to create my list of things I hoped to  accomplish this year, a habit I do each year and which I begin early the year  before, I felt exasperated.The list was too long; a recipe for  failure.Each year before, I failed to live up to my goals, so why was my  list even longer and more complicated?

       took a paintbrush and marked the top of my list with a  thick line of orange ink.Somehow, it made the list more appealing, and I  realized then that orange had always played a role in my life.No, it  wasn't my favorite color, and no, I don't wear orange bow-ties or hang orange  paintings in my living room.But I couldn't deny the influence of the  color throughout my life. Why not just make orange the theme for the year; all  tasks, goals, hopes and dreams can be organized neatly under a single  theme.No longer lists of finances, family, fitness; but a year in color.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       By having a color as my theme for travel, I was both  admitting to myself that there was nothing noble about why I traveled, that I  was not seeking or losing myself or curing an insatiable wanderlust, but rather  that travel is more a way to pursue and sort out the themes of our own lives.
       <br/>
       Lost in thought, but also lost, I approach a street vendor,  and pay him to help find my way to the riad.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The next morning, I meet up with Hicham, a friend of a  family friend who drove from a coastal city to act as my driver.I jump in  his car and we leave the medina for the outskirts of the city.Many  streets are lined with orange trees."But those are not the sweet oranges  that we eat," Hicham says, explaining that they are a type of bitter orange  tree typically grown here ornamentally, because they produce oranges throughout  the year.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I imagine Marrakech a few hundred years ago; in a time  before cars and street signs, and a street like this one would have been all  the color of sand and sandstone, and the colors that would stand out the most  would be the orange trees themselves.It's a lovely architectural element:  orange and green against the subdued natural colors of sandy Marrakech stone  and mud.

       itter oranges, in all their hybridized forms around the  world, play as much of a role in the orange taste as sweet oranges  Marmelade,  Grand Marnier, Curaao, spiced Belgian witbiers and various orange extracts,  flavors, orange blossom water and essential oils.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Here in Marrakech, citrus trees, and perhaps particularly  the bitter orange tree, plays a central cultural role. To understand the role  of the orange tree, you have to understand the riad, which is really a  traditional Moroccan courtyard house."These days," explains Hicham, "many  of the riads in Marrakech have been converted into hotels, but it used to be  that this is where people lived."
       <br/>
       "It doesn't make sense to me," I say, "riads are  large.They are three or four stories high, they are like  mansions.How did people afford to live in such space?"
       <br/>
       "Actually, you would have many generations living in a  riad," he explains."If you get married, you would still live in the riad  you grew up in.You would have many generations living in each  one.That is one way in which they do not work in the modern world."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The riad grew out of different traditional elements: the  Moroccan desert weather; harsh wind and sand necessitated an enclosed space.  But the beautiful and nearly ever-present warm sun justifies the courtyard,  which blocks the harsh weather but brings in the bright light.

       lso, the Islamic notions of privacy (particularly hijab;  the partitioning of adult women from the outside world), the Islamic/North  African concept of hospitality, which is very much central to life  here.Hicham explains, "It is not like in the states, where if you want to  have your friends over, you invite them over and they come at the time you tell  them.At home, for example, if we are making a tagine, we make enough for  five or six people, even though there are just the four of us.You never  know when a friend or family will stop over, and we expect that they do regularly.If  nobody comes over, we have leftovers."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The next morning, I meet up with Hicham, a friend of a  family friend who drove from a coastal city to act as my driver.I jump in  his car and we leave the medina for the outskirts of the city.Many streets  are lined with orange trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But those are not the sweet oranges that we eat," Hicham  explains, explaining that they are a type of bitter orange tree typically grown  here ornamentally, because they produce oranges throughout the year.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I imagine Marrakech a few hundred years ago; in a time  before cars and street signs, and a street like this one would have been all  the color of sand and sandstone, and the colors that would stand out the most  would be the orange trees themselves.It's a lovely architectural element:  orange and green against the subdued natural colors of sandy Marrakech stone  and mud.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Islamic concept of the garden, the earthly reminder of  paradise, also plays a role in the creation of the riad, and at the center of  each is almost always a citrus tree.It may be a single orange or lemon  tree, but larger courtyards may host two or three trees.These ideas of  hijab, hospitality, weather and garden put the orange tree front and  center.They become almost like a symbol of the way of life here.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oranges did not always exist in Morocco or the Mediterranean  at large.In fact, they didn't always exist.Before man's role in  citrus, native citrus shrubs existed in India and Southeast Asia.They  were evergreen shrubs that loved sunny jungles, bore greenish or yellowish  fruits, and probably were unremarkable and patchily distributed.There  were no limes, no lemons, no grapefruits, and in fact botanists believe that  since fruits of the citrus genus so easily hybridize, that each fruit we know  today is the result of so much manipulation that learning the taxonomy will  never get resolved.An orange, for example, may be a cross between a  pomelo and a mandarin.But a pomelo itself, a hybrid of a hybrid of a  hybrid of some native citrus, from some vast region, from plants that may have  existed somewhere between India, China and Southeast Asia.If that's  confusing, then consider the grapefruit  a hybrid of an orange and a pomelo,  or the lemon, which is a hybrid of an orange and a citron.

       itrus began to appear in North Africa and the Arab world in  the first millennium, and even surfaced in the Qu'ran; in the defining era of  Islamic culture in North Africa, the bitter orange tree must have been  something to behold; brilliant evergreen with bright bulbs of a color so rare  in this part of the world.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In English, the name for the color comes from the name for  the fruit.In the countries of the Far East, the name of the color is  named after the spice that is so often used to dye garments orange   saffron.In those countries, the concept of orange is exaulted by Buddhism  and Hinduism, and it is ever-present in design.For me, that is a strange  concept, because in North America, orange is the least used color in design,  fashion and architecture  it is associated so closely with friviolity and  plastic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But perhaps its rarity endears me to it; whenever we do use  orange, we use it boldly.We know there is something dangerous about it;  dangerous and bright and bold and optimistic.Over the years, I've learned  that it's difficult to mix red and yellow paint to produce a big, bold crisp  orange.To truly represent orange, you need a naturally occurring pigment.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       After three days of traveling with Hichan through Marrakech,  I sit down on the rooftop of the riad with my Winsor &amp; Newton ink  just  brown and orange, and try to capture Marrakech in two colors.For  breakfast, fresh squeezed orange juice with pistachio yogurt.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I remember a year ago, when the doctor first said that we  should try running the color-blindness test on our son again.And how,  after seeing that when we drew together, that he tended to draw everything in  the colors of yellow and blue.And that one day, when we were sharing a  plate of pita, hummus and carrots, I asked him what the most brilliant color on  the plate was, and he pointed to the little yellowish garlics infused in the  hummus.At first, I was hurt to learn that my son would never see the  color orange the way I do.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But if travel is about exploring our own themes in our own  lives, then a pursuit of the color orange has reminded me that we each see  things our own way.Not everybody sees the big, bold optimism that I see  in orange, but six billion people each seeing the world through their own eyes  is what makes being a part of it so interesting.And sitting up here,  under the morning sun, I ponder being back home, and sharing an orange popsicle  with my son  his favorite flavor.
