          Jeremy Spencer's music ministry is another example of a collaborative venture based around a celebrity-style personality that started small and has started to bear quite a bit of fruit.

         Besides participating in three concerts in India during the '90s, Jeremy started playing publicly again several years ago in low-key venues and eventually with a nationally respected Norwegian blues band. Gradually, he has built a network of people who like to work with him, and the opportunities and offers are growing. While he doesn't announce his Family membership from the stage, he does highlight the Family and his personal faith in the many

         he has done, and in his personal witnessing and interaction with those the Lord puts on his path. People see him, know him, appreciate his talent, and they inevitably come to learn that he's in the Family, a fact that many who are familiar with his music already know. His example and his skill in music gives the Family a good name, without his having to publicly promote the Family or our good works.

         Alleged child sexual abuse
        </span>
       </h2>
       <p>
        There have been a number of allegations of child sexual abuse made against Spencer. Information about some of these allegations can be found in court documents from Argentina and the United Kingdom, and in published statements, sworn affidavits and court testimony by his first wife and a number of people raised in The Family who alleged he sexually assaulted them during their childhood. In 1982, Spencer's first wife publicly accused him of statutory rape and also alleged that she and Spencer had found adults willing to sexually share with their older children.  In a 1992 child custody case, three people testified under oath that Jeremy Spencer sexually assaulted them and otherwise sexually abused them when they were children. In 2005, a number of people provided sworn affidavits alleging child sexual abuse by Spencer to an
        <a href="/index.php/FBI" title="FBI">
         FBI
        </a>
        office in

         San Diego
        </a>
        .  The FBI investigation of Spencer ended in 2006 when the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California declined to prosecute due to the statute of limitations having expired for the alleged criminal offenses within its jurisdiction.  In 2007, Harper Collins published a book,
        <a href="/index.php/Not_Without_My_Sister" title="Not Without My Sister">
         Not Without My Sister
        </a>
        , in which one of the authors described child sexual abuse by Spencer in graphic detail.  In 2014, another one of Spencer's alleged victims, released a public statement describing his ongoing sexual abuse of her starting at age 7 and his violent physical abuse of her two-year old sister.  In a June 2009 public statement released on his web site, Spencer complained that he had been "subjected to slander and controversy" and "absurdly misquoted and presented in a less than favourable light" but did not specifically deny any of the allegations against him other than denying "speculation" that he was "a leader in the organization."  His empathetic denial of the allegation that he was a leader in The Family appears to be in response to Lord Justice Ward's mention of him, 14 years earlier, in a section of the 1995 Ward Judgment titled "The Leaders' involvement in sexual abuse."

The routine was by now was familiar  undress, pray, kiss and then give him a hand job. Jeremy would try to masturbate me but it just ended up feeling raw and hurting. I would move position so that he would rub a different spot, but I never understood why he  and the other men  kept on rubbing and rubbing. If I said I did not enjoy it they would accuse me of being prudish or proud. I just pretended to have an orgasm to get them to stop.

         I was 7 years old when I met Jeremy Spencer in the secluded compound in Manila My first memories with Uncle Dada Jeremy (as we were told to refer to him) were the disturbing music sessions I was made to take with him where he taught me to play guitar chords and harmonize to melodies that he re-created from old Elvis and Beatles songs (which he said HE wrote!).  Being forced into submission and punishment for any contrary attitude was a typical scenario constantly enforced on us young people and any other person who dared to question or defy the believe, obey and cooperate as told law which The Family always strictly  enforced and this whole time Jeremy Spencer was always making sure to remind me that I was a pathetic, disgusting and stupid child and I would never be a singer or musician and I had absolutely no talent and would never become to much of anything ever! When I eventually did exceptionally well at a certain music session with him after  I was then rewarded by getting to have sex with him in some special one on one love up time  to reward me for being a cooperative music student in his class that day!  I was taken to a secluded room.. where I was forced to perform oral sex in which I would gag on his penis until I vomited in my mouth and almost suffocated then I had to sit on his genitals and grind on them and improvise penetration until he had another orgasm and lie there while he violated me with his tongue and fingers.  Now this was only one of the first of many countless incidents  He also used to love to beat my baby sisters; mostly my youngest who was a 2 year old at the time until she couldnt walk and was black and blue.  I counted him beating her almost senseless 10 times repeatedly as a 2 year old toddler while she screamed and screamed as he locked himself in a bathroom with her and then he came out smacking and licking his lips with the pleasure he had just experienced from beating a child too young for him to sexually molest all because she deserved that for pouting before his beating because she had a bad attitude and asked for a hug from me!

In her account she stated that Mr. Spencer "could have been put in prison" because she was a minor and he was an adult when they began having sexual relations that resulted in her pregnancy. She also described how her older (described as being between the ages of 10 to 12 and up) children were "fortunate" in that she and her husband had been able to find "loving", "helpful" and "patient" adults to sexually "

         Jeremy &amp; I had spent a lot of time together &amp; when he was in town he would stay at my house up till 3-4:00 in the morning &amp; then leave, but my mother would always go to bed &amp; leave us downstairs &amp; we were always making love, sometimes 3-5 times a day! When I told my mother I was PG, she said, "I might have known. What are we going to do?" So we went to the doctor &amp; he confirmed it--4 or 5 months, &amp; he asked my mother if she wanted it terminated. At first she said, "Yes", then she said, "Lord forgive me!" I told her I wanted the baby &amp; I wanted to go and live with Jeremy in London. I was just 15 &amp; this type of thing was unheard of, but she considered it &amp; agreed that I could live at home with her until the baby was born &amp; then we would see.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jeremy's parents were a little more outraged &amp; maybe they felt more responsibility because I was only 15 and under the legal age. Jeremy could have been put in prison by my mother if she had wanted to press charges because I was under legal age.

         Where we live at MWM we do have a lot of fellowship, a lot of sharing, &amp; the children are very fortunate to be able to partake of this. As I said before, it's easy for our little ones to share &amp; stay with one another, even make love if they can, they're all small and they can manage it. But when they get 10, 11, 12, &amp; on, our children like to share with the adults. I found some adults in our Family are very helpful, very loving, &amp; very patient towards our children, &amp; will take time to really help them &amp; love them &amp; even teach them. In fact, I haven't really heard of a bad experience in our Family with our children sharing. I have talked a lot with the children about my own testimony and I treat them as adults, because, although it was a long time ago when I was their age, 12-13, I would have loved to have been in the situation we are now. I feel that almost all of our Family, the brethren are really understanding, very gentle, very loving, &amp; there is no need to fear for the children, &amp; they should be really free to love and share with the other brethren just as we do. When they have sperm, when they start their period, that's the testing time, how much do you trust the Lord, how much do you believe His promises, His blessings, etc? Being worried like our parents, the older generation are watching us, their grandparents; or not caring, only wanting to flow with the spirit, with this love, helping the children to be really free, &amp; helping them to bring forth fruit!

          A personal note from Jeremy Spencer
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been said, "Your friends don't need an explanation, your enemies won't believe you anyway, but others may deserve an explanation." In light of that saying, I would like to give a statement on disturbing allegations against me that have surfaced on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since going more public with a couple of albums and some concerts in recent years, I want to say that I have entered these endeavours being well aware that those interested in my music can obtain information and sadly, much misinformation  about me at the click of a mouse button. I have been subjected to slander and controversy that often surrounds me because of belonging to an alternative religious movement and I have been absurdly misquoted and presented in a less than favourable light due to my lifestyle choice, especially having dropped out of a famous rock group.
        </p>
        <p>
         In response, my quandary is that I could go about trying to refute, edit or even erase where possible what is written about me, although that in itself could be construed as covering up and it could be fruitless, considering that anyone can say anything about anyone on the internet or in books - these days, virtually with impunity. Instead, I prefer to go on with my life and for those interested- let my music speak for itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been a member of the Family International (
         <a class="external free" href="http://www.thefamily.org/" rel="nofollow">
          http://www.thefamily.org/
         </a>
         ) for almost four decades and have given my time, services and skills to it. Contrary to speculation, although I am a famous member, I am not a leader in the organization! That is certainly not one of my talents! God gave me several artistic talents, however, one of which is playing slide guitar blues. I believe God wants me to impart my passion for the blues to those interested and I am grateful for the opportunities He has given me to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Heartfelt thanks to those of you who are interested in my music and career.
        </p>
