Columbia came up with a photo pass, and I was allowed to shoot only the first four numbers. I didn't know I had this pic until I saw the contact sheets, but it's been my favourite photo ever since. It's been used by dozens of magazines, and a hand tinted version was the cover pic on Patrick Humphries' book Blinded by the Light." class="descriptionImage" src="http://www.rockarchive.com/images/products/prnt/BN001SR_prnt.jpg"/>

           <img alt="My first professional job as a photographer was to make Bruce Springsteen's first pictures at Columbia Records in February of 1973.  It was just before Greetings from Asbury Park was released- I got paid $25.  My job was to cover an interview by Bob Sarlin in the 12th floor conference room in &quot;Black Rock&quot; for an in house magazine, which was formed to introduce new artists to the record company staff.  Bruce was just a kid from New Jersey, he wandered in with his girlfriend Diane; later John Hammond stopped by as he often did in those days.  Bruce was known to some as John's 'latest folly', (Dylan had been an earlier one).  Blinded by the light, some thought the kid was faking it when those stumbling tumbling rambling array of lyrics rolled off his tongue, there was even debate about whether he really was a good guitar player.  But when he sat down to talk with us, there was no pretence or falseness in the room; he was noticeably good at just being himself.

Bruce was just a kid from New Jersey, he wandered in with his girlfriend Diane; later John Hammond stopped by as he often did in those days.  Bruce was known to some as John's 'latest folly', (Dylan had been an earlier one).
