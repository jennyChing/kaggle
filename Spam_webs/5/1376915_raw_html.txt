   The Hazel Grove School of Bardic Wisdom is designed to give you a deeper understanding of the Myths and Legends of the Gaelic speaking people of Ireland and Scotland. Our Celtic ancestors saved these stories for us and handed them down from generation to generation. These myths and legends are an integral part of our ancestral heritage and they contain many of the hidden keys to our ancestral wisdom. Anyone who claims a desire to walk the path of the Celtic shaman needs to have these stories in their hearts.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   If you are planning to enter the Faery Shamans Apprenticeship Program and you plan to take only one pre-qualifying program, take this one. It will be a good foundation for your apprenticeship work.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    All Society of Celtic Shamans programs are ON-LINE. Our classroom is ON-LINE. You will need to access your lessons ON-LINE. If you are not COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE with working ON-LINE please do not register for any of our programs.
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We are accepting students in the first year of the program. This is a two year program. The first year  twelve months  is dedicated to Irish myths and legends.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We now offer a second year of Hazel Grove studies. The second year is devoted to Welsh myths and legends. You need to complete year one in the Hazel Grove before you are eligible to register for year two.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There are plans to arrange a third year of Arthurian myths and legends in the future.

     Can I enroll in more than one program at once?
    </strong>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Hazel Grove School of Bardic Wisdom is a truly comprehensive course in the myths and legends our Celtic ancestors handed down to us. Students who have enrolled in the Hazel Grove and/or the Oak Grove, at the same time, have had trouble keeping up. One of the reasons for this is the programs involve initiations. Undergoing too many initiations at once is not a good thing to do. Therefore, we no longer allow any student to enroll in more than one program.
