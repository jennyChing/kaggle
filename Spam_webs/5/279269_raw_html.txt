              It's Monday afternoon, and I'm sitting at my desk. Faithfully plugging away at my contract job, pretending not to notice the overgrown grass begging to be shorn, or the rabbits eating what might once have become spectacular, color-saturated bursts of iris. I am earning my wage. Doing my part to keep spaceship America moving forward, the economy in motion, my mortgage paid and my children fed and clothed.
             </p>
             <p>
              The phone rings. It's a number I don't recognize; a city number. I pick it up, and answer with a tentative hello.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Hey... it's JiF."
             </p>
             <p>
              I take a deep breath. This cannot be a good conversation. They never are, these days.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Hey... how are you? What's going on?"
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a loaded question. We both recognize it, and so we exchange a couple of pleasantries before we plunge into the matter at hand.
             </p>
             <p>
              "So. It's been an... interesting, I guess, couple of months."
             </p>

              "Jesus." I say it, but I'm not surprised. He knows I'm not surprised.

              "And it just got to the point where we'd had enough trips to the emergency room, and incidents with the police trying to find her, and time when she'd just disappear and we'd have no idea... it was awful, and she was refusing to acknowledge that this was a serious problem.

             </p>
             <p>
              I don''t say it, but I know what he means.

               A friend of mine
              </a>
              had told me about it, back in January. It'd been in the back of my head, ever since. Wondering. If.
             </p>
             <p>
              When.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I went to court. I had to file... there were all these different steps, but I had to file to get sole custodianship of (our son). I had to file to get guardianship over her. That's what the sectioning was: me deciding against her will to have her committed."
             </p>
             <p>
              (long exhale. both of us.)
             </p>
             <p>
              "I'm so sorry."
             </p>
             <p>
              "It's... well, there was really nothing else to be done. She spent about a week in an inpatient program at (local hospital), and now she's in (a specialized program for a specific group of dual diagnosis patients somewhere down south). It's a locked ward deal, and realistically she's going to be there for at least three months."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Jesus Christ." What I don't ask: how do you get someone with severe alcoholism, depression, and pronounced self-injurious behavior on a plane from New England to the south? What I decide: I don't need to know.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I just wanted to tell you, because you and TheWife have been such a help to us, and I know I haven't really had the chance recently to keep you in the loop..."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Yeah, well, clearly you had some other things on your mind."
             </p>
             <p>
              He laughs, a little bit. "Yeah. Anyhow, we brought her down early last week, and now I'm trying to get our life here back together. Me and (our son's). I'm realizing that I'm now a single father, for all intents and purposes. So I'm hiring a nanny to help him out in the hours when I'll be working, and I'm... well, I'm finally getting back to work. I've missed so much time recently, but my job has been incredible in terms of understanding the situation."
             </p>
             <p>
              I make a sound - almost a small laugh - to indicate my admiration. "That's awesome. Obviously, taking care of ElF and your son have been priority number one, but, y'know... we've been worried about the toll all of this might be taking on your job. Because, obviously, if something were to happen with that, it'd create a whole new set of substantial problems."
             </p>
             <p>
              "I know, and I've been very, very lucky on that side. So now... now, we're finally kind of settling down. Last weekend was the first weekend in I don't know how long where (my son) and I haven't been rushing off to a hospital or to a treatment center or calling the cops or driving around the neighborhood looking for her... and it was like: we both just collapsed."
             </p>
             <p>
              "I can't imagine why you'd be exhausted."
             </p>
             <p>
              He laughs a bit. "I know. The problem is that (my son's) idea of resting is mapping out and taking a long bike trip. So the weekend turned out to be less lying around and more biking back and forth the length of the Minuteman trail." I laugh, because I know that this is less of an ordeal for him than he's making out. In the midst of everything else, JiF managed to run the Boston Marathon in April. There was a list in the Globe: he finished with the best time of anyone from our town.
             </p>
             <p>
              We talk for a few more minutes. He thanks us again for what little we've done to help them over the previous months. I offer to help out again, anytime he needs it. I don't ask if there's something we can do for ElF. She's beyond our capacity to help, at this point. I want to hope that she comes home late this summer. Stronger. Somehow healed. I want to hope.
             </p>
             <p>
              The conversation ends, and I put the phone down. My grass is still too long. The rabbits have moved from our irises to our neighbor's flower bed. They are eating happily. Taking their fill. And as I watch them, my mind flits back to an early evening last June. Sitting on ElF and JiF's back patio. TheWife out in their yard, playing catch with our girls. JiF up on the deck, grilling what will prove to be an amazing adobo chicken dinner. ElF and I, sitting there, shooting the breeze. Me telling a story, sarcastic and borderline mean, trying to make her laugh. Her sitting on her white chair, her legs pulled up beneath her body. Pushing her hair back from her eyes. Both of us, swirling glasses of malbec, taking sips. Soaking up the sunshine.
             </p>
             <p>
              And then their son cries out. "Mom, the rabbits! The rabbits are out!" And ElF stands up and runs out into the yard, stopping next to her son. I saunter behind, and see what he's pointing at. Baby bunnies - newborns, really - in the grass. Exposed to the sunlight. No warren to be seen. No mother rabbit standing nearby, watching us nervously. JiF comes over a moment later, and assesses the situation. He is very matter-of-fact. "We should leave them alone," he says. "If we stand here and watch them, the mother rabbit won't come back." Their son is upset, and ElF wants to pick them up and move them. JiF is adament: leave them be. Let nature take its course.
             </p>
             <p>
              I walk away with JiF, and he says to me in a low voice: "I haven't seen the mother in days. I knew they were there, but I think she's gone. I don't think this is going to be a happy ending for the bunnies." Then he calls over to ElF. "Hey, bring (our son) inside... it's time for dinner, anyhow." He heads up the stairs to his deck, and I tell TheWife to help me to gather our brood and bring them inside as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              We do, and as I guide them up the stairs and across the deck and into their home, I look back and see ElF and their son still standing out in the yard. They are looking down on the baby bunnies, concerned. "But how do we know the mother will come back?" he asks. His voice is unsteady; he is still upset. And she looks at him and says, "She will. I'm sure of it."

             It's Monday afternoon, and I'm sitting at my desk. Faithfully plugging away at my contract job, pretending not to notice the overgrown grass begging to be shorn, or the rabbits eating what might once have become spectacular, color-saturated bursts of iris. I am earning my wage. Doing my part to keep spaceship America moving forward, the economy in motion, my mortgage paid and my children fed and clothed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The phone rings. It's a number I don't recognize; a city number. I pick it up, and answer with a tentative hello.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             "I went to court. I had to file... there were all these different steps, but I had to file to get sole custodianship of (our son). I had to file to get guardianship over her. That's what the sectioning was: me deciding against her will to have her committed."
            </p>
            <p>
             (long exhale. both of us.)
            </p>
            <p>
             "I'm so sorry."
            </p>
            <p>
             "It's... well, there was really nothing else to be done. She spent about a week in an inpatient program at (local hospital), and now she's in (a specialized program for a specific group of dual diagnosis patients somewhere down south). It's a locked ward deal, and realistically she's going to be there for at least three months."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Jesus Christ." What I don't ask: how do you get someone with severe alcoholism, depression, and pronounced self-injurious behavior on a plane from New England to the south? What I decide: I don't need to know.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I just wanted to tell you, because you and TheWife have been such a help to us, and I know I haven't really had the chance recently to keep you in the loop..."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Yeah, well, clearly you had some other things on your mind."
            </p>
            <p>
             He laughs, a little bit. "Yeah. Anyhow, we brought her down early last week, and now I'm trying to get our life here back together. Me and (our son's). I'm realizing that I'm now a single father, for all intents and purposes. So I'm hiring a nanny to help him out in the hours when I'll be working, and I'm... well, I'm finally getting back to work. I've missed so much time recently, but my job has been incredible in terms of understanding the situation."
            </p>
            <p>
             I make a sound - almost a small laugh - to indicate my admiration. "That's awesome. Obviously, taking care of ElF and your son have been priority number one, but, y'know... we've been worried about the toll all of this might be taking on your job. Because, obviously, if something were to happen with that, it'd create a whole new set of substantial problems."
            </p>
            <p>
             "I know, and I've been very, very lucky on that side. So now... now, we're finally kind of settling down. Last weekend was the first weekend in I don't know how long where (my son) and I haven't been rushing off to a hospital or to a treatment center or calling the cops or driving around the neighborhood looking for her... and it was like: we both just collapsed."
            </p>
            <p>
             "I can't imagine why you'd be exhausted."
            </p>
            <p>
             He laughs a bit. "I know. The problem is that (my son's) idea of resting is mapping out and taking a long bike trip. So the weekend turned out to be less lying around and more biking back and forth the length of the Minuteman trail." I laugh, because I know that this is less of an ordeal for him than he's making out. In the midst of everything else, JiF managed to run the Boston Marathon in April. There was a list in the Globe: he finished with the best time of anyone from our town.
            </p>
            <p>
             We talk for a few more minutes. He thanks us again for what little we've done to help them over the previous months. I offer to help out again, anytime he needs it. I don't ask if there's something we can do for ElF. She's beyond our capacity to help, at this point. I want to hope that she comes home late this summer. Stronger. Somehow healed. I want to hope.
            </p>
            <p>
             The conversation ends, and I put the phone down. My grass is still too long. The rabbits have moved from our irises to our neighbor's flower bed. They are eating happily. Taking their fill. And as I watch them, my mind flits back to an early evening last June. Sitting on ElF and JiF's back patio. TheWife out in their yard, playing catch with our girls. JiF up on the deck, grilling what will prove to be an amazing adobo chicken dinner. ElF and I, sitting there, shooting the breeze. Me telling a story, sarcastic and borderline mean, trying to make her laugh. Her sitting on her white chair, her legs pulled up beneath her body. Pushing her hair back from her eyes. Both of us, swirling glasses of malbec, taking sips. Soaking up the sunshine.
            </p>
            <p>
             And then their son cries out. "Mom, the rabbits! The rabbits are out!" And ElF stands up and runs out into the yard, stopping next to her son. I saunter behind, and see what he's pointing at. Baby bunnies - newborns, really - in the grass. Exposed to the sunlight. No warren to be seen. No mother rabbit standing nearby, watching us nervously. JiF comes over a moment later, and assesses the situation. He is very matter-of-fact. "We should leave them alone," he says. "If we stand here and watch them, the mother rabbit won't come back." Their son is upset, and ElF wants to pick them up and move them. JiF is adament: leave them be. Let nature take its course.
            </p>
            <p>
             I walk away with JiF, and he says to me in a low voice: "I haven't seen the mother in days. I knew they were there, but I think she's gone. I don't think this is going to be a happy ending for the bunnies." Then he calls over to ElF. "Hey, bring (our son) inside... it's time for dinner, anyhow." He heads up the stairs to his deck, and I tell TheWife to help me to gather our brood and bring them inside as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             We do, and as I guide them up the stairs and across the deck and into their home, I look back and see ElF and their son still standing out in the yard. They are looking down on the baby bunnies, concerned. "But how do we know the mother will come back?" he asks. His voice is unsteady; he is still upset. And she looks at him and says, "She will. I'm sure of it."

               Def Leppard: Hysteria
              </a>
              <br/>
              It only took me 25 years, but I finally picked up Hysteria the other week... and it's everything I hoped and feared it would be. Does it sound awesome? Holy hell yes, it sounds awesome  every explosive drumbeat, chiming/echoing guitar lick and Joe Elliott high note seguing perfectly into a creamy, harmony-driven chorus sounds like the word "awesome" would sound if awesome was a sound. But is it also stupid? Well... yes. Honestly, the lyrics on this album are nothing shy of appalling bottoming out with immortal "You've got the peaches, I've got the cream" couplet from Pour Some Sugar On Me. (cringes) But when you turn off your brain and allow yourself to get caught up in the gorgeous awesome of all that sound... the appeal of Def Leppard becomes crystal clear.

              <br/>
              Honestly, I'm running out of ways to describe this music to you. I can call it shoegaze-metal, but that may not mean a thing to you. I can tell you it fuses the aggression and (occasional) blood-curdling screaming of one genre with the gorgeous melodics, atmosphere and graceful, haunting vocals of the other. I can tell you that the fact that it's (mostly) in French doesn't do a damned bit to detract from the breathtaking beauty and emotional resonance of the music, which stands up to the impossibly high standards set by Alcest's first two albums. I can tell you all of this and more, but unless you give yourself the opportunity to actually listen to what they've created... you'll never really understand why Alcest may be my favorite band in the world right now.

              I finally got my act together a picked up some Billy Squier. And you know what? His best songs hold up beauuuutifully. This is Rawk music with a capital R, and there's not a damned thing wrong with that. Everybody Wants You, In The Dark, The Stroke, Learn How To Live... I can't believe I waited this long to bring this music back into my life. Awesome.

              My 2011 album of the year. Achingly gorgeous neo-classical compositions designed to leave you on the verge of tears. I've been listening to it almost non-stop for months; you should do the same.

               Hammock: Longest Year EP
              </a>
              <br/>
              There are few things more frustrating than trying to describe the gorgeous, evocative and profoundly atmospheric post-rock music of Hammock without A) resorting to clichs that, while not necessarily inaccurate, do little to accurately describe the listening experience; or B) having the musical vocabulary to adequately describe just what it is about these lengthy, largely wordless compositions that hypnotizes and moves me so profoundly. So I'll just say: imagine a film. No words; just images. Flashing, semi-grainy images of someone from your past impossibly beautiful, vibrant and full of life. Someone lost to you forever. Imagine that feeling, of love and impossible longing and desperate, hopeless desire to recapture that moment and make it last forever. Now hunt down the title track to this EP, close your eyes, and listen. And you will know: this is the music for that feeling.

               Jane Roper: Double Time: How I Survived - and Mostly Thrived - Through the First Three Years of Mothering Twins
              </a>
              <br/>
              I really, really wish that Jane Roper's terrific Double Time had been around when I needed it, because it's exactly the kind of thing I was desperately hoping to find when my wife and I discovered we were having twins: a warm, funny, immensely personable and eminently readable take on how someone like me navigated the discovery and aftermath of "Oh my god! It's twins" without crashing on the rocks and sinking to the bottom. 

Of course,  there's a lot more to the book than just kid/parenting stuff - Roper devotes a sizeable amount of real estate to discussing in sobering and often moving terms her struggles with depression and bipolarism, which are further complicated by the myriad challenges of being a twinfant parent - but make no mistake: twin wrangling is at the heart of the book, and is the engine that drives not only the story but Roper's impressive ability to wrench honestly, truly funny observations from the kind of parenting scenarios that might kill a lesser person.

              </a>
              <br/>
              Thank you, Adam P Knave, for making this a part of my life. Richard Stark (a pseudonym for the late grand master of crime fiction, Donald Westlake) produced a series of Parker novels back in the day  creating a dark, violent antihero who's been brought to life (to varying degrees of success) on the big screen in everything from Lee Marvin's Point Blank to Mel Gibson's Payback. It's a very different proposition from the incredibly funny caper stories that brought Westlake much of his success as a novelist, and perhaps that's why he created a separate pen name for the series... but as far as deep, dark, delicious noir fiction goes, Parker is prime stuff. All of which is to say that it's great source material for Darwyn Cooke, who brings the first Parker novel to life here in a comics-style format that does absolute, compelling justice to the sudden violence, moral ambivalence and creeping sense of doom that made The Hunter such a landmark in noir fiction. Wonderfully moody and incredibly evocative of the story's time and place, Cooke's recreation of the story via sequential art makes for a wonderfully fast and furious read... and, in the end, left me hungry for me. Great stuff.

               Bob Mould: See a Little Light: The Trail of Rage and Melody
              </a>
              <br/>
              As someone who's been a fan of Bob Mould's music for more than 20 years - tracing his career from Hsker D to his solo career to Sugar and then back again to solo life - I approached his memoir with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. Why? Because you never know whether someone's ability to write compelling stories in song form will translate to a longer-form narrative. Fortunately, it turns out that my anticipation was justified  because Mould delivers a consistently interesting and engaging account of his life both within and outside of music that offers insight into the eclectic experiences that shaped the rage and melody of the subtitle. From his often-stormy personal life (including his private and public experiences as a gay man) to his relationships with bandmates to his foray into the world of writing for professional wrestling (it's true!) and beyond, it's a story that translates well across 400+ pages... and while you're aware that you're getting only one side of the argument when he talks about his battles with lovers, record labels, Grant Hart and more, Mould tells it all in a voice every bit as compelling and relatable as that offered by his singing. 

Would I have enjoyed this as much if I hadn't been familiar with his music? Probably not  and having a pretty good context in terms of his music and the scene(s) he's been a part of over the years is almost certainly a prerequisite for enjoying this book. That said: it's a really good read, and if his music has earned even a small place in your heart, it's a worthwhile investment of your time.

               Erik Larson: Thunderstruck
              </a>
              <br/>
              Considering how much I'd enjoyed two of Larson's earlier books - Isaac's Storm and the completely wonderful Devil in the White City - it took me a hell of a long time to get around to reading Thunderstruck. Honestly, there was a pretty good layer of dust sitting on the jacket when I finally picked it up and went to work a couple of weeks ago. Why? Because, for no reason I can really explain, I was afraid I'd find it kind of dull.

Unfortunately, it turns out my apprehension was well-justified. I can certainly understand why Larson was attracted to the subject matter: he parallels Marconi's invention of radio with the then-sensational Crippen "Basement Murder" in London, and how the two intersected in the mid-Atlantic, as Crippen attempted to flee to America. Which sounds interesting, right? Wrong. The Marconi storyline is extremely well-researched, and Larson does his best to bring it to life, but ultimately it comes across as something that is clearly far more important than it is actually interesting. Marconi himself: smart, driven, not a nice guy, and not a terribly compelling subject. And Crippen? Who killed his harpy wife and fled the UK with his secretary/lover? Is a cypher... a man universally described (as is clear through Larson's impeccable research) as a small, quiet, listless little creature. And while I spent the entirety of the book hoping for a revelation in which we come to understand how such a non-entity came to commit such a strange and gruesome murder, I came away frustrated -- as no such revelation ever appears. Larson (like the police) knows Crippen did it, but we never really understand how (functionally) or why (in a character-motivation sense). 

In the end, I found myself wishing that I'd left the book collecting dust. Very disappointing.

              Brian Boone is a funny, funny, funny man... and I was happy as hell (if unsurprised) to discover that the same sharp, sarcastic humor he brings to his blog and tweetstream manifests throughout this book. Now, I'm aware that I'm more or less the ideal audience for this book - I love music, I love lists, and I love sharp, sarcastic humor - but that doesn't mean that the content is appealing only to those who fall into the somewhat limited blue lobster demographic. 

Let me put it to you this way. One section of the book is called "Succinct Information In Column Form," and features an item with a number of options beneath the question "Little girl object of fancy or little girl object of fancy that is also the title of a Mariah Carey album?" The answer, per Brian Boone? "Mariah Carey has released Rainbow, Charmbracelet, Butterfly, Daydream and Glitter. She has not yet released albums titled Unicorn, Princess or Sparkles." 

If you're the kind of person I think you are, that just made you cackle. And that also makes you the kind of person who would enjoy the rest of the book  which I certainly did.
