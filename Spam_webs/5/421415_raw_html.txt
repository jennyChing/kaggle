Aristotle and his followers even compiled a volume of the ways that your looks could reflect your spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Soft hair indicates cowardice and coarse hair courage,\" they wrote. Impudence, the treatise says, was evident in \"bright, wise-open eyes with heavy blood-shot lids\"; a broad nose, meanwhile, was a sign of laziness, like in cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensuous, fleshy lips fared little better. The philosophers saw it as a sign of folly, \"like an ass\", while those with especially thin mouths were thought to be proud, like lions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lttmf\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are taught not to judge a book by its cover. But while it is wise not to set too much by appearances, psychologists are finding that your face offers a window on our deepest secrets. Even if you keep a stony poker face, your features can reveal details about your personality, your health, and your intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assertive structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The idea is that our biology, like genes and hormone levels, influences our growth, and the same mechanisms will also shape our character,&rdquo; explains &lt;a href=\"http://clefevre.moonfruit.com/home/4562134246\"&gt;Carmen Lefevre at Northumbria University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the face&rsquo;s bone structure &ndash; whether it is relatively short and wide or long and thin. Lefevre has found that people with &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513813000275\"&gt;higher levels of testosterone&lt;/a&gt; tend to be wider-faced with bigger cheekbones, and they are also more likely to have more assertive, and sometimes aggressive, personalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lttch\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between face shape and dominance is surprisingly widespread, from &lt;a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093369\"&gt;capuchin monkeys&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; the wider the face, the more likely they are to hold a higher rank in the group&rsquo;s hierarchy &ndash; to professional football players. Examining the 2010 World Cup, Keith Welker at the University of Boulder, Colorado, recently showed that the ratio of the width and height of the footballers&rsquo; faces predicted both the number of fouls among midfielders, and the number of goals scored by the forwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(To calculate this yourself, compare the distance from ear-to-ear with the distance between the top of your eyes, and your upper lip. The average ratio of width-to-height&nbsp; is around 2 &ndash; Abraham Lincoln was 1.93)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ltvbc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may even clue you in to a politician&rsquo;s motives. Using volunteers to rate former US presidents on different psychological attributes, Lefevre found that face shape seemed to reflect their perceived ambition and drive. &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886912000049\"&gt;John F Kennedy had a thicker-set face than 19th Century Chester Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Such analyses of historical figures are perhaps best taken with a pinch of salt, however, and it has to be said that other traits, such as cooperation and intelligence, should be equally important for success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plump cheeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, your health and medical history are also written in your countenance &ndash; and the detail it offers is surprising. The amount of fat on your face, for instance, provides a stronger indication of your fitness than more standard measures, such as your body mass index. Those with thinner faces are less likely to suffer infections, and when they do, the illness is less severe; they also tend to have lower rates of depression and anxiety, probably because mental health is often closely related to the body&rsquo;s fitness in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could the plumpness of your cheeks say so much about you? Benedict Jones at the University of Glasgow thinks a new understanding of fat&rsquo;s role in the body may help explain it. &ldquo;How healthy you are isn&rsquo;t so much about how much fat you have, but where you have that fat,&rdquo; he says. Pear-shaped people, with more weight around the hips and bottom but slimmer torsos, tend to be healthier than &ldquo;apples&rdquo; with a spare tyre around the midriff, since the adipose tissue around the chest is thought to release inflammatory molecules that can damage the core organs. Perhaps the fullness of your face reflects the fatty deposits in the more harmful areas, Jones says. Or it could be that facial fat is itself dangerous for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lttwg\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides these more overt cues, very subtle differences in skin colour can also reveal your health secrets. Jones and Lefevre emphasise this has nothing to do with the tones associated with ethnicity, but barely-noticeable tints that may reflect differences in lifestyle. You appear to be in more robust health, for instance, if your skin has a slightly yellowish, golden tone. The pigments in question are called carotenoids, which, as the name suggest, can be found in orange and red fruit and veg. Carotenoids help build a healthy immune system, says Lefevre. &ldquo;But when we&rsquo;ve eaten enough, they layer in the skin and dye it yellow. We exhibit them, because we haven&rsquo;t used them to battle illness.&rdquo; The glow of health, in turn, contributes significantly to your physical attraction &ndash; more so, in fact, than the &lt;a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2014.944194?journalCode=pqje20#preview\"&gt;more overt tones that might accompany a trip to the tanning salon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blush of pink, meanwhile, should signal the good circulation that comes with an active lifestyle &ndash; and it might also be a sign of a woman&rsquo;s fertility. Jones has found that women tend to adopt a slightly redder flush at the peak of the menstrual cycle, &lt;a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/103607/\"&gt;perhaps because estradiol&lt;/a&gt;, a sex hormone, leads the blood vessels in the cheek to dilate slightly. It may be one of many tiny shifts in appearance and behaviour that together make a woman &lt;a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/25457-fertile-women-attractiveness.html\"&gt;slightly more attractive when she is most likely to conceive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking smart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jones points out, these secrets were hiding in plain sight &ndash; yet we were slow to uncover them. At the very least, this knowledge helps restore the reputation of &ldquo;physiognomy&rdquo;, which has suffered a somewhat chequered reputation since Aristotle&rsquo;s musings. Tudor king Henry VIII was so sceptical of the idea that he even banned quack &ldquo;professors&rdquo; from &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9P0ZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=henry+8+physiognomy+beggars&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V6GbryaHDX&amp;sig=_VrckPgiNE8ZIzJgNh1oCLkkG_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BAj_VNbYJ4ixggT2r4OoCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=henry%208%20physiognomy%20beggars&amp;f=false\"&gt;profiting from their readings,&lt;/a&gt; and its status took a second bashing in the early 20th Century, when it was associated with phrenology &ndash; the mistaken idea that lumps and bumps on your head can predict your behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now the discipline is gaining credibility, we may find that there are many more surprises hiding in your selfies. Intriguingly, we seem to be able to predict intelligence from someone&rsquo;s face with modest accuracy &ndash; though it&rsquo;s not yet clear what &lt;a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081237\"&gt;specific cues make someone look smart&lt;/a&gt;. (Needless to say, it is not as simple as whether or not they wear glasses.) Others are examining the &ldquo;gaydar&rdquo;. We often can guess someone&rsquo;s sexual orientation within a split-second, &lt;a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036671\"&gt;even when there are no stereotypical clues&lt;/a&gt;, but it&rsquo;s still a mystery as to what we&rsquo;re actually reading. Further research might explain exactly how we make these snap judgements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ltv17\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also be interesting to see how the link between personality, lifestyle and appearance changes across the lifetime. One study managed to examine records of personality and appearance, following subjects from the 1930s to the 1990s. The scientists found that although baby-faced men tended to be less dominant in their youth, they grew to be more assertive as the years wore on &ndash; perhaps because they learnt to compensate for the expectations brought about by their puppyish appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More intriguingly, the authors also found evidence of a &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/24/7/736.abstract\"&gt;Dorian Gray effect&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; &ndash; where the ageing face began to reflect certain aspects of the personality that hadn&rsquo;t been obvious when the people were younger. Women who had more attractive, sociable, personalities from adolescence to their 30s slowly started to climb in physical attractiveness, so that in their 50s they were considered better-looking than those who had been less personable but naturally prettier. One possibility is that they simply knew how to make the best of their appearance, and that their inner confidence was reflected on subtle differences in expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ltv4m\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, there is so much more to our appearance than the bone structure and skin tone, as one particularly clever study recently demonstrated. The scientists asked volunteers to wear their favourite clothes, and then took a photo of their face. Even though the clothes themselves were not visible in the mugshots, impartial judges considered them to be considerably more attractive than other pictures of the participants. The finding is particularly striking, considering that they were asked to keep neutral expressions: somehow, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.gu.se/english/research/publication/?publicationId=101305\"&gt;boosted self-esteem shone through&lt;/a&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our faces aren&rsquo;t just the product of our biology. We can&rsquo;t change our genes or our hormones &ndash; but by cultivating our personality and sense of self-worth, they may begin to mirror something far more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":0,"MimeType":"unknown","SourceHeight":0,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8tbz.jpg","SourceWidth":0,"SynopsisLong":"In Depth","SynopsisMedium":"In Depth","SynopsisShort":"In Depth","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8tbz.jpg","Title":"inDepth.jpg","CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8tbz","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8tbz","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p00q8tbz","_id":"559a52de0b808738c4e273fe"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"559a52610b808738c4e262a1"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":116306,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SourceHeight":1080,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/2r/rd/p02rrdlm.jpg","SourceWidth":1920,"SynopsisLong":"(Credit: Getty Images)","SynopsisMedium":"(Credit: Getty Images)","SynopsisShort":"(Credit: Getty Images)","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/2r/rd/p02rrdlm.jpg","Title":"sections_02_science_environment_gettyimages_1920.jpg"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p02rrdlm","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p02rrdlm","_id":"559a55840b808738c4e2defd"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;You do not want to get in the way of a gamma ray burst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the most luminous, high energy explosions that have happened since the Big Bang,&rdquo; says Neil Gehrels, principal investigator at Nasa for the Swift mission. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a beam of gamma radiation that&rsquo;s flying through the Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if one of these cosmic death rays of high frequency electromagnetic waves hit the Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w94\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;For a planet 1000 light years away, it would destroy the ozone layer. If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasas cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention.

Yet a few years later there she was, approaching the due date for the next baby. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explanation usually given is that women simply forget exactly what the pain was like because the brain edits out the memory. In evolutionary terms it might make sense to forget the pain of childbirth in case it deterred people from reproduction. But unfortunately it seems not to be that simple. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the subject of childbirth, for instance, a review of studies conducted before 2000, concluded that women do not completely forget labour pain &ndash; or &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11251509/\"&gt;the intensity of the pain they experienced&lt;/a&gt;. It&rsquo;s a difficult topic to study, though. There are scales that allow people to rate their experience of pain, but since childbirth tends to take many hours, it&rsquo;s not always clear which part of labour or childbirth study participants focus on. Even individual contractions vary in their painfulness, so scoring the pain of the whole experience is never going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lrj58\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you can do, though, is examine whether individual women&rsquo;s recollections of their pain change with time. A Swedish study took more than 2,000 mothers and &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14992155\"&gt;compared ratings of their memories of the pain and experience of childbirth two months after the birth with their ratings 12 months later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the evidence suggests that most women don&rsquo;t forget: the memory of the experience of childbirth was the same for 60% of the women at two months and 12 months. In fact, just one-third of the mothers at 12 months had forgotten quite how painful they&rsquo;d considered childbirth at two months. And for 18% the opposite happened &ndash; far from forgetting the pain, in their minds the experience had become more painful by 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewriting the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, the researchers talked to the women again. By now, the memory of labour pain had indeed declined in some women &ndash; about half of them rated the pain as less severe than they had done at two months &ndash; but for those who had rated the experience most negatively after two months, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19076128/\"&gt;the memory of the pain simply didn&rsquo;t go away&lt;/a&gt;. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, though. Some studies have found that women who remember the pain of childbirth see coping with the experience as an achievement that stays with them. &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11251509/\"&gt;If I can cope with labour pain I can cope with anything&lt;/a&gt;.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it still might come as a surprise that the memory of pain often remains unchanged with time. That&rsquo;s because decades of psychological research on memory show that we reconstruct memories slightly differently every time we recall them. Our memories are not like a DVD library which we can browse through, replaying any past event exactly as it happened &ndash; instead, the context of the original memory and the way we tell the story each time makes a difference. The pain of childbirth is pain with a purpose &ndash; provided the baby is delivered safely, this positive result should, in theory, lessen the memory of the pain. But clearly, for some mothers even the happy event of a new-born baby can&rsquo;t diminish the painful memory of childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lrjlp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if the intensity of this kind of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; pain isn&rsquo;t necessarily forgotten, how about more negative experiences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&rsquo;s important that we feel some pain and remember what caused it &ndash; the memory can keep us safe and prevent an accident from happening again. A painful cut gained when opening a tin can, for instance, will generally ensure that you are more careful the next time you&rsquo;re preparing dinner. Or if, like me, you find yourself wondering whether the metal ring around a fire pit gets really hot and you touch it with all four fingers, you probably won&rsquo;t do that again. Sadly that was aged 30, not aged five. As you might expect, then, people with disorders which prevent them from feeling pain at all frequently burn and injure themselves. So we don&rsquo;t necessarily want to forget all pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgetting some pain might be useful, though &ndash; particularly the chronic pain sometimes associated with conditions like diabetes. Clues to controlling and eliminating this sort of pain at the molecular level come from recent work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lrj8n\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just walking past the doorway where you stubbed your toe, or using the door you once shut your finger in, can make you wince at the memory. In 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona College of Medicine claimed this is because of a molecule called PKMzeta, which they argued strengthens the connections between neurons in the brain when we learn something new &ndash; and also creates physical sensitivity after a painful experience. Using mice, they demonstrated that, if they blocked this specific molecule in the spine, they could erase the extra sensitivity to pain in the mice. However, other researchers have since questioned this finding, showing that &lt;a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/04/deleting-a-memory-molecule-doesnt-affect-memory-in-mice/\"&gt;mice born without PKMzeta could still feel pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the uncomfortable or traumatic pain that can be associated with some medical procedures? When colonoscopies are done under conscious sedation, patients are sometimes given a drug called midazolam which makes them feel less anxious and also promotes anterograde amnesia &ndash; the inability to form new memories. Patients might wince or wriggle with discomfort during the procedure, but the hope is that they won&rsquo;t remember any pain or feel disturbed by the procedure afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingering feelings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some have questioned the ethics of this approach &ndash; and its implications. In a paper published last year Andrew Davidson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Victoria, Australia, warned that although drugs such as midazolam can make it harder to form conscious memories, &lt;a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/content/40/10/659.extract\"&gt;they can leave implicit memories intact&lt;/a&gt;. These are memories that affect us even though we can&rsquo;t consciously recall them. So we can button a shirt or find our way along a familiar route to the station without thinking about when we actually made those memories. Troublingly, Davidson suggests that even if you don't remember a colonoscopy, you might feel &ldquo;strangely uncomfortable when walking past a garden hose&rdquo;. Would it be more ethical if patients were warned in advance that this might happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s even been suggested that to mitigate the psychological trauma of the very rare situations where patients wake up while under a general anaesthetic, they could be given midazolam as soon as the anaesthetist realises, &lt;a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/content/40/10/651.short?g=w_jme_top10_tab\"&gt;to disrupt the formation of memories of the event&lt;/a&gt;. But this would only erase memories from the point when the drug was administered, not from the point of waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ethics of the use of drugs like this will continue to be discussed. The very fact that they are being considered underlines the fact that &ndash; unfortunately &ndash; for people who have given birth or experienced other kinds of agony, it can be a myth that pain has no memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: This article has been amended to reflect the evidence questioning the importance of the molecule PKMzeta.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't remember a colonoscopy, you might feel strangely uncomfortable when walking past a garden hose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Urban myths and old wives tales under the microscope.

It doesn&rsquo;t need to be during wintertime: summer holidays, beach trips and short breaks can all fall foul of a post-work health slump too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s even a name for this affliction &ndash; leisure sickness. Ad Vingerhoets, the Dutch psychologist who came up with the name, concedes this diagnosis is not yet established in the medical literature; nevertheless, the idea that you fall ill as soon as you stop work is one which many will recognise from bitter experience. So, how valid is it really?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k4ljg\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s been no large systematic study to find out whether people are more likely to fall ill when on holiday than during everyday life. But to try to put some figures on it, Vingerhoets asked more than 1,800 people whether they thought they suffered from leisure sickness. Just over &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12411765\"&gt;3% of people said they did&lt;/a&gt;. Considering how likely we are to feel stressed and work extra-hard before a holiday, this suggests it&rsquo;s not the norm and even quite unusual &ndash; especially because this study relied on asking people to judge for themselves whether it happened, and we&rsquo;re more likely to remember a holiday ruined by an illness, than all the ones unblemished by a cold. We don&rsquo;t remark on it when we go on holiday and feel fine. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if a small percentage of people are convinced they experience this, is there a physiological explanation? Almost half the people &lt;a href=\"http://hrcak.srce.hr/20385?lang=en\"&gt;in Vingerhoets&rsquo; study&lt;/a&gt; put it down to the transition from work to holiday. There are several theories why this might be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sick list&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The first goes that when we finally get the chance to relax, the stress hormones that help us cope with work deadlines get out of balance, and leave us open to infection. Adrenaline helps us to cope with stress, as well as boosting the immune system to help fight infections and keep us well. Along with it comes cortisol which also helps with the stress, but at a cost to the immune system. It all sounds plausible, particularly if the transition from stress to relaxation is fast, but not enough research has been done yet to confirm whether this hypothesis holds true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There again, perhaps people are ill all along. They are so busy and determined to battle on until their holiday arrives that they simply don&rsquo;t notice they are becoming ill until they have the chance to relax on holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s certainly the case that how we rate our symptoms depends on what else we&rsquo;re doing. The psychologist James Pennebaker found that the less that&rsquo;s going on around a person, the worse they say their symptoms are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k4m4t\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had a set of students rate every 30 seconds of a film to say &lt;a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp0101_6#.VLAfmNBFAy8\"&gt;how interesting it was&lt;/a&gt;. Then he showed the same film to another group of students and monitored how often they coughed. The more interesting the scene in the film, the less they coughed. In the boring bits they seemed to notice their sore throats and cough a lot&hellip; observations that might interest any concert performers fed up with audiences coughing. That said, while you may notice aches and pains more when you are free from the workplace, you&rsquo;re probably going to notice a thick head and a runny nose however hard you&rsquo;re working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cabin fever&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;An entirely different possibility is that it&rsquo;s not the stress of work that&rsquo;s making us ill, but the holiday itself. Travelling is always tiring, particularly by plane, and the longer the flight the more likely you are to pick up a virus. The average American gets 2.5 colds a year, and on this basis researchers calculated the chances of catching a cold on a single flight should be &lt;a href=\"http://www.cieh.org/library/knowledge/.../jehrvol3iss1-commoncoldaircraft.pdf\"&gt;1% for an adult&lt;/a&gt;. But when patients were surveyed a week after flying from San Francisco Bay to Denver, 20% of them had developed a cold. If this infection rate held all year round, you&rsquo;d expect to get more than 56 colds a year, in other words be prone to the sniffles every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k4mh1\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recycling air in planes is often blamed for this rate of infection, but in this study it made no difference. The researchers blamed two other culprits: sitting in an enclosed space, closer to other people&rsquo;s germs than you normally would be; and humidity. They hypothesise that the dry air in planes could cause the virus and bacteria-trapping mucus in our noses to become too thick for the fine hairs to pass it down the throat to our stomachs for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vingerhoets is open to other explanations for people getting ill on holiday. There&rsquo;s even a suggestion that if you don&rsquo;t really like a holiday, being ill gets you out of it. But the lack of research in this area makes it impossible to pick out one explanation from the others, and it could even be a combination of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news, though, is that it&rsquo;s rarer than you might expect. Even better, as we get older our immune systems have had more time to develop antibodies ,and we get fewer and fewer colds, whether we&rsquo;re on holiday or not. Finally, that&rsquo;s one aspect of getting older to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why we may fall ill when were on holiday","HeadlineShort":"Why you fall ill on holiday","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Does rushing to meet work deadlines before a break leave you more prone to coming down with an illness?

It&rsquo;s an alternative to sugar, created from aspartic acid and phenylalanine. In 1996 a paper suggested that the increase in brain tumours &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8939194\"&gt;might be linked to a rise in the popularity of aspartame&lt;/a&gt;. Fears continued, and other types of cancer began to be mentioned. There was so much concern that a vast study of almost half a million people was conducted by the US National Cancer Institute &lt;a href=\"http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/docs/aspartame.pdf\"&gt;and published in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. It found no increase in the risk of brain cancer, leukaemia or lymphoma in people who consumed aspartame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise when the European Food Safety Authority conducted the most comprehensive review of the evidence to date, they concluded that &lt;a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/3496.pdf\"&gt;at the recommended levels&lt;/a&gt; (40mg a day per kilogram of body weight) it was safe, even for children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooth protector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have caused problems is that so little aspartame enters our blood system; it&rsquo;s quickly broken down into by-products. But there is one exception. People with a rare genetic disorder called phenylketonuria or PKU can&rsquo;t break down phenylalanine, one of aspartame&rsquo;s by-products  for them, it isn&rsquo;t safe. This is why sweeteners for people to add at the table or to hot drinks are clearly labelled with a warning that they contain a source of phenylalanine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sweeteners do come with side-effects, however. If you&rsquo;ve ever eaten too many sugar-free mints containing xylitol then you might have experienced this for yourself. Xylitol is a type of carbohydrate made from birch and other hardwood trees. It contains 30% fewer calories than sugar and doesn&rsquo;t seem to leave an aftertaste, but if you consume large amounts, it can cause water retention, resulting in diarrhoea. But there is evidence exciting some dentists that it can help prevent tooth decay. Chewing gum or mints sweetened with xylitol has been show to &lt;a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2266.pdf\"&gt;neutralise plaque acidity on the teeth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hqch1\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest kid on the block is a sweetener that comes from the stevia plant, except that it isn&rsquo;t really that new. In Paraguay and Brazil stevia has been used medicinally for centuries. It&rsquo;s calorie-free and 300 times sweeter than sugar. In Japan it&rsquo;s been sold as a sweetener for more than four decades. Native to tropical and sub-tropical areas of South and Latin America, sweet compounds called steviol glycosides are extracted from the leaves of the plant by steeping them in water. These compounds pass through the body without being absorbed. Stevia was approved at a food additive in the US in 2008 and in Europe in 2011. The downside is that some find it has a bitter aniseed-like aftertaste and for this reason it&rsquo;s often mixed with artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are steviol glysocides safe? The European Food Safety Authority thinks so after they conducted an analysis of all the available evidence done on &lt;a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/sweeteners.htm#efsa_activities\"&gt;both humans and animals in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. They concluded these compounds don&rsquo;t cause cancer, are not toxic and are safe for children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great hope is that it helps people to satisfy their sweet tooth without putting on weight or developing diabetes, yet sweeteners have been available for some time and don&rsquo;t seem to have halted the obesity crisis so far. Scientists still don&rsquo;t know whether there are consequences when the brain registers the sweet taste, but then doesn&rsquo;t get the hit of sugar it expects. The worry is that the sweetness might somehow trick the body into releasing too much insulin, something which could lead to weight gain in the long run. It&rsquo;s not possible to say yet whether this is happening. But the European Food Safety Authority has concluded there&rsquo;s not enough evidence to say that stevia helps to achieve or maintain a healthy body weight.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glucose intolerance&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeteners don&rsquo;t seem to deserve their poor reputation, it would appear. But just as it seemed that the evidence was clear, this year some curious new research from Israel was published, suggesting that far from helping to prevent Type 2 diabetes, the artificial sweeteners aspartame, saccharin and sucralose might contribute to it. Healthy mice were given drinking water with one of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7521/full/nature13793.html\"&gt;these three sweeteners added to it&lt;/a&gt;. When they measured their blood glucose levels they found that the mice who had consumed sweeteners were showing glucose intolerance, something associated with Type 2 diabetes, while the mice which drank plain water or water containing ordinary sugar didn&rsquo;t. The reason appeared to lie in the bacteria found in the gut; if they had consumed sweeteners their gut bacteria was changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from mice can&rsquo;t always be extrapolated to people and the usual diet of a mouse is of course very different from ours. But for the second part of their study the researchers used humans, feeding them the maximum daily allowance of saccharin, the equivalent of 40 cans of a typical diet drink. Within five days just over half the people showed some intolerance to glucose. Intriguingly those that did had different gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hqc7k\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers took it a step further, carrying out faecal transplants where faeces are passed from one person or animal to another. In this case they took the faeces from the humans and put them in the mice. The humans with glucose intolerance passed it on to the mice, suggesting these bacteria in the gut are the key. But before we decide that sweeteners are harmful after all, this is just a single study conducted mainly on mice, with just seven humans taking part. Even the researchers concede that more research is needed. This study tells us nothing about the long-term impact of sweeteners in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 a vast study covering more than 300,000 people in eight European countries found no link between the development of Type 2 diabetes and eating or drinking artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one lesson from all these studies and that&rsquo;s that there is no one category of &ldquo;sweeteners&rdquo; which are good or bad. Each is very different and needs to be researched and considered separately. Considering all this evidence, it seems to be far too soon to reach for the sugary drinks instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Google+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

One common assumption is that everyone is prone to developing post- traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, and in the 1990s this led to attempts to get people to participate in a single counselling session or psychological debriefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach has not been shown to be effective. One comprehensive review on the subject concluded that compulsory counselling after an incident &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12076399\"&gt;should be discontinued&lt;/a&gt;, and some have gone as far as to argue that a &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/183/1/12\"&gt;disaster industry&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; has promoted such interventions uncritically. When you look at the evidence, it is not true that most people develop PTSD. And this isn&rsquo;t the only myth about the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after a traumatic event people understandably feel shocked, anxious and afraid. Events loom large in their minds, and they might find themselves plagued for some days or weeks by flashbacks, nightmares and a constant anxiety that they are not safe. None of this is pleasant, but these are all very normal reactions to any event whether your own life threatened or you saw other people injured or dying in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d5sf4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashbacks can become so intrusive that thinking is disrupted. Feelings of guilt might lead a person to go over and over events in their mind, for instance, questioning whether they could have done more to save other people. They might go to great lengths to avoid any places or activity that remind them of the event or become numb to everything in an attempt not to feel anything at all. A constant sense of high alert can mean that someone simply walking past them in the street can set their heart racing and bring back feelings of terror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarkable resilience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Post-traumatic-stress-disorder/Pages/Symptoms.aspx\"&gt;symptoms of PTSD&lt;/a&gt; are very real and very distressing. It&rsquo;s important that anyone who experiences them can get the help they need. But one of the keys to a diagnosis of PTSD is that these symptoms persist for &lt;a href=\"http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/PTSD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf\"&gt;at least a month after the event&lt;/a&gt;, and that they affect a person&rsquo;s work or social life, or stop them getting on with the things they want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remarkable thing is that for most people these symptoms gradually subside, and as a result PTSD is not as common as you might expect. Even in extreme situations like war most people are not affected. Only &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/kcmhr/publications/15YearReportfinal.pdf\"&gt;4% of British soldiers developed PTSD&lt;/a&gt; after serving in Iraq, for example, rising to 6.9% for those in combat roles. Among reservists rates were a little higher, averaging at 6%. Researchers think this might be because they return to their old civilian lives where they have to cope on their own, while regular members of the armed forces remain with colleagues who have a better understanding of what war is like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d5sqx\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise after attacks on civilians, most people are not affected. A study of more than 10,000 people including police and construction workers, who came to aid of staff at World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, found that three-quarters &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23551932\"&gt;did not have long-lasting difficulties&lt;/a&gt;. It is true that sometimes symptoms can be delayed. Some 8.5% of the responders at the World Trade Center experienced difficulties much later on. There were even cases of soldiers who fought in World War II, returned home seemingly fine, worked for the rest of their careers, and then on retirement found that the nightmares and flashbacks suddenly returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norwegian experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019smbv\"&gt;travelled to Norway&lt;/a&gt; to meet survivors of the shootings on Utoya Island in 2011, where 69 teenagers died and many others witnessed the killings. Some survived by hiding in the toilets for three hours, knowing that the killer was still nearby, hunting for them.&nbsp; Immediately after the event, Atle Dyregrov, Director of the Center for Crisis Psychology in Bergen estimated that between 30-50% would suffer long-term mental health difficulties including PTSD. Even though the numbers have ended up at the high end of the estimate, that still leaves half who witnessed their friends being murdered and fled for their lives, yet have somehow recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d5sc3\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shootings took place in the summer holidays and most of the teenagers involved were starting at new schools in the autumn, which made it harder for them. But the country already had a plan for how to deal with something like this, whether a natural disaster or a crime, and provided a ground-breaking level of support. Every school involved was given advice on what to do, the strict attendance rules were relaxed for survivors and students were given the choice about when and how to talk to their new classmates about what had happened. Some even decided to avoid questions by standing up and telling the whole class about it when they were ready. The bereaved and the survivors were given an opportunity to revisit the island at different times, since it was learned from previous disasters that they come at it from such different perspectives. This kind of support did seem to make a difference and other countries are now looking to the Norwegian experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposure levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another myth about PTSD is that only people who are weak will experience the condition. Why, even after the most horrendous experiences, some people develop PTSD and others don&rsquo;t, is still a mystery. The psychiatrists&rsquo; bible in the US, DSM until recently included a person&rsquo;s responses to the initial event. Intense fear, helplessness or horror were thought to result in more PTSD, but those indicators have been removed from the newest version of the manual, because it&rsquo;s been found that they don&rsquo;t predict who will and won&rsquo;t suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of the event itself can of course make a difference. Rates of PTSD amongst US troops are &lt;a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa040603\"&gt;almost triple those in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, partly because there is a higher proportion of reservists, but also because their average tour of duty is a year, compared with six months for UK service people. A review of the many different studies following up &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386850/\"&gt;staff at World Trade Center&lt;/a&gt; found that those who were injured, worked on the higher floors, witnessed others falling or jumping from the buildings or whose employers were killed, were more likely to develop PTSD. But so were women, younger people, the less well-paid and those who had experienced other setbacks in the preceding years. So it&rsquo;s a complex picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d5t7l\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a myth that when children go through something traumatic they just bounce back. They too can suffer from PTSD. A review of dozens of studies of &lt;a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60051-2/abstract\"&gt;displaced children&lt;/a&gt; has tried to pin down the main factors leading to PTSD. Not surprisingly exposure to violence makes a difference, but it&rsquo;s still hard to guess who will be affected, when even the number of traumatic events they&rsquo;ve experienced doesn&rsquo;t predict whether they will develop PTSD or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as the factors putting people at risk, there are also those which contribute to resilience and protect against developing PTSD. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23551932\"&gt;Supportive family and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;can definitely make a difference. But again these factors still don&rsquo;t tell us exactly who will and won&rsquo;t be affected. Until we know more about the condition, the key is to make psychological help available if and when people do need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;page, or message us on&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

I know a lot of parents who insist that they would like their daughters to wear something different, but pink seems to hold an irresistible allure for them. But is that really true? Is it inevitable that girls are born to grow up to prefer pink? &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various studies have looked at colour preferences in different age groups. In the US most have found that babies and toddlers, whether male or female, are attracted to primary colours such as red and blue. Pink doesn&rsquo;t feature high on the list, although it is more popular than brown and grey. &nbsp;Some studies of this age group have found blue is favoured, others red, but they rarely find any gender difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c5b19\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, research conducted at Newcastle University in the UK asked &lt;a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(07)01559-X\"&gt;adults for their favourite colour&lt;/a&gt;. Did most of the women choose pink, or even red? No. The colour which came out top, for both men and women, was blue. But women, on average, rated the reddish shades more highly than the men did. The authors speculated that this was because hunter-gatherer women traditionally had the job of collecting fruit, so they might be more attuned to reddish shades of berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s not quite clear why this should influence their likes and dislikes. Perhaps it might lead to improved skills in discrimination between different shades of red, but there&rsquo;s a missing step in the logic. Since some red berries are delicious and others are poisonous, why should that make red your favourite colour? If women evolved to prefer red, this should be universal, but a study conducted last year with the Himba people in Namibia found there was &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-30151-001/\"&gt;no preference for reddish tones&lt;/a&gt; among women. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hard-wired colours?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural norms may also shape colour preferences. In cultures where pink is considered the appropriate colour for a baby girl and blue for a baby boy, babies become accustomed from birth to spending time wearing or even surrounded by, those colours. This makes it hard to know whether any preferences expressed later on are hard-wired. But a study from 2011 tried to get closer to discovering what&rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one-year-old girls and boys were shown pairs of identical objects such as bracelets, pill boxes and picture frames, but with one object pink and another of a second colour, they were &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02027.x/abstract\"&gt;no more likely to choose pink than any other colour&lt;/a&gt;. But after the age of two the girls started to like pink and, by four, boys were determined in their rejection of pink. This is the precise time when toddlers start to become aware of their gender, to talk about it and even to look around them to see what defines boy and what defines a girl. But just like adults, even very small children show biases towards their own group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group bias was also seen another study where three-to-five-year-olds were given &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16942493\"&gt;red or blue t-shirts to wear at nursery&lt;/a&gt;. For one group, the red and blue t-shirts were constantly referred to, and by the end of three weeks the children liked everything about their own colour group better. And that was just three weeks. Gender becomes a key topic of discussion from early pregnancy onwards. When we hear the news of the birth of a new baby, there&rsquo;s just one thing we want to know. Is it a boy or a girl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c5b38\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could argue that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what colour babies are exposed to the most, but it can even affect the way we, as adults, treat them. There&rsquo;s one famous study showing that women treated the exact same babies differently &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1128775?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104447047971\"&gt;depending on whether they were dressed in pink or blue&lt;/a&gt;. If the clothes were blue they assumed it was a boy, played more physical games with them and encouraged them to play with a squeaky hammer, whereas they would gently soothe the baby dressed in pink and choose a doll for them to play with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink for boys?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But what about the idea that a century ago little boys were dressed in pink and pink for girls is only a recent fashion? It seems even that might be something of a myth too. Psychology writer Christian Jarrett describes in his new book Great Myths of the Brain, how an Italian psychologist Marco Del Giudice, who &lt;a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/229437155_The_Twentieth_Century_Reversal_of_Pink-Blue_Gender_Coding_A_Scientific_Urban_Legend\"&gt;tried to find the origins of this idea&lt;/a&gt;, could find just four short magazine quotes, describing pink as the colour for boys. In two of these he believes that perhaps the blue and pink were accidentally swapped around. That seems unlikely to me, but when he searched a database of five million books printed in American or British English from 1800-2000 more convincing was the lack of any mentions of &ldquo;pink for a boy&rdquo;, even though from 1890 onwards there were increasing mentions of &ldquo;pink for a girl&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the association of pink with femininity today can backfire if it&rsquo;s not used in the right way. Pink is often used for breast cancer campaigns, but researchers at Erasmus University Rotterdam found that when &lt;a href=\"http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.413\"&gt;women were shown adverts dominated by the colour pink&lt;/a&gt;, they were in fact less likely to think they&rsquo;d contract breast cancer themselves or to donate money to a cancer charity. The authors don&rsquo;t believe this was because they hated the colour pink, but because when they were reminded of their gender so overtly, the adverts felt so personally threatening that it set off denial mechanisms. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is one way at least in which pink can be useful for both women and men. Back in 2002 researchers in Switzerland who were keen &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12026752\"&gt;to increase the response rate to surveys&lt;/a&gt;, found that printing questionnaires on coloured paper made no difference, unless the paper was pink, in which case 12% more people filled it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colours, it seems, influence our behaviour much more than we realise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hear more Medical Myths on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Check on the BBC World Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

Some swear by it to ward off a cold when they feel the first stirrings of a sore throat. Others take it once a cold is full-blown, in the hope that it will speed their recovery. Native Americans have long valued &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12808356\"&gt;echinacea for its medical properties&lt;/a&gt;, but in the 20th Century its use spread to many countries after it became popular in Germany. In today&rsquo;s health food shops &shy; you can see dozens of different kinds of preparations. The question is, does it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every couple of years a new study is published showing that echinacea either does or doesn&rsquo;t reduce your risk of contracting a cold. Part of the reason for this mixed picture is that it comes in so many forms. Of the nine different species, all from the daisy family, there are three which are often used medicinally - the pinky-purple &lt;em&gt;echinacea purpurea&lt;/em&gt;, the pale purple coneflower and the slightly shorter &lt;em&gt;echinacea angustifolia&lt;/em&gt;. To complicate things more, some preparations use the root, others the flower, the leaves or the whole plant and then it can be pressed for its juice, made into a tincture or dried and put into tablets. Different research studies use different preparations, making them hard to compare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b11cj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is even agreed on exactly which ingredients in echinacea might prevent or aid recovery from a cold, or whether it&rsquo;s the combination of ingredients that&rsquo;s crucial. Echinacea contains four types of compounds which might boost the immune system: &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17538868\"&gt;alkamides&lt;/a&gt;, glycoproteins, polysaccharides and caffeic acid derivatives, but not all these substances are found in every species of echinacea, nor in every part of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does it make a difference to your chances of contracting a cold? After years of mixed results, in 2007 &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17597571\"&gt;scientists at the University Of Connecticut in the US conducted a meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, combining and reanalysing the data from the 1600 participants in previous trials. The results seemed good news for echinacea fans, with newspapers proclaiming that supplements could halve your chances of getting a cold. The problem is that the plant is so versatile that the original studies involved not only different species of echinacea, but different parts of the plant, extracted in different ways. You could argue that this is like pooling the results of studies measuring different treatments, since chemically not every species of part of the plant is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then earlier this year came the most comprehensive review so far &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD000530/ARI_echinacea-for-preventing-and-treating-the-common-cold\"&gt;a Cochrane review that scanned the literature and included only the very best studies&lt;/a&gt;. They looked for randomised controlled studies where people were given either echinacea or a placebo and neither they nor the staff administering the preparations knew which they were getting. From the 82 trials they assessed they ended up with 24 which fulfilled the criteria, mostly from the US and Germany. Still, they weren&rsquo;t always convinced that the people wouldn&rsquo;t guess what they were taking. One trial used capsules containing vegetable oil as a placebo. Another used the manufacturers&rsquo; own staff who might be familiar with the taste of their own product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02b129q\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some studies people were given echinacea and then deliberately exposed to a cold virus to see whether they became infected. In others, people had the echinacea on hand and were instructed to start taking it the moment they felt a tickle in their throat or starting sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results were slightly disappointing for those hoping to avoid colds in the future. They found that when you looked at these well-conducted trials, none of them showed on their own that echinacea prevented colds. But on a more positive note, when they pooled the results of the best studies, giving them a much larger group of people, those who took echinacea did turn out to be less likely to get a cold, even if only 10 to 20% less likely. The authors suggest that perhaps the reason that these effects didn&rsquo;t show up in individual studies, is that they had such small numbers of people taking part in them. Of course with the pooled result there&rsquo;s still the problem that the people in different studies took different forms of echinacea. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune trigger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also need to bear in mind that these studies all excluded people with an underlying illness. Not everyone wants to boost their immune systems. A healthy immune system has been described to me as a dog on a lead that&rsquo;s out in the park. It&rsquo;s straining at the leash ready to shoot off at any moment if it can get free. You want it to keep on walking at a steady pace with you, not to break free and go rushing off too far. Similarly, you want the immune system to work reliably, but not to go too far. Auto-immune diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis involve an immune system that has become too active and organisations such as the National Institute of Health in the US &lt;a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/981.html\"&gt;advise patients with these conditions not to take echinacea&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you feel your throat getting a bit sore and fear you&rsquo;re going down with a cold, you could try taking some echinacea, but bear in mind no one yet knows exactly which kind you should take. And until they do, then on average there&rsquo;s an 80-90% chance you will still get the cold. It might make a difference, but only a small one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

When everything else is considered, more attractive people tend to earn more money and climb higher on the corporate ladder than people who are considered less pleasing on the eye. One study of MBA graduates found that there was about a 10 to 15% difference in earnings between the most and least attractive people in the group &ndash; which &lt;a href=\"http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&amp;context=chrr\"&gt;added up to about $230,000 (&pound;150,000) over a lifetime&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;You are being conferred advantages throughout your life, from your schooldays into the workplace,&rdquo; says Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jxh19\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the courts, a pleasing appearance can work its magic. Attractive defendants are likely to get more lenient sentences, or to escape conviction entirely; attractive plaintiffs, meanwhile, are more likely to win their case and get bigger financial settlements. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pervasive effect,&rdquo; says Walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if beauty pays in most circumstances, there are still situations where it can backfire. While attractive men may be considered better leaders, for instance, implicit sexist prejudices can work against attractive women, &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/zfp/220/2/98/\"&gt;making them less likely to be hired for high-level jobs&lt;/a&gt; that require authority. (If you want Hollywood&rsquo;s take on this truism, Frevert and Walker suggest that you look no further than Reese Witherspoon&rsquo;s Legally Blonde.) And as you might expect, good-looking people of both genders run into jealousy &ndash; one study found that if you are interviewed by someone of the same sex, they may be less likely to &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311000123X\"&gt;recruit you&lt;/a&gt; if they judge that you are more attractive than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jxh7g\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More worryingly, being beautiful or handsome could harm your medical care. We tend to link good looks to health, meaning that illnesses are often taken less seriously when they affect the good-looking. When treating people for pain, for instance, doctors tend to take less care over the more attractive people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the bubble of beauty can be a somewhat lonely place. One study in 1975, for instance, found that people tend to move further away from a beautiful woman on the pathway &ndash; perhaps as a mark of respect, but still making interaction more distant. &ldquo;Attractiveness can convey more power over visible space &ndash; but that in turn can make others feel they can&rsquo;t approach that person,&rdquo; says Frevert. Interestingly, the online dating website OKCupid recently reported that people with the most flawlessly beautiful profile pictures are less likely to find dates than those with &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31168242\"&gt;quirkier, less perfect pics&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; perhaps because the prospective dates are less intimidated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jxgwy\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, as you might have guessed, being beautiful is not a passport to certain happiness &ndash; though it helps.

As the writer Dorothy Parker put it so elegantly: &ldquo;Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes clean to the bone.&rdquo;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"559a52610b808738c4e262a1"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Science &amp; Environment","Name":"Science &amp; Environment","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Science &amp; Environment"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:45.984509Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"1aa4ccec-87b5-44b8-b5af-c553debaf6f6","Id":"wwfuture/section/science-environment","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:51:20.083392Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/science-environment"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/science-environment","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262dc"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262db"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-13T10:25:32Z","HeadlineLong":"The surprising downsides of being drop dead gorgeous","HeadlineShort":"The downsides of being beautiful","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Good looks can get you far in life, but psychologists say there are unrecognised pitfalls for the beautiful.

Like a witch doctor&rsquo;s spell, their words might be spreading modern plagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have long known that expectations of a malady can be as dangerous as a virus. In the same way that voodoo shamans could harm their victims through the power of suggestion, priming someone to think they are ill can often produce the actual symptoms of a disease. Vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and even death, could be triggered through belief alone. It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;nocebo effect&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is now becoming clear just how easily those dangerous beliefs can spread through gossip and hearsay &ndash; with potent effect. It may be the reason why certain houses seem cursed with illness, and why people living near wind turbines report puzzling outbreaks of &lt;a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wind-turbine-syndrome-blamed-mysterious-symptoms-cape-cod/story?id=20591168\"&gt;dizziness, insomnia and vomiting&lt;/a&gt;. If you have ever felt &ldquo;fluey&rdquo; after a vaccination, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/29/electrosensitivity-is-technology-killing-us\"&gt;believed your cell phone was giving you a headache&lt;/a&gt;, or suffered an inexplicable food allergy, you may have also fallen victim to a nocebo jinx. &ldquo;The nocebo effect shows the brain&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; says Dimos Mitsikostas, from Athens Naval Hospital in Greece. &ldquo;And we cannot fully explain it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A killer joke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that beliefs can be deadly &ndash; as demonstrated by a rather nasty student prank that went horribly wrong. The 18th Century Viennese medic, Erich Menninger von Lerchenthal, describes how students at his medical school picked on a much-disliked assistant. Planning to teach him a lesson, they sprung upon him before announcing that he was about to be decapitated. Blindfolding him, they bowed his head onto the chopping block, before dropping a wet cloth on his neck. Convinced it was the kiss of a steel blade, the poor man &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0091743597902280/1-s2.0-S0091743597902280-main.pdf?_tid=629508a2-ad24-11e4-91aa-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423133431_417644834766d9ed139dcb89374277fb\"&gt;died on the spot&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrtf\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While anecdotes like this abound, modern researchers had mostly focused on the mind&rsquo;s ability to heal, not harm &ndash; the &ldquo;placebo effect&rdquo;, from the Latin for &ldquo;I will please&rdquo;. Every clinical trial now randomly assigns patients to either a real drug, or a placebo in the form of an inert pill. The patient doesn&rsquo;t know which they are taking, and even those taking the inert drug tend to show some improvement &ndash; thanks to their faith in the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet alongside the benefits, people taking placebos often report puzzling side effects &ndash; nausea, headaches, or pain &ndash; that are unlikely to come from an inert tablet. The problem is that people in a clinical trial are given exactly the same health warnings whether they are taking the real drug or the placebo &ndash; and somehow, the expectation of the symptoms can produce physical manifestations in some placebo takers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it,&rdquo; says Ted Kaptchuk at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqryx\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, doctors have shown that this nocebo effect &ndash; Latin for &ldquo;I will harm&rdquo; &ndash; is very common. Reviewing the literature, Mitsikostas has so far documented strong nocebo effects in many treatments for headache, multiple sclerosis, and depression. In &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23145482\"&gt;trials for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease&lt;/a&gt;, as many as 65% report adverse events as a result of their placebo. &ldquo;And around one out of 10 treated will drop out of a trial because of nocebo, which is pretty high,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many of the side-effects are somewhat subjective &ndash; like nausea or pain &ndash; nocebo responses do occasionally show up as rashes and skin complaints, and they are sometimes detectable on physiological tests too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable &ndash; they are taking sugar pills and when you measure liver enzymes, they are elevated,&rdquo; says Mitsikostas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those who think these side effects are somehow &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; willed or imagined, measures of nerve activity following nocebo treatment have shown that the spinal cord begins &lt;a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/34/13784.long\"&gt;responding to heightened pain&lt;/a&gt; before conscious deliberation would even be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs10\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the near fatal case of &ldquo;Mr A&rdquo;, reported by doctor Roy Reeves in 2007. Mr A was suffering from depression when he consumed a whole bottle of pills. Regretting his decision, Mr A rushed to ER, and promptly collapsed at reception. It looked serious; his blood pressure had plummeted, and he was hyperventilating; he was immediately given intravenous fluids. Yet blood tests could find no trace of the drug in his system. Four hours later, another doctor arrived to inform Reeves that the man had been in the placebo arm of a drugs trial; &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834307000114\"&gt;he had &ldquo;overdosed&rdquo; on sugar tablets&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing the news, the relieved Mr A soon recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can never know whether the nocebo effect would have actually killed Mr A, though Fabrizio Benedetti at the University of Turin Medical School thinks it is certainly possible. He has scanned subjects&rsquo; brains as they undergo nocebo suggestions, which seems to set off a chain of activation in the hypothalamus, and the pituitary and adrenal glands &ndash; areas that deal with extreme threats to our body. If your fear and belief were strong enough, the resulting cocktail of hormones could be deadly, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sick rumours&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The thought that your doctor could inadvertently make you sicker is concerning enough. But more recently, it has become clear just how little is needed to spread the nocebo effect. Even just passing gossip and hearsay can prime your mind for illness with potent effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs30\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, for instance, Benedetti offered to take &lt;a href=\"http://hcpportalco20140430.pfizer.edrupalgardens.com/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/2014_155_5_Nocebo-and-placebo-modulation-of-hypobaric-hypoxia-headache-involves-the-cyclooxygenase-prostaglandins-pathway.pdf\"&gt;more than 100 students up the Italian Alps&lt;/a&gt; to an altitude of 3000m (9800ft). A few days beforehand, he had told just one of them about a possible consequence &ndash; that the thin air could bring on a migraine. By the day of the trip, he found that the gossip had spread to more than a quarter of the group &ndash; and those who had heard the rumour began to suffer the worst headaches. What&rsquo;s more, a study of their saliva showed an exaggerated response to the low oxygen conditions, including a proliferation of the enzymes that are associated with altitude headache. &ldquo;The brain biochemistry changed in the &lsquo;socially infected&rsquo; individuals,&rdquo; says Benedetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, harmful beliefs, that transmit illness, could be catching. &ldquo;Negative expectations can be communicated to your friends, neighbours, and the like, and they spread very quickly, producing social nocebo effects in a large population of subjects,&rdquo; says Benedetti. Indeed, another study found that simply seeing another patient suffering pain can &lt;a href=\"http://www.pfizerpro.com.co/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/08013%20V154I8-Responding-to-nocebos-through-observation-Social-contagion-of-negative-emotions_1165_1165.pdf\"&gt;make a treatment hurt more&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; suggesting nocebo could pass from person to person by silent observation. Even more worryingly, you might not need to be &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15959.short\"&gt;conscious of those thoughts to be affected&lt;/a&gt;; the nocebo can apparently be triggered by subliminal cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs5m\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History is full of mysterious outbreaks that might have arisen in this way. Most famous is the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Plague_of_1518\"&gt;deadly dancing plague of 1518&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in the 1960s, there was the mysterious &ldquo;June Bug&rdquo; epidemic in an American textile factory, which brought about dizziness and vomiting, despite the fact that none of the poisonous insects thought to be responsible could ever be identified. The most chilling was the spate of mysterious deaths within the community of Hmong people who arrived in the US from southeast Asia in the 1980s &ndash; young men, with no existing illness, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/09/the-dark-side-of-the-placebo-effect-when-intense-belief-kills/245065/\"&gt;who began dying in their sleep after periods of nightmares and sleep paralysis&lt;/a&gt;; experts have speculated that it arose from a strong cultural belief in deadly night spirits. Often, fear of new technology seems to be responsible: in the late 19th Century, early telephone users reported giddiness and wracking pain after using the new contraption, for instance, while Scandinavian workers in the 1980s developed surprising rashes, apparently from their computer monitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the nocebo is perhaps most visible in such controversial disorders as &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2014;volume=16;issue=69;spage=116;epage=122;aulast=Rubin\"&gt;wind turbine syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; (sickness and insomnia from wind farms, most common in Canada) and &ldquo;electro-sensitivity&rdquo; &ndash; an allergic reaction to mobile phone signals and wi-fi. Some sufferers even resort to sleeping in metal cocoons to avoid the constant ringing in their ears. Yet dozens of experiments have shown that people are just as likely to report the same symptoms when they are exposed to a sham transmitter that doesn&rsquo;t actually emit any electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrx1\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If work on the nocebo tells us anything, it is that we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the distress of their condition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no doubt in my mind &ndash; people are genuinely experiencing physical symptoms,&rdquo; says James Rubin at King&rsquo;s College London. Even the former head of the World Health Organisation was affected: she &lt;a href=\"http://microwavenews.com/short-takes-archive/brundtland-now-using-cell-phone\"&gt;banned cell phones in her office&lt;/a&gt;, because she thought that they gave her splitting headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears of electro-sensitivity are relatively rare, but there are many other ways a nocebo belief could have taken a hold of your health. Perhaps you suffer from a mysterious food intolerance, for instance. In England, 20% of people claim to be unable to stomach certain foods &ndash; yet hospital tests of the actual digestion suggest that only about a tenth of that number of people have a real problem. The nocebo may also explain why people apparently develop sickness after an inert vaccine, and it may shed light on &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001078241000363X\"&gt;the oft-discussed side-effects of the contraceptive pill&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; such as depression, headache, and breast pain&ndash; which scientific trails have mostly failed to confirm. Expectation of illness may also lie behind the sickness and &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118898/\"&gt;eye-strain apparently created by 3D TVs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrxt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be done? It is notoriously difficult to neutralise long-held beliefs, but responsible media reporting would at least stem the spread of poisonous rumours. In 2013, Rubin found that simply showing a short video on electro-sensitivity was enough to trigger later symptoms &ndash; and the evidence seems to show that outbreaks of &ldquo;wind turbine syndrome&rdquo; follow local media reports. In other words, the health scares themselves are actually making people ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about doctors themselves? Rebecca Wells at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina points out that it&rsquo;s a major dilemma for modern medicine. Doctors are obliged to be honest about a drug&rsquo;s side effects &ndash; they need to gain &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; &ndash; but that is a &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352765/\"&gt;fuzzy concept when the information itself could make someone sicker&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;There is no hard and fast truth of what a medicine does,&rdquo; Wells says. In the future, she thinks doctors may need to develop new procedures to decide which facts to divulge and the way they frame that information. Due care is crucial in each case &ndash; as Benedetti points out, the contagious nature of the nocebo means that a single person&rsquo;s side-effects could soon spread to a much larger group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More positively, education itself may help sap the nocebo effect of its power. Mitsikostas, for instance, tries to explain to his patients that they have to be wary of their own expectations. &ldquo;We have to make the patient understand that it&rsquo;s an internal fear that we both have to try to fight,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind-body connection, he says, is something that we can ill afford to ignore, despite our amazing new medical tools. &ldquo;For millennia, medicine was basically placebo &ndash; by using expectation, magicians used the will to heal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is not enough to overcome disease &ndash; but it is indispensable.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-11T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The contagious thought that could kill you ","HeadlineShort":"The thought that could kill you","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly catch such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly catch such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","SummaryShort":"Deadly if you believe it  and contagious","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-11T02:42:14Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"501b5d72-b021-4ba6-a02e-84fcc597b84f","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-11T02:42:14Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death","_id":"559a564b0b808738c4e2fad2"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;It was no ordinary honeymoon. After boarding their flight in Canada on the evening of 23 August 2001, newlyweds Margaret McKinnon and her husband were heading for Lisbon, Portugal. As Air Transat flight 236 soared over the mid-Atlantic, McKinnon went to the lavatory. Nothing inside it was working. &ldquo;It seemed odd,&rdquo; she says, but she didn't think a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to her seat, the crew served breakfast, but then announced that they would be making an emergency landing. She remembers thinking it seemed early to be arriving in Lisbon. &ldquo;I didn't really understand at the time what that meant,&rdquo; she says. She soon found out. Crew instructed passengers to put on their life jackets. The lights flickered, then extinguished. The cabin depressurised. Oxygen masks deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plane&rsquo;s systems had shut down after a catastrophic leakage of fuel. &ldquo;They were shouting that we would be ditching into the ocean,&rdquo; McKinnon recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a half hour of preparing for the worst, McKinnon recalls somebody yelling that they&rsquo;d made it to land. It was the Azores, an isolated archipelago some 850 miles (1,360km) off the Portuguese coast. The pilots had established contact with Lajes, a joint military-civilian air base. Following a harrowing 360 degree spin and several sharp turns to reduce altitude, the crew shouted &ldquo;brace, brace, brace&rdquo; as the officers brought the plane to a bumpy landing. Fires licked across the plane&rsquo;s wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgwj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stunned passengers and crew descended escape slides and ran across a field to a safe distance, towards American soldiers with guns. Two serious and 16 minor injuries were sustained during evacuation down the chutes, but all 293 passengers and 13 crew survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for many the flight didn&rsquo;t end there. For some &ndash; including McKinnon &ndash; the terrifying experience replayed vividly as intrusive memories and nightmares in the months that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience inspired McKinnon, now a clinical psychologist, to study what trauma does to the brain &ndash; how it changes what we remember and why some people experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In recent years, she and a number of other researchers have been trying to understand what makes fearful experiences seem to become imprinted so deeply in our brains. And if they can understand why trauma has such a profound and lasting effect on us, perhaps they can find ways to help people cope better with the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fearful imprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between fear and memory has intrigued researchers and clinicians for decades. Yet the data is conflicting. &ldquo;Some studies have found that during the recollection of traumatic events, recollection is enhanced. It's very vivid, people recall many details, and people don't seem to have difficulty remembering,&rdquo; says McKinnon. Other studies have found that recollection of traumatic events can be very impoverished and fragmented, with &ldquo;a detail here, a detail there, that don't really fit together&rdquo;, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgp8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few studies have looked at memory during the experience of trauma itself, especially for a single, shared event. So McKinnon decided to delve into the memories of her fellow passengers on Air Transat flight 236.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We wanted to take this opportunity to look at a very &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; circumstance, so to speak,&rdquo; says McKinnon, suppressing an awkward laugh at using &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; to describe AT 236&rsquo;s emergency descent. McKinnon and collaborators examined the memories for 15 passengers on the flight, comparing their recollection of three events: the flight itself, an emotionally neutral event from the same year, and their experience during 9/11, the following month. Six of those interviewed exhibited PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers guided subjects&rsquo; memories by saying &ldquo;tell me everything you can remember about the event&rdquo;, and then further aided retrieval with cues like &ldquo;what were you thinking, what were you feeling, and what was the lighting like in the cabin?&rdquo; These detailed recollections were compared with the known sequence of events, and a control group who had suffered less traumatic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was that all passengers, regardless of whether they went on to develop PTSD, had vivid and enhanced recollections of the incident, supporting the idea that fear changes how the brain stores memories. In those that subsequently developed PTSD, &ldquo;they showed a lot of recollection of extraneous details, not only of the traumatic event, but also for the events of September 11, as well as from the neutral memory from the same time period&rdquo;, says McKinnon. It suggests that these individuals have difficulty editing what they recollect, or fading the contents of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinnon admits that her study represents a small sample, and is cautious about generalising the results, but they are nevertheless intriguing. &ldquo;Understandably, people were reluctant to participate,&rdquo; says McKinnon. &ldquo;And we are very, very grateful to the people who did participate, because it can be difficult to talk about these kinds of things.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgvy\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if traumatic memories are more vivid, what&rsquo;s going on inside our heads when they are &lsquo;made&rsquo;? There are multiple memory systems in the brain. We have physical memories, like how we learn to ride a bike. We have auditory memories for singing songs. And we have more specific &ldquo;declarative&rdquo; memory systems heavily involving the hippocampus. The hippocampus stores memory for things like where we parked our car, and that two plus two is four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fear activates a different system: our body&rsquo;s emergency control centre &ndash; the &lt;a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_04/d_04_cr/d_04_cr_peu/d_04_cr_peu.html\"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt;. The amygdala, a pair of almond-shaped structures on the left and right of the brain&rsquo;s medial temporal lobe, is particularly involved in emotional memories like fear, but also in pleasurable memories associated with food, sex, or recreational drug use. When a memory is particularly striking and unexpected, it activates this emotional memory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be partly why there are a plethora of anecdotes about how sensory cues, out of context, can take you right back to emotional memories &ndash; perhaps you associate the scent of a certain perfume or cologne with your first kiss because the memory is higher fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgyp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a fearful experience, our survival systems kick into action, and we can achieve what&rsquo;s known as a single trial memory. &ldquo;If you escape from a lion once, or you see someone else being eaten by a lion, you know to be afraid of that lion,&rdquo; explains Kerry Ressler, a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. That's very different from something like studying facts in a book, and activities that aren&rsquo;t emotionally arousing. &ldquo;That may make sense evolutionarily, because we want to prioritise things that are really important,&rdquo; explains Ressler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fear system has evolved to keep us alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we feel fear, a burst of adrenaline activates a cascade that is thought to enhance memory storage of the immediately preceding events. &ldquo;The fear system has evolved to keep us alive,&rdquo; says Karim Nader, a psychology professor at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashbulb memories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fearful experiences may not always lay down strong memories, however. Elizabeth Phelps, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, was interested in people&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;flashbulb memories&rdquo; of 9/11. These are not individuals with PTSD, &ldquo;but everyday people who had experienced 9/11, which was most of us&rdquo;, says Phelps. And curiously, she found that, vivid as these memories feel, they were not as strong as people believed &ndash; they could be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgy8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phelps&rsquo; lab at NYU was near the thick of the disaster. In a large-scale detailed survey conducted first within a few weeks of 9/11, then one year, two years, and 10 years later, they found that &ldquo;people were very confident that the details of their memory were correct&rdquo;. Not the detail in terms of the fact that it happened, but where they were, who they were with, how they first heard about it, and what they did afterwards. However, personal recollections of the contextual details often actually changed with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests, says Phelps, that flashbulb memories differ from memories of more neutral events not because the details of the memory are preserved any better, but because we think they are. &ldquo;With highly traumatic events we think we have this incredibly accurate memory,&rdquo; she says. The truth is, many of the details we think are accurate are not. &ldquo;Emotion focuses your attention on a few details, at the expense of a lot of others,&rdquo; explains Phelps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total recall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So, could this mean that &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/partial-recall\"&gt;traumatic memories can be manipulated, even removed&lt;/a&gt;? Based on an emerging understanding of the storage and retrieval of memory, we have windows of opportunity for altering the closure of fearful memories in the brain. The time window for dampening the initial locking-in of memories, explains Nader, is on the order of 6 hours. So pharmacological approaches to lessen the strength with which a distressing memory is locked into the brain need to be administered within that short window. Indeed, there is emerging evidence from rodent and human studies that drugs called beta-blockers can achieve a reduction in later PTSD symptoms if administered quickly. &ldquo;The Israeli military now use that,&rdquo; says Nader. But new research is suggesting that even beyond the short window during which memories are saved to the internal hard drive of our brain, they can be retrieved, updated, and toned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jchfv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with rats, Nader reminded animals of a conditioned fearful memory with a musical tone (previously linked to an electric shock), and subsequently administered a beta-blocker. Even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, the fearful freezing response to the memory was gone. Exploring the same approach in a small sample of humans, Nader and colleagues determined that despite an average of 11 years between trauma and experimental intervention, &ldquo;even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, their trauma was down to non-PTSD levels&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s still early days for this method, and studies of its efficacy are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, by using what we know about reconsolidation as a potential therapeutic tool, it seems that a subtle form of memory reprogramming is within reach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not changing your knowledge of what happened. We&rsquo;re just changing its association with these fight or flight stress responses that we get&rdquo;, says Phelps. &ldquo;So the notion that we&rsquo;re going to be able to erase your knowledge of what happened &ndash; that&rsquo;s science fiction at this point.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Departure points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As for McKinnon, she admits that despite her vividly traumatic experience, there are many details she can&rsquo;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We were over the top of the island and then the plane veered back over the ocean, which was incredibly scary, because then we thought &lsquo;that was it&rsquo;,&rdquo; says McKinnon, recalling the moment that AT 236 approached the Lajes landing strip. She remembers seeing the tops of houses, and worrying about crashing there and killing other people. But asked if the plane was in darkness during its terrifying descent, McKinnon says, &ldquo;I have to be honest with you &ndash; I entirely don't remember.&rdquo; Nor can she remember whether or not she was sitting beside the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to terrifying memories, perhaps our brains are selective in what details are stored. The more we learn about how and why, the closer we&rsquo;ll get to lessening the impact of trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fated honeymoon flight was an eventful way to begin a marriage. &ldquo;It was quite a start, yes,&rdquo; McKinnon laughs. &ldquo;Unexpected.&rdquo; It proved to be a life-changing year in more than one way: making her aware of the need for research, but also for better care and treatment for PTSD, she says. &ldquo;And that was the direction I wanted to take my career in.&rdquo; McKinnon&rsquo;s experience that day was the start of an unforeseen new personal and scientific journey. As time goes by, the memory may be harder to remember, but the legacy is hard to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How extreme fear shapes what we remember","HeadlineShort":"How extreme fear shapes the brain","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Many of us will experience a significant trauma in our lives, says Lesley Evans Ogden.

If we get caught red-handed, we experience shame and regret. And we tend to frown upon others when they do it in public. I'm talking, of course, about reaching up into your nostrils with a finger in an effort to scrape out snot. Is nose-picking really all that bad? How prevalent or bad is it, really? And why (really, &lt;em&gt;why?&lt;/em&gt;) would anybody ever decide to see what snot tastes like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The formal medical term used to describe the act of picking one's nose is &ldquo;rhinotillexomania&rdquo;. The first &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7852253\"&gt;systematic scientific study&lt;/a&gt; of the phenomenon may have been undertaken as recently as 1995, by a pair of US researchers named Thompson and Jefferson. They sent a survey by mail to 1,000 adult residents of Dane County, Wisconsin. Of the 254 that responded, a whopping 91% of their respondents confessed to picking their noses, while only 1.2% could admit to doing it at least once each hour. Two subjects indicated that their nasal mining habits interfered with their daily lives (moderately to markedly). And, to their surprise, two other people reported so much nose picking that they had actually picked a hole right trough their nasal septum, the thin tissue that separates the left and right nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j4g83\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a perfect study; only about a quarter of those surveyed responded, and those who already had a personal interest in nose picking may have been more likely to complete and return the survey. Still, it underscored the likelihood that nose picking, despite its cultural taboos, is pretty widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young habit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, doctors Chittaranjan Andrade and BS Srihari of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bangalore, India, decided to look a little deeper into nose-picking. They reasoned that most habitual behaviours are more common among kids and teenagers than among adults, so it made sense to survey younger populations rather than older populations, to get a sense for how prevalent nose picking might be. In addition, knowing that the Wisconsin study suffered from a possible response bias, they distributed their surveys in school classrooms, where they would have a much higher likelihood of getting a representative sample. They focused on four schools within Bangalore, one catering to children from families of lower socioeconomic status (SES), two whose students tended to come from middle-class families, and a fourth school where students came from higher-earning households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, Andrade and Srihari compiled data from 200 teenagers. Nearly all of them admitted to picking their noses, on average four times per day. That's not all that enlightening; we knew this. But what are interesting are the patterns. Only 7.6% of students reported sticking their fingers into their noses more than 20 times each day, but nearly 20% thought they had a &ldquo;serious nose-picking problem&rdquo;. Most of them said they did it to relieve an itch or to clear out nasal debris, but 24 of them, i.e. 12%, admitted that they picked their nose because it felt good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j4fq1\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it wasn't just fingers. A total of 13 students said they used tweezers to pick their noses, and nine said they used pencils. Nine of them &ndash; nine! &ndash; admitted to eating the treasures obtained from their nose picking activities. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no differences according to socioeconomic class; nose picking is something that truly unites us all. There were, however, some gender differences. Boys were more likely to do it, while girls were more likely to think it a bad habit. Boys were also statistically more likely to have additional bad habits, like biting their nails (onychophagia) or pulling out their hair (trichotillomania).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facial mutilation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Nose picking isn&rsquo;t just a harmless activity, though. In some extreme cases, nose-picking can cause, or be related to, more serious problems, as Andrade and Srihari found when they reviewed the medical literature. In one case, surgeons could not achieve complete, lasting closure of a perforated nasal septum because a patient couldn&rsquo;t stop nose picking, preventing the surgical site from healing. Then there was a 53-year-old woman whose &lt;a href=\"http://www.ajnr.org/content/18/10/1949.full.pdf\"&gt;chronic nose picking&lt;/a&gt; not only led to a perforation of her nasal septum; she actually carved a hole into her sinus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j4ght\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there was a 29-year-old man who had a previously undocumented convergence of trichotillomania (hair-plucking) and rhinotillexomania (nose-picking). It forced his doctors to coin a new term: &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0447.2002.01463.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=true\"&gt;rhinotrichotillomania&lt;/a&gt;. His behaviour involved compulsively pulling out his nose hairs. When his hair pulling got too extreme, his nose would become inflamed. To treat the inflammation, he began applying a solution that had the side effect of staining his nose purple. To his surprise, the purple stain concealed his visible nose hairs, making him far more relaxed. He was actually more comfortable leaving the house with a purple nose than with visible nose hairs. His doctors, who succeeded in treating him with drugs, describe his compulsion as a manifestation of body dysmorphic disorder, which is sometimes thought of as an \"obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nose for danger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Most of us can rest safe knowing that our occasional, discreet nose picking is probably not the pathological variety. It's interesting that despite the fact that nail-biting and nose-hair plucking are well-recognised manifestations of &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-3083.1998.tb00761.x/abstract\"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, rhinotillexomania is generally not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean it's completely safe. In a &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/506401\"&gt;2006 study&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Dutch researchers found that nose picking can help bacterial infections get around. They discovered that nose pickers at an ear, nose, and throat clinic were more likely to carry &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; bacteria in their noses than non-pickers. Among healthy volunteers, they found something similar: a positive correlation between self-reported nose-picking frequency and both the frequency with which their nasal cultures housed the nasty beasties, and the amount of &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; present in those cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j4ftt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, given all these risks, and the potential for provoking disgust in other people, why do we still do it? There are no clear answers, but as &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140710-why-do-we-bite-our-nails\"&gt;Tom Stafford wrote recently about nail-biting&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps it&rsquo;s a combination of the simple satisfaction we derive from &lsquo;tidying-up&rsquo; and the fact that our nose is within easy reach all the time &ndash; in other words, we pick it &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s there&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps nose picking is just evidence of laziness. Fingers, after all, are never in short supply when you feel the urge to clear your nostrils. Which is more than can be said about a box of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's gratifying to know that some researchers are still trying to understand the reasons we pick our noses and the consequences that arise from it. In 2001, the Indian researchers, Andrade and Srihari, were recognised for their work with an &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/19/research.highereducation\"&gt;Ig Nobel&lt;/a&gt; prize, which is given for research that first makes you laugh and then makes you think. At the ceremony, Andrade remarked, \"some people poke their nose into other people's business. I made it my business to poke my business into other people's noses.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20150106-how-to-nap-like-a-pro&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2g%2Fdj%2Fp02gdj02.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-02T10:19:33Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we pick our nose?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we pick our nose?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Poking around inside our nostrils is disgusting, unhygienic and potentially harmful, so its baffling that its as common as it is, says Jason G Goldman.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Poking around inside our nostrils is disgusting, unhygienic and potentially harmful, so its baffling that its as common as it is, says Jason G Goldman.","SummaryShort":"The science of a terrible habit","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-02T10:19:33Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"48960bab-318e-4870-93f0-a2ffb4c36183","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150202-why-do-we-pick-our-nose","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-02T10:19:33Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150202-why-do-we-pick-our-nose"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150202-why-do-we-pick-our-nose","_id":"559a564a0b808738c4e2fac0"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How your eyes trick your mind","HeadlineShort":"How your eyes trick your mind","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Look closer at optical illusions, says Melissa Hogenboom, and they can reveal how you truly perceive reality","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":null,"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Look closer at optical illusions, says Melissa Hogenboom, and they can reveal how you truly perceive reality.","SummaryShort":"Why your idea of reality is wrong","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-02T21:42:31Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"8697edf8-2583-4ba1-92ac-bb1d0fb527e1","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150130-how-your-eyes-trick-your-mind","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-02T21:42:31Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150130-how-your-eyes-trick-your-mind"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150130-how-your-eyes-trick-your-mind","_id":"559a564a0b808738c4e2fab8"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;Many people buy diet drinks and sweeteners in a bid to reduce the amount of sugar they consume. Over the years concerns about their safety have been raised, but how much evidence is there that they&rsquo;re bad for us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspartame is probably the best-known artificial sweetener and the one that&rsquo;s had the worst press. It&rsquo;s an alternative to sugar, created from aspartic acid and phenylalanine. In 1996 a paper suggested that the increase in brain tumours &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8939194\"&gt;might be linked to a rise in the popularity of aspartame&lt;/a&gt;. Fears continued, and other types of cancer began to be mentioned. There was so much concern that a vast study of almost half a million people was conducted by the US National Cancer Institute &lt;a href=\"http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/docs/aspartame.pdf\"&gt;and published in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. It found no increase in the risk of brain cancer, leukaemia or lymphoma in people who consumed aspartame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise when the European Food Safety Authority conducted the most comprehensive review of the evidence to date, they concluded that &lt;a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/3496.pdf\"&gt;at the recommended levels&lt;/a&gt; (40mg a day per kilogram of body weight) it was safe, even for children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooth protector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have caused problems is that so little aspartame enters our blood system; it&rsquo;s quickly broken down into by-products. But there is one exception. People with a rare genetic disorder called phenylketonuria or PKU can&rsquo;t break down phenylalanine, one of aspartame&rsquo;s by-products  for them, it isn&rsquo;t safe. This is why sweeteners for people to add at the table or to hot drinks are clearly labelled with a warning that they contain a source of phenylalanine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sweeteners do come with side-effects, however. If you&rsquo;ve ever eaten too many sugar-free mints containing xylitol then you might have experienced this for yourself. Xylitol is a type of carbohydrate made from birch and other hardwood trees. It contains 30% fewer calories than sugar and doesn&rsquo;t seem to leave an aftertaste, but if you consume large amounts, it can cause water retention, resulting in diarrhoea. But there is evidence exciting some dentists that it can help prevent tooth decay. Chewing gum or mints sweetened with xylitol has been show to &lt;a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2266.pdf\"&gt;neutralise plaque acidity on the teeth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hqch1\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest kid on the block is a sweetener that comes from the stevia plant, except that it isn&rsquo;t really that new. In Paraguay and Brazil stevia has been used medicinally for centuries. It&rsquo;s calorie-free and 300 times sweeter than sugar. In Japan it&rsquo;s been sold as a sweetener for more than four decades. Native to tropical and sub-tropical areas of South and Latin America, sweet compounds called steviol glycosides are extracted from the leaves of the plant by steeping them in water. These compounds pass through the body without being absorbed. Stevia was approved at a food additive in the US in 2008 and in Europe in 2011. The downside is that some find it has a bitter aniseed-like aftertaste and for this reason it&rsquo;s often mixed with artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are steviol glysocides safe? The European Food Safety Authority thinks so after they conducted an analysis of all the available evidence done on &lt;a href=\"http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/sweeteners.htm#efsa_activities\"&gt;both humans and animals in 2010&lt;/a&gt;. They concluded these compounds don&rsquo;t cause cancer, are not toxic and are safe for children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great hope is that it helps people to satisfy their sweet tooth without putting on weight or developing diabetes, yet sweeteners have been available for some time and don&rsquo;t seem to have halted the obesity crisis so far. Scientists still don&rsquo;t know whether there are consequences when the brain registers the sweet taste, but then doesn&rsquo;t get the hit of sugar it expects. The worry is that the sweetness might somehow trick the body into releasing too much insulin, something which could lead to weight gain in the long run. It&rsquo;s not possible to say yet whether this is happening. But the European Food Safety Authority has concluded there&rsquo;s not enough evidence to say that stevia helps to achieve or maintain a healthy body weight.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glucose intolerance&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeteners don&rsquo;t seem to deserve their poor reputation, it would appear. But just as it seemed that the evidence was clear, this year some curious new research from Israel was published, suggesting that far from helping to prevent Type 2 diabetes, the artificial sweeteners aspartame, saccharin and sucralose might contribute to it. Healthy mice were given drinking water with one of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7521/full/nature13793.html\"&gt;these three sweeteners added to it&lt;/a&gt;. When they measured their blood glucose levels they found that the mice who had consumed sweeteners were showing glucose intolerance, something associated with Type 2 diabetes, while the mice which drank plain water or water containing ordinary sugar didn&rsquo;t. The reason appeared to lie in the bacteria found in the gut; if they had consumed sweeteners their gut bacteria was changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from mice can&rsquo;t always be extrapolated to people and the usual diet of a mouse is of course very different from ours. But for the second part of their study the researchers used humans, feeding them the maximum daily allowance of saccharin, the equivalent of 40 cans of a typical diet drink. Within five days just over half the people showed some intolerance to glucose. Intriguingly those that did had different gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hqc7k\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the researchers took it a step further, carrying out faecal transplants where faeces are passed from one person or animal to another. In this case they took the faeces from the humans and put them in the mice. The humans with glucose intolerance passed it on to the mice, suggesting these bacteria in the gut are the key. But before we decide that sweeteners are harmful after all, this is just a single study conducted mainly on mice, with just seven humans taking part. Even the researchers concede that more research is needed. This study tells us nothing about the long-term impact of sweeteners in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 a vast study covering more than 300,000 people in eight European countries found no link between the development of Type 2 diabetes and eating or drinking artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one lesson from all these studies and that&rsquo;s that there is no one category of &ldquo;sweeteners&rdquo; which are good or bad. Each is very different and needs to be researched and considered separately. Considering all this evidence, it seems to be far too soon to reach for the sugary drinks instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Google+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

After boarding their flight in Canada on the evening of 23 August 2001, newlyweds Margaret McKinnon and her husband were heading for Lisbon, Portugal. As Air Transat flight 236 soared over the mid-Atlantic, McKinnon went to the lavatory. Nothing inside it was working. &ldquo;It seemed odd,&rdquo; she says, but she didn't think a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to her seat, the crew served breakfast, but then announced that they would be making an emergency landing. She remembers thinking it seemed early to be arriving in Lisbon. &ldquo;I didn't really understand at the time what that meant,&rdquo; she says. She soon found out. Crew instructed passengers to put on their life jackets. The lights flickered, then extinguished. The cabin depressurised. Oxygen masks deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plane&rsquo;s systems had shut down after a catastrophic leakage of fuel. &ldquo;They were shouting that we would be ditching into the ocean,&rdquo; McKinnon recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a half hour of preparing for the worst, McKinnon recalls somebody yelling that they&rsquo;d made it to land. It was the Azores, an isolated archipelago some 850 miles (1,360km) off the Portuguese coast. The pilots had established contact with Lajes, a joint military-civilian air base. Following a harrowing 360 degree spin and several sharp turns to reduce altitude, the crew shouted &ldquo;brace, brace, brace&rdquo; as the officers brought the plane to a bumpy landing. Fires licked across the plane&rsquo;s wheels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgwj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stunned passengers and crew descended escape slides and ran across a field to a safe distance, towards American soldiers with guns. Two serious and 16 minor injuries were sustained during evacuation down the chutes, but all 293 passengers and 13 crew survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for many the flight didn&rsquo;t end there. For some &ndash; including McKinnon &ndash; the terrifying experience replayed vividly as intrusive memories and nightmares in the months that followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience inspired McKinnon, now a clinical psychologist, to study what trauma does to the brain &ndash; how it changes what we remember and why some people experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In recent years, she and a number of other researchers have been trying to understand what makes fearful experiences seem to become imprinted so deeply in our brains. And if they can understand why trauma has such a profound and lasting effect on us, perhaps they can find ways to help people cope better with the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fearful imprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between fear and memory has intrigued researchers and clinicians for decades. Yet the data is conflicting. &ldquo;Some studies have found that during the recollection of traumatic events, recollection is enhanced. It's very vivid, people recall many details, and people don't seem to have difficulty remembering,&rdquo; says McKinnon. Other studies have found that recollection of traumatic events can be very impoverished and fragmented, with &ldquo;a detail here, a detail there, that don't really fit together&rdquo;, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgp8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few studies have looked at memory during the experience of trauma itself, especially for a single, shared event. So McKinnon decided to delve into the memories of her fellow passengers on Air Transat flight 236.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We wanted to take this opportunity to look at a very &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; circumstance, so to speak,&rdquo; says McKinnon, suppressing an awkward laugh at using &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; to describe AT 236&rsquo;s emergency descent. McKinnon and collaborators examined the memories for 15 passengers on the flight, comparing their recollection of three events: the flight itself, an emotionally neutral event from the same year, and their experience during 9/11, the following month. Six of those interviewed exhibited PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers guided subjects&rsquo; memories by saying &ldquo;tell me everything you can remember about the event&rdquo;, and then further aided retrieval with cues like &ldquo;what were you thinking, what were you feeling, and what was the lighting like in the cabin?&rdquo; These detailed recollections were compared with the known sequence of events, and a control group who had suffered less traumatic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was that all passengers, regardless of whether they went on to develop PTSD, had vivid and enhanced recollections of the incident, supporting the idea that fear changes how the brain stores memories. In those that subsequently developed PTSD, &ldquo;they showed a lot of recollection of extraneous details, not only of the traumatic event, but also for the events of September 11, as well as from the neutral memory from the same time period&rdquo;, says McKinnon. It suggests that these individuals have difficulty editing what they recollect, or fading the contents of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McKinnon admits that her study represents a small sample, and is cautious about generalising the results, but they are nevertheless intriguing. &ldquo;Understandably, people were reluctant to participate,&rdquo; says McKinnon. &ldquo;And we are very, very grateful to the people who did participate, because it can be difficult to talk about these kinds of things.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgvy\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if traumatic memories are more vivid, what&rsquo;s going on inside our heads when they are &lsquo;made&rsquo;? There are multiple memory systems in the brain. We have physical memories, like how we learn to ride a bike. We have auditory memories for singing songs. And we have more specific &ldquo;declarative&rdquo; memory systems heavily involving the hippocampus. The hippocampus stores memory for things like where we parked our car, and that two plus two is four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fear activates a different system: our body&rsquo;s emergency control centre &ndash; the &lt;a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_04/d_04_cr/d_04_cr_peu/d_04_cr_peu.html\"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt;. The amygdala, a pair of almond-shaped structures on the left and right of the brain&rsquo;s medial temporal lobe, is particularly involved in emotional memories like fear, but also in pleasurable memories associated with food, sex, or recreational drug use. When a memory is particularly striking and unexpected, it activates this emotional memory system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be partly why there are a plethora of anecdotes about how sensory cues, out of context, can take you right back to emotional memories &ndash; perhaps you associate the scent of a certain perfume or cologne with your first kiss because the memory is higher fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgyp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a fearful experience, our survival systems kick into action, and we can achieve what&rsquo;s known as a single trial memory. &ldquo;If you escape from a lion once, or you see someone else being eaten by a lion, you know to be afraid of that lion,&rdquo; explains Kerry Ressler, a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. That's very different from something like studying facts in a book, and activities that aren&rsquo;t emotionally arousing. &ldquo;That may make sense evolutionarily, because we want to prioritise things that are really important,&rdquo; explains Ressler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fear system has evolved to keep us alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we feel fear, a burst of adrenaline activates a cascade that is thought to enhance memory storage of the immediately preceding events. &ldquo;The fear system has evolved to keep us alive,&rdquo; says Karim Nader, a psychology professor at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashbulb memories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fearful experiences may not always lay down strong memories, however. Elizabeth Phelps, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, was interested in people&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;flashbulb memories&rdquo; of 9/11. These are not individuals with PTSD, &ldquo;but everyday people who had experienced 9/11, which was most of us&rdquo;, says Phelps. And curiously, she found that, vivid as these memories feel, they were not as strong as people believed &ndash; they could be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgy8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phelps&rsquo; lab at NYU was near the thick of the disaster. In a large-scale detailed survey conducted first within a few weeks of 9/11, then one year, two years, and 10 years later, they found that &ldquo;people were very confident that the details of their memory were correct&rdquo;. Not the detail in terms of the fact that it happened, but where they were, who they were with, how they first heard about it, and what they did afterwards. However, personal recollections of the contextual details often actually changed with time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests, says Phelps, that flashbulb memories differ from memories of more neutral events not because the details of the memory are preserved any better, but because we think they are. &ldquo;With highly traumatic events we think we have this incredibly accurate memory,&rdquo; she says. The truth is, many of the details we think are accurate are not. &ldquo;Emotion focuses your attention on a few details, at the expense of a lot of others,&rdquo; explains Phelps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total recall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;So, could this mean that &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/partial-recall\"&gt;traumatic memories can be manipulated, even removed&lt;/a&gt;? Based on an emerging understanding of the storage and retrieval of memory, we have windows of opportunity for altering the closure of fearful memories in the brain. The time window for dampening the initial locking-in of memories, explains Nader, is on the order of 6 hours. So pharmacological approaches to lessen the strength with which a distressing memory is locked into the brain need to be administered within that short window. Indeed, there is emerging evidence from rodent and human studies that drugs called beta-blockers can achieve a reduction in later PTSD symptoms if administered quickly. &ldquo;The Israeli military now use that,&rdquo; says Nader. But new research is suggesting that even beyond the short window during which memories are saved to the internal hard drive of our brain, they can be retrieved, updated, and toned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jchfv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with rats, Nader reminded animals of a conditioned fearful memory with a musical tone (previously linked to an electric shock), and subsequently administered a beta-blocker. Even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, the fearful freezing response to the memory was gone. Exploring the same approach in a small sample of humans, Nader and colleagues determined that despite an average of 11 years between trauma and experimental intervention, &ldquo;even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, their trauma was down to non-PTSD levels&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s still early days for this method, and studies of its efficacy are ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, by using what we know about reconsolidation as a potential therapeutic tool, it seems that a subtle form of memory reprogramming is within reach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not changing your knowledge of what happened. We&rsquo;re just changing its association with these fight or flight stress responses that we get&rdquo;, says Phelps. &ldquo;So the notion that we&rsquo;re going to be able to erase your knowledge of what happened &ndash; that&rsquo;s science fiction at this point.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Departure points&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As for McKinnon, she admits that despite her vividly traumatic experience, there are many details she can&rsquo;t remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We were over the top of the island and then the plane veered back over the ocean, which was incredibly scary, because then we thought &lsquo;that was it&rsquo;,&rdquo; says McKinnon, recalling the moment that AT 236 approached the Lajes landing strip. She remembers seeing the tops of houses, and worrying about crashing there and killing other people. But asked if the plane was in darkness during its terrifying descent, McKinnon says, &ldquo;I have to be honest with you &ndash; I entirely don't remember.&rdquo; Nor can she remember whether or not she was sitting beside the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to terrifying memories, perhaps our brains are selective in what details are stored. The more we learn about how and why, the closer we&rsquo;ll get to lessening the impact of trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fated honeymoon flight was an eventful way to begin a marriage. &ldquo;It was quite a start, yes,&rdquo; McKinnon laughs. &ldquo;Unexpected.&rdquo; It proved to be a life-changing year in more than one way: making her aware of the need for research, but also for better care and treatment for PTSD, she says. &ldquo;And that was the direction I wanted to take my career in.&rdquo; McKinnon&rsquo;s experience that day was the start of an unforeseen new personal and scientific journey. As time goes by, the memory may be harder to remember, but the legacy is hard to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"559a52610b808738c4e262a1"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262db"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Science &amp; Environment","Name":"Science &amp; Environment","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Science &amp; Environment"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:45.984509Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"1aa4ccec-87b5-44b8-b5af-c553debaf6f6","Id":"wwfuture/section/science-environment","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:51:20.083392Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/science-environment"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/science-environment","_id":"559a52620b808738c4e262dc"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How extreme fear shapes what we remember","HeadlineShort":"How extreme fear shapes the brain","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Many of us will experience a significant trauma in our lives, says Lesley Evans Ogden.

Even if the bugs had names, and you could hear their shells painfully crunching? And would you take a perverse pleasure from blasting an innocent bystander with an excruciating noise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the tests that Delroy Paulhus uses to understand the &ldquo;dark personalities&rdquo; around us. Essentially, he wants to answer a question we all may have asked: why do some people take pleasure in cruelty? Not just psychopaths and murderers &ndash; but school bullies, internet trolls and even apparently upstanding members of society such as politicians and policemen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy, he says, to make quick and simplistic assumptions about these people. &ldquo;We have a tendency to use the halo or devil framing of individuals we meet &ndash; we want to simplify our world into good or bad people,&rdquo; says Paulhus, who is based at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But while Paulhus doesn&rsquo;t excuse cruelty, his approach has been more detached, like a zoologist studying poisonous insects &ndash; allowing him to build a &ldquo;taxonomy&rdquo;, as he calls it, of the different flavours of everyday evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-regard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulhus&rsquo;s interest began with narcissists &ndash; the incredibly selfish and vain, who may lash out to protect their own sense of self-worth.&nbsp; Then, a little more than a decade ago, his grad student Kevin Williams suggested that they explore whether these self-absorbed tendencies are linked to two other unpleasant characteristics &ndash; Machiavellianism (the coolly manipulative) and psychopathy (callous insensitivity and immunity to the feelings of others). Together, they found that the three traits were largely independent, though they sometimes coincide, forming a &ldquo;Dark Triad&rdquo; &ndash; a triple whammy of nastiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwhgf\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is surprising how candid his participants can often be. His questionnaires typically ask the subjects to agree with statements such as &ldquo;I like picking on weaker people&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wise not to tell me your secrets&rdquo;. You would imagine those traits would be too shameful to admit &ndash; but, at least in the laboratory, people open up, and their answers do seem to correlate with real-life bullying, both in adolescence and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886911005423\"&gt;adulthood&lt;/a&gt;. They are also more likely to &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886913012634\"&gt;be unfaithful to their spouses&lt;/a&gt; (particularly those with Machiavellian and psychopathic tendencies) and &lt;a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2010/09/cheating-personality.aspx\"&gt;to cheat on tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, since Paulhus tends to focus on everyday evil rather than criminal or psychiatric cases, the traits are by no means apparent on the first meeting. &ldquo;They are managing in everyday society, so they have enough control not to get themselves into trouble. But it catches your attention here or there.&rdquo; People who score particularly high on narcissism, for instance, quickly display their tendency to &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=leadershipfacpub\"&gt;over-claim&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; &ndash; one of the strategies that helps them boost their own egos. In some experiments, Paulhus presented them with a made up subject and they quickly confabulated to try to appear like they knew it all &ndash; only to get angry when he challenged them about it. &ldquo;It strikes you that yes, this fits into a package that allows them to live with a distorted positive view of themselves.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Born nasty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Paulhus had begun to open a window on these dark minds, others soon wanted to delve in to answer some basic questions about the human condition. Are people born nasty, for instance? Studies comparing identical and non-identical twins suggest a relatively &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886907003054\"&gt;large genetic component for both narcissism and psychopathy&lt;/a&gt;, though Machiavellianism seems to be more due to the environment &ndash; you may learn to manipulate from others. Whatever we&rsquo;ve inherited cannot take away our personal responsibility, though. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone is born with psychopathy genes and then nothing can be done about it,&rdquo; says Minna Lyons at the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwhfq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You only need to look at the anti-heroes of popular culture &ndash; James Bond, Don Draper or Jordan Belfort in the Wolf of Wall Street &ndash; to realise that dark personalities have sex appeal, a finding supported by more scientific studies. Further clues to the benefits might come from another basic human characteristic &ndash; whether you are a morning or evening person. Lyons and her student, Amy Jones found that &ldquo;night owls&rdquo; &ndash; people who stay up late but can&rsquo;t get up in the morning &ndash; tend to score higher on a range of dark triad traits. They are often risk-takers &ndash; one of the characteristics of psychopathy; they are more manipulative &ndash; a Machiavellian trait &ndash; and as narcissists, they tend to be exploitative of other people. That might make sense if you consider our evolution: perhaps dark personalities have more chance to steal, manipulate, and have illicit sexual liaisons late while everyone else is sleeping, so they evolved to be creatures of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the truth of that theory, Paulhus agrees there will always be niches for these people to exploit. &ldquo;Human society is so complex that there are different ways of enhancing your reproductive success &ndash; some involve being nice and some being nasty,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark corners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, he has started probing even further into the darkest shadows of the psyche. &nbsp;&ldquo;We were pushing the envelope, asking more extreme questions,&rdquo; he says &ndash; when he found that some people will also readily admit to inflicting pain on others for no other reason than their own pleasure. Crucially, these tendencies are not simply a reflection of the narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism, but seem to form their own sub-type &ndash; &ldquo;everyday sadism&rdquo;. For this reason, Paulhus now calls it a &ldquo;dark tetrad&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/24/11/2201.long\"&gt;bug crushing machine&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; offered the perfect way for Paulhus and colleagues to test whether that reflected real life behaviour. Unknown to the participants, the coffee grinder had been adapted to give insects an escape route &ndash; but the machine still produced a devastating crushing sound to mimic their shells hitting the cogs. Some were so squeamish they refused to take part, while others took active enjoyment in the task. &ldquo;They would be willing not just to do something nasty to bugs but to ask for more,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;while others thought it was so gross they didn&rsquo;t even want to be in the same room.&rdquo; Crucially, those individuals also scored very highly on his test for everyday sadism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwh59\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably, a rational human being shouldn&rsquo;t care too much about bugs&rsquo; feelings. But the team then set up a computer game that would allow the participants to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; a competitor with a loud noise through their headphones. This wasn&rsquo;t compulsory; in fact, the volunteers had to perform a tedious verbal task to earn the right to punish their competitor &ndash; but, to Paulhus&rsquo;s surprise, the everyday sadists were more than happy to take the trouble. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t just willingness to do it but a motivation to enjoy, to put in some extra effort to have the opportunity to hurt other individuals.&rdquo; Importantly, there was no provocation or personal gain to be had from their cruelty &ndash; the people were doing it for pure pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troll tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He thinks this is directly relevant to internet trolls. &ldquo;They appear to be the internet version of everyday sadists because they spend time searching for people to hurt.&rdquo; Sure enough, an anonymous survey of &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000324\"&gt;trollish commentators found that they scored highly on dark tetrad traits&lt;/a&gt;, but particularly the everyday sadism component &ndash; and enjoyment was their prime motivation. Indeed, the bug-crushing experiment suggested that everyday sadists may have more muted emotional responses to all kinds of pleasurable activities &ndash; so perhaps their random acts of cruelty are attempts to break through the emotional numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More immediately, his discoveries have attracted the attention of police and military agencies, who want to collaborate with Paulhus to see if his insights might explain why some people abuse their positions.&nbsp; &ldquo;The concern is that these people might deliberately select jobs where you are given the mandate to hurt individuals,&rdquo; he says. If so, further work might suggest ways to screen out the dark personalities at recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hwh8n\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&rsquo;s also excited about new work on &ldquo;moral Machiavellianism&rdquo; and &ldquo;communal narcissists&rdquo; &ndash; people who perhaps have dark traits but use them for good (as they see it). In some situations, ruthlessness may be necessary. &ldquo;To be prime minister, you can&rsquo;t be namby pamby &ndash; you need to cut corners and hurt people, and even be nasty to achieve your moral causes,&rdquo; he says. After all, the dark personalities often have the impulse and the confidence to get things done &ndash;even &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html\"&gt;Mother Theresa apparently had a steely side&lt;/a&gt;, he says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to help society by sitting at home being nice.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which underlines the false dichotomy of good and evil that Paulhus has been keen to probe. In a sense, that is a personal as much as a professional question. He admits to seeing a dark streak in his own behaviour: for example, he enjoys watching violent, painful sports like Mixed Martial Arts. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take long to see I would stand above average on these dark traits,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But given my abiding curiosity as a scientist and my enjoyment of investigating such things &ndash; I thought that perhaps I was in a good position to take a closer look at the dark side.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-01-30T09:47:58Z","HeadlineLong":"Psychology: the man who studies everyday evil","HeadlineShort":"The man who studies evil","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Why are some people extraordinarily selfish, manipulative, and unkind?

His response was always the same: I could blame my genes and a love of reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common concern is that glasses are making things worse &ndash; the answer is no&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had no reason to question him; it&rsquo;s probably what your ophthalmologist told you, too, if you were diagnosed with short-sightedness. But recent research suggests those assumptions are quite wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other things about the modern environment could be leading to poor eyesight. And, with just a few simple measures, our children may be prevented from the same blurry decline that has plagued our own generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02h17x7\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that poor eyesight is primarily genetic had never really rung true for me, anyway. Without my glasses, I literally couldn&rsquo;t tell a rock from a rhino. So shouldn&rsquo;t my ancestors have been removed from the gene pool as they groped and squinted their way through the savannah? Yet short-sightedness is something of an epidemic; 30-40% of people in Europe and the US need glasses, and the figure has risen to as much as 90% in some Asian countries. If we had &ldquo;short-sightedness&rdquo; genes they have made it through the millennia regardless of their obvious disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask an Eskimo&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the experiences of the Inuit in Canada should have settled that question nearly 50 years ago. Whereas the older generation had next-to-no cases of short-sightedness, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1116086?dopt=Abstract&amp;holding=npg\"&gt;between 10-25% of their children all needed glasses&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;That would never be possible with a genetic disease,&rdquo; says Nina Jacobsen at Glostrup University Hospital in Copenhagen. Over that same period, the Inuit had started to leave their traditional lifestyles of hunting and fishing for a more Western way of life &ndash; a far more likely cause of their decline. &ldquo;Short-sightedness is an industrial disease,&rdquo; says Ian Flitcroft at Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin. Our genes may still play a role in deciding who becomes short-sighted, but it was only through a change in environment that the problems began to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02h17nj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of that change would have been education and literacy &ndash; one of the most common explanations for short-sightedness. At first the evidence seemed to be strong: just look at the sea of glinting specs in any university lecture theatre or academic conference, and you would seem to find proof of a link. Yet epidemiological studies suggest the effects are much smaller than once believed. &ldquo;The more we studied it and measured the amount people read, the more the association seemed to vanish,&rdquo; says Flitcroft. &lt;a href=\"http://www.iovs.org/content/48/8/3524.abstract\"&gt;One large study following the progress of children in Ohio appeared to show no correlation at all&lt;/a&gt; with reading, though we should not yet rule out the effect completely, says Jacobsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, many now argue that it is the time spent indoors, rather than reading per se, that matters most. Study after study, from &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22491403\"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413273\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637483\"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt;, have all found that people who spend more time outside are far less likely to get short-sighted than people whose lives are mostly confined within four walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02h17mh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would that be? One popular explanation is that sunlight somehow nourishes the eyes. Scott Read at Queensland University of Technology, for instance, recently equipped a group of schoolchildren with a special watch that recorded their overall movements, and the light intensity, every 30 seconds for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids with good eyesight turned out to be no more active than those with specs &ndash; ruling out the possibility that exercise and general good health protect the eyes. Instead, glasses prescriptions seemed to hinge, almost exclusively, on &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413273\"&gt;the time spent in the sunshine&lt;/a&gt;. Bright sunlight can be thousands of times more intense than lighting inside (though your eyes may mask the difference) &ndash; and the more sunlight the children enjoyed, the less likely they were to need glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02h17cn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is because &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25406278\"&gt;sunlight stimulates the production of Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, which is responsible for a healthy immune system and brain, and might also regulate eye health. A more widely accepted idea is that sunshine triggers the release of dopamine, directly in the eye itself. Short-sightedness is caused by excessive growth of the eyeball, making it more difficult for the lens to focus an image on the retina, but dopamine seems to put the brakes on this and keep it in a healthier shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the blues&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it could be a question of colour. Green and blue wavelengths tend to be focused at the front of the retina, while red light hits the back.&nbsp; Since indoor lighting tends to be redder than the sun&rsquo;s rays, the mismatch could confuse the eyeball&rsquo;s control mechanisms. &ldquo;It tells the eye that it&rsquo;s not focusing on the optimal place, and so it has to grow and compensate for that,&rdquo; says Chi Luu at the University of Melbourne. Sure enough, he has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=chi+luu+chromaticity\"&gt;chicks raised in red light are more likely to be short-sighted&lt;/a&gt; than those growing up with blue or green surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02h17jk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flitcroft, meanwhile, thinks the problem lies in the clutter of objects clouding your visual field. Just take a look around you and you will see what he means. &ldquo;If you look at a laptop screen, everything behind the screen is out of focus to quite a large degree,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And then if you look up from the laptop to a clock, you have a huge flip &ndash; the clock is in focus, but there are lots of things close to you in periphery, that are blurred.&rdquo; Wherever you fix your gaze, there is always a blur that plays with the eye&rsquo;s feedback mechanisms. Outdoors, however, things tend to lie at a greater distance, providing a clearer image that helps to regulate the eye&rsquo;s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such insights are hopefully not just of academic importance, since they could eventually direct us to new treatments. Luu, for instance, is hoping to put together a trial that offers blue lamps to short-sighted children. Not only does Luu hope it could slow further decline; it may actually reverse it; during his study of chicks, he found that a few hours a day under a blue lamp undid the damage of the red lights and returned the chick&rsquo;s vision to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chance discovery&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flitcroft points out that there are promising trials of contact lenses that can reduce blur in the peripheral vision. He is also optimistic that an eye drop, called atropine, could be helpful. The drug has long been known to slow down the signalling that triggers eyeball growth and short-sightedness. Its unwelcome side-effects &ndash; such as causing pupil dilation and generating halos around sources of light &ndash; meant that it was once dismissed, but a chance finding recently &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24315293\"&gt;showed that it is equally effective at a just one hundredth the original dose&lt;/a&gt;. At those levels, the side effects should be minimal &ndash; a discovery that has now sparked renewed interest in the eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02h17fs\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the time being, Flitcroft stresses that we should be careful not to take any action in haste. One&nbsp; misconception, for instance, is that &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140513-do-glasses-weaken-your-eyesight\"&gt;glasses themselves make your eyes worse&lt;/a&gt;, but the evidence suggests this advice should be discarded. My own experience shows that this is sadly misguided; inspired by the controversial book &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_method\"&gt;Better Eyesight Without Glasses&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, I decided to go without my specs in the hope that it would reverse my prescription; instead, it doubled over the course of three years. &ldquo;A common concern is that glasses are making things worse &ndash; but the answer to that question is no,&rdquo; says Flitcroft. &ldquo;If you are making sure your children can see properly &ndash; you&rsquo;re doing things right.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who would like to take action now, most of the researchers agree that encouraging children to play outside can do no harm, &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23462271\"&gt;and a trial in Taiwanese schools&lt;/a&gt; has already shown moderate success. &ldquo;Left to their natural, outdoors environment, humans don&rsquo;t become myopic,&rdquo; says Flitcroft. &ldquo;Encouraging children to spend time outdoors can only be good.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish that I&rsquo;d known all of this during my youth. Today, I wear contact lenses that almost completely correct my vision, and the occasional dryness and irritation are small concerns in the grand scheme of things. But when I wake up and can&rsquo;t even recognise my partner lying next to me, I can&rsquo;t help hoping that future generations will be able to enjoy the crystal-clear vision that was once our ancestors&rsquo; birthright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20150106-how-to-nap-like-a-pro&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2g%2Fdj%2Fp02gdj02.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-01-16T09:57:04Z","HeadlineLong":"Why are we short-sighted?","HeadlineShort":"Why are we short-sighted?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Myopia is among our most common complaints  but have we fundamentally misunderstood its origins and its treatment?

And it&rsquo;s an outlook that could be gaining momentum &ndash; despite its lack of cheer. In some countries, openly acknowledged atheism has never been more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s absolutely more atheists around today than ever before, both in sheer numbers and as a percentage of humanity,&rdquo; says Phil Zuckerman, a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, California, and author of &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Living-Secular-Life-Answers-Questions-ebook/dp/B00INIQQEA/ref=la_B001HD3S8U_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417626000&amp;sr=1-1\"&gt;Living the Secular Life&lt;/a&gt;. According to a &lt;a href=\"http://redcresearch.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RED-C-press-release-Religion-and-Atheism-25-7-12.pdf\"&gt;Gallup International survey&lt;/a&gt; of more than 50,000 people in 57 countries, the number of individuals claiming to be religious fell from 77% to 68% between 2005 and 2011, while those who self-identified as atheist rose by 3% &ndash; bringing the world&rsquo;s estimated proportion of adamant non-believers to 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While atheists certainly are not the majority, could it be that these figures are a harbinger of things to come? Assuming global trends continue might religion someday disappear entirely?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s impossible to predict the future, but examining what we know about religion &ndash; including why it evolved in the first place, and why some people chose to believe in it and others abandon it &ndash; can hint at how our relationship with the divine might play out in decades or centuries to come.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flfyd\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholars are still trying to tease out the complex factors that drive an individual or a nation toward atheism, but there are a few commonalities. Part of religion&rsquo;s appeal is that it offers security in an uncertain world. So not surprisingly, nations that report the highest rates of atheism tend to be those that provide their citizens with relatively high economic, political and existential stability. &ldquo;Security in society seems to diminish religious belief,&rdquo; Zuckerman says. Capitalism, access to technology and education also seems to correlate with a corrosion of religiosity in some populations, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crisis of faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan, the UK, Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, France and Uruguay (where the majority of citizens have European roots) are all places where religion was important just a century or so ago, but that now report some of the lowest belief rates in the world. These countries feature strong educational and social security systems, low inequality and are all relatively wealthy. &ldquo;Basically, people are less scared about what might befall them,&rdquo; says Quentin Atkinson, a psychologist at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flf5d\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet decline in belief seems to be occurring across the board, including in places that are still strongly religious, such as Brazil, Jamaica and Ireland. &ldquo;Very few societies are more religious today than they were 40 or 50 years ago,&rdquo; Zuckerman says. &ldquo;The only exception might be Iran, but that&rsquo;s tricky because secular people might be hiding their beliefs.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US, too, is an outlier in that it is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, but also has high rates of religiosity. (Still, &lt;a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise/\"&gt;a recent Pew survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that, between 2007 and 2012, the proportion of Americans who said they are atheist rose from 1.6% to 2.4%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decline, however, does not mean disappearance, says Ara Norenzayan, a social psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and author of &lt;a href=\"http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/IndexBook.html\"&gt;Big Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Existential security is more fallible than it seems. In a moment, everything can change: a drunk driver can kill a loved one; a tornado can destroy a town; a doctor can issue a terminal diagnosis. As climate change wreaks havoc on the world in coming years and natural resources potentially grow scarce, then suffering and hardship could fuel religiosity. &ldquo;People want to escape suffering, but if they can&rsquo;t get out of it, they want to find meaning,&rdquo; Norenzayan says. &ldquo;For some reason, religion seems to give meaning to suffering &ndash; much more so than any secular ideal or belief that we know of.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flf9c\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon constantly plays out in hospital rooms and disaster zones around the world. In 2011, for example, a massive earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand &ndash; a highly secular society. There was a &lt;a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049648\"&gt;sudden spike of religiosity&lt;/a&gt; in the people who experienced that event, but the rest of the country remained as secular as ever. While exceptions to this rule do exist &ndash; religion in Japan plummeted following World War II, for instance &ndash; for the most part, Zuckerman says, we adhere by the Christchurch model. &ldquo;If experiencing something terrible caused all people to become atheists, then we&rsquo;d all be atheists,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mind of god&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;But even if the world&rsquo;s troubles were miraculously solved and we all led peaceful lives in equity, religion would probably still be around. This is because a god-shaped hole seems to exist in our species&rsquo; neuropsychology, thanks to a quirk of our evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flflq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this requires a delve into &ldquo;dual process theory&rdquo;. This psychological staple states that we have two very basic forms of thought: System 1 and System 2. System 2 evolved relatively recently. It&rsquo;s the voice in our head &ndash; the narrator who never seems to shut up &ndash; that enables us to plan and think logically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;System 1, on the other hand, is intuitive, instinctual and automatic. These capabilities regularly develop in humans, regardless of where they are born. They are survival mechanisms. System 1 bestows us with an innate revulsion of rotting meat, allows us to speak our native language without thinking about it and gives babies the ability to recognise parents and distinguish between living and nonliving objects. It makes us prone to looking for patterns to better understand our world, and to seek meaning for seemingly random events like natural disasters or the death of loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flfs0\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping us navigate the dangers of the world and find a mate, some scholars think that System 1 also enabled religions to evolve and perpetuate. System 1, for example, makes us instinctually primed to see life forces &ndash; a phenomenon called hypersensitive agency detection &ndash; everywhere we go, regardless of whether they&rsquo;re there or not. Millennia ago, that tendency probably helped us avoid concealed danger, such as lions crouched in the grass or venomous snakes concealed in the bush. But it also made us vulnerable to inferring the existence of invisible agents &ndash; whether they took the form of a benevolent god watching over us, an unappeased ancestor punishing us with a drought or a monster lurking in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, System 1 encourages us to see things dualistically, meaning we have trouble thinking of the mind and body as a single unit. This tendency emerges quite early: young children, regardless of their cultural background, are inclined to believe that &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12220/abstract\"&gt;they have an immortal soul&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; that their essence or personhood existed somewhere prior to their birth, and will always continue to exist. This disposition easily assimilates into many existing religions, or &ndash; with a bit of creativity &ndash; lends itself to devising original constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flg1n\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;A Scandinavian psychologist colleague of mine who is an atheist told me that his three-year-old daughter recently walked up to him and said, &lsquo;God is everywhere all of the time.&rsquo; He and his wife couldn&rsquo;t figure out where she&rsquo;d gotten that idea from,&rdquo; says Justin Barrett, director of the Thrive Center for Human Development at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, and author of &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Born-Believers-Science-Childrens-Religious/dp/B00D1G9LXC\"&gt;Born Believers&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;For his daughter, god was an elderly woman, so you know she didn&rsquo;t get it from the Lutheran church.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, many scholars believe that religion arose as &ldquo;a byproduct of our cognitive disposition&rdquo;, says Robert McCauley, director of the Center for Mind, Brain and Culture at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and author of &lt;a href=\"http://www.robertmccauley.com/books/why-religion-is-natural-and-science-is-not\"&gt;Why Religion Is Natural and Science Is Not&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;Religions are cultural arrangements that evolved to engage and exploit these natural capacities in humans.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard habits to break&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Atheists must fight against all of that cultural and evolutionary baggage. Human beings naturally want to believe that they are a part of something bigger, that life isn&rsquo;t completely futile. Our minds crave purpose and explanation. &ldquo;With education, exposure to science and critical thinking, people might stop trusting their intuitions,&rdquo; Norenzayan says. &ldquo;But the intuitions are there.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flg54\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, science &ndash; the system of choice that many atheists and non-believers look to for understanding the natural world &ndash; is not an easy cognitive pill to swallow. Science is about correcting System 1 biases, McCauley says. We must accept that the Earth spins, even though we never experience that sensation for ourselves. We must embrace the idea that evolution is utterly indifferent and that there is no ultimate design or purpose to the Universe, even though our intuition tells us differently. We also find it difficult to admit that we are wrong, to resist our own biases and to accept that truth as we understand it is ever changing as new empirical data are gathered and tested &ndash; all staples of science. &ldquo;Science is cognitively unnatural &ndash; it&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo; McCauley says. &ldquo;Religion, on the other hand, is mostly something we don&rsquo;t even have to learn because we already know it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s evidence that religious thought is the path of least resistance,&rdquo; Barrett adds. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to fundamentally change something about our humanity to get rid of religion.&rdquo; This biological sticking point probably explains the fact that, although &lt;a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise/\"&gt;20% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; are not affiliated with a church, 68% of them say that they still believe in God and 37% describe themselves as spiritual. Even without organised religion, they believe that some greater being or life force guides the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flggp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many around the world who explicitly say they don&rsquo;t believe in a god still harbour superstitious tendencies, like belief in ghosts, astrology, karma, telepathy or reincarnation. &ldquo;In Scandinavia, most people say they don&rsquo;t believe in God, but paranormal and superstitious beliefs tend to be higher than you&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; Norenzayan says. Additionally, non-believers often lean on what could be interpreted as religious proxies &ndash; sports teams, yoga, professional institutions, Mother Nature and more &ndash; to guide their values in life. As a testament to this, witchcraft is &lt;a href=\"http://www.bkmag.com/2013/11/18/witches-as-the-new-hipsters/\"&gt;gaining popularity&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and paganism seems to be the &lt;a href=\"http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/features/it-s-a-moot-point-but-paganism-may-be-the-fastest-growing-religion-in-britain-1-6199786\"&gt;fastest growing religion&lt;/a&gt; in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious experiences for non-believers can also manifest in other, more bizarre ways. Anthropologist Ryan Hornbeck, also at the Thrive Center for Human Development, found evidence that the World of Warcraft is &lt;a href=\"http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.600630\"&gt;assuming spiritual importance&lt;/a&gt; for some players in China, for example. &ldquo;WoW seems to be offering opportunities to develop certain moral traits that regular life in contemporary society doesn&rsquo;t afford,&rdquo; Barrett says. &ldquo;People seem to have this conceptual space for religious thought, which &ndash; if it&rsquo;s not filled by religion &ndash; bubbles up in surprising ways.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The in-group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;What&rsquo;s more, religion promotes group cohesion and cooperation. The threat of an all-powerful God (or gods) watching for anyone who steps out of line likely helped to keep order in ancient societies. &ldquo;This is the supernatural punishment hypothesis,&rdquo; Atkinson says. &ldquo;If everyone believes that the punishment is real, then that can be functional to groups.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02flgpt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And again, insecurity and suffering in a population may play a role here, by helping to encourage religions with stricter moral codes. In a &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/47/16784.abstract\"&gt;recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; of religious belief systems of nearly 600 traditional societies from around the world, Joseph Bulbulia at the University of Wellington, New Zealand and his colleagues found that those places with harsher weather or that are more prone to natural disasters were more likely to develop moralising gods. Why? Helpful neighbours could mean the difference between life and death. In this context, religion evolved as a valuable public utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When we see something so pervasive, something that emerges so quickly developmentally and remains persistent across cultures, then it makes sense that the leading explanation is that it served a cooperative function,&rdquo; says Bulbulia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there&rsquo;s also some simple mathematics behind religion&rsquo;s knack for prevailing. Across cultures, people who are more religious also tend to have more children than people who are not. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very strong evidence for this,&rdquo; Norenzayan says. &ldquo;Even among religious people, the more fundamentalist ones usually have higher fertility rates than the more liberal ones.&rdquo; Add to that the fact that &lt;a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1590808/The_Importance_of_Religious_Displays_for_Belief_Acquisition_and_Secularization\"&gt;children typically follow their parents&rsquo; lead&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to whether or not they become religious adults themselves, and a completely secularised world seems ever more unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enduring belief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons &ndash; psychological, neurological, historical, cultural and logistical &ndash; experts guess that religion will probably never go away. Religion, whether it&rsquo;s maintained through fear or love, is highly successful at perpetuating itself. If not, it would no longer be with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even if we lose sight of the Christian, Muslim and Hindu gods and all the rest, superstitions and spiritualism will almost certainly still prevail. More formal religious systems, meanwhile, would likely only be a natural disaster or two away. &ldquo;Even the best secular government can&rsquo;t protect you from everything,&rdquo; says McCauley. As soon as we found ourselves facing an ecological crisis, a global nuclear war or an impending comet collision, the gods would emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Humans need comfort in the face of pain and suffering, and many need to think that there&rsquo;s something more after this life, that they&rsquo;re loved by an invisible being,&rdquo; Zuckerman says. &ldquo;There will always be people who believe, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they remain the majority.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-19T11:16:55Z","HeadlineLong":"Will religion ever disappear?

Seriously, what good are lips? Birds get on just fine without them, turtles' lips have hardened into beaks as well, and while most mammals have lips, we humans are in a class all our own having lips that are permanently turned outwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that lips are quite important; so important, even, that it seems worth the risk of having your bottom lip caught in between your chompers. Even though that can &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using our lips to suck is one of the very first skills we have after we're born. In fact, it's so fundamental to our survival that it's known as a \"primitive reflex\"; we're born knowing how to suck and no learning is necessary. That's true for nearly all mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02gskkn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the sucking reflex combined with another primitive response, the rooting reflex, that allows infants to breastfeed. The rooting reflex works by turning the infant's head to face anything that strokes its mouth or cheek. As soon as something grazes the newborn's lips, the sucking reflex is activated. While the tongue then does a lot of the work, the lips are vital to maintain a tight seal so that the infant can swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means feeding, whether from breast or from bottle, is not a passive behaviour on the part of a newborn infant. It's more like a conversation, with each side doing his or her part in a dance elaborately choreographed by evolution. At the centre of that dance are the lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read my lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The lips are of course also important in the act of eating other foods, and in speech. In linguistics, the lips are two of many &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_of_articulation\"&gt;places of articulation&lt;/a&gt;, or spots in the mouth and throat that aid in blockage of air moving out from the lungs. Bring your two lips together and you can form the sounds &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt;. To make the sounds &lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt;, bring your lower lip to your upper teeth. To make a &lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; sound, move the back of your tongue towards the roof of your mouth while also moving your lips closer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech is arguably a critical part of human life, but it's not quite as much fun as kissing. Kissing isn't universal, though it does pop up in some 90% of cultures. Darwin himself noted that there are cultures in which kissing is conspicuously absent. \"We Europeans are so accustomed to kissing as a mark of affection that it might be thought to be innate in mankind,\" he wrote in &lt;a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=KGNHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=%22is+replaced+in+various+parts+of+the+world+by+the+rubbing+of+noses%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wbZSh8FASS&amp;sig=MH0c-sfb4iD4a-rheldDVqQZvzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HcmQVP35ApK5ogTJ5ILwDg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22is%20replaced%20in%20various%20parts%20of%20the%20world%20by%20the%20rubbing%20of%20noses%22&amp;f=false\"&gt;The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals&lt;/a&gt;, \"but this is not the case&hellip;[it is] unknown with the [Maori] New Zealanders, Tahitians, Papuans, Australians, Somals of Africa, and the Esquimaux [Eskimo].\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02gsktz\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If kissing isn't universal, it could still have its roots in biology, perhaps as a combination of inherited impulses and learned behaviour. For one thing, other species kiss as well. Chimpanzees do it in order to reconcile following a fight, and bonobos do it with some tongue as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2008 issue of &lt;a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/affairs-of-the-lips-why-we-kiss/\"&gt;Scientific American Mind&lt;/a&gt; the writer Chip Walter argued, citing British zoologist Desmond Morris, that kissing may have originated from the primate behavior of pre-chewing food and passing it to the kids. Chimpanzee mothers, for example, are known to chew food and before swallowing they press their lips to the lips of their youngsters to allow the food to pass into their mouths. The pressing of lips may have then become a general means for relieving anxiety. Basic classical conditioning would suggest that by pairing lip stimulation with food, simply touching the lips would eventually trigger feelings of pleasure. Add to that the overabundance of nerve endings in the lips, and you have the recipe for ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lip service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lips are exquisitely sensitive (if sometimes slimy) bits of tissue. The part of the brain responsible for detecting touch is called the somatosensory cortex, and is found on the top of the brain in an area called the postcentral gyrus. Touch sensations from all over the body get sent there to be processed, with each part of the body getting its own little sub-division along the postcentral gyrus, and the size reflects the density of receptors rather than the amount of skin available to touch. For example, the part devoted to sensations from the chest and stomach is fairly small. Meanwhile, the parts that process sensations from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141215-why-are-most-of-us-right-handed\"&gt;hands&lt;/a&gt; and lips are enormous. Just as the hands are a central conduit with which we experience the world, so too are the lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02gskq7\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researcher &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2008-06860-010\"&gt;Gordon Gallup&lt;/a&gt;, in cultures without kissing, \"sex partners may blow in each other&rsquo;s faces, lick, suck, or rub their partner&rsquo;s face prior to intercourse.\" But the so-called \"Eskimo kiss\" isn't actually about rubbing noses, as early Arctic explorers thought, but about sniffing &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131104-natures-grossest-perfume\"&gt;exchanging scents&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible that the act of kissing could have come along as an enjoyable means for sniffing out possible romantic partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallup studied kissing behavior in a group who should know a thing or two about it: American college students. He and his colleagues found that one of the chief means through which college-aged women determined whether a partner was a good kisser was based upon chemical cues, taste and smell. And according to his research, college women said they were far less likely to have &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex\"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; with a man unless they'd kissed him first. Whether humans indeed have pheromones, and whether we can even detect them if we do, kissing facilitates the sharing of body odours, which can relay a wealth of information regarding things like basic hygiene. In another survey conducted by Gallup, he asked \"Have you ever found yourself attracted to someone, only to discover after kissing them for the first time that you were no longer interested?\" Of the men he surveyed, 59% said yes, while 66% of the women agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his studies are quite obviously limited by focusing on American college students, when placed alongside the cross-cultural data and evidence from animal research, it seems reasonable to conclude that the close contact that kissing offers facilitates a good deal of sniffing. Whether we're aware of it or not, kissing may allow us to judge the potential suitability of those we desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&rsquo;s why the occasional chapped lip, or mistaken bite of this hypersensitive part of the body, is all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"The mysteries of our bodies.

There are those animals with eyes on the sides of their heads &ndash; chickens, cows, horses, zebras &ndash; and then there are those with eyes that are closer together on the front of their face, like monkeys, tigers, owls, wolves. All the humans visiting the zoo are obviously in the latter camp. What's behind this divide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a trade-off when it comes to eye placement. As the eyes move forward along the face, two fields of vision overlap. It's that overlap &ndash; the slightly different perspective on the scene in front of you that each of your two eyes sends to your brain &ndash; that allows you to perceive depth. Animals with sideways-facing eyes may not have this well-developed depth perception, but they are able to see an extremely wide panorama instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p028kyl3\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eye placement probably evolved for different reasons in different groups of animals. Some turtles, for example, have &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2014/03/19/the-turtle-with-human-eyes/\"&gt;eyes on the side of their heads but process optical information as if their eyes were forward facing&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; probably because when they retract their heads into their carapaces their eyes only receive light from the front, as if their eyes faced forwards. But how did our corner of the family tree, the primates, wind up with forward-facing eyes? There are lots of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1922, Edward Treacher Collins, a British ophthalmologist, wrote that early primates needed sight that would \"enable them to swing and spring with accuracy from bough to bough&hellip;to grasp food with their hands and convey it by them to their mouths\". As our primate ancestors moved into the trees to escape their predators, the needs to navigate the tree branches and to grab rapidly fleeing prey with their hands, he argued, meant that evolution favoured a visual system with good depth perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p028kz9b\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins' idea has become known as the \"arboreal locomotion hypothesis\" &ndash; arboreal meaning living in trees. In the decades since, it has been expanded and refined, but the basic idea that our ancestors evolved forward facing eyes to accurately judge distances while leaping from tree to tree remained central for quite a while. After all, the stakes for failing to work out the true distance between trees were high. &ldquo;The price of failure was to drop many metres onto a ground inhabited by carnivorous beasts,\" wrote visual psychotherapist Christopher Tyler in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with Collins&rsquo; hypothesis is that many animals that thrive in trees have eyes on the sides of their heads &ndash; squirrels, for instance. So, in 2005, biological anthropologist &lt;a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/anthrop/people/faculty/m-cartmill/\"&gt;Matt Cartmill&lt;/a&gt; proposed a different idea: &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.1360010308/abstract\"&gt;the \"visual predation hypothesis\".&lt;/a&gt; Predators are best served, ostensibly, by having extremely good depth perception. That would help them to better locate and more effectively take down their prey, whether that's a leopard stalking a gazelle or a raptor snatching a rabbit in its talons, or one of our primate ancestors grabbing an insect from the branch of a tree. Cartmill thought his explanation was the most elegant, because it also explained other evolutionary changes that are distinctive to primates. Early primates, for example, hunt by sight rather than by scent. Cartmill thought that the reduction in their ability to smell was a side effect of the eyes' convergence, simply because the space available for the nose and its connections to the brain became smaller as it was crowded out by the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p028kznq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurobiologist John Allman picked up on Cartmill's hypothesis and expanded it to focus on nocturnal predation. Not all predators, after all, have forward facing eyes. Cats, primates and owls do, but not mongooses, tree shrews, and robins. Allman's contribution was to suggest that forward-facing eyes proved beneficial for creatures that hunt at night, such as owls and cats, because they can take in more light than sideways-facing eyes. As it happens, early primates were also nocturnal hunters, and their adaptation for nighttime predation may have granted forward-facing eyes to all their descendants, including our own species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretical neurobiologist &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140926-are-hairy-faces-less-evolved\"&gt;Mark Changizi&lt;/a&gt; has yet another idea. In 2008 in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519308003585\"&gt;Journal of Theoretical Biology&lt;/a&gt;, he offered up the \"X-ray vision hypothesis\". In short, forward-facing eyes allowed our ancestors to see through the dense leaves and branches in their forest habitat. The catchy name for his hypothesis comes from a curious phenomenon. \"When you hold up your finger vertically and fixate your eyes on something far beyond it,\" he writes, \"you perceive two copies of your finger, and both copies of your finger appear transparent.\" Thus, you have the ability to \"see through\" your finger, as though you were seeing with X-ray vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p028l016\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clutter problem is unique to large-bodied animals in forests, such as primates. Smaller animals, such as squirrels, suffer less clutter because their heads are small enough to see in between branches and leaves. And large animals in non-forest environments can do just fine with eyes that face sideways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the reason we all have peepers on the front of our heads is by no means settled. Each hypothesis has its own strengths and weaknesses. But whether our eyes moved forward to account for leaping through branches, chasing after tasty bugs, or to see through leaves, at least one thing is certain: it all comes down to life in the trees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; page, or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Evolution: Why do your eyes face forwards?","HeadlineShort":"Why do your eyes face forwards?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Why dont we have peepers protruding from the sides of our heads?

Compared to most of the rest of the animal kingdom, the human face has at least one really peculiar feature: it's almost completely devoid of hair. Sure, some people grow beards or moustaches, but even a full pirate's beard would leave quite a bit of skin showing. They don't call us \"the hairless ape\" for nothing. How did we come to be so bare-faced?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons we lost our body hair are still debated. Some researchers think that we lost our fur to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/19/science/why-humans-and-their-fur-parted-ways.html\"&gt;free ourselves of parasites&lt;/a&gt;, such as lice. This might have made us more attractive to the opposite sex; bare skin would advertise our lack of parasites. Others have suggested that we lost most of our hair to &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00295.x/abstract?\"&gt;facilitate cooling&lt;/a&gt; as we moved from the shady forests to the hot savannah. Still others wonder whether nakedness is one of a number of juvenile traits that humans retain throughout their lifetimes; humans are thought to be, in one sense, juvenilised apes, who mature slower and live longer than our ape cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Mark Changizi, a neurobiologist at 2AI Labs in Boston, has an intriguing alternative explanation for why we don&rsquo;t have hair on our faces, at least when we compare ourselves to other primates. It's because we're walking, talking, breathing &lsquo;mood rings&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colour reveal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood rings were a short-lived fad of the mid 1970s. The idea behind wearing one was that it would act as a sort of emotional barometer, betraying your innermost feelings to anyone who took a glance at the jewellery. In truth, mood rings were little more than thermometers, designed to change colour according to body temperature. But the idea &ndash; that colour betrays emotion &ndash; isn't actually all that farfetched. The idea is pervasive in human culture. We become \"green with envy\". We turn red when angry or embarrassed. Sadness is referred to as \"the blues\". The truth may not be so far off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027dfhn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changizi, together with researchers Qiong Zhang and Shinsuke Shimojo, argues that our &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618887/\"&gt;faces evolved their hairlessness to allow other members of our species the ability to read our emotions&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, primate faces and &ndash; in some cases &ndash; rumps and genitalia change colours thanks to the underlying physiology of the skin. \"For highly social animals like most primates, one of the most important kinds of objects to be competent at perceiving and discriminating is other members of one's own species,\" he writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most mammals, like dogs, horses, or bears, can only see blends of two colours when they look at the world. They're called dichromats, and they can only see yellows, blues, or the greens that form when blue and yellow mix &ndash; in addition to perceiving brightness. That's because their eyes have, in addition to the brightness-sensing rods, only two types of cones: ones sensitive to short or long wavelengths of light. But humans and some other primates are trichromats. We have a third type of cone, sensitive to medium wavelengths of light. Having that third cone means that we can also detect colours along a red-green continuum. (&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision\"&gt;A few lucky people are tetrachromats&lt;/a&gt;, which means they can see even more shades).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there's something odd about the three types of cones that trichromats have: they're not evenly spaced out. It just so happens that this odd assortment of cones allows our eyes to perceive properties of the blood circling through our bodies just beneath the skin: how saturated with oxygen the haemoglobin is, and how concentrated the haemoglobin is. Changes in those two variables result in predictable changes in skin colouration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's actually quite remarkable how many colours human skin can be. We're used to thinking of skin as being white, black, or brown. But those are just a baseline. Darker faces still blush, after all, something that even Darwin noticed. Skin appears redder as haemoglobin becomes more and more oxygenated. Reductions in oxygen saturation turn the skin green (which is just how veins carrying de-oxygenated blood back to the heart look). On the other hand, a greater accumulation of blood in a certain area turns the skin somewhat blue. Just like a bruise. And a reduction in blood concentration does the opposite, making the skin appear yellow. Which, indeed, is how we describe somebody who isn't looking very healthy. \"Colour is sufficiently suggestive of emotion,\" writes Changizi, \"that cartoons often use colour on a face to indicate emotional state.\" And it's something that even children can recognise effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p027dfkh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dichromats &ndash; the dogs, bunnies, and bears of the world, along with certain primates &ndash; can only perceive changes along the blue-yellow dimension, allowing them to notice changes only in blood concentration. In some ways, that's a useful skill. It's probably best to avoid someone who looks yellow, to avoid becoming infected with whatever disease or sickness they're trying to fight off, or to escape being near someone who might imminently vomit. On the other hand, a bruise betrays injury, someone who will be easier to beat in a fight over resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the best part: if it's true that facial bare skin evolved to allow for colour signalling, then other trichromatic primates should have visible skin too. To see if his hypothesis held up, Changizi looked at 97 different primate species. Sure enough, he found that monochromatic and dichromatic primates are furry, while those, including us, who have three types of cones have more visible facial skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if bare skin was initially selected for something other than colour signalling, it is likely the case that both colour vision and visible skin became evolutionarily entangled, at least among primates, argues Changizi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time your friends ask you what you're feeling, just tell them to look at your skin. They should be able to figure it out: after all, they have millions of years of evolution on their side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Evolution: Why dont we have hairier faces?","HeadlineShort":"Are hairy faces less evolved?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Men may have beards, but compared to many of our primate cousins our faces are pretty hairless  why is that?

If you use one hand for writing, you probably use the same one for eating as well, and most of us &ndash; around 85% of our species &ndash; prefer our right hands. In fact, \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248409001304\"&gt;there has never been any report of a human population in which left-handed individuals predominate&lt;/a&gt;\", according to archaeologist Natalie Uomini at the University of Liverpool in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lateralisation of limb use &ndash; that is, a bias towards one side or the other &ndash; usually begins in the brain. We know that some tasks are largely controlled by brain activity in the left hemisphere, while the right hemisphere governs other tasks. Confusingly, there is some crossing of nerves between the body and the brain, which means it&rsquo;s actually the left side of the brain that has more control over the right side of the body and vice versa. In other words, the brain&rsquo;s left hemisphere helps control the operation of the right hand, eye, leg and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02f8rk7\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some argue that &lt;a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evolutionary-origins-of-your-right-and-left-brain/\"&gt;this division of neurological labour has been a feature of animals for half a billion years&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it evolved because it is more efficient to allow the two hemispheres to carry out different computations at the same time. The left side of the brain, for instance, might have evolved to carry out routine operations &ndash; things like foraging for food &ndash; while the right side was kept free to detect and react rapidly to unexpected challenges in the environment &ndash; an approaching predator, for instance. This can be seen in various fish, toads and birds, &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627581.600-southpaws-the-evolution-of-handedness.html#.VI74thD2fEc\"&gt;which are all more likely to attack prey seen in the right eye&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it is possible (though hard to prove) that as our hominin ancestors began walking on two legs rather than four, freeing up their hands to perform new tasks like making tools, they were predisposed to begin using those hands differently. Or, as cognitive scientist Stephanie Braccini and colleagues put it in a Journal of Human Evolution study, \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248409002218\"&gt;a strengthening of individual asymmetry [may have] started as soon as early hominins assumed a habitual upright posture during tool use or foraging&lt;/a&gt;\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02f8r8j\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of the idea, Braccini and her colleagues&rsquo; looked at handedness in chimpanzees, and found that when the apes stand on all fours, they displayed no real hand preferences. It was only when forced to assume an upright stance that a lateral preference emerged &ndash; although individual chimps in the study were equally likely to be left-handed as right-handed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidently, then, something else was needed to push early humans from a lateral preference in general to the extremely high levels of right-handedness we see today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02f8rn8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know roughly when that change occurred from experiments in which researchers made their own versions of ancient stone tools using either their left or right hands to chip &ndash; or knap &ndash; the tool into shape, before comparing them with the tools made by early hominins. Doing so suggests &lt;a href=\"http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~nuomini/Uomini_2005_Lejre-report.pdf\"&gt;there is only limited evidence that hominin toolmakers working more than 2 million years ago were primarily right-handed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248485800877\"&gt;stone tools&lt;/a&gt; that were made some 1.5 million years ago in Koobi Fora, Kenya, by two ancient human species &ndash; &lt;em&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; &ndash; do show some evidence of species-wide right-handedness. And by the time a species called &lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; had appeared, perhaps around 600,000 years ago, there was a &lt;a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~tcrnjst/SteeleUomini2009.pdf\"&gt;clear right-handed preference in prehistoric societies&lt;/a&gt;. Wear on the preserved teeth of &lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, suggest that food was usually brought to the mouth with the right hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02f8rl8\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tells us when that shift occurred, but not why. Some have argued that it all comes down to &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121016-is-language-unique-to-humans\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;. Just as most people are right-handed &ndash; a trait, remember, controlled by the left side of the brain &ndash; so do most people do the bulk of their linguistic processing in their brain&rsquo;s left hemisphere. Indeed, this left-brained specialisation for language is even more common than right-handedness &ndash; which might suggest that as the left hemisphere evolved for language, the preference for the right hand may have intensified simply as a side effect. This is called the &lt;em&gt;Homo loquens&lt;/em&gt; hypothesis: lateralisation in general was driven by the evolution of an upright, bipedal stance, while the rightward preference was driven, some time later, by the evolution of language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-handedness, then, may simply be an accidental by-product of the way most of our brains are wired up. But proving the hypothesis is difficult, or even impossible, since it would ideally involve running neurological tests on our long-dead ancestors. The truth is we'll probably never quite know what the sequence of events was that led our species to lean so overwhelmingly on the right sides of our bodies and the left sides of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the left-handers out there? Take heart! According to a 1977 paper in the journal &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/84/3/385/\"&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, \"there is remarkably little evidence for any association of left-handedness with deficit, as has often been suggested\". In fact, some research shows that left-handed folks might even have an easier time recovering from brain damage. And their left hand seems to have the advantage of surprise in a fight, which means they can be &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23742683\"&gt;better at combat sports&lt;/a&gt;. All of which suggests there are advantages to breaking from the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141215-why-are-most-of-us-right-handed&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2f%2F8r%2Fp02f8rdj.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"&gt;Share this story on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-16T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Evolution: Why are most of us right-handed?","HeadlineShort":"Why are most of us right-handed?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Right-handed people are dominant worldwide  but why?

The more I try to quash it, the more it seems to spread, until it consumes my whole being. Eventually, it is all I can think about &ndash; but how can I stop myself from yawning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provine tells me this often happens when people are talking to him; during presentations, he sometimes finds the majority of his audience with their mouths agape and tonsils swinging. Luckily, as a psychologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and author of Curious Behavior: Yawning, Laughing, Hiccupping, and Beyond, he isn&rsquo;t offended. &ldquo;It makes a very effective lecture,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You talk and then the audience starts yawning. And then you can ask people to experiment on their yawns &ndash; like closing the lips, or inhaling through clenched teeth, or trying to yawn with the nose pinched closed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is through experiments like these that Provine has tried to explore a millennia-old mystery: why do we yawn? We all know that tiredness, boredom, or the sight of someone else can all bring along the almost irrepressible urge &ndash; but what purpose does it serve the body? &nbsp;When he first started work on so-called &ldquo;chasmology&rdquo; in the late 80s, Provine wrote that &ldquo;yawning may have the dubious distinction of being the least understood, common human behaviour&rdquo;. Nearly three decades later, we may be closer to an answer, but it&rsquo;s one that has split the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024lhzh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably the first studier of yawns was the Greek physician Hippocrates &lt;a href=\"http://www.karger.com/Book/Home/253772\"&gt;nearly 2,500 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that yawning helped to release noxious air, particularly during a fever. &ldquo;Like the large quantities of steam that escape from cauldrons when water boils, the accumulated air in the body is violently expelled through the mouth when the body temperature rises,&rdquo; he wrote. Different incarnations of the idea lingered until the 19th Century, when scientists instead proposed that yawning aids respiration &ndash; triggering a rush of oxygen into the blood supply, while flushing out the carbon dioxide. If that were true, you would expect people to yawn more or less frequently depending on the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the air. Yet when Provine asked volunteers to breathe various mixtures of gases, he found no such change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many theories have instead focussed on the strange, contagious nature of yawning &ndash; a fact that I know only too well from my conversation with Provine. &ldquo;Around 50% of people who observe a yawn will yawn in response,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is so contagious that anything associated with it will trigger one&hellip; seeing or hearing another person, or even reading about yawning.&rdquo; For this reason, some researchers have wondered if yawning might be a primitive form of communication &ndash; if so, what information is it transmitting? We often feel tired when we yawn, so one idea is that it helps set everyone&rsquo;s biological clocks to the same rhythm. &ldquo;In my view the most likely signalling role of yawning is to help to synchronize the behaviour of a social group &ndash; to make them go to sleep more or less at the same time,&rdquo; says Christian Hess, at the University of Bern in Switzerland. With the same routine, a group can then work together more efficiently throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024lj80\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet we also yawn during times of stress: &lt;a href=\"http://running.competitor.com/2014/01/training/making-the-case-for-the-pre-race-yawn_36250\"&gt;Olympic athletes often do it before a race&lt;/a&gt;, while musicians sometimes succumb before a concert. So some researchers, including Provine, believe that the strenuous movements might have a more general role in rebooting the brain &ndash; when you are sleepy they make you more alert, or when you are distracted they make you more focussed. Spreading through a group, contagious yawns could then help everyone reach the same level of attention, making them more vigilant to a threat, for instance. The mechanism is somewhat hazy &ndash; though one French researcher, Olivier Walusinski, proposes that yawning helps to &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23813685\"&gt;pump cerebrospinal fluid around the brain&lt;/a&gt;, which could trigger a shift in neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many competing and contradictory ideas, a grand unifying theory of yawning may seem like a distant speck on the horizon. But over the last few years, one underlying mechanism has emerged that could, potentially, appease all these apparent paradoxes in one fell swoop. Andrew Gallup, now at the State University of New York at Oneonta, was first inspired with the idea during his undergraduate degree, when he realised that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534187/\"&gt;yawning might help to chill the brain&lt;/a&gt; and stop it overheating. The violent movement of the jaws moves blood flow around the skull, he argued, helping to carry away excess heat, while the deep inhalation brings cool air into the sinus cavities and around the carotid artery leading back into the brain. What&rsquo;s more, the strenuous movements could also flex the membranes of sinuses &ndash; fanning a soft breeze through the cavities that should cause our mucus to evaporate, which should chill the head like air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most obvious test was to see if people are &lt;a href=\"http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep0592101.pdf\"&gt;more or less likely to yawn in different temperatures&lt;/a&gt;. In normal conditions, Gallup found that around 48% felt the urge to yawn, but when he asked them to hold a cold compress to their foreheads, just 9% succumbed. Breathing through the nose, which could also cool the brain, was even more effective, completely dampening his subjects&rsquo; urge to yawn &ndash; potentially suggesting a handy trick for anyone facing embarrassment during a tedious conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024mgqj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best evidence comes from two troubled women who approached Gallup soon after he first published his results. Both were looking for relief from &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657685\"&gt;pathological yawning attacks, sometimes lasting an hour at a time&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;It was extremely debilitating and interferes with any basic activity,&rdquo; says Gallup. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d have to walk away and go to a secluded area &ndash; it affected their personal and professional lives.&rdquo; Intriguingly, one of the women found the only way to stop the yawning attack was to throw herself into cold water. Inspired, Gallup asked them to place a thermometer in their mouths before and after the attacks. Sure enough, he saw a slight rise in temperature just before the yawning bouts, which continued until it dropped back to 37C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, this brain chill might underlie the many, seemingly contradictory, events that lead to yawning. Our body temperature naturally rises before and after sleep, for instance. Cooling the brain slightly might also make us more alert &ndash; waking us up when we are bored and distracted. And by spreading from person to person, contagious yawns could therefore help a whole group to focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024ljrm\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallup&rsquo;s unified theory has been somewhat contentious among yawning researchers. &ldquo;Gallup&rsquo;s group has failed to present any convincing experimental evidence to support his theory,&rdquo; says Hess. In particular, his critics point out he hasn&rsquo;t made direct measurements of temperature changes in the human brain, though Gallup says he has found the expected fluctuations in yawning rats. Provine is more positive, however &ndash; believing that it could be one way in which yawning helps the brain change state, and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Gallup has managed to find that unified theory, many mysteries remain. Why do foetuses yawn in the womb, for instance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Fetuses-Yawn-in-Utero-|-Video\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could just be that they are practicing for life outside, or perhaps the yawn plays a more active role in guiding the body&rsquo;s growth &ndash; by helping to develop articulation in the jaws joints, for instance, or by encouraging the growth of the lungs, says Provine. If so, Provine suggests that yawning&rsquo;s functions in the womb may be more important than our attacks as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provine also points out that yawning &ndash; and perhaps other bodily functions, like sneezing &ndash; shares some strange parallels with sex. The facial expressions involved are surprisingly similar, he says &ndash; just take a look at this picture and you can see where he&rsquo;s coming from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024mhdk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like sex, yawns and sneezes involve a build-up that ends in a pleasant climax. &ldquo;Once initiated, they go to completion &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want a yawnus interruptus,&rdquo; is how Provine puts it. For these reasons, he wonders if a shared neural machinery underlying these different feelings. &ldquo;Mother Nature does not reinvent the wheel,&rdquo; he says. As evidence, he points to the fact that &lt;a href=\"http://baillement.com/clomipramine.html\"&gt;certain anti-depressants can lead some patients to orgasm during a yawn&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; a rare side effect that could quickly lose its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the temptation to yawn just proved too irresistible during my conversation with Provine. It was a warm summer day, so perhaps my yawns were stopping my brain from over-heating during our stimulating conversation. Whatever function it was serving, the relief was almost worth the agonising wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;m willing to bet you&rsquo;ve been stifling a few yawns yourself by this point &ndash; as Provine points out, reading or even thinking about yawning can be enough to set us off. So go ahead, let it out &ndash; and do so in the knowledge that you are enjoying one of life&rsquo;s most enduring mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-08-12T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"One of science's most baffling questions?

I know a lot of parents who insist that they would like their daughters to wear something different, but pink seems to hold an irresistible allure for them. But is that really true? Is it inevitable that girls are born to grow up to prefer pink? &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various studies have looked at colour preferences in different age groups. In the US most have found that babies and toddlers, whether male or female, are attracted to primary colours such as red and blue. Pink doesn&rsquo;t feature high on the list, although it is more popular than brown and grey. &nbsp;Some studies of this age group have found blue is favoured, others red, but they rarely find any gender difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c5b19\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, research conducted at Newcastle University in the UK asked &lt;a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(07)01559-X\"&gt;adults for their favourite colour&lt;/a&gt;. Did most of the women choose pink, or even red? No. The colour which came out top, for both men and women, was blue. But women, on average, rated the reddish shades more highly than the men did. The authors speculated that this was because hunter-gatherer women traditionally had the job of collecting fruit, so they might be more attuned to reddish shades of berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s not quite clear why this should influence their likes and dislikes. Perhaps it might lead to improved skills in discrimination between different shades of red, but there&rsquo;s a missing step in the logic. Since some red berries are delicious and others are poisonous, why should that make red your favourite colour? If women evolved to prefer red, this should be universal, but a study conducted last year with the Himba people in Namibia found there was &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2012-30151-001/\"&gt;no preference for reddish tones&lt;/a&gt; among women. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Hard-wired colours?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural norms may also shape colour preferences. In cultures where pink is considered the appropriate colour for a baby girl and blue for a baby boy, babies become accustomed from birth to spending time wearing or even surrounded by, those colours. This makes it hard to know whether any preferences expressed later on are hard-wired. But a study from 2011 tried to get closer to discovering what&rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one-year-old girls and boys were shown pairs of identical objects such as bracelets, pill boxes and picture frames, but with one object pink and another of a second colour, they were &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02027.x/abstract\"&gt;no more likely to choose pink than any other colour&lt;/a&gt;. But after the age of two the girls started to like pink and, by four, boys were determined in their rejection of pink. This is the precise time when toddlers start to become aware of their gender, to talk about it and even to look around them to see what defines boy and what defines a girl. But just like adults, even very small children show biases towards their own group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group bias was also seen another study where three-to-five-year-olds were given &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16942493\"&gt;red or blue t-shirts to wear at nursery&lt;/a&gt;. For one group, the red and blue t-shirts were constantly referred to, and by the end of three weeks the children liked everything about their own colour group better. And that was just three weeks. Gender becomes a key topic of discussion from early pregnancy onwards. When we hear the news of the birth of a new baby, there&rsquo;s just one thing we want to know. Is it a boy or a girl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c5b38\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could argue that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what colour babies are exposed to the most, but it can even affect the way we, as adults, treat them. There&rsquo;s one famous study showing that women treated the exact same babies differently &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1128775?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104447047971\"&gt;depending on whether they were dressed in pink or blue&lt;/a&gt;. If the clothes were blue they assumed it was a boy, played more physical games with them and encouraged them to play with a squeaky hammer, whereas they would gently soothe the baby dressed in pink and choose a doll for them to play with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pink for boys?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But what about the idea that a century ago little boys were dressed in pink and pink for girls is only a recent fashion? It seems even that might be something of a myth too. Psychology writer Christian Jarrett describes in his new book Great Myths of the Brain, how an Italian psychologist Marco Del Giudice, who &lt;a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/229437155_The_Twentieth_Century_Reversal_of_Pink-Blue_Gender_Coding_A_Scientific_Urban_Legend\"&gt;tried to find the origins of this idea&lt;/a&gt;, could find just four short magazine quotes, describing pink as the colour for boys. In two of these he believes that perhaps the blue and pink were accidentally swapped around. That seems unlikely to me, but when he searched a database of five million books printed in American or British English from 1800-2000 more convincing was the lack of any mentions of &ldquo;pink for a boy&rdquo;, even though from 1890 onwards there were increasing mentions of &ldquo;pink for a girl&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the association of pink with femininity today can backfire if it&rsquo;s not used in the right way. Pink is often used for breast cancer campaigns, but researchers at Erasmus University Rotterdam found that when &lt;a href=\"http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.413\"&gt;women were shown adverts dominated by the colour pink&lt;/a&gt;, they were in fact less likely to think they&rsquo;d contract breast cancer themselves or to donate money to a cancer charity. The authors don&rsquo;t believe this was because they hated the colour pink, but because when they were reminded of their gender so overtly, the adverts felt so personally threatening that it set off denial mechanisms. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is one way at least in which pink can be useful for both women and men. Back in 2002 researchers in Switzerland who were keen &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12026752\"&gt;to increase the response rate to surveys&lt;/a&gt;, found that printing questionnaires on coloured paper made no difference, unless the paper was pink, in which case 12% more people filled it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colours, it seems, influence our behaviour much more than we realise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hear more Medical Myths on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Check on the BBC World Service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

                You might expect a great philosopher to look past our surface into the depths of the soul  but Ancient Greek thinkers were surprisingly concerned with appearance. Aristotle and his followers even compiled a volume of the ways that your looks could reflect your spirit.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Soft hair indicates cowardice and coarse hair courage," they wrote. Impudence, the treatise says, was evident in "bright, wise-open eyes with heavy blood-shot lids"; a broad nose, meanwhile, was a sign of laziness, like in cattle.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sensuous, fleshy lips fared little better. The philosophers saw it as a sign of folly, "like an ass", while those with especially thin mouths were thought to be proud, like lions.

                Today, we are taught not to judge a book by its cover. But while it is wise not to set too much by appearances, psychologists are finding that your face offers a window on our deepest secrets. Even if you keep a stony poker face, your features can reveal details about your personality, your health, and your intelligence.

                 the wider the face, the more likely they are to hold a higher rank in the groups hierarchy  to professional football players. Examining the 2010 World Cup, Keith Welker at the University of Boulder, Colorado, recently showed that the ratio of the width and height of the footballers faces predicted both the number of fouls among midfielders, and the number of goals scored by the forwards.

                It may even clue you in to a politicians motives. Using volunteers to rate former US presidents on different psychological attributes, Lefevre found that face shape seemed to reflect their perceived ambition and drive.

               <p>
                As you might expect, your health and medical history are also written in your countenance  and the detail it offers is surprising. The amount of fat on your face, for instance, provides a stronger indication of your fitness than more standard measures, such as your body mass index. Those with thinner faces are less likely to suffer infections, and when they do, the illness is less severe; they also tend to have lower rates of depression and anxiety, probably because mental health is often closely related to the bodys fitness in general.
               </p>
               <p>
                How could the plumpness of your cheeks say so much about you? Benedict Jones at the University of Glasgow thinks a new understanding of fats role in the body may help explain it. How healthy you are isnt so much about how much fat you have, but where you have that fat, he says. Pear-shaped people, with more weight around the hips and bottom but slimmer torsos, tend to be healthier than apples with a spare tyre around the midriff, since the adipose tissue around the chest is thought to release inflammatory molecules that can damage the core organs. Perhaps the fullness of your face reflects the fatty deposits in the more harmful areas, Jones says. Or it could be that facial fat is itself dangerous for some reason.

                Besides these more overt cues, very subtle differences in skin colour can also reveal your health secrets. Jones and Lefevre emphasise this has nothing to do with the tones associated with ethnicity, but barely-noticeable tints that may reflect differences in lifestyle. You appear to be in more robust health, for instance, if your skin has a slightly yellowish, golden tone. The pigments in question are called carotenoids, which, as the name suggest, can be found in orange and red fruit and veg. Carotenoids help build a healthy immune system, says Lefevre. But when weve eaten enough, they layer in the skin and dye it yellow. We exhibit them, because we havent used them to battle illness. The glow of health, in turn, contributes significantly to your physical attraction  more so, in fact, than the

                A blush of pink, meanwhile, should signal the good circulation that comes with an active lifestyle  and it might also be a sign of a womans fertility. Jones has found that women tend to adopt a slightly redder flush at the peak of the menstrual cycle,

                As Jones points out, these secrets were hiding in plain sight  yet we were slow to uncover them. At the very least, this knowledge helps restore the reputation of physiognomy, which has suffered a somewhat chequered reputation since Aristotles musings. Tudor king Henry VIII was so sceptical of the idea that he even banned quack professors from

                It will also be interesting to see how the link between personality, lifestyle and appearance changes across the lifetime. One study managed to examine records of personality and appearance, following subjects from the 1930s to the 1990s. The scientists found that although baby-faced men tended to be less dominant in their youth, they grew to be more assertive as the years wore on  perhaps because they learnt to compensate for the expectations brought about by their puppyish appearance.
               </p>

                More intriguingly, the authors also found evidence of a

                </a>
                  where the ageing face began to reflect certain aspects of the personality that hadnt been obvious when the people were younger. Women who had more attractive, sociable, personalities from adolescence to their 30s slowly started to climb in physical attractiveness, so that in their 50s they were considered better-looking than those who had been less personable but naturally prettier. One possibility is that they simply knew how to make the best of their appearance, and that their inner confidence was reflected on subtle differences in expression.

                After all, there is so much more to our appearance than the bone structure and skin tone, as one particularly clever study recently demonstrated. The scientists asked volunteers to wear their favourite clothes, and then took a photo of their face. Even though the clothes themselves were not visible in the mugshots, impartial judges considered them to be considerably more attractive than other pictures of the participants. The finding is particularly striking, considering that they were asked to keep neutral expressions: somehow, the

                anyway.

               <p>
                Our faces arent just the product of our biology. We cant change our genes or our hormones  but by cultivating our personality and sense of self-worth, they may begin to mirror something far more important.
