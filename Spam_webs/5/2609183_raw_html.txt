   There once was a man from Ellstree
   <br/>
   Who was horribly stung by a wasp.
   <br/>
   When asked, "Does it hurt?"
   <br/>
   He replied, "Not at all;
   <br/>
   I'm glad it wasn't a hornet!"

   There once was a poet named Dan
   <br/>
   Who was told, "Your poems don't scan."
   <br/>
   When told this was so,
   <br/>
   He replied, "Yes, I know,
   <br/>
   But this way I fit as many extra syllables into the last line as I 
possibly can!"

   There was a musician from Utrecht,
   <br/>
   Whose trumpet was mottled and blue-specked.
   <br/>
   Because of the cold,
   <br/>
   It started to mold,
   <br/>
   And his fuguing, de-Bached, became Brubecked.

   There once was a gaucho named Bruno
   <br/>
   Who said, "Sex is one thing I do know:
   <br/>
   A woman is fine,
   <br/>
   And sheep are divine,
   <br/>
   But llamas are numero uno!"

   What a wonderful bird is the pelican.
   <br/>
   His beak can hold more than his belican.
   <br/>
   He can hold in his beak
   <br/>
   Enough food for a week,
   <br/>
   But I don't know how the helican.

   REQUIEM
   <br/>
   There was a young belle of old Natchez
   <br/>
   Whose garments were always in patchez.
   <br/>
   When comment arose
   <br/>
   On the state of her clothes,
   <br/>
   She replied, "When Ah itchez, Ah scratchez."

   A canner exceedingly canny
   <br/>
   One morning remarked to his granny,
   <br/>
   "A canner can can
   <br/>
   Anything that he can,
   <br/>
   But a canner can't can a can, can he?"

   A tooter who tooted a flute
   <br/>
   Tried to tutor two tooters to toot.
   <br/>
   Said the the two to the tutor,
   <br/>
   "Is it harder to toot,
   <br/>
   Or to tutor two tooters to toot?"

   There was a young lady named Bright
   <br/>
   Whose speed was much faster than light.
   <br/>
   She set out one day,
   <br/>
   In a relative way,
   <br/>
   And returned on the previous night.

   She frowned and called him Mr.
   <br/>
   Because, in sport, he kr.
   <br/>
   And so, in spite,

   That very night,

   This Mr. kr. sr.

   I'd rather have fingers than toes;
   <br/>
   I'd rather have eyes than a nose;
   <br/>
   And, as for my hair,
   <br/>
   I'm glad it's all there;
   <br/>
   I'll be awfully sad when it goes!
