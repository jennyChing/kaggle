         Stand up paddle boarding
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 350
        <br/>

        Stand up paddle boarding (aka SUP) might look intimidating, but the way the board is designed makes it easy for anyone to do, according to Kim Truman, a certified personal trainer and outdoor athletic coach. SUP is done on a large surfboard, which provides a wider area to stand on and balance. And while this activity can be almost meditative, youll still be strengthening your upper back, legs, glutes and abs while developing balance and coordination, too.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        To help maximize your workoutand minimize your chances of falling offTruman suggests standing with feet hip width apart on the board, maintaining good posture and starting your paddle strokes on your dominant side (right if you're right handed) to help to find your rhythm, balance and strengthen your connection to both the board and the water. Once you're steady, start alternating sides after every third stroke.

         Hiking
        </strong>

        Not only does hiking offer a physical challenge, it gets you out into nature, which can boost your mood. And the beautiful scenery and changing terrain shifts your focus to your movement and surroundings, taking your mind off exercising (unlike the boring repetition of a treadmill). Hiking is one workout you can't help but fall in love with, Truman says. Hiking is a great cardio workout that challenges all of your muscles as the terrain shifts (going uphill and stepping over rocks), says Truman. The pace of your hike will influence the intensity of your workout and how many calories you burn, so pick a trail that meets both your fitness level and goals.
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        Never go alone hiking aloneif you get easy lost or stuck you need a buddy -- and plan out a route in advance.

        <strong>
         Biking
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 400
        <br/>

        It may have been years since you last rode your bike, but its never too late to get back in the saddle! Riding a bike outdoors offers even more benefits than a stationary bike since youll have to balance, steer your bike and respond to changing terrain as you pedal. Cycling works your glutes, thighs and hamstrings as well as your core, Truman says.
       </p>
       <p>
        She recommends trying a pedal stroke interval to amp up your calorie burn and improve your cardiovascular fitness: Pedal as fast as you can for 60 seconds, then slow down and recover for 20, repeat five times in total. Make it a cardio and mental game knowing you're getting stronger with each pedal stroke, says Truman. Wear clothing that is easy to pedal in (such as bike shorts) and stiff-soled or bike shoes.
       </p>
       <p>

        <strong>
         Swimming
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 425
       </p>
       <p>
        Want a total body workout thats easy on your joints but still a great calorie burner? Try swimming! Swimming challenges your muscles because of the density of the water. Your own body weight is your resistance and you are working much harder than you will feel in the moment, Truman says. Swimming develops strong, lean muscles as well as strengthening your core and low back to help protect your spine and improve posture, she notes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Truman recommends focusing on your form and breathing with each stroke -- if you are new to swimming, just get comfortable with moving in the water. The faster your pace and the shorter your rest time in between laps, the more intense your workout (and calorie burn) will be.

        <strong>
         Beach volleyball
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 500
       </p>
       <p>
        Turn exercising into a fun game with volleyballyou'll get both a strength-training and cardio session. Volleyball is a fabulous total body workout; its interval training at its best. You work hard, using the legs and butt to get under the ball, core to maintain your balance, and upper body to power through, followed by a period of rest, but you never know how long, says fitness expert Sara Haley, creator of the Daily Sweat DVDs Sweat UNLIMITED and Expecting More. And, playing in the soft, uneven terrain of sand on the beach means youll be working even harder (translation: burning up extra calories) than on a flat, indoor court every time you go to spike that ball. If you're not near a beach start a game of pool volleyball  it's just as challenging (and fun).
       </p>

        <strong>
         Rollerblading
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 800
       </p>
       <p>
        If you love the feeling of running outdoors but find it too hard on your joints, give rollerblading a whirl. Rollerblading, once you get the hang of it, is an incredibly effective cardio workout, Haley says. Its low-impact, so it places less stress on the joints and muscles then running or aerobics. Plus, you use more muscle groups, especially your core, to maintain your balance, she explains.
       </p>
       <p>
        Skating through a park with level terrain and no traffic is a great place to get your bearings and practice building your speed. Dont worry if you arent good at it in the beginningpractice makes perfect. The best way to get better at rollerblading is to just get out and do it. Youll be having so much fun learning a new skill, youll forget youre working out, says Haley.

         Yoga in the park
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 175
       </p>
       <p>
        Summers warmer weather makes it the perfect time of year to try an outdoor yoga, which is often offered in local parks as a sunrise or sunset group class. Most outdoor yoga classes are for all levels (check with your instructor first to be sure), making it easy for beginners to join in without any prior experience. Depending on the type of yoga, you might experience the benefits of flexibility, strength and/or cardiovascular training. Plus, youll have the most amazing backdrop, as you see the sun rise or set around you, Haley says.
       </p>
       <p>
        Come prepared for class in an outfit that youll feel comfortable wearing in both standing and floor postures. Most classes are BYM (bring your own mat) and toting a towel can be helpful if sweat and dirt start to show up on your mat.
       </p>

        <strong>
         Gardening
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Average Hourly Calorie Burn: 250
       </p>
       <p>
        If you've never planted a garden, you may not think of gardening as exercise, but it's a great full body workout! If you are doing some serious gardening, such as digging holes, planting and weeding, you will exert a significant workload, which can sometimes work the body harder than most typical exercise, explains Haley. From raking, lifting, pushing, pulling and shoveling, gardening is a complete body workout for the butt, legs, back, chest, arms and abs, she says.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take breaks every hour from that forward, hunched over position by standing up and walking around. Try a few standing back extensions to help relieve any stiffness. Get inspired to dig into the dirt with these amazing garden designs for spaces and landscapes of all shapes and sizes.
