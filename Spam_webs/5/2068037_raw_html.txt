        Soon after I began training as a psychotherapist, I knew 
          that I was going to have a major problem with Faith. I hoped that these 
          doubts would fade, that my initial cynical mistrust of what seemed like 
          selfserving, madeup gibberish would soon be challenged 
          by the irrefutable (or at least plausible) evidence of Science and direct 
          experience. Alas, it only got worse as I went along.

        Upon close examination the bizarre, competing theories of 
          psychotherapy turned out to be even cheesier than they looked from a 
          distance. The empirical data was just as damning; no reputable researcher 
          has ever managed to document much significant benefit from headshrinking. 
          And my personal experience, as a properly trained and wellrespected 
          therapist, only confirmed my initial impression that the vast majority 
          of psychotherapy is a waste of time, equally likely to harm as to help.

        Back when I'd first considered the Profession it seemed 
          uniquely attractive. Sitting at my desk at my clerical job, which I'd 
          held for nearly three years at that point (a personal best in my occupational 
          history), I'd had plenty of time to contemplate the meaningless quality 
          of most Work, and especially of my particular work. In fact, that was 
          the period of my life when I first consciously embraced my Bad Attitude. 
          Previously I'd simply avoided and ignored the phenomenon of Work as 
          much as I could in a naive, unthinking way, without ever truly coming 
          to grips with it.

        There were a number of purely pragmatic and practical advantages 
          to Becoming a Psychotherapist. Qualifying for The Profession required 
          (at least) four years of graduate school, or from my perspective, that 
          much more heavily subsidized prolonged adolescence and absence from 
          the fulltime workforce. Thus, craftily, I committed to ending 
          my career of perpetual postponement by taking just one, last halfdecade 
          detour. For me, at least, School was fun as well as meaningful, in stark 
          contrast to my current situation which was neither.

        It was also prestigious, and would delight my bourgeois 
          relatives (who found my career up to then somewhat disappointing) and 
          piss the hell out of my boss, to say nothing of boosting my own selfesteem 
          as I ascended from lowly clerk to haughty, intellectual professional.

        Finally, while I was still far from sharing the consumerist 
          aspirations of the vast majority of my peers, I was beginning to feel 
          the allure of a comfortable, middleclass existence. If I absolutely 
          had to work to support myself I might as well have a cushy job that, 
          at its basic level, amounted to sitting around and talking to people 
          and telling them how to run their lives better. Frankly, I felt I had 
          some natural talents in this direction.

        I still think I do, but I've given up on the notion of shrinking 
          heads for a living. I've also surrendered to the painfully obvious fact 
          that Psychotherapy is most certainly no Science (though it may qualify 
          as an Art) and is a sad species of Profession, offering little of 
          value in return for its amazingly steep fees. Overall I would judge 
          it as valid, helpful and consistent a practice as the fortunetelling 
          done by the
        <i>
         brujas

        who run little

        in marginal 
          urban neighborhoods across the U.S.: the customers are satisfied and 
          keep coming back, but it's difficult for the rest of us to detect any 
          true benefits from these questionable ministrations.

        Declining health due to AIDS gave me a good excuse to retire 
          from the field after only a few years as a processional psychotherapist. 
          In fact, counseling is an easy profession for a fatiguedisabled 
          person (after all, you get to sit the whole time and can limit your 
          client load to match your energy level); but I had no stomach for it. 
          If my time were limited, as it pretty much seems to be, did I really 
          want to spend my precious hours listening to people whine and rationalize 
          about why they had to live their lives exactly as they were, despite 
          how miserable it was making them?

        Viewed from that cold, harsh perspective, the answer was 
          clearly no, and so I retired, not quite seven years after I'd started.

        Reagan was just beginning his second term (1984) when I 
          entered graduate school. I was one of a cohort of seven neophytes being 
          initiated into the Counseling Psychology program, a subgroup 
          of the department's crop of 30 or so firstyear graduate students. 
          About a dozen or so more were students in Clinical Psychology  the 
          differences between Counseling and Clinical Psychology were endlessly 
          debated but are, for all intents and purposes, nonexistent, having 
          more to do with academic turf division than anything else. The remaining 
          Psych grad students were in the Experimental (i.e., nonclinical, 
          research oriented) program.

        But Experimental, Counseling or Clinical, we were all selected 
          for our promise as academics and researchers, rather than for clinical 
          skills potential and this showed. It was wellknown that expressing 
          any interest in the professional practice of psychotherapy was the kiss 
          of death as far as getting accepted into programs like ours at large, 
          cheap state universities, which (mostly) supported you while providing 
          training as a clinician. There are also urban professional schools, 
          but these are upscale private institutions along the lines of law and 
          business schools, charging top dollar in return for the prospect of 
          easy entry into profitable guild, providing meaningful work.

        Few of us were really interested in becoming academics or 
          researchers and we mostly had our hearts set on Becoming Therapists, 
          but we were all savvy enough to figure on concealing this for the next 
          four years.

        In line with this largely inaccurate assumption that we 
          were all primarily motivated as researchers, the bulk of our classwork 
          focused on statistics and a review of the relevant body of research 
          on clinical psychology, rather than on clinical skills  not, but the 
          way, that these can really be taught, but it was distressing to see 
          them dismissed so easily. The statistics were boring. The research was 
          horrifying in its revelation of psychotherapy's emptiness, at least 
          as regards empirical evidence. The clinical skills stuff, when we finally 
          got around to it, was fun but worrisome.

        We began by doing role plays, acting out the part of shrinker 
          and shrinkee and practicing the basic therapeutic techniques: simple 
          reflective statements and reframings (It sounds like you feel that

        Then, in our second semester, we graduated to working on 
          live clients, depressed freshmen who'd reported to the university counseling 
          center and been turned over to us as guinea pigs. Therapy is one of 
          those things that can only be learned by doing. Sessions were taped 
          and presumably reviewed by supervisors, though in practice (as I learned 
          as a fourth year student, when I provided such supervision to the fresh 
          crop of neophytes) this uninteresting chore was often sloughed over; 
          it was enough that you knew that someone COULD be listening to your 
          efforts.

        As we progressed, we received more advanced clients, seriously 
          flippedout seniors instead of just homesick freshmen. You were 
          expected to justify all interventions by one of the halfdozen 
          or so generally accepted competing theories of therapy (e.g. psychoanalytic, 
          humanistic, or rationalemotive [isn't that an oxymoron?] approaches), 
          but it really didn't matter too much which you used. Anything that didn't 
          drive the patients to suicide or litigation was acceptable.

        In our later years, we did internships at local mental health 
          centers and agencies. If you were a good finangler or kissed the right 
          butts, you could get one that actually paid money. Otherwise you had 
          to do unpaid therapy as part of paying your dues and logging your hours. 
          There was no serious attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of your work, 
          as the standards of practice were broad and lenient. Only the most blatantly 
          and monumentally incompetent therapists ever had any trouble getting 
          byand even those ended up getting their degrees (and, subsequently, 
          jobs) without too much trouble. The standard of care is so low that 
          just about anyone not actively hallucinating can meet it.

        An ironic thing about headshrinking, a phenomenon 
          that illustrates its paradoxical nature, is that the more dangerous, 
          useful and necessary your work, the less it pays and the less training 
          it requires. Most suicide prevention hotlines are staffed by unpaid 
          volunteers. Looking after dangerously psychotic people in a halfway 
          house requires only a high school diploma and pays little above minimum 
          wage. Doing essentially the same work in a highsecurity private 
          psych hospital (like the multitudinous Barclay's chain) usually requires 
          a 2year degree, but pays like a mediumscale union job. 
          Many of these Psych Techs are on exactly the same antihallucination 
          meds as their clients (but, presumably, are responding more effectively 
          to them).

        Doing field work to prevent child abuse, ostensibly one 
          of our nation's sacred duties and highest priorities, is poorly paid 
          and often acutely dangerous. Child protection workers in rural areas 
          have a high mortality rate because of triggerhappy backwoods 
          molesters with no patience for the Law's endless quibbles about age 
          of consent and degrees of consanguity. Often counselors' only training 
          is an advanced home ec or mental hygiene class in high school; accordingly, 
          the job tends to pay small town librarian's wages, maybe $15,000 per 
          year. But a dozen years down the road, counseling the wounded Inner 
          Child that (presumably results) from such early abuse easily pays $100 
          an hour.

        A shrink who focuses on traditional psychotherapy (i.e. 
          hourlong weekly meeting for perhaps many years [or even decades] 
          with highfunctioning, wellpaid but slightly neurotic yuppies) 
          can hope to earn close to a hundred thousand dollars with a decent practice. 
          To do this safe and wellpaid work requires, oddly, several years'

        This rule of inverse effort holds across the board in the 
          The Profession with logarithmic consistency. An agency therapist, like 
          the staff at a Counseling Center, gets the stability of a regular wage 
          and benefits but earns half of what s/he'd make with a good practice. 
          Topline therapists can hold lucrative training seminars, or even 
          found new theoretical schools of psychotherapy. This is wellpaid, 
          prestigious and rewarding work: it also removes you from direct contact 
          with those whiny, demanding clients.

        There are three things that keep Psychotherapy from becoming 
          a worthwhile profession. They are: the pseudoscientific system 
          of training; the potential shrinks who present themselves for this training; 
          and the clients who indiscriminately patronize these helpers who seem 
          mostly to help themselves.

        The ability to read someone's vibes, to detect phoniness 
          and the lurking, evil glint of psychotic madness, is to some extent 
          an inborn skill. You got it or you don't; and as with learning to draw 
          or sculpt or play music, natural abilities can be enhanced (or disfigured) 
          but not created out of nothing. Contemporary psychology, determined 
          as it is to assert its full status as a Science rather than a mere Art, 
          refuses to acknowledge this. Thus it shuns its proper  and doable 
           task of weeding out the deadheads and finetuning the naturals, 
          instead opting to teach all and sundry a rigid and largely ineffective 
          psychometric technology.

        A true Art of psychotherapy would put much more emphasis 
          by selection of both shrinks and shrinkees, use a more pragmatic and 
          practical teaching approach, and critically evaluate results strictly 
          on the basis of clinical effectiveness. Currently most therapists are 
          credentialed on the basis of academic achievement (e.g. passing classes, 
          writing these, etc.) and evaluated just once in their careers  at licensing 
          time  by their score on a written test. Existing technology would permit 
          performancebased testing, but the gatekeepers of The Profession 
          are painfully aware that the majority of its established, credentialed, 
          highranking practitioners could not pass such an exam.

        Then there is the question of who wants to become a shrink, 
          and why. I described my own frankly selfinterested motives above. 
          They may seem mercenary or tangential, but people whose primary drive 
          is to Help are usually lousy therapists, ranging from merely ineffectual 
          to actively destructive. I call them the Helping Vampires. They long 
          to rescue the world, to bond with the confused and downtrodden, to straighten 
          out the disordered lives of their hapless clients by their own sage 
          advice and moral vigor. Crazies often really cotton to them, which sometimes 
          gives them a deceptive aura of competence; but they mostly exacerbate 
          their helpee's symptoms until they blow up, at which point the Helping 
          Vampire dumps them on a competent colleague or into whatever safety 
          net offers itself.

        Finally, there are the clients. Some are people in crisis, 
          briefly disoriented and wanting help to get back on an even keel but 
          basically sound. Motivated and competent, they are easy to work with, 
          quickly identify and resolve the issues that brought them to therapy, 
          and move on.

        Most clients, however, are chronically afflicted longterm 
          neurotics who only want an hour to complain and carp without fear of 
          contradiction. They will pay for this; most of them have to, as their 
          friends certainly won't listen to this stuff for free. They seem to 
          have no center, let alone any central issues, and are content to stay

        Thus these chronics and lifers naturally tend to dominate

        Sigmund Freud, the great Viennese inventor of the talking

        But contemporary psychoanalysts, the direct descendants 
          of Freud, are just as kooky; what's more, they're generally politically 
          conservative, impossibly rigid and frankly exploitative. True psychoanalysis 
          requires
        <i>
         at least
        </i>
        five years of meeting three times a week. It 
          could take more if you express too much resistance. To be admitted 
          to the official psychoanalytic society, you must have successfully completed 
          analysis with someone who was shrunk himself in direct link back to 
          Freud himself, as if this conferred some spiritual or mystical immunity

        According to the research done by scientists attempting

          of all possible alternatives. Drugs are cheaper (and work faster). Daily 
          exercise regulates the mood better than the talking cure (and treats

          the thousands of dollars spent.

        Good therapy should produce change. Yet most clients are 
          actually seeking to avoid change, to continue living the way they are 
          but to somehow stop hurting. Their jobs drive them crazy, so they consider 
          taking Prozac or talking with you for an hour every week. But the best 
          thing they could do, probably, is change jobs. This is usually one of 
          the last things they're willing to consider. Instead, they want a quick 
          fix that allows them to change as little as possible.

        This is even more obvious when treating the numberone 
          psychotherapeutic complaint: Bad relationships or dysfunctional families. 
          Is your partner: addicted, abusive, asexual, indifferent, cruel, neglectful, 
          insensitive, stupid, lazy, evil, dishonest, and/or no fun to be with? 
          Well, then, leave the bum! Is that so difficult to figure out? Should 
          conveying that really take more than a few sessions? But, but, but! 
          they will stammer, and go on to explain why this isn't possible.

        Their problem is a dysfunctional relationship. Yet instead 
          of refusing to participate in it, they seek you out for another lopsided, 
          dysfunctional relationship of a different sort. By piling one unbalanced 
          relationship upon another, they hope to reach equilibrium. And that's 
          exactly what they get, the perpetuation of a poor compromise that makes 
          them miserable.

        Why can't people just talk (for free) to their friends and 
          partners? Because that is exactly what they seek to avoid. By restricting 
          these revelations to a hired stranger one further alienates them, moves 
          them away from their central issues. The rising popularity of longterm 
          psychotherapy is a symptom of declining emotional stability and increasing 
          alienation. Like TV, it's a cure that makes the illness worse.

        If families spent less time silently glued to their televisions, 
          they might be able to support one another emotionally without subcontracting 
          this chore to outsiders. If people lived in genuine groupings based 
          on common interests, instead of being isolated in nuclear families 
          by accident of birth, they could avoid much of the pain currently expressed, 
          quietly, in the private chambers of psychotherapists.

        And, finally and most importantly, if people led meaningful 
          lives in the first place instead of being yoked to pointless and painful 
          careers performing worthless labor, perhaps they wouldn't suffer so 
          much. As it stands, this pain merely justifies one more mostly meaningless 
          profession: psychotherapy
