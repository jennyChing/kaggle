         Animal care staff at the San Diego Zoo have determined that their new hippopotamus calf is a girl after nearly two months of waiting. The calf, born March 23, 2015 has been named Devi. Due to the very protective nature of a hippo mom, the calf was often kept tucked into vegetation growing along the edge of the hippo pool. Her mother, Funani, would also place her body between the baby and the viewing area. While she hasn't been weighed, keepers estimate that Devi weights between 90 and 110 pounds. Funani weighs nearly 3,500 pounds.

         Tuah, the 5-month-old Bornean orangutan looks on in the Great Ape Building at Utah's Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City, April 10, 2015. A handful of animal keepers at Salt Lake City's Hogle Zoo found themselves with a tiny red-headed charge when Eve, a Bornean orangutan, died a few weeks after giving birth. Now 5 months old, the 14-inch, 11-pound Tuah is starting to crawl. Tuah was revealed to the public on Saturday, with visitors -- some of whom wore &quot;I met Tuah&quot; buttons -- lining up around the ape building to catch their first glimpse.

         A baby orangutan named Budi, who was left deformed after being crammed into a chicken coop for most of his life is recovering after being rescued by a UK animal charity, Feb. 9, 2015. Tiny Budi was squashed into a chicken coop in Ketapang, West Borneo and fed only condensed milk for ten months becoming malnourished and unable to grow properly. Since highlighting his plight, IAR has received more than 50,000 in donations and Budi, who was too weak to even open his mouth at first is now eating and responding well to treatment.

The baby, whose name and gender have yet to be determined, is on exhibit and doing well. Black howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) are native to central South America, south of the Amazon River basin. Howler monkeys have enlarged lower jaws which accommodate egg-shaped resonating chambers that allow them to make the very loud, reverberating sounds which give them their name.
