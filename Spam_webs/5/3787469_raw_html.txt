       <br/>
       Translation of the lecture on Pure Intuition and the lyrical nature of

       <br/>
       Philosophy at Heidelberg.

       INTRODUCTION
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There are always Americas to be discovered: the most interesting in
       <br/>
       Europe.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I can lay no claim to having discovered an America, but I do claim to
       <br/>
       have discovered a Columbus. His name is Benedetto Croce, and he dwells
       <br/>
       on the shores of the Mediterranean, at Naples, city of the antique
       <br/>
       Parthenope.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Croce's America cannot be expressed in geographical terms. It is more
       <br/>
       important than any space of mountain and river, of forest and dale. It
       <br/>
       belongs to the kingdom of the spirit, and has many provinces. That
       <br/>
       province which most interests me, I have striven in the following pages
       <br/>
       to annex to the possessions of the Anglo-Saxon race; an act which cannot
       <br/>
       be blamed as predatory, since it may be said of philosophy more truly
       <br/>
       than of love, that "to divide is not to take away."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Historical Summary will show how many a brave adventurer has
       <br/>
       navigated the perilous seas of speculation upon Art, how Aristotle's
       <br/>
       marvellous insight gave him glimpses of its beauty, how Plato threw away
       <br/>
       its golden fruit, how Baumgarten sounded the depth of its waters, Kant
       <br/>
       sailed along its coast without landing, and Vico hoisted the Italian
       <br/>
       flag upon its shore.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But Benedetto Croce has been the first thoroughly to explore it, cutting
       <br/>
       his way inland through the tangled undergrowth of imperfect thought. He
       <br/>
       has measured its length and breadth, marked out and described its
       <br/>
       spiritual features with minute accuracy. The country thus won to
       <br/>
       philosophy will always bear his name, _Estetica di Croce_, a new
       <br/>
       America.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It was at Naples, in the winter of 1907, that I first saw the Philosopher
       <br/>
       of Aesthetic. Benedetto Croce, although born in the Abruzzi, Province of
       <br/>
       Aquila (1866), is essentially a Neapolitan, and rarely remains long absent
       <br/>
       from the city, on the shore of that magical sea, where once Ulysses
       <br/>
       sailed, and where sometimes yet (near Amalfi) we may hear the Syrens sing
       <br/>
       their song. But more wonderful than the song of any Syren seems to me the
       <br/>
       Theory of Aesthetic as the Science of Expression, and that is why I have
       <br/>
       overcome the obstacles that stood between me and the giving of this
       <br/>
       theory, which in my belief is the truth, to the English-speaking world.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       No one could have been further removed than myself, as I turned over at
       <br/>
       Naples the pages of _La Critica_, from any idea that I was nearing the
       <br/>
       solution of the problem of Art. All my youth it had haunted me. As an
       <br/>
       undergraduate at Oxford I had caught the exquisite cadence of Walter
       <br/>
       Pater's speech, as it came from his very lips, or rose like the perfume
       <br/>
       of some exotic flower from the ribbed pages of the _Renaissance_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Seeming to solve the riddle of the Sphinx, he solved it not--only
       <br/>
       delighted with pure pleasure of poetry and of subtle thought as he led
       <br/>
       one along the pathways of his Enchanted Garden, where I shall always
       <br/>
       love to tread.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Oscar Wilde, too, I had often heard at his best, the most brilliant
       <br/>
       talker of our time, his wit flashing in the spring sunlight of Oxford
       <br/>
       luncheon-parties as now in his beautiful writings, like the jewelled
       <br/>
       rapier of Mercutio. But his works, too, will be searched in vain by the
       <br/>
       seeker after definite aesthetic truth.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       With A.C. Swinburne I had sat and watched the lava that yet flowed from
       <br/>
       those lips that were kissed in youth by all the Muses. Neither from him
       <br/>
       nor from J.M. Whistler's brilliant aphorisms on art could be gathered
       <br/>
       anything more than the exquisite pleasure of the moment: the
       <br/>
       _monochronos haedonae_. Of the great pedagogues, I had known, but never
       <br/>
       sat at the feet of Jowett, whom I found far less inspiring than any of
       <br/>
       the great men above mentioned. Among the dead, I had studied Herbert
       <br/>
       Spencer and Matthew Arnold, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Guyau: I had
       <br/>
       conversed with that living Neo-Latin, Anatole France, the modern
       <br/>
       Rousseau, and had enjoyed the marvellous irony and eloquence of his
       <br/>
       writings, which, while they delight the society in which he lives, may
       <br/>
       well be one of the causes that lead to its eventual destruction.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The solution of the problem of Aesthetic is not in the gift of the Muses.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To return to Naples. As I looked over those pages of the bound volumes
       <br/>
       of _La Critica_. I soon became aware that I was in the presence of a
       <br/>
       mind far above the ordinary level of literary criticism. The profound
       <br/>
       studies of Carducci, of d'Annunzio, and of Pascoli (to name but three),
       <br/>
       in which those writers passed before me in all their strength and in all
       <br/>
       their weakness, led me to devote several days to the _Critica_. At the
       <br/>
       end of that time I was convinced that I had made a discovery, and wrote
       <br/>
       to the philosopher, who owns and edits that journal.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In response to his invitation, I made my way, on a sunny day in November,
       <br/>
       past the little shops of the coral-vendors that surround, like a
       <br/>
       necklace, the Rione de la Bellezza, and wound zigzag along the
       <br/>
       over-crowded Toledo. I knew that Signor Croce lived in the old part of
       <br/>
       the town, but had hardly anticipated so remarkable a change as I
       <br/>
       experienced on passing beneath the great archway and finding myself in
       <br/>
       old Naples. This has already been described elsewhere, and I will not
       <br/>
       here dilate upon this world within a world, having so much of greater
       <br/>
       interest to tell in a brief space. I will merely say that the costumes
       <br/>
       here seemed more picturesque, the dark eyes flashed more dangerously
       <br/>
       than elsewhere, there was a quaint life, an animation about the streets,
       <br/>
       different from anything I had known before. As I climbed the lofty stone
       <br/>
       steps of the Palazzo to the floor where dwells the philosopher of
       <br/>
       Aesthetic I felt as though I had stumbled into the eighteenth century
       <br/>
       and were calling on Giambattista Vico. After a brief inspection by a
       <br/>
       young man with the appearance of a secretary, I was told that I was
       <br/>
       expected, and admitted into a small room opening out of the hall.
       <br/>
       Thence, after a few moments' waiting, I was led into a much larger room.
       <br/>
       The walls were lined all round with bookcases, barred and numbered,
       <br/>
       filled with volumes forming part of the philosopher's great library. I
       <br/>
       had not long to wait. A door opened behind me on my left, and a rather
       <br/>
       short, thick-set man advanced to greet me, and pronouncing my name at
       <br/>
       the same time with a slight foreign accent, asked me to be seated beside
       <br/>
       him. After the interchange of a few brief formulae of politeness in
       <br/>
       French, our conversation was carried on in Italian, and I had a better
       <br/>
       opportunity of studying my host's air and manner. His hands he held
       <br/>
       clasped before him, but frequently released them, to make those vivid
       <br/>
       gestures with which Neapolitans frequently clinch their phrase. His most
       <br/>
       remarkable feature was his eyes, of a greenish grey: extraordinary eyes,
       <br/>
       not for beauty, but for their fathomless depth, and for the sympathy
       <br/>
       which one felt welling up in them from the soul beneath. This was
       <br/>
       especially noticeable as our conversation fell upon the question of Art
       <br/>
       and upon the many problems bound up with it. I do not know how long that
       <br/>
       first interview lasted, but it seemed a few minutes only, during which
       <br/>
       was displayed before me a vast panorama of unknown height and headland,
       <br/>
       of league upon league of forest, with its bright-winged birds of thought
       <br/>
       flying from tree to tree down the long avenues into the dim blue vistas
       <br/>
       of the unknown.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I returned with my brain awhirl, as though I had been in fairyland, and
       <br/>
       when I looked at the second edition of the _Estetica_, with his
       <br/>
       inscription, I was sure of it.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These lines will suffice to show how the translation of the _Estetica_
       <br/>
       originated from the acquaintance thus formed, which has developed into
       <br/>
       friendship. I will now make brief mention of Benedetto Croce's other
       <br/>
       work, especially in so far as it throws light upon the _Aesthetic_.
       <br/>
       For this purpose, besides articles in Italian and German reviews, I
       <br/>
       have made use of the excellent monograph on the philosopher, by G.
       <br/>
       Prezzolini.[1]
       <br/>
       <br/>
       First, then, it will be well to point out that the _Aesthetic_ forms
       <br/>
       part of a complete philosophical system, to which the author gives the
       <br/>
       general title of "Philosophy of the Spirit." The _Aesthetic_ is the
       <br/>
       first of the three volumes. The second is the _Logic_, the third the
       <br/>
       _Philosophy of the Practical_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the _Logic_, as elsewhere in the system, Croce combats that false
       <br/>
       conception, by which natural science, in the shape of psychology, makes
       <br/>
       claim to philosophy, and formal logic to absolute value. The thesis of
       <br/>
       the _pure concept_ cannot be discussed here. It is connected with the
       <br/>
       logic of evolution as discovered by Hegel, and is the only logic which
       <br/>
       contains in itself the interpretation and the continuity of reality.
       <br/>
       Bergson in his _L'Evolution Creatrice_ deals with logic in a somewhat
       <br/>
       similar manner. I recently heard him lecture on the distinction between
       <br/>
       spirit and matter at the College de France, and those who read French
       <br/>
       and Italian will find that both Croce's _Logic_ and the book above
       <br/>
       mentioned by the French philosopher will amply repay their labour. The
       <br/>
       conception of nature as something lying outside the spirit which informs
       <br/>
       it, as the non-being which aspires to being, underlies all Croce's
       <br/>
       thought, and we find constant reference to it throughout his
       <br/>
       philosophical system.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       With regard to the third volume, the _Philosophy of the Practical_, it
       <br/>
       is impossible here to give more than a hint of its treasures. I merely
       <br/>
       refer in passing to the treatment of the will, which is posited as a
       <br/>
       unity _inseparable from the volitional act_. For Croce there is no
       <br/>
       difference between action and intention, means and end: they are one
       <br/>
       thing, inseparable as the intuition-expression of Aesthetic. The
       <br/>
       _Philosophy of the Practical_ is a logic and science of the will, not a
       <br/>
       normative science. Just as in Aesthetic the individuality of expression
       <br/>
       made models and rules impossible, so in practical life the individuality
       <br/>
       of action removes the possibility of catalogues of virtues, of the exact
       <br/>
       application of laws, of the existence of practical judgments and
       <br/>
       judgments of value _previous to action_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The reader will probably ask here: But what, then, becomes of morality?
       <br/>
       The question will be found answered in the _Theory of Aesthetic_, and I
       <br/>
       will merely say here that Croce's thesis of the _double degree_ of the
       <br/>
       practical activity, economic and moral, is one of the greatest
       <br/>
       contributions to modern thought. Just as it is proved in the _Theory of
       <br/>
       Aesthetic_ that the _concept_ depends upon the _intuition_, which is the
       <br/>
       first degree, the primary and indispensable thing, so it is proved in
       <br/>
       the _Philosophy of the Practical_ that _Morality_ or _Ethic_ depends
       <br/>
       upon _Economic_, which is the _first_ degree of the practical activity.
       <br/>
       The volitional act is _always economic_, but true freedom of the will
       <br/>
       exists and consists in conforming not merely to economic, but to moral
       <br/>
       conditions, to the human spirit, which is greater than any individual.
       <br/>
       Here we are face to face with the ethics of Christianity, to which Croce
       <br/>
       accords all honour.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This Philosophy of the Spirit is symptomatic of the happy reaction of
       <br/>
       the twentieth century against the crude materialism of the second half
       <br/>
       of the nineteenth. It is the spirit which gives to the work of art its
       <br/>
       value, not this or that method of arrangement, this or that tint or
       <br/>
       cadence, which can always be copied by skilful plagiarists: not so the
       <br/>
       _spirit_ of the creator. In England we hear too much of (natural)
       <br/>
       science, which has usurped the very name of Philosophy. The natural
       <br/>
       sciences are very well in their place, but discoveries such as aviation
       <br/>
       are of infinitely less importance to the race than the smallest addition
       <br/>
       to the philosophy of the spirit. Empirical science, with the collusion
       <br/>
       of positivism, has stolen the cloak of philosophy and must be made to
       <br/>
       give it back.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Among Croce's other important contributions to thought must be mentioned
       <br/>
       his definition of History as being aesthetic and differing from Art
       <br/>
       solely in that history represents the _real_, art the _possible_. In
       <br/>
       connection with this definition and its proof, the philosopher recounts
       <br/>
       how he used to hold an opposite view. Doing everything thoroughly, he
       <br/>
       had prepared and written out a long disquisition on this thesis, which
       <br/>
       was already in type, when suddenly, from the midst of his meditations,
       <br/>
       _the truth flashed upon him_. He saw for the first time clearly that
       <br/>
       history cannot be a science, since, like art, it always deals with the
       <br/>
       particular. Without a moment's hesitation he hastened to the printers
       <br/>
       and bade them break up the type.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This incident is illustrative of the sincerity and good faith of
       <br/>
       Benedetto Croce. One knows him to be severe for the faults and
       <br/>
       weaknesses of others, merciless for his own.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Yet though severe, the editor of _La Critica_ is uncompromisingly just,
       <br/>
       and would never allow personal dislike or jealousy, or any extrinsic
       <br/>
       consideration, to stand in the way of fair treatment to the writer
       <br/>
       concerned. Many superficial English critics might benefit considerably
       <br/>
       by attention to this quality in one who is in other respects also so
       <br/>
       immeasurably their superior. A good instance of this impartiality is his
       <br/>
       critique of Schopenhauer, with whose system he is in complete
       <br/>
       disagreement, yet affords him full credit for what of truth is contained
       <br/>
       in his voluminous writings.[2]
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Croce's education was largely completed in Germany, and on account of
       <br/>
       their thoroughness he has always been an upholder of German methods. One
       <br/>
       of his complaints against the Italian Positivists is that they only read
       <br/>
       second-rate works in French or at the most "the dilettante booklets
       <br/>
       published in such profusion by the Anglo-Saxon press." This tendency
       <br/>
       towards German thought, especially in philosophy, depends upon the fact
       <br/>
       of the former undoubted supremacy of Germany in that field, but Croce
       <br/>
       does not for a moment admit the inferiority of the Neo-Latin races, and
       <br/>
       adds with homely humour in reference to Germany, that we "must not throw
       <br/>
       away the baby with the bath-water"! Close, arduous study and clear
       <br/>
       thought are the only key to scientific (philosophical) truth, and Croce
       <br/>
       never begins an article for a newspaper without the complete collection
       <br/>
       of the works of the author to be criticized, and his own elaborate notes
       <br/>
       on the table before him. Schopenhauer said there were three kinds of
       <br/>
       writers--those who write without thinking, the great majority; those who
       <br/>
       think while they write, not very numerous; those who write after they
       <br/>
       have thought, very rare. Croce certainly belongs to the last division,
       <br/>
       and, as I have said, always feeds his thought upon complete erudition.
       <br/>
       The bibliography of the works consulted for the _Estetica_ alone, as
       <br/>
       printed at the end of the Italian edition, extends to many pages and
       <br/>
       contains references to works in any way dealing with the subject in all
       <br/>
       the European languages. For instance, Croce has studied Mr. B.
       <br/>
       Bosanquet's eclectic works on Aesthetic, largely based upon German
       <br/>
       sources and by no means without value. But he takes exception to Mr.
       <br/>
       Bosanquet's statement that _he_ has consulted all works of importance on
       <br/>
       the subject of Aesthetic. As a matter of fact, Mr. Bosanquet reveals his
       <br/>
       ignorance of the greater part of the contribution to Aesthetic made by
       <br/>
       the Neo-Latin races, which the reader of this book will recognize as of
       <br/>
       first-rate importance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This thoroughness it is which gives such importance to the literary and
       <br/>
       philosophical criticisms of _La Critica_. Croce's method is always
       <br/>
       historical, and his object in approaching any work of art is to classify
       <br/>
       the spirit of its author, as expressed in that work. There are, he
       <br/>
       maintains, but two things to be considered in criticizing a book. These
       <br/>
       are, _firstly_, what is its _peculiarity_, in what way is it singular,
       <br/>
       how is it differentiated from other works? _Secondly_, what is its
       <br/>
       degree of purity?--That is, to what extent has its author kept himself
       <br/>
       free from all considerations alien to the perfection of the work as an
       <br/>
       expression, as a lyrical intuition? With the answering of these
       <br/>
       questions Croce is satisfied. He does not care to know if the author
       <br/>
       keep a motor-car, like Maeterlinck; or prefer to walk on Putney Heath,
       <br/>
       like Swinburne. This amounts to saying that all works of art must be
       <br/>
       judged by their own standard. How far has the author succeeded in doing
       <br/>
       what he intended?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Croce is far above any personal animus, although the same cannot be said
       <br/>
       of those he criticizes. These, like d'Annunzio, whose limitations he
       <br/>
       points out--his egoism, his lack of human sympathy--are often very
       <br/>
       bitter, and accuse the penetrating critic of want of courtesy. This
       <br/>
       seriousness of purpose runs like a golden thread through all Croce's
       <br/>
       work. The flimsy superficial remarks on poetry and fiction which too
       <br/>
       often pass for criticism in England (Scotland is a good deal more
       <br/>
       thorough) are put to shame by _La Critica_, the study of which I commend
       <br/>
       to all readers who read or wish to read Italian.[3] They will find in
       <br/>
       its back numbers a complete picture of a century of Italian literature,
       <br/>
       besides a store-house of philosophical criticism. The _Quarterly_ and
       <br/>
       _Edinburgh Reviews_ are our only journals which can be compared to _The
       <br/>
       Critica_, and they are less exhaustive on the philosophical side. We
       <br/>
       should have to add to these _Mind_ and the _Hibbert Journal_ to get even
       <br/>
       an approximation to the scope of the Italian review.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As regards Croce's general philosophical position, it is important to
       <br/>
       understand that he is _not_ a Hegelian, in the sense of being a close
       <br/>
       follower of that philosopher. One of his last works is that in which he
       <br/>
       deals in a masterly manner with the philosophy of Hegel. The title may
       <br/>
       be translated, "What is living and what is dead of the philosophy of
       <br/>
       Hegel." Here he explains to us the Hegelian system more clearly than
       <br/>
       that wondrous edifice was ever before explained, and we realize at the
       <br/>
       same time that Croce is quite as independent of Hegel as of Kant, of
       <br/>
       Vico as of Spinoza. Of course he has made use of the best of Hegel, just
       <br/>
       as every thinker makes use of his predecessors and is in his turn made
       <br/>
       use of by those that follow him. But it is incorrect to accuse of
       <br/>
       Hegelianism the author of an anti-hegelian _Aesthetic_, of a _Logic_
       <br/>
       where Hegel is only half accepted, and of a _Philosophy of the
       <br/>
       Practical_, which contains hardly a trace of Hegel. I give an instance.
       <br/>
       If the great conquest of Hegel be the dialectic of opposites, his great
       <br/>
       mistake lies in the confusion of opposites with things which are
       <br/>
       distinct but not opposite. If, says Croce, we take as an example the
       <br/>
       application of the Hegelian triad that formulates becoming (affirmation,
       <br/>
       negation and synthesis), we find it applicable for those opposites which
       <br/>
       are true and false, good and evil, being and not-being, but _not
       <br/>
       applicable_ to things which are distinct but not opposite, such as art
       <br/>
       and philosophy, beauty and truth, the useful and the moral. These
       <br/>
       confusions led Hegel to talk of the death of art, to conceive as
       <br/>
       possible a Philosophy of History, and to the application of the natural
       <br/>
       sciences to the absurd task of constructing a Philosophy of Nature.
       <br/>
       Croce has cleared away these difficulties by shewing that if from the
       <br/>
       meeting of opposites must arise a superior synthesis, such a synthesis
       <br/>
       cannot arise from things which are distinct _but not opposite_, since
       <br/>
       the former are connected together as superior and inferior, and the
       <br/>
       inferior can exist without the superior, but _not vice versa_. Thus we
       <br/>
       see how philosophy cannot exist without art, while art, occupying the
       <br/>
       lower place, can and does exist without philosophy. This brief example
       <br/>
       reveals Croce's independence in dealing with Hegelian problems.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I know of no philosopher more generous than Croce in praise and
       <br/>
       elucidation of other workers in the same field, past and present. For
       <br/>
       instance, and apart from Hegel, _Kant_ has to thank him for drawing
       <br/>
       attention to the marvellous excellence of the _Critique of Judgment_,
       <br/>
       generally neglected in favour of the Critiques of _Pure Reason and of
       <br/>
       Practical Judgment_; _Baumgarten_ for drawing the attention of the world
       <br/>
       to his obscure name and for reprinting his Latin thesis in which the
       <br/>
       word _Aesthetic_ occurs for the first time; and _Schleiermacher_ for the
       <br/>
       tributes paid to his neglected genius in the History of Aesthetic. _La
       <br/>
       Critica_, too, is full of generous appreciation of contemporaries by
       <br/>
       Croce and by that profound thinker, Gentile.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But it is not only philosophers who have reason to be grateful to Croce
       <br/>
       for his untiring zeal and diligence. Historians, economists, poets,
       <br/>
       actors, and writers of fiction have been rescued from their undeserved
       <br/>
       limbo by this valiant Red Cross knight, and now shine with due
       <br/>
       brilliance in the circle of their peers. It must also be admitted that a
       <br/>
       large number of false lights, popular will o' the wisps, have been
       <br/>
       ruthlessly extinguished with the same breath. For instance, Karl Marx,
       <br/>
       the socialist theorist and agitator, finds in Croce an exponent of his
       <br/>
       views, in so far as they are based upon the truth, but where he
       <br/>
       blunders, his critic immediately reveals the origin and nature of his
       <br/>
       mistakes. Croce's studies in Economic are chiefly represented by his
       <br/>
       work, the title of which may be translated "Historical Materialism and
       <br/>
       Marxist Economic."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       To indicate the breadth and variety of Croce's work I will mention the
       <br/>
       further monograph on the sixteenth century Neapolitan Pulcinella (the
       <br/>
       original of our Punch), and the personage of the Neapolitan in comedy, a
       <br/>
       monument of erudition and of acute and of lively dramatic criticism,
       <br/>
       that would alone have occupied an ordinary man's activity for half a
       <br/>
       lifetime. One must remember, however, that Croce's average working day
       <br/>
       is of ten hours. His interest is concentrated on things of the mind, and
       <br/>
       although he sits on several Royal Commissions, such as those of the
       <br/>
       Archives of all Italy and of the monument to King Victor Emmanuel, he
       <br/>
       has taken no university degree, and much dislikes any affectation of
       <br/>
       academic superiority. He is ready to meet any one on equal terms and try
       <br/>
       with them to get at the truth on any subject, be it historical,
       <br/>
       literary, or philosophical. "Truth," he says, "is democratic," and I can
       <br/>
       testify that the search for it, in his company, is very stimulating. As
       <br/>
       is well said by Prezzolini, "He has a new word for all."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       There can be no doubt of the great value of Croce's work as an
       <br/>
       _educative influence_, and if we are to judge of a philosophical system
       <br/>
       by its action on others, then we must place the _Philosophy of the
       <br/>
       Spirit_ very high. It may be said with perfect truth that since the
       <br/>
       death of the poet Carducci there has been no influence in Italy to
       <br/>
       compare with that of Benedetto Croce.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       His dislike of Academies and of all forms of prejudice runs parallel
       <br/>
       with his breadth and sympathy with all forms of thought. His activity in
       <br/>
       the present is only equalled by his reverence for the past. Naples he
       <br/>
       loves with the blind love of the child for its parent, and he has been
       <br/>
       of notable assistance to such Neapolitan talent as is manifested in the
       <br/>
       works of Salvatore di Giacomo, whose best poems are written in the
       <br/>
       dialect of Naples, or rather in a dialect of his own, which Croce had
       <br/>
       difficulty in persuading the author always to retain. The original jet
       <br/>
       of inspiration having been in dialect, it is clear that to amend this
       <br/>
       inspiration at the suggestion of wiseacres at the Cafe would have been
       <br/>
       to ruin it altogether.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of the popularity that his system and teaching have already attained we
       <br/>
       may judge by the fact that the _Aesthetic_[4], despite the difficulty of
       <br/>
       the subject, is already in its third edition in Italy, where, owing to
       <br/>
       its influence, philosophy sells better than fiction; while the French
       <br/>
       and Germans, not to mention the Czechs, have long had translations of
       <br/>
       the earlier editions. His _Logic_ is on the point of appearing in its
       <br/>
       second edition, and I have no doubt that the _Philosophy of the
       <br/>
       Practical_ will eventually equal these works in popularity. _The
       <br/>
       importance and value of Italian thought have been too long neglected in
       <br/>
       Great Britain_. Where, as in Benedetto Croce, we get the clarity of
       <br/>
       vision of the Latin, joined to the thoroughness and erudition of the
       <br/>
       best German tradition, we have a combination of rare power and
       <br/>
       effectiveness, which can by no means be neglected.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The philosopher feels that he has a great mission, which is nothing less
       <br/>
       than the leading back of thought to belief in the spirit, deserted by so
       <br/>
       many for crude empiricism and positivism. His view of philosophy is that
       <br/>
       it sums up all the higher human activities, including religion, and that
       <br/>
       in proper hands it is able to solve any problem. But there is no
       <br/>
       finality about problems: the solution of one leads to the posing of
       <br/>
       another, and so on. Man is the maker of life, and his spirit ever
       <br/>
       proceeds from a lower to a higher perfection. Connected with this view
       <br/>
       of life is Croce's dislike of "Modernism." When once a problem has been
       <br/>
       correctly solved, it is absurd to return to the same problem. Roman
       <br/>
       Catholicism cannot march with the times. It can only exist by being
       <br/>
       conservative--its only Logic is to be illogical. Therefore, Croce is
       <br/>
       opposed to Loisy and Neo-Catholicism, and supports the Encyclical
       <br/>
       against Modernism. The Catholic religion, with its great stores of myth
       <br/>
       and morality, which for many centuries was the best thing in the world,
       <br/>
       is still there for those who are unable to assimilate other food.
       <br/>
       Another instance of his dislike for Modernism is his criticism of
       <br/>
       Pascoli, whose attempts to reveal enigmas in the writings of Dante he
       <br/>
       looks upon as useless. We do not, he says, read Dante in the twentieth
       <br/>
       century for his hidden meanings, but for his revealed poetry.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I believe that Croce will one day be recognized as one of the very few
       <br/>
       great teachers of humanity. At present he is not appreciated at nearly
       <br/>
       his full value. One rises from a study of his philosophy with a sense of
       <br/>
       having been all the time as it were in personal touch with the truth,
       <br/>
       which is very far from the case after the perusal of certain other
       <br/>
       philosophies.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Croce has been called the philosopher-poet, and if we take philosophy as
       <br/>
       Novalis understood it, certainly Croce does belong to the poets, though
       <br/>
       not to the formal category of those who write in verse. Croce is at any
       <br/>
       rate a born philosopher, and as every trade tends to make its object
       <br/>
       prosaic, so does every vocation tend to make it poetic. Yet no one has
       <br/>
       toiled more earnestly than Croce. "Thorough" might well be his motto,
       <br/>
       and if to-day he is admitted to be a classic without the stiffness one
       <br/>
       connects with that term, be sure he has well merited the designation.
       <br/>
       His name stands for the best that Italy has to give the world of
       <br/>
       serious, stimulating thought. I know nothing to equal it elsewhere.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Secure in his strength, Croce will often introduce a joke or some
       <br/>
       amusing illustration from contemporary life, in the midst of a most
       <br/>
       profound and serious argument. This spirit of mirth is a sign of
       <br/>
       superiority. He who is not sure of himself can spare no energy for the
       <br/>
       making of mirth. Croce loves to laugh at his enemies and with his
       <br/>
       friends. So the philosopher of Naples sits by the blue gulf and explains
       <br/>
       the universe to those who have ears to hear. "One can philosophize
       <br/>
       anywhere," he says--but he remains significantly at Naples.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Thus I conclude these brief remarks upon the author of the _Aesthetic_,
       <br/>
       confident that those who give time and attention to its study will be
       <br/>
       grateful for having placed in their hands this pearl of great price from
       <br/>
       the diadem of the antique Parthenope.

       INTUITION AND EXPRESSION
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuitive knowledge._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Human knowledge has two forms: it is either intuitive knowledge or
       <br/>
       logical knowledge; knowledge obtained through the imagination or
       <br/>
       knowledge obtained through the intellect; knowledge of the individual or
       <br/>
       knowledge of the universal; of individual things or of the relations
       <br/>
       between them: it is, in fact, productive either of images or of
       <br/>
       concepts.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In ordinary life, constant appeal is made to intuitive knowledge. It
       <br/>
       is said to be impossible to give expression to certain truths; that
       <br/>
       they are not demonstrable by syllogisms; that they must be learnt
       <br/>
       intuitively. The politician finds fault with the abstract reasoner, who
       <br/>
       is without a lively knowledge of actual conditions; the pedagogue
       <br/>
       insists upon the necessity of developing the intuitive faculty in the
       <br/>
       pupil before everything else; the critic in judging a work of art makes
       <br/>
       it a point of honour to set aside theory and abstractions, and to judge
       <br/>
       it by direct intuition; the practical man professes to live rather by
       <br/>
       intuition than by reason.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But this ample acknowledgment, granted to intuitive knowledge in
       <br/>
       ordinary life, does not meet with an equal and adequate acknowledgment
       <br/>
       in the field of theory and of philosophy. There exists a very ancient
       <br/>
       science of intellective knowledge, admitted by all without discussion,
       <br/>
       namely, Logic; but a science of intuitive knowledge is timidly and with
       <br/>
       difficulty admitted by but a few. Logical knowledge has appropriated the
       <br/>
       lion's share; and if she does not quite slay and devour her companion,
       <br/>
       yet yields to her with difficulty the humble little place of maidservant
       <br/>
       or doorkeeper. What, it says, is intuitive knowledge without the light
       <br/>
       of intellective knowledge? It is a servant without a master; and though
       <br/>
       a master find a servant useful, the master is a necessity to the
       <br/>
       servant, since he enables him to gain his livelihood. Intuition is
       <br/>
       blind; Intellect lends her eyes.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Its independence in respect to intellective knowledge._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now, the first point to be firmly fixed in the mind is that intuitive
       <br/>
       knowledge has no need of a master, nor to lean upon any one; she does
       <br/>
       not need to borrow the eyes of others, for she has most excellent eyes
       <br/>
       of her own. Doubtless it is possible to find concepts mingled with
       <br/>
       intuitions. But in many other intuitions there is no trace of such a
       <br/>
       mixture, which proves that it is not necessary. The impression of a
       <br/>
       moonlight scene by a painter; the outline of a country drawn by a
       <br/>
       cartographer; a musical motive, tender or energetic; the words of a
       <br/>
       sighing lyric, or those with which we ask, command and lament in
       <br/>
       ordinary life, may well all be intuitive facts without a shadow of
       <br/>
       intellective relation. But, think what one may of these instances, and
       <br/>
       admitting further that one may maintain that the greater part of the
       <br/>
       intuitions of civilized man are impregnated with concepts, there yet
       <br/>
       remains to be observed something more important and more conclusive.
       <br/>
       Those concepts which are found mingled and fused with the intuitions,
       <br/>
       are no longer concepts, in so far as they are really mingled and fused,
       <br/>
       for they have lost all independence and autonomy. They have been
       <br/>
       concepts, but they have now become simple elements of intuition.
       <br/>
       The philosophical maxims placed in the mouth of a personage of tragedy
       <br/>
       or of comedy, perform there the function, not of concepts, but of
       <br/>
       characteristics of such personage; in the same way as the red in a
       <br/>
       painted figure does not there represent the red colour of the
       <br/>
       physicists, but is a characteristic element of the portrait. The whole
       <br/>
       it is that determines the quality of the parts. A work of art may be
       <br/>
       full of philosophical concepts; it may contain them in greater
       <br/>
       abundance and they may be there even more profound than in a
       <br/>
       philosophical dissertation, which in its turn may be rich to
       <br/>
       overflowing with descriptions and intuitions. But, notwithstanding all
       <br/>
       these concepts it may contain, the result of the work of art is an
       <br/>
       intuition; and notwithstanding all those intuitions, the result of the
       <br/>
       philosophical dissertation is a concept. The _Promessi Sposi_ contains
       <br/>
       copious ethical observations and distinctions, but it does not for
       <br/>
       that reason lose in its total effect its character of simple story, of
       <br/>
       intuition. In like manner the anecdotes and satirical effusions which
       <br/>
       may be found in the works of a philosopher like Schopenhauer, do not
       <br/>
       remove from those works their character of intellective treatises. The
       <br/>
       difference between a scientific work and a work of art, that is,
       <br/>
       between an intellective fact and an intuitive fact lies in the result,
       <br/>
       in the diverse effect aimed at by their respective authors. This it is
       <br/>
       that determines and rules over the several parts of each.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuition and perception._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But to admit the independence of intuition as regards concept does not
       <br/>
       suffice to give a true and precise idea of intuition. Another error
       <br/>
       arises among those who recognize this, or who, at any rate, do not make
       <br/>
       intuition explicitly dependent upon the intellect. This error obscures
       <br/>
       and confounds the real nature of intuition. By intuition is frequently
       <br/>
       understood the _perception_ or knowledge of actual reality, the
       <br/>
       apprehension of something as _real_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Certainly perception is intuition: the perception of the room in which I
       <br/>
       am writing, of the ink-bottle and paper that are before me, of the pen I
       <br/>
       am using, of the objects that I touch and make use of as instruments of
       <br/>
       my person, which, if it write, therefore exists;--these are all
       <br/>
       intuitions. But the image that is now passing through my brain of a me
       <br/>
       writing in another room, in another town, with different paper, pen and
       <br/>
       ink, is also an intuition. This means that the distinction between
       <br/>
       reality and non-reality is extraneous, secondary, to the true nature of
       <br/>
       intuition. If we assume the existence of a human mind which should have
       <br/>
       intuitions for the first time, it would seem that it could have
       <br/>
       intuitions of effective reality only, that is to say, that it could have
       <br/>
       perceptions of nothing but the real. But if the knowledge of reality be
       <br/>
       based upon the distinction between real images and unreal images, and if
       <br/>
       this distinction does not originally exist, these intuitions would in
       <br/>
       truth not be intuitions either of the real or of the unreal, but pure
       <br/>
       intuitions. Where all is real, nothing is real. The child, with its
       <br/>
       difficulty of distinguishing true from false, history from fable, which
       <br/>
       are all one to childhood, can furnish us with a sort of very vague and
       <br/>
       only remotely approximate idea of this ingenuous state. Intuition is the
       <br/>
       indifferentiated unity of the perception of the real and of the simple
       <br/>
       image of the possible. In our intuitions we do not oppose ourselves to
       <br/>
       external reality as empirical beings, but we simply objectify our
       <br/>
       impressions, whatever they be.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuition and the concepts of space and time._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Those, therefore, who look upon intuition as sensation formed and
       <br/>
       arranged simply according to the categories of space and time, would
       <br/>
       seem to approximate more nearly to the truth. Space and time (they say)
       <br/>
       are the forms of intuition; to have intuitions is to place in space and
       <br/>
       in temporal sequence. Intuitive activity would then consist in this
       <br/>
       double and concurrent function of spatiality and temporality. But for
       <br/>
       these two categories must be repeated what was said of intellectual
       <br/>
       distinctions, found mingled with intuitions. We have intuitions without
       <br/>
       space and without time: a tint of sky and a tint of sentiment, an Ah! of
       <br/>
       pain and an effort of will, objectified in consciousness. These are
       <br/>
       intuitions, which we possess, and with their making, space and time have
       <br/>
       nothing to do. In some intuitions, spatiality may be found without
       <br/>
       temporality, in others, this without that; and even where both are
       <br/>
       found, they are perceived by posterior reflexion: they can be fused with
       <br/>
       the intuition in like manner with all its other elements: that is, they
       <br/>
       are in it _materialiter_ and not _formaliter_, as ingredients and not as
       <br/>
       essentials. Who, without a similar act of interruptive reflexion, is
       <br/>
       conscious of temporal sequence while listening to a story or a piece of
       <br/>
       music? That which intuition reveals in a work of art is not space and
       <br/>
       time, but character, individual physiognomy. Several attempts may be
       <br/>
       noted in modern philosophy, which confirm the view here exposed. Space
       <br/>
       and time, far from being very simple and primitive functions, are shown
       <br/>
       to be intellectual constructions of great complexity. And further, even
       <br/>
       in some of those who do not altogether deny to space and time the
       <br/>
       quality of forming or of categories and functions, one may observe the
       <br/>
       attempt to unify and to understand them in a different manner from that
       <br/>
       generally maintained in respect of these categories. Some reduce
       <br/>
       intuition to the unique category of spatiality, maintaining that time
       <br/>
       also can only be conceived in terms of space. Others abandon the three
       <br/>
       dimensions of space as not philosophically necessary, and conceive the
       <br/>
       function of spatiality as void of every particular spatial
       <br/>
       determination. But what could such a spatial function be, that should
       <br/>
       control even time? May it not be a residuum of criticisms and of
       <br/>
       negations from which arises merely the necessity to posit a generic
       <br/>
       intuitive activity? And is not this last truly determined, when one
       <br/>
       unique function is attributed to it, not spatializing nor temporalizing,
       <br/>
       but characterizing? Or, better, when this is conceived as itself a
       <br/>
       category or function, which gives knowledge of things in their
       <br/>
       concretion and individuality?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuition and sensation._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Having thus freed intuitive knowledge from any suggestion of
       <br/>
       intellectualism and from every posterior and external adjunct, we must
       <br/>
       now make clear and determine its limits from another side and from a
       <br/>
       different kind of invasion and confusion. On the other side, and before
       <br/>
       the inferior boundary, is sensation, formless matter, which the spirit
       <br/>
       can never apprehend in itself, in so far as it is mere matter. This it
       <br/>
       can only possess with form and in form, but postulates its concept as,
       <br/>
       precisely, a limit. Matter, in its abstraction, is mechanism, passivity;
       <br/>
       it is what the spirit of man experiences, but does not produce. Without
       <br/>
       it no human knowledge and activity is possible; but mere matter produces
       <br/>
       animality, whatever is brutal and impulsive in man, not the spiritual
       <br/>
       dominion, which is humanity. How often do we strive to understand
       <br/>
       clearly what is passing within us? We do catch a glimpse of something,
       <br/>
       but this does not appear to the mind as objectified and formed. In such
       <br/>
       moments it is, that we best perceive the profound difference between
       <br/>
       matter and form. These are not two acts of ours, face to face with one
       <br/>
       another; but we assault and carry off the one that is outside us, while
       <br/>
       that within us tends to absorb and make its own that without. Matter,
       <br/>
       attacked and conquered by form, gives place to concrete form. It is the
       <br/>
       matter, the content, that differentiates one of our intuitions from
       <br/>
       another: form is constant: it is spiritual activity, while matter is
       <br/>
       changeable. Without matter, however, our spiritual activity would not
       <br/>
       leave its abstraction to become concrete and real, this or that
       <br/>
       spiritual content, this or that definite intuition.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is a curious fact, characteristic of our times, that this very form,
       <br/>
       this very activity of the spirit, which is essentially ourselves, is so
       <br/>
       easily ignored or denied. Some confound the spiritual activity of man
       <br/>
       with the metaphorical and mythological activity of so-called nature,
       <br/>
       which is mechanism and has no resemblance to human activity, save when
       <br/>
       we imagine, with Aesop, that _arbores loquuntur non tantum ferae_. Some
       <br/>
       even affirm that they have never observed in themselves this
       <br/>
       "miraculous" activity, as though there were no difference, or only one
       <br/>
       of quantity, between sweating and thinking, feeling cold and the energy
       <br/>
       of the will. Others, certainly with greater reason, desire to unify
       <br/>
       activity and mechanism in a more general concept, though admitting that
       <br/>
       they are specifically distinct. Let us, however, refrain for the moment
       <br/>
       from examining if such a unification be possible, and in what sense, but
       <br/>
       admitting that the attempt may be made, it is clear that to unify two
       <br/>
       concepts in a third implies a difference between the two first. And here
       <br/>
       it is this difference that is of importance and we set it in relief.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuition and association._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Intuition has often been confounded with simple sensation. But, since
       <br/>
       this confusion is too shocking to good sense, it has more frequently
       <br/>
       been attenuated or concealed with a phraseology which seems to wish to
       <br/>
       confuse and to distinguish them at the same time. Thus, it has been
       <br/>
       asserted that intuition is sensation, but not so much simple sensation
       <br/>
       as _association_ of sensations. The equivoque arises precisely from the
       <br/>
       word "association." Association is understood, either as memory,
       <br/>
       mnemonic association, conscious recollection, and in that case is
       <br/>
       evident the absurdity of wishing to join together in memory elements
       <br/>
       which are not intuified, distinguished, possessed in some way by the
       <br/>
       spirit and produced by consciousness: or it is understood as association
       <br/>
       of unconscious elements. In this case we remain in the world of
       <br/>
       sensation and of nature. Further, if with certain associationists we
       <br/>
       speak of an association which is neither memory nor flux of sensations,
       <br/>
       but is a _productive_ association (formative, constructive,
       <br/>
       distinguishing); then we admit the thing itself and deny only its name.
       <br/>
       In truth, productive association is no longer association in the sense
       <br/>
       of the sensualists, but _synthesis_, that is to say, spiritual activity.
       <br/>
       Synthesis may be called association; but with the concept of
       <br/>
       productivity is already posited the distinction between passivity and
       <br/>
       activity, between sensation and intuition.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuition and representation._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Other psychologists are disposed to distinguish from sensation something
       <br/>
       which is sensation no longer, but is not yet intellective concept: _the
       <br/>
       representation or image_. What is the difference between their
       <br/>
       representation or image, and our intuitive knowledge? The greatest, and
       <br/>
       none at all. "Representation," too, is a very equivocal word. If by
       <br/>
       representation be understood something detached and standing out from
       <br/>
       the psychic base of the sensations, then representation is intuition.
       <br/>
       If, on the other hand, it be conceived as a complex sensation, a return
       <br/>
       is made to simple sensation, which does not change its quality according
       <br/>
       to its richness or poverty, operating alike in a rudimentary or in a
       <br/>
       developed organism full of traces of past sensations. Nor is the
       <br/>
       equivoque remedied by defining representation as a psychic product of
       <br/>
       secondary order in relation to sensation, which should occupy the first
       <br/>
       place. What does secondary order mean here? Does it mean a qualitative,
       <br/>
       a formal difference? If so, we agree: representation is elaboration of
       <br/>
       sensation, it is intuition. Or does it mean greater complexity and
       <br/>
       complication, a quantitative, material difference? In that case
       <br/>
       intuition would be again confused with simple sensation.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Intuition and expression._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       And yet there is a sure method of distinguishing true intuition, true
       <br/>
       representation, from that which is inferior to it: the spiritual fact
       <br/>
       from the mechanical, passive, natural fact. Every true intuition or
       <br/>
       representation is, also, _expression_. That which does not objectify
       <br/>
       itself in expression is not intuition or representation, but sensation
       <br/>
       and naturality. The spirit does not obtain intuitions, otherwise than by
       <br/>
       making, forming, expressing. He who separates intuition from expression
       <br/>
       never succeeds in reuniting them.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       _Intuitive activity possesses intuitions to the extent that it expresses
       <br/>
       them_.--Should this expression seem at first paradoxical, that is
       <br/>
       chiefly because, as a general rule, a too restricted meaning is given to
       <br/>
       the word "expression." It is generally thought of as restricted to
       <br/>
       verbal expression. But there exist also non-verbal expressions, such as
       <br/>
       those of line, colour, and sound; to all of these must be extended our
       <br/>
       affirmation. The intuition and expression together of a painter are
       <br/>
       pictorial; those of a poet are verbal. But be it pictorial, or verbal,
       <br/>
       or musical, or whatever else it be called, to no intuition can
       <br/>
       expression be wanting, because it is an inseparable part of intuition.
       <br/>
       How can we possess a true intuition of a geometrical figure, unless we
       <br/>
       possess so accurate an image of it as to be able to trace it immediately
       <br/>
       upon paper or on a slate? How can we have an intuition of the contour of
       <br/>
       a region, for example, of the island of Sicily, if we are not able to
       <br/>
       draw it as it is in all its meanderings? Every one can experience the
       <br/>
       internal illumination which follows upon his success in formulating to
       <br/>
       himself his impressions and sentiments, but only so far as he is able to
       <br/>
       formulate them. Sentiments or impressions, then, pass by means of words
       <br/>
       from the obscure region of the soul into the clarity of the
       <br/>
       contemplative spirit. In this cognitive process it is impossible to
       <br/>
       distinguish intuition from expression. The one is produced with the
       <br/>
       other at the same instant, because they are not two, but one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Illusions as to their difference._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The principal reason which makes our theme appear paradoxical as we
       <br/>
       maintain it, is the illusion or prejudice that we possess a more
       <br/>
       complete intuition of reality than we really do. One often hears people
       <br/>
       say that they have in their minds many important thoughts, but that they
       <br/>
       are not able to express them. In truth, if they really had them, they
       <br/>
       would have coined them into beautiful, ringing words, and thus expressed
       <br/>
       them. If these thoughts seem to vanish or to become scarce and poor in
       <br/>
       the act of expressing them, either they did not exist or they really
       <br/>
       were scarce and poor. People think that all of us ordinary men imagine
       <br/>
       and have intuitions of countries, figures and scenes, like painters; of
       <br/>
       bodies, like sculptors; save that painters and sculptors know how to
       <br/>
       paint and to sculpture those images, while we possess them only within
       <br/>
       our souls. They believe that anyone could have imagined a Madonna of
       <br/>
       Raphael; but that Raphael was Raphael owing to his technical ability in
       <br/>
       putting the Madonna upon the canvas. Nothing can be more false than this
       <br/>
       view. The world of which as a rule we have intuitions, is a small thing.
       <br/>
       It consists of little expressions which gradually become greater and
       <br/>
       more ample with the increasing spiritual concentration of certain
       <br/>
       moments. These are the sort of words which we speak within ourselves,
       <br/>
       the judgments that we tacitly express: "Here is a man, here is a horse,
       <br/>
       this is heavy, this is hard, this pleases me," etc. It is a medley of
       <br/>
       light and colour, which could not pictorially attain to any more sincere
       <br/>
       expression than a haphazard splash of colours, from among which would
       <br/>
       with difficulty stand out a few special, distinctive traits. This and
       <br/>
       nothing else is what we possess in our ordinary life; this is the basis
       <br/>
       of our ordinary action. It is the index of a book. The labels tied to
       <br/>
       things take the place of the things themselves. This index and labels
       <br/>
       (which are themselves expressions) suffice for our small needs and small
       <br/>
       actions. From time to time we pass from the index to the book, from the
       <br/>
       label to the thing, or from the slight to the greater intuitions, and
       <br/>
       from these to the greatest and most lofty. This passage is sometimes far
       <br/>
       from being easy. It has been observed by those who have best studied the
       <br/>
       psychology of artists, that when, after having given a rapid glance at
       <br/>
       anyone, they attempt to obtain a true intuition of him, in order, for
       <br/>
       example, to paint his portrait, then this ordinary vision, that seemed
       <br/>
       so precise, so lively, reveals itself as little better than nothing.
       <br/>
       What remains is found to be at the most some superficial trait, which
       <br/>
       would not even suffice for a caricature. The person to be painted stands
       <br/>
       before the artist like a world to discover. Michael Angelo said, "one
       <br/>
       paints, not with one's hands, but with one's brain." Leonardo shocked
       <br/>
       the prior of the convent delle Grazie by standing for days together
       <br/>
       opposite the "Last Supper" without touching it with the brush. He
       <br/>
       remarked of this attitude "that men of the most lofty genius, when they
       <br/>
       are doing the least work, are then the most active, seeking invention
       <br/>
       with their minds." The painter is a painter, because he sees what others
       <br/>
       only feel or catch a glimpse of, but do not see. We think we see a
       <br/>
       smile, but in reality we have only a vague impression of it, we do not
       <br/>
       perceive all the characteristic traits from which it results, as the
       <br/>
       painter perceives them after his internal meditations, which thus enable
       <br/>
       him to fix them on the canvas. Even in the case of our intimate friend,
       <br/>
       who is with us every day and at all hours, we do not possess intuitively
       <br/>
       more than, at the most, certain traits of his physiognomy, which enable
       <br/>
       us to distinguish him from others. The illusion is less easy as regards
       <br/>
       musical expression; because it would seem strange to everyone to say
       <br/>
       that the composer had added or attached notes to the motive, which is
       <br/>
       already in the mind of him who is not the composer. As if Beethoven's
       <br/>
       Ninth Symphony were not his own intuition and his own intuition the
       <br/>
       Ninth Symphony. Thus, just as he who is deceived as to his material
       <br/>
       wealth is confuted by arithmetic, which states its exact amount, so is
       <br/>
       he confuted who nourishes delusions as to the wealth of his own thoughts
       <br/>
       and images. He is brought back to reality, when he is obliged to cross
       <br/>
       the Bridge of Asses of expression. We say to the former, count; to the
       <br/>
       latter, speak, here is a pencil, draw, express yourself.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have each of us, as a matter of fact, a little of the poet, of the
       <br/>
       sculptor, of the musician, of the painter, of the prose writer: but how
       <br/>
       little, as compared with those who are so called, precisely because of
       <br/>
       the lofty degree in which they possess the most universal dispositions
       <br/>
       and energies of human nature! How little does a painter possess of the
       <br/>
       intuitions of a poet! How little does one painter possess those of
       <br/>
       another painter! Nevertheless, that little is all our actual patrimony
       <br/>
       of intuitions or representations. Beyond these are only impressions,
       <br/>
       sensations, feelings, impulses, emotions, or whatever else one may term
       <br/>
       what is outside the spirit, not assimilated by man, postulated for the
       <br/>
       convenience of exposition, but effectively inexistent, if existence be
       <br/>
       also a spiritual fact.

       [Sidenote] _Identity of intuition and expression._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We may then add this to the verbal variants descriptive of intuition,
       <br/>
       noted at the beginning: intuitive knowledge is expressive knowledge,
       <br/>
       independent and autonomous in respect to intellectual function;
       <br/>
       indifferent to discriminations, posterior and empirical, to reality and
       <br/>
       to unreality, to formations and perceptions of space and time, even when
       <br/>
       posterior: intuition or representation is distinguished as form from
       <br/>
       what is felt and suffered, from the flux or wave of sensation, or from
       <br/>
       psychic material; and this form this taking possession of, is
       <br/>
       expression. To have an intuition is to express. It is nothing else!
       <br/>
       (nothing more, but nothing less) than _to express_.

       INTUITION AND ART
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Corollaries and explanations._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Before proceeding further, it seems opportune to draw certain
       <br/>
       consequences from what has been established and to add some explanation.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Identity of art and intuitive knowledge._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have frankly identified intuitive or expressive knowledge with the
       <br/>
       aesthetic or artistic fact, taking works of art as examples of intuitive
       <br/>
       knowledge and attributing to them the characteristics of intuition, and
       <br/>
       _vice versa_. But our identification is combated by the view, held even
       <br/>
       by many philosophers, who consider art to be an intuition of an
       <br/>
       altogether special sort. "Let us admit" (they say) "that art is
       <br/>
       intuition; but intuition is not always art: artistic intuition is of a
       <br/>
       distinct species differing from intuition in general by something
       <br/>
       _more_."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _No specific difference._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But no one has ever been able to indicate of what this something more
       <br/>
       consists. It has sometimes been thought that art is not a simple
       <br/>
       intuition, but an intuition of an intuition, in the same way as the
       <br/>
       concept of science has been defined, not as the ordinary concept, but as
       <br/>
       the concept of a concept. Thus man should attain to art, by
       <br/>
       objectifying, not his sensations, as happens with ordinary intuition,
       <br/>
       but intuition itself. But this process of raising to a second power does
       <br/>
       not exist; and the comparison of it with the ordinary and scientific
       <br/>
       concept does not imply what is wished, for the good reason that it is
       <br/>
       not true that the scientific concept is the concept of a concept. If
       <br/>
       this comparison imply anything, it implies just the opposite. The
       <br/>
       ordinary concept, if it be really a concept and not a simple
       <br/>
       representation, is a perfect concept, however poor and limited. Science
       <br/>
       substitutes concepts for representations; it adds and substitutes other
       <br/>
       concepts larger and more comprehensive for those that are poor and
       <br/>
       limited. It is ever discovering new relations. But its method does not
       <br/>
       differ from that by which is formed the smallest universal in the brain
       <br/>
       of the humblest of men. What is generally called art, by antonomasia,
       <br/>
       collects intuitions that are wider and more complex than those which we
       <br/>
       generally experience, but these intuitions are always of sensations and
       <br/>
       impressions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Art is the expression of impressions, not the expression of expressions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _No difference of intensity._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       For the same reason, it cannot be admitted that intuition, which is
       <br/>
       generally called artistic, differs from ordinary intuition as to
       <br/>
       intensity. This would be the case if it were to operate differently on
       <br/>
       the same matter. But since artistic function is more widely distributed
       <br/>
       in different fields, but yet does not differ in method from ordinary
       <br/>
       intuition, the difference between the one and the other is not intensive
       <br/>
       but extensive. The intuition of the simplest popular love-song, which
       <br/>
       says the same thing, or very nearly, as a declaration of love such as
       <br/>
       issues at every moment from the lips of thousands of ordinary men, may
       <br/>
       be intensively perfect in its poor simplicity, although it be
       <br/>
       extensively so much more limited than the complex intuition of a
       <br/>
       love-song by Leopardi.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _The difference is extensive and empirical._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The whole difference, then, is quantitative, and as such, indifferent to
       <br/>
       philosophy, _scientia qualitatum_. Certain men have a greater aptitude,
       <br/>
       a more frequent inclination fully to express certain complex states of
       <br/>
       the soul. These men are known in ordinary language as artists. Some very
       <br/>
       complicated and difficult expressions are more rarely achieved and these
       <br/>
       are called works of art. The limits of the expressions and intuitions
       <br/>
       that are called art, as opposed to those that are vulgarly called
       <br/>
       not-art, are empirical and impossible to define. If an epigram be art,
       <br/>
       why not a single word? If a story; why not the occasional note of the
       <br/>
       journalist? If a landscape, why not a topographical sketch? The teacher
       <br/>
       of philosophy in Moliere's comedy was right: "whenever we speak we
       <br/>
       create prose." But there will always be scholars like Monsieur Jourdain,
       <br/>
       astonished at having created prose for forty years without knowing it,
       <br/>
       and who will have difficulty in persuading themselves that when they
       <br/>
       call their servant John to bring their slippers, they have spoken
       <br/>
       nothing less than--prose.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We must hold firmly to our identification, because among the principal
       <br/>
       reasons which have prevented Aesthetic, the science of art, from
       <br/>
       revealing the true nature of art, its real roots in human nature, has
       <br/>
       been its separation from the general spiritual life, the having made of
       <br/>
       it a sort of special function or aristocratic circle. No one is
       <br/>
       astonished when he learns from physiology that every cellule is an
       <br/>
       organism and every organism a cellule or synthesis of cellules. No one
       <br/>
       is astonished at finding in a lofty mountain the same chemical elements
       <br/>
       that compose a small stone or fragment. There is not one physiology of
       <br/>
       small animals and one of large animals; nor is there a special chemical
       <br/>
       theory of stones as distinct from mountains. In the same way, there is
       <br/>
       not a science of lesser intuition distinct from a science of greater
       <br/>
       intuition, nor one of ordinary intuition distinct from artistic
       <br/>
       intuition. There is but one Aesthetic, the science of intuitive or
       <br/>
       expressive knowledge, which is the aesthetic or artistic fact. And this
       <br/>
       Aesthetic is the true analogy of Logic. Logic includes, as facts of the
       <br/>
       same nature, the formation of the smallest and most ordinary concept and
       <br/>
       the most complicated scientific and philosophical system.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Artistic genius._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Nor can we admit that the word _genius_ or artistic genius, as distinct
       <br/>
       from the non-genius of the ordinary man, possesses more than a
       <br/>
       quantitative signification. Great artists are said to reveal us to
       <br/>
       ourselves. But how could this be possible, unless there be identity of
       <br/>
       nature between their imagination and ours, and unless the difference be
       <br/>
       only one of quantity? It were well to change _poeta nascitur_ into _homo
       <br/>
       nascitur poeta_: some men are born great poets, some small. The cult and
       <br/>
       superstition of the genius has arisen from this quantitative difference
       <br/>
       having been taken as a difference of quality. It has been forgotten that
       <br/>
       genius is not something that has fallen from heaven, but humanity
       <br/>
       itself. The man of genius, who poses or is represented as distant from
       <br/>
       humanity, finds his punishment in becoming or appearing somewhat
       <br/>
       ridiculous. Examples of this are the _genius_ of the romantic period and
       <br/>
       the _superman_ of our time.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But it is well to note here, that those who claim unconsciousness as the
       <br/>
       chief quality of an artistic genius, hurl him from an eminence far above
       <br/>
       humanity to a position far below it. Intuitive or artistic genius, like
       <br/>
       every form of human activity, is always conscious; otherwise it would be
       <br/>
       blind mechanism. The only thing that may be wanting to the artistic
       <br/>
       genius is the _reflective_ consciousness, the superadded consciousness
       <br/>
       of the historian or critic, which is not essential to artistic genius.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Content and form in Aesthetic._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The relation between matter and form, or between _content and form_, as
       <br/>
       it is generally called, is one of the most disputed questions in
       <br/>
       Aesthetic. Does the aesthetic fact consist of content alone, or of form
       <br/>
       alone, or of both together? This question has taken on various meanings,
       <br/>
       which we shall mention, each in its place. But when these words are
       <br/>
       taken as signifying what we have above defined, and matter is understood
       <br/>
       as emotivity not aesthetically elaborated, that is to say, impressions,
       <br/>
       and form elaboration, intellectual activity and expression, then our
       <br/>
       meaning cannot be doubtful. We must, therefore, reject the thesis that
       <br/>
       makes the aesthetic fact to consist of the content alone (that is, of
       <br/>
       the simple impressions), in like manner with that other thesis, which
       <br/>
       makes it to consist of a junction between form and content, that is, of
       <br/>
       impressions plus expressions. In the aesthetic fact, the aesthetic
       <br/>
       activity is not added to the fact of the impressions, but these latter
       <br/>
       are formed and elaborated by it. The impressions reappear as it were in
       <br/>
       expression, like water put into a filter, which reappears the same and
       <br/>
       yet different on the other side. The aesthetic fact, therefore, is form,
       <br/>
       and nothing but form.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From this it results, not that the content is something superfluous (it
       <br/>
       is, on the contrary, the necessary point of departure for the expressive
       <br/>
       fact); but that _there is no passage_ between the quality of the content
       <br/>
       and that of the form. It has sometimes been thought that the content, in
       <br/>
       order to be aesthetic, that is to say, transformable into form, should
       <br/>
       possess some determinate or determinable quality. But were that so, then
       <br/>
       form and content, expression and impression, would be the same thing. It
       <br/>
       is true that the content is that which is convertible into form, but it
       <br/>
       has no determinable qualities until this transformation takes place. We
       <br/>
       know nothing of its nature. It does not become aesthetic content at
       <br/>
       once, but only when it has been effectively transformed. Aesthetic
       <br/>
       content has also been defined as what is _interesting_. That is not an
       <br/>
       untrue statement; it is merely void of meaning. What, then, is
       <br/>
       interesting? Expressive activity? Certainly the expressive activity
       <br/>
       would not have raised the content to the dignity of form, had it not
       <br/>
       been interested. The fact of its having been interested is precisely the
       <br/>
       fact of its raising the content to the dignity of form. But the word
       <br/>
       "interesting" has also been employed in another not illegitimate sense,
       <br/>
       which we shall explain further on.

       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Critique of the imitation of nature and of the artistic
       <br/>
       illusion._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The proposition that art is _imitation of nature_ has also several
       <br/>
       meanings. Now truth has been maintained or at least shadowed with these
       <br/>
       words, now error. More frequently, nothing definite has been thought.
       <br/>
       One of the legitimate scientific meanings occurs when imitation is
       <br/>
       understood as representation or intuition of nature, a form of
       <br/>
       knowledge. And when this meaning has been understood, by placing in
       <br/>
       greater relief the spiritual character of the process, the other
       <br/>
       proposition becomes also legitimate: namely, that art is the
       <br/>
       _idealization_ or _idealizing_ imitation of nature. But if by imitation
       <br/>
       of nature be understood that art gives mechanical reproductions, more or
       <br/>
       less perfect duplicates of natural objects, before which the same tumult
       <br/>
       of impressions caused by natural objects begins over again, then the
       <br/>
       proposition is evidently false. The painted wax figures that seem to be
       <br/>
       alive, and before which we stand astonished in the museums where such
       <br/>
       things are shown, do not give aesthetic intuitions. Illusion and
       <br/>
       hallucination have nothing to do with the calm domain of artistic
       <br/>
       intuition. If an artist paint the interior of a wax-work museum, or if
       <br/>
       an actor give a burlesque portrait of a man-statue on the stage, we
       <br/>
       again have spiritual labour and artistic intuition. Finally, if
       <br/>
       photography have anything in it of artistic, it will be to the extent
       <br/>
       that it transmits the intuition of the photographer, his point of view,
       <br/>
       the pose and the grouping which he has striven to attain. And if it be
       <br/>
       not altogether art, that is precisely because the element of nature in
       <br/>
       it remains more or less insubordinate and ineradicable. Do we ever,
       <br/>
       indeed, feel complete satisfaction before even the best of photographs?
       <br/>
       Would not an artist vary and touch up much or little, remove or add
       <br/>
       something to any of them?

       [Sidenote] _Critique of art conceived as a sentimental not a
       <br/>
       theoretical fact. Aesthetic appearance and feeling._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The statements repeated so often, with others similar, that art is not
       <br/>
       knowledge, that it does not tell the truth, that it does not belong to
       <br/>
       the world of theory, but to the world of feeling, arise from the failure
       <br/>
       to realize exactly the theoretic character of the simple intuition. This
       <br/>
       simple intuition is quite distinct from intellectual knowledge, as it is
       <br/>
       distinct from the perception of the real. The belief that only the
       <br/>
       intellective is knowledge, or at the most also the perception of the
       <br/>
       real, also arises from the failure to grasp the theoretic character of
       <br/>
       the simple intuition. We have seen that intuition is knowledge, free of
       <br/>
       concepts and more simple than the so-called perception of the real.
       <br/>
       Since art is knowledge and form, it does not belong to the world of
       <br/>
       feeling and of psychic material. The reason why so many aestheticians
       <br/>
       have so often insisted that art is _appearance_ (_Schein_), is precisely
       <br/>
       because they have felt the necessity of distinguishing it from the more
       <br/>
       complex fact of perception by maintaining its pure intuitivity. For the
       <br/>
       same reason it has been claimed that art is _sentiment_. In fact, if the
       <br/>
       concept as content of art, and historical reality as such, be excluded,
       <br/>
       there remains no other content than reality apprehended in all its
       <br/>
       ingenuousness and immediateness in the vital effort, in _sentiment_,
       <br/>
       that is to say, pure intuition.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Critique of theory of aesthetic senses._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The theory of the _aesthetic senses_ has also arisen from the failure to
       <br/>
       establish, or from having lost to view the character of the expression
       <br/>
       as distinct from the impression, of the form as distinct from the
       <br/>
       matter.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       As has just been pointed out, this reduces itself to the error of
       <br/>
       wishing to seek a passage from the quality of the content to that of the
       <br/>
       form. To ask, in fact, what the aesthetic senses may be, implies asking
       <br/>
       what sensible impressions may be able to enter into aesthetic
       <br/>
       expressions, and what must of necessity do so. To this we must at once
       <br/>
       reply, that all impressions can enter into aesthetic expressions or
       <br/>
       formations, but that none are bound to do so. Dante raised to the
       <br/>
       dignity of form not only the "sweet colour of the oriental sapphire"
       <br/>
       (visual impression), but also tactile or thermic impressions, such as
       <br/>
       the "thick air" and the "fresh rivulets" which "parch all the more" the
       <br/>
       throat of the thirsty. The belief that a picture yields only visual
       <br/>
       impressions is a curious illusion. The bloom of a cheek, the warmth of a
       <br/>
       youthful body, the sweetness and freshness of a fruit, the cutting of a
       <br/>
       sharpened blade, are not these, also, impressions that we have from a
       <br/>
       picture? Maybe they are visual? What would a picture be for a
       <br/>
       hypothetical man, deprived of all or many of his senses, who should in
       <br/>
       an instant acquire the sole organ of sight? The picture we are standing
       <br/>
       opposite and believe we see only with our eyes, would appear to his eyes
       <br/>
       as little more than the paint-smeared palette of a painter.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Some who hold firmly to the aesthetic character of given groups of
       <br/>
       impressions (for example, the visual, the auditive), and exclude others,
       <br/>
       admit, however, that if visual and auditive impressions enter _directly_
       <br/>
       into the aesthetic fact, those of the other senses also enter into it,
       <br/>
       but only as _associated_. But this distinction is altogether arbitrary.
       <br/>
       Aesthetic expression is a synthesis, in which it is impossible to
       <br/>
       distinguish direct and indirect. All impressions are by it placed on a
       <br/>
       level, in so far as they are aestheticised. He who takes into himself
       <br/>
       the image of a picture or of a poem does not experience, as it were, a
       <br/>
       series of impressions as to this image, some of which have a prerogative
       <br/>
       or precedence over others. And nothing is known of what happens prior to
       <br/>
       having received it, for the distinctions made after reflexion have
       <br/>
       nothing to do with art.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The theory of the aesthetic senses has also been presented in another
       <br/>
       way; that is to say, as the attempt to establish what physiological
       <br/>
       organs are necessary for the aesthetic fact. The physiological organ or
       <br/>
       apparatus is nothing but a complex of cellules, thus and thus
       <br/>
       constituted, thus and thus disposed; that is to say, it is merely
       <br/>
       physical and natural fact or concept. But expression does not recognize
       <br/>
       physiological facts. Expression has its point of departure in the
       <br/>
       impressions, and the physiological path by which these have found their
       <br/>
       way to the mind is to it altogether indifferent. One way or another
       <br/>
       amounts to the same thing: it suffices that they are impressions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is true that the want of given organs, that is, of given complexes of
       <br/>
       cells, produces an absence of given impressions (when these are not
       <br/>
       obtained by another path by a kind of organic compensation). The man
       <br/>
       born blind cannot express or have the intuition of light. But the
       <br/>
       impressions are not conditioned solely by the organ, but also by the
       <br/>
       stimuli which operate upon the organ. Thus, he who has never had the
       <br/>
       impression of the sea will never be able to express it, in the same way
       <br/>
       as he who has never had the impression of the great world or of the
       <br/>
       political conflict will never express the one or the other. This,
       <br/>
       however, does not establish a dependence of the expressive function on
       <br/>
       the stimulus or on the organ. It is the repetition of what we know
       <br/>
       already: expression presupposes impression. Therefore, given expressions
       <br/>
       imply given impressions. Besides, every impression excludes other
       <br/>
       impressions during the moment in which it dominates; and so does every
       <br/>
       expression.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Unity and indivisibility of the work of art._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Another corollary of the conception of expression as activity is the
       <br/>
       _indivisibility_ of the work of art. Every expression is a unique
       <br/>
       expression. Activity is a fusion of the impressions in an organic whole.
       <br/>
       A desire to express this has always prompted the affirmation that the
       <br/>
       world of art should have _unity_, or, what amounts to the same thing,
       <br/>
       _unity in variety_. Expression is a synthesis of the various, the
       <br/>
       multiple, in the one.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The fact that we divide a work of art into parts, as a poem into scenes,
       <br/>
       episodes, similes, sentences, or a picture into single figures and
       <br/>
       objects, background, foreground, etc., may seem to be an objection to
       <br/>
       this affirmation. But such division annihilates the work, as dividing
       <br/>
       the organism into heart, brain, nerves, muscles and so on, turns the
       <br/>
       living being into a corpse. It is true that there exist organisms in
       <br/>
       which the division gives place to more living things, but in such a
       <br/>
       case, and if we transfer the analogy to the aesthetic fact, we must
       <br/>
       conclude for a multiplicity of germs of life, that is to say, for a
       <br/>
       speedy re-elaboration of the single parts into new single expressions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It will be observed that expression is sometimes based on other
       <br/>
       expressions. There are simple and there are _compound_ expressions. One
       <br/>
       must admit some difference between the _eureka_, with which Archimedes
       <br/>
       expressed all his joy after his discovery, and the expressive act
       <br/>
       (indeed all the five acts) of a regular tragedy. Not in the least:
       <br/>
       expression is always directly based on impressions. He who conceives a
       <br/>
       tragedy puts into a crucible a great quantity, so to say, of
       <br/>
       impressions: the expressions themselves, conceived on other occasions,
       <br/>
       are fused together with the new in a single mass, in the same way as we
       <br/>
       can cast into a smelting furnace formless pieces of bronze and most
       <br/>
       precious statuettes. Those most precious statuettes must be melted in
       <br/>
       the same way as the formless bits of bronze, before there can be a new
       <br/>
       statue. The old expressions must descend again to the level of
       <br/>
       impressions, in order to be synthetized in a new single expression.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Art as the deliverer._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       By elaborating his impressions, man _frees_ himself from them. By
       <br/>
       objectifying them, he removes them from him and makes himself their
       <br/>
       superior. The liberating and purifying function of art is another aspect
       <br/>
       and another formula of its character of activity. Activity is the
       <br/>
       deliverer, just because it drives away passivity.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       This also explains why it is customary to attribute to artists alike the
       <br/>
       maximum of sensibility or _passion_, and the maximum insensibility or
       <br/>
       Olympic _serenity_. Both qualifications agree, for they do not refer to
       <br/>
       the same object. The sensibility or passion relates to the rich material
       <br/>
       which the artist absorbs into his psychic organism; the insensibility or
       <br/>
       serenity to the form with which he subjugates and dominates the tumult
       <br/>
       of the feelings and of the passions.

       [Sidenote] _Indissolubility of intellective from intuitive knowledge._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The two forms of knowledge, aesthetic and intellectual or conceptual,
       <br/>
       are indeed diverse, but this does not amount altogether to separation
       <br/>
       and disjunction, as we find with two forces going each its own way. If
       <br/>
       we have shown that the aesthetic form is altogether independent of the
       <br/>
       intellectual and suffices to itself without external support, we have
       <br/>
       not said that the intellectual can stand without the aesthetic. This
       <br/>
       _reciprocity_ would not be true.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What is knowledge by concepts? It is knowledge of relations of things,
       <br/>
       and those things are intuitions. Concepts are not possible without
       <br/>
       intuitions, just as intuition is itself impossible without the material
       <br/>
       of impressions. Intuitions are: this river, this lake, this brook, this
       <br/>
       rain, this glass of water; the concept is: water, not this or that
       <br/>
       appearance and particular example of water, but water in general, in
       <br/>
       whatever time or place it be realized; the material of infinite
       <br/>
       intuitions, but of one single and constant concept.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, the concept, the universal, if it be no longer intuition in one
       <br/>
       respect, is in another respect intuition, and cannot fail of being
       <br/>
       intuition. For the man who thinks has impressions and emotions, in so
       <br/>
       far as he thinks. His impression and emotion will not be love or hate,
       <br/>
       but _the effort of his thought itself_, with the pain and the joy, the
       <br/>
       love and the hate joined to it. This effort cannot but become intuitive
       <br/>
       in form, in becoming objective to the mind. To speak, is not to think
       <br/>
       logically; but to _think logically_ is, at the same time, to _speak_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Critique of the negations of this thesis._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That thought cannot exist without speech, is a truth generally admitted.
       <br/>
       The negations of this thesis are all founded on equivoques and errors.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The first of the equivoques is implied by those who observe that one can
       <br/>
       likewise think with geometrical figures, algebraical numbers,
       <br/>
       ideographic signs, without a single word, even pronounced silently and
       <br/>
       almost insensibly within one. They also affirm that there are languages
       <br/>
       in which the word, the phonetic sign, expresses nothing, unless the
       <br/>
       written sign also be looked at. But when we said "speech," we intended
       <br/>
       to employ a synecdoche, and that "expression" generically, should be
       <br/>
       understood, for expression is not only so-called verbal expression, as
       <br/>
       we have already noted. It may be admitted that certain concepts may be
       <br/>
       thought without phonetic manifestations. But the very examples adduced
       <br/>
       to show this also prove that those concepts never exist without
       <br/>
       expressions.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Others maintain that animals, or certain animals, think or reason
       <br/>
       without speaking. Now as to how, whether, and what animals think,
       <br/>
       whether they be rudimentary, half-savage men resisting civilization,
       <br/>
       rather than physiological machines, as the old spiritualists would have
       <br/>
       it, are questions that do not concern us here. When the philosopher
       <br/>
       talks of animal, brutal, impulsive, instinctive nature and the like, he
       <br/>
       does not base himself on conjectures as to these facts concerning dogs
       <br/>
       or cats, lions or ants; but upon observations of what is called animal
       <br/>
       and brutal in man: of the boundary or animal basis of what we feel in
       <br/>
       ourselves. If individual animals, dogs or cats, lions or ants, possess
       <br/>
       something of the activity of man, so much the better, or so much the
       <br/>
       worse for them. This means that as regards them also we must talk, not
       <br/>
       of their nature as a whole, but of its animal basis, as being perhaps
       <br/>
       larger and more strong than the animal basis of man. And if we suppose
       <br/>
       that animals think, and form concepts, what is there in the line of
       <br/>
       conjecture to justify the admission that they do so without
       <br/>
       corresponding expressions? The analogy with man, the knowledge of the
       <br/>
       spirit, human psychology, which is the instrument of all our conjectures
       <br/>
       as to animal psychology, would oblige us to suppose that if they think
       <br/>
       in any way, they also have some sort of speech.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is from human psychology, that is, literary psychology, that comes
       <br/>
       the other objection, to the effect that the concept can exist without
       <br/>
       the word, because it is true that we all know books that are _well
       <br/>
       thought and badly written_: that is to say, a thought which remains
       <br/>
       thought _beyond_ the expression, _notwithstanding_ the imperfect
       <br/>
       expression. But when we talk of books well thought and badly written, we
       <br/>
       cannot mean other than that in those books are parts, pages, periods or
       <br/>
       propositions well thought out and well written, and other parts (perhaps
       <br/>
       the least important) ill thought out and badly written, not truly
       <br/>
       thought out and therefore not truly expressed. Where Vico's _Scienza
       <br/>
       nuova_ is really ill written, it is also ill thought out. If we pass
       <br/>
       from the consideration of big books to a short proposition, the error or
       <br/>
       the imprecision of this statement will be recognized at once. How could
       <br/>
       a proposition be clearly thought and confusedly written out?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All that can be admitted is that sometimes we possess thoughts
       <br/>
       (concepts) in an intuitive form, or in an abbreviated or, better,
       <br/>
       peculiar expression, sufficient for us, but not sufficient to
       <br/>
       communicate it with ease to another or other definite individuals. Hence
       <br/>
       people say inaccurately, that we have the thought without the
       <br/>
       expression; whereas it should properly be said that we have, indeed, the
       <br/>
       expression, but in a form that is not easy of social communication.
       <br/>
       This, however, is a very variable and altogether relative fact. There
       <br/>
       are always people who catch our thought on the wing, and prefer it in
       <br/>
       this abbreviated form, and would be displeased with the greater
       <br/>
       development of it, necessary for other people. In other words, the
       <br/>
       thought considered abstractly and logically will be the same; but
       <br/>
       aesthetically we are dealing with two different intuition-expressions,
       <br/>
       into both of which enter different psychological elements. The same
       <br/>
       argument suffices to destroy, that is, to interpret correctly, the
       <br/>
       altogether empirical distinction between an _internal_ and an _external_
       <br/>
       language.

       [Sidenote] _Art and science._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The most lofty manifestations, the summits of intellectual and of
       <br/>
       intuitive knowledge shining from afar, are called, as we know, Art and
       <br/>
       Science. Art and Science, then, are different and yet linked together;
       <br/>
       they meet on one side, which is the aesthetic side. Every scientific
       <br/>
       work is also a work of art. The aesthetic side may remain little
       <br/>
       noticed, when our mind is altogether taken up with the effort to
       <br/>
       understand the thought of the man of science, and to examine its truth.
       <br/>
       But it is no longer concealed, when we pass from the activity of
       <br/>
       understanding to that of contemplation, and behold that thought either
       <br/>
       developed before us, limpid, exact, well-shaped, without superfluous
       <br/>
       words, without lack of words, with appropriate rhythm and intonation; or
       <br/>
       confused, broken, embarrassed, tentative. Great thinkers are sometimes
       <br/>
       termed great writers, while other equally great thinkers remain more or
       <br/>
       less fragmentary writers, if indeed their fragments are scientifically
       <br/>
       to be compared with harmonious, coherent, and perfect works.

       [Sidenote] _Content and form: another meaning. Prose and poetry._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We pardon thinkers and men of science their literary mediocrity. The
       <br/>
       fragments console us for the failure of the whole, for it is far more
       <br/>
       easy to recover the well-arranged composition from the fragmentary work
       <br/>
       of genius than to achieve the discovery of genius. But how can we pardon
       <br/>
       mediocre expression in pure artists? _Mediocribus esse poetis non di,
       <br/>
       non homines, non concessere columnae_. The poet or painter who lacks
       <br/>
       form, lacks everything, because he lacks _himself_. Poetical material
       <br/>
       permeates the Soul of all: the expression alone, that is to say, the
       <br/>
       form, makes the poet. And here appears the truth of the thesis which
       <br/>
       denies to art all content, as content being understood just the
       <br/>
       intellectual concept. In this sense, when we take "content" as equal to
       <br/>
       "concept" it is most true, not only that art does not consist of
       <br/>
       content, but also that _it has no content_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In the same way the distinction between _poetry and prose_ cannot be
       <br/>
       justified, save in that of art and science. It was seen in antiquity
       <br/>
       that such distinction could not be founded on external elements, such as
       <br/>
       rhythm and metre, or on the freedom or the limitation of the form; that
       <br/>
       it was, on the contrary, altogether internal. Poetry is the language of
       <br/>
       sentiment; prose of the intellect; but since the intellect is also
       <br/>
       sentiment, in its concretion and reality, so all prose has a poetical
       <br/>
       side.

       <br/>
       The relation between intuitive knowledge or expression, and intellectual
       <br/>
       knowledge or concept, between art and science, poetry and prose, cannot
       <br/>
       be otherwise defined than by saying that it is one of _double degree_.
       <br/>
       The first degree is the expression, the second the concept: the first
       <br/>
       can exist without the second, but the second cannot exist without the
       <br/>
       first. There exists poetry without prose, but not prose without poetry.
       <br/>
       Expression, indeed, is the first affirmation of human activity. Poetry
       <br/>
       is "the maternal language of the human race"; the first men "were by
       <br/>
       nature sublime poets." We also admit this in another way, when we
       <br/>
       observe that the passage from soul to mind, from animal to human
       <br/>
       activity, is effected by means of language. And this should be said of
       <br/>
       intuition or expression in general. But to us it appears somewhat
       <br/>
       inaccurate to define language or expression as an _intermediate_ link
       <br/>
       between nature and humanity, as though it were a mixture of the one and
       <br/>
       of the other. Where humanity appears, the rest has already disappeared;
       <br/>
       the man who expresses himself, certainly emerges from the state of
       <br/>
       nature, but he really does emerge: he does not stand half within and
       <br/>
       half without, as the use of the phrase "intermediate link" would imply.

       _Historicity_ is incorrectly held to be a third theoretical form.
       <br/>
       History is not form, but content: as form, it is nothing but intuition
       <br/>
       or aesthetic fact. History does not seek for laws nor form concepts; it
       <br/>
       employs neither induction nor deduction; it is directed _ad narrandum,
       <br/>
       non ad demonstrandum_; it does not construct universals and
       <br/>
       abstractions, but posits intuitions. The this, the that, the _individuum
       <br/>
       omni modo determinatum_, is its kingdom, as it is the kingdom of art.
       <br/>
       History, therefore, is included under the universal concept of art.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Faced with this proposition and with the impossibility of conceiving a
       <br/>
       third mode of knowledge, objections have been brought forward which
       <br/>
       would lead to the affiliation of history to intellective or scientific
       <br/>
       knowledge. The greater portion of these objections is dominated by the
       <br/>
       prejudice that in refusing to history the character of conceptual
       <br/>
       science, something of its value and dignity has been taken from it. This
       <br/>
       really arises from a false idea of art, conceived, not as an essential
       <br/>
       theoretic function, but as an amusement, a superfluity, a frivolity.

       Without reopening a long debate, which so far as we are concerned, is
       <br/>
       finally closed, we will mention here one sophism which has been and
       <br/>
       still is widely repeated. It is intended to show the logical and
       <br/>
       scientific nature of history. The sophism consists in admitting that
       <br/>
       historical knowledge has for its object the individual; but not the
       <br/>
       representation, it is added, so much as the concept of the individual.
       <br/>
       From this it is argued that history is also a logical or scientific form
       <br/>
       of knowledge. History, in fact, should elaborate the concept of a
       <br/>
       personage such as Charlemagne or Napoleon; of an epoch, like the
       <br/>
       Renaissance or the Reformation; of an event, such as the French
       <br/>
       Revolution and the Unification of Italy. This it is held to do in the
       <br/>
       same way as Geometry elaborates the concepts of spatial form, or
       <br/>
       Aesthetic those of expression. But all this is untrue. History cannot do
       <br/>
       otherwise than represent Napoleon and Charlemagne, the Renaissance and
       <br/>
       the Reformation, the French Revolution and the Unification of Italy as
       <br/>
       individual facts with their individual physiognomy: that is, in the same
       <br/>
       way as logicians state, that one cannot have a concept of an individual,
       <br/>
       but only a representation. The so-called concept of the individual is
       <br/>
       always a universal or general concept, full of details, very rich, if
       <br/>
       you will, but however rich it be, yet incapable of attaining to that
       <br/>
       individuality, to which historical knowledge, as aesthetic knowledge,
       <br/>
       alone attains.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Let us rather show how the content of history comes to be distinguished
       <br/>
       from that of art. The distinction is secondary. Its origin will be found
       <br/>
       in what has already been observed as to the ideal character of the
       <br/>
       intuition or first perception, in which all is real and therefore
       <br/>
       nothing is real. The mind forms the concepts of external and internal at
       <br/>
       a later stage, as it does those of what has happened and of what is
       <br/>
       desired, of object and subject, and the like. Thus it distinguishes
       <br/>
       historical from non-historical intuition, the _real_ from the _unreal_,
       <br/>
       real fancy from pure fancy. Even internal facts, what is desired and
       <br/>
       imagined, castles in the air, and countries of Cockagne, have their
       <br/>
       reality. The soul, too, has its history. His illusions form part of the
       <br/>
       biography of every individual. But the history of an individual soul is
       <br/>
       history, because in it is always active the distinction between the real
       <br/>
       and the unreal, even when the real is the illusions themselves. But
       <br/>
       these distinctive concepts do not appear in history as do scientific
       <br/>
       concepts, but rather like those that we have seen dissolved and melted
       <br/>
       in the aesthetic intuitions, although they stand out in history in an
       <br/>
       altogether new relief. History does not construct the concepts of the
       <br/>
       real and unreal, but makes use of them. History, in fact, is not the
       <br/>
       theory of history. Mere conceptual analysis is of no use in realizing
       <br/>
       whether an event in our lives were real or imaginary. It is necessary to
       <br/>
       reproduce the intuitions in the mind in the most complete form, as they
       <br/>
       were at the moment of production, in order to recognize the content.
       <br/>
       Historicity is distinguished in the concrete from pure imagination only
       <br/>
       as one intuition is distinguished from another: in the memory.

       [Sidenote] _Historical scepticism._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Where this is not possible, owing to the delicate and fleeting shades
       <br/>
       between the real and unreal intuitions, which confuse the one with the
       <br/>
       other, we must either renounce, for the time at least, the knowledge of
       <br/>
       what really happened (and this we often do), or we must fall back upon
       <br/>
       conjecture, verisimilitude, probability. The principle of verisimilitude
       <br/>
       and of probability dominates in fact all historical criticism.
       <br/>
       Examination of the sources and of authority is directed toward
       <br/>
       establishing the most credible evidence. And what is the most credible
       <br/>
       evidence, save that of the best observers, that is, of those who best
       <br/>
       remember and (be it understood) have not desired to falsify, nor had
       <br/>
       interest in falsifying the truth of things? From this it follows that
       <br/>
       intellectual scepticism finds it easy to deny the certainty of any
       <br/>
       history, for the certainty of history is never that of science.
       <br/>
       Historical certainty is composed of memory and of authority, not of
       <br/>
       analyses and of demonstration. To speak of historical induction or
       <br/>
       demonstration, is to make a metaphorical use of these expressions, which
       <br/>
       bear quite a different meaning in history to that which they bear in
       <br/>
       science. The conviction of the historian is the undemonstrable
       <br/>
       conviction of the juryman, who has heard the witnesses, listened
       <br/>
       attentively to the case, and prayed Heaven to inspire him. Sometimes,
       <br/>
       without doubt, he is mistaken, but the mistakes are in a negligible
       <br/>
       minority compared with the occasions when he gets hold of the truth.
       <br/>
       That is why good sense is right against the intellectualists, in
       <br/>
       believing in history, which is not a "fable agreed upon," but that which
       <br/>
       the individual and humanity remember of their past. We strive to enlarge
       <br/>
       and to render as precise as possible this record, which in some places
       <br/>
       is dim, in others very clear. We cannot do without it, such as it is,
       <br/>
       and taken as a whole, it is rich in truth. In a spirit of paradox only,
       <br/>
       can one doubt if there ever were a Greece or a Rome, an Alexander or a
       <br/>
       Caesar, a feudal Europe overthrown by a series of revolutions, that on
       <br/>
       the 1st of November 1517 the theses of Luther were seen fixed to the
       <br/>
       door of the church of Wittenberg, or that the Bastile was taken by the
       <br/>
       people of Paris on the 14th of July 1789.

       sciences, and their limits._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The world of what has happened, of the concrete, of history, is the
       <br/>
       world that is called real, natural, including in this definition the
       <br/>
       reality that is called physical, as well as that which is called
       <br/>
       spiritual and human. All this world is intuition; historical intuition,
       <br/>
       if it be realistically shown as it is, or imaginary intuition, artistic
       <br/>
       in the strict sense, if shown under the aspect of the possible, that is
       <br/>
       to say, of the imaginable.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Science, true science, which is not intuition but concept, not
       <br/>
       individuality but universality, cannot be anything but a science of the
       <br/>
       spirit, that is, of what is universal in reality: Philosophy. If natural
       <br/>
       _sciences_ be spoken of, apart from philosophy, it is necessary to
       <br/>
       observe that these are not perfect sciences: they are complexes of
       <br/>
       knowledge, arbitrarily abstracted and fixed. The so-called natural
       <br/>
       sciences themselves recognize, in fact, that they are surrounded by
       <br/>
       limitations. These limitations are nothing more than historical and
       <br/>
       intuitive data. They calculate, measure, establish equalities,
       <br/>
       regularity, create classes and types, formulate laws, show in their own
       <br/>
       way how one fact arises out of other facts; but in their progress they
       <br/>
       are always met with facts which are known intuitively and historically.
       <br/>
       Even geometry now states that it rests altogether on hypotheses, since
       <br/>
       space is not three-dimensional or Euclidean, but this assumption is made
       <br/>
       use of by preference, because it is more convenient. What there is of
       <br/>
       truth in the natural sciences, is either philosophy or historical fact.
       <br/>
       What they contain proper to themselves is abstract and arbitrary. When
       <br/>
       the natural sciences wish to form themselves into perfect sciences, they
       <br/>
       must issue from their circle and enter the philosophical circle. This
       <br/>
       they do when they posit concepts which are anything but natural, such as
       <br/>
       those of the atom without extension in space, of ether or vibrating
       <br/>
       matter, of vital force, of space beyond the reach of intuition, and the
       <br/>
       like. These are true and proper philosophical efforts, when they are not
       <br/>
       mere words void of meaning. The concepts of natural science are, without
       <br/>
       doubt, most useful; but one cannot obtain from them that _system_, which
       <br/>
       belongs only to the spirit.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These historical and intuitive assumptions, which cannot be separated
       <br/>
       from the natural sciences, furthermore explain, not only how, in the
       <br/>
       progress of knowledge, that which was once considered to be truth
       <br/>
       descends gradually to the grade of mythological beliefs and imaginary
       <br/>
       illusions, but also how, among natural scientists, there are some who
       <br/>
       term all that serves as basis of argument in their teaching _mythical
       <br/>
       facts, verbal expedients_, or _conventions_. The naturalists and
       <br/>
       mathematicians who approach the study of the energies of the spirit
       <br/>
       without preparation, are apt to carry thither these mental habits and to
       <br/>
       speak, in philosophy, of such and such conventions "as arranged by man."
       <br/>
       They make conventions of truth and morality, and their supreme
       <br/>
       convention is the Spirit itself! However, if there are to be
       <br/>
       conventions, something must exist about which there is no convention to
       <br/>
       be made, but which is itself the agent of the convention. This is the
       <br/>
       spiritual activity of man. The limitation of the natural sciences
       <br/>
       postulates the illimitation of philosophy.

       HISTORICISM AND INTELLECTUALISM IN AESTHETIC
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These relations between intuitive or aesthetic knowledge and the other
       <br/>
       fundamental or derivative forms of knowledge having been definitely
       <br/>
       established, we are now in a position to reveal the errors of a series
       <br/>
       of theories which have been, or are, presented, as theories of
       <br/>
       Aesthetic.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Critique of verisimilitude and of naturalism._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From the confusion between the exigencies of art in general and the
       <br/>
       particular exigencies of history has arisen the theory (which has lost
       <br/>
       ground to-day, but used to dominate in the past) of _verisimilitude_ as
       <br/>
       the object of art. As is generally the case with erroneous propositions,
       <br/>
       the intention of those who employed and employ the concept of
       <br/>
       verisimilitude has no doubt often been much more reasonable than the
       <br/>
       definition given of the word. By verisimilitude used to be meant the
       <br/>
       artistic _coherence_ of the representation, that is to say, its
       <br/>
       completeness and effectiveness. If "verisimilar" be translated by
       <br/>
       "coherent," a most exact meaning will often be found in the discussions,
       <br/>
       examples, and judgments of the critics. An improbable personage, an
       <br/>
       improbable ending to a comedy, are really badly-drawn personages,
       <br/>
       badly-arranged endings, happenings without artistic motive. It has been
       <br/>
       said with reason that even fairies and sprites must have verisimilitude,
       <br/>
       that is to say, be really sprites and fairies, coherent artistic
       <br/>
       intuitions. Sometimes the word "possible" has been used instead of
       <br/>
       "verisimilar." As we have already remarked in passing, this word
       <br/>
       possible is synonymous with that which is imaginable or may be known
       <br/>
       intuitively. Everything which is really, that is to say, coherently,
       <br/>
       imagined, is possible. But formerly, and especially by the
       <br/>
       theoreticians, by verisimilar was understood historical credibility, or
       <br/>
       that historical truth which is not demonstrable, but conjecturable, not
       <br/>
       true, but verisimilar. It has been sought to impose a like character
       <br/>
       upon art. Who does not recall the great part played in literary history
       <br/>
       by the criticism of the verisimilar? For example, the fault found with
       <br/>
       the _Jerusalem Delivered_, based upon the history of the Crusades, or of
       <br/>
       the Homeric poems, upon that of the verisimilitude of the costume of the
       <br/>
       emperors and kings?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       At other times has been imposed upon art the duty of the aesthetic
       <br/>
       reproduction of historical reality. This is another of the erroneous
       <br/>
       significations assumed by the theory concerning _the imitation of
       <br/>
       nature_. Verism and naturalism have since afforded the spectacle of a
       <br/>
       confusion of the aesthetic fact with the processes of the natural
       <br/>
       sciences, by aiming at some sort of _experimental_ drama or romance.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Critique of ideas in art, of theses in art, and of the
       <br/>
       typical._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The confusions between the methods of art and those of the philosophical
       <br/>
       sciences have been far more frequent. Thus it has often been held to be
       <br/>
       within the competence of art to develop concepts, to unite the
       <br/>
       intelligible with the sensible, to represent _ideas or universals_,
       <br/>
       putting art in the place of science, that is, confusing the artistic
       <br/>
       function in general with the particular case in which it becomes
       <br/>
       aesthetico-logical.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The theory of art as supporting _theses_ can be reduced to the same
       <br/>
       error, as can be the theory of art considered as individual
       <br/>
       representation, exemplifying scientific laws. The example, in so far as
       <br/>
       it is an example, stands for the thing exemplified, and is thus an
       <br/>
       exposition of the universal, that is to say, a form of science, more or
       <br/>
       less popular or vulgarized.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The same may be said of the aesthetic theory of the _typical_, when by
       <br/>
       type is understood, as it frequently is, just the abstraction or the
       <br/>
       concept, and it is affirmed that art should make _the species shine in
       <br/>
       the individual_. If by typical be here understood the individual, here,
       <br/>
       too, we have a merely verbal variation. To typify would signify, in this
       <br/>
       case, to characterize; that is, to determine and to represent the
       <br/>
       individual. Don Quixote is a type; but of whom is he a type, if not of
       <br/>
       all Don Quixotes? A type, that is to say, of himself. Certainly he is
       <br/>
       not a type of abstract concepts, such as the loss of the sense of
       <br/>
       reality, or of the love of glory. An infinite number of personages can
       <br/>
       be thought of under these concepts, who are not Don Quixote. In other
       <br/>
       words, we find our own impressions fully determined and verified in the
       <br/>
       expression of a poet (for example in a poetical personage). We call that
       <br/>
       expression typical, which we might call simply aesthetic. Poetical or
       <br/>
       artistic universals have been spoken of in like manner, in order to show
       <br/>
       that the artistic product is altogether spiritual and ideal in itself.

       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Critique of the symbol and of the allegory._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Continuing to correct these errors, or to make clear equivoques, we will
       <br/>
       note that the _symbol_ has sometimes been given as essence of art. Now,
       <br/>
       if the symbol be given as inseparable from the artistic intuition, it is
       <br/>
       the synonym of the intuition itself, which always has an ideal
       <br/>
       character. There is no double-bottom to art, but one only; in art all is
       <br/>
       symbolical, because all is ideal. But if the symbol be looked upon as
       <br/>
       separable--if on the one side can be expressed the symbol, and on the
       <br/>
       other the thing symbolized, we fall back again into the intellectualist
       <br/>
       error: that pretended symbol is the exposition of an abstract concept,
       <br/>
       it is an _allegory_, it is science, or art that apes science. But we
       <br/>
       must be just toward the allegorical also. In some cases, it is
       <br/>
       altogether harmless. Given the _Gerusalemme liberata_, the allegory was
       <br/>
       imagined afterwards; given the _Adone_ of Marino, the poet of the
       <br/>
       lascivious insinuated afterwards that it was written to show how
       <br/>
       "immoderate indulgence ends in pain"; given a statue of a beautiful
       <br/>
       woman, the sculptor can write on a card that the statue represents
       <br/>
       _Clemency_ or _Goodness_. This allegory linked to a finished work _post
       <br/>
       festum_ does not change the work of art. What is it, then? It is an
       <br/>
       expression externally _added_ to another expression. A little page of
       <br/>
       prose is added to the _Gerusalemme_, expressing another thought of the
       <br/>
       poet; a verse or a strophe is added to the _Adone_, expressing what the
       <br/>
       poet would like to make a part of his public swallow; while to the

       [Sidenote] _Critique of the theory of artistic and literary classes._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But the greatest triumph of the intellectualist error lies in the theory
       <br/>
       of artistic and literary classes, which still has vogue in literary
       <br/>
       treatises, and disturbs the critics and the historians of art. Let us
       <br/>
       observe its genesis.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The human mind can pass from the aesthetic to the logical, just because
       <br/>
       the former is a first step, in respect to the latter. It can destroy the
       <br/>
       expressions, that is, the thought of the individual with the thought of
       <br/>
       the universal. It can reduce expressive facts to logical relations. We
       <br/>
       have already shown that this operation in its turn becomes concrete in
       <br/>
       an expression, but this does not mean that the first expressions have
       <br/>
       not been destroyed. They have yielded their place to the new
       <br/>
       aesthetico-logical expressions. When we are on the second step, we have
       <br/>
       left the first.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       He who enters a picture-gallery, or who reads a series of poems, may,
       <br/>
       after he has looked and read, go further: he may seek out the relations
       <br/>
       of the things there expressed. Thus those pictures and compositions,
       <br/>
       each of which is an individual inexpressible by logic, are resolved into
       <br/>
       universals and abstractions, such as _costumes, landscapes, portraits,
       <br/>
       domestic life, battles, animals, flowers, fruit, seascapes, lakes,
       <br/>
       deserts, tragic, comic, piteous, cruel, lyrical, epic, dramatic,
       <br/>
       knightly, idyllic facts_, and the like. They are often also resolved
       <br/>
       into merely quantitative categories, such as _little picture, picture,
       <br/>
       statuette, group, madrigal, song, sonnet, garland of sonnets, poetry,
       <br/>
       poem, story, romance_, and the like.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       When we think the concept _domestic life_, or _knighthood_, or _idyll_,
       <br/>
       or _cruelty_, or any other quantitative concept, the individual
       <br/>
       expressive fact from which we started is abandoned. From aesthetes that
       <br/>
       we were, we have been changed into logicians; from contemplators of
       <br/>
       expression, into reasoners. Certainly no objection can be made to such a
       <br/>
       process. In what other way could science be born, which, if aesthetic
       <br/>
       expressions be assumed in it, yet has for function to go beyond them?
       <br/>
       The logical or scientific form, as such, excludes the aesthetic form. He
       <br/>
       who begins to think scientifically has already ceased to contemplate
       <br/>
       aesthetically; although his thought will assume of necessity in its turn
       <br/>
       an aesthetic form, as has already been said, and as it would be
       <br/>
       superfluous to repeat.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The error begins when we try to deduce the expression from the concept,
       <br/>
       and to find in the thing substituting the laws of the thing substituted;
       <br/>
       when the difference between the second and the first step has not been
       <br/>
       observed, and when, in consequence, we declare that we are standing on
       <br/>
       the first step, when we are really standing on the second. This error is
       <br/>
       known as _the theory of artistic and literary classes_.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       What is the aesthetic form of domestic life, of knighthood, of the
       <br/>
       idyll, of cruelty, and so forth? How should these contents be
       <br/>
       _represented_? Such is the absurd problem implied in the theory of
       <br/>
       artistic and literary classes. It is in this that consists all search
       <br/>
       after laws or rules of styles. Domestic life, knighthood, idyll,
       <br/>
       cruelty, and the like, are not impressions, but concepts. They are not
       <br/>
       contents, but logico-aesthetic forms. You cannot express the form, for
       <br/>
       it is already itself expression. And what are the words cruelty, idyll,
       <br/>
       knighthood, domestic life, and so on, but the expression of those
       <br/>
       concepts?
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Even the most refined of these distinctions, those that have the most
       <br/>
       philosophic appearance, do not resist criticism; as, for instance, when
       <br/>
       works of art are divided into the subjective and the objective styles,
       <br/>
       into lyric and epic, into works of feeling and works of design. It is
       <br/>
       impossible to separate in aesthetic analysis, the subjective from the
       <br/>
       objective side, the lyric from the epic, the image of feeling from that
       <br/>
       of things.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       [Sidenote] _Errors derived from this theory appearing in judgments
       <br/>
       on art._
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From the theory of the artistic and literary classes derive those
       <br/>
       erroneous modes of judgment and of criticism, thanks to which, instead
       <br/>
       of asking before a work of art if it be expressive, and what it
       <br/>
       expresses, whether it speak or stammer, or be silent altogether, it is
       <br/>
       asked if it be obedient to the _laws_ of the epic poem, or to those of
       <br/>
       tragedy, to those of historical portraiture, or to those of landscape
       <br/>
       painting. Artists, however, while making a verbal pretence of agreeing,
       <br/>
       or yielding a feigned obedience to them, have really always disregarded
       <br/>
       these _laws of styles_. Every true work of art has violated some
       <br/>
       established class and upset the ideas of the critics, who have thus been
       <br/>
       obliged to enlarge the number of classes, until finally even this
       <br/>
       enlargement has proved too narrow, owing to the appearance of new works
       <br/>
       of art, which are naturally followed by new scandals, new upsettings,
       <br/>
       and-new enlargements.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       From the same theory come the prejudices, owing to which at one time
       <br/>
       (and is it really passed?) people used to lament that Italy had no
       <br/>
       tragedy (until a poet arose who gave to Italy that wreath which was the
       <br/>
       only thing wanting to her glorious hair), nor France the epic poem
