    This excerpt from the essay "King-Kill/33"
has been out of print since 1987 and the publication of the first edition
of Adam Parfrey's conspiracy anthology, 'Apocalypse Culture.' Subsequent
editions of 'Apocalypse Culture' (including the current Feral House edition),
do not carry it.

    Convicted Mafia hit-man Charles Harrelson, a suspected
Kennedy assassin, is incarcerated in a Federal prison for the contract killing
of a federal judge. (The suspect is the father of "Natural Born Killer"
movie star Woody Harrelson, who was directed by "JFK" filmmaker
Oliver Stone). Journalists have thus far shown little interest in attempting
to interview the senior Harrelson and persuade him to provide information
which might lead to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Kennedy's
killing.

    The late James Shelby Downard's primal way of looking
at things, which is the way I think ancient man perceived the world, encompasses
a vision that detects every link and every symbol, beginning with the significance
of names, then places and then the obsessive actions which stem from the
confluence of the two and which have come to be known as ritual. Publisher
Adam Parfrey, who first brought Shelby's work to a mass audience, states:
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    "In Downard's writings, the products of his
subconscious bubble to the surface and catalyze painstaking research. The
collision of the poetic against the logical works especially well in the
field of conspiracy; it remains the freshest approach to a field of inquiry..."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    I remember sitting in Shelby's airstream trailer
in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1977, along with the great Fortean philosopher
William N. Grimstad and Charles Saunders, a brilliant recluse who was a
close friend of Jack Kerouac toward the end of the Beat writer's life (a
fact missed by every one of Kerouac's numerous biographers; so much for
biographers).
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Shelby's conversation that day ranged from the
occult significance of the Theremin musical instrument to the sorcerous
implications of elevators, the relationship he had with an evanescent rabbit
named Petey; the sinister connotations of the circus and the mystical topography
of the American Southwest, which Mr. Downard knew the way you and I know
our backyard.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    As he fried our hamburgers, he regaled us in his
prospector's drawl with the hidden wonders of a tapestry of coincidences
which he wove from the seeming mundane details of everyday living, into
a magic carpet of incomparable strangeness and peerless utility.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Parfrey spoke for many of Shelby's friends and
associates when he stated: "Downard has influenced me to look with
interest upon the details and the fantastic convergences of life..."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    For my money, James Shelby Downard is the one man
most intimately tied to the once and future November, on the Camelot calendar's
33rd turning of the wheel, in this age of the Revelation of the Method;
the era of the deluge of hidden facts made public, which Downard predicted
would not liberate us, but only enslave us further.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    More than two decades ago he foresaw the coming
of this time as the fulfillment of the final dictum of the alchemical rampage
of the elephant Must Be; the behemoth run amok in the fields of our nightmares.
As the "X-Files" and the other fictional TV shows which neither
I or Shelby have ever seen, purposefully muddy the waters with a flood of
pop drivel disguised as revelation, the actual truths are lost in the swirl.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    James Shelby Downard looked forward to the time
beyond Must Be, to the era which will witness the return of could be. After
the coming cataclysmic chastisement has run its cleansing course, we will
once again wish upon a star and dream a destiny free of the masonic chain
that at present binds our nation as tightly as the hangman's rope once bound
the rotted cadavers on Tyburn Tree.

    The information I present in these pages on the
Kennedy assassination is well-known to certain news agencies who have chosen
to suppress it, just as the motivation for the assassination has been plunged
into cryonic secrecy. Masonic betrayal of the "common man" involves
archetypes of fertility and death symbolism seemingly motivated to bring
about syncretism in opposing principles in order to green Israel, rebuild
the Temple of Solomon and establish a One World government.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    It is by way of Masonic sorcery that the union
of opposing principles is supposed to be brought about. The criminals who
stage-managed Dallas in the killing of Kennedy have controlled the American
people's will in exchange for a sleep without nightmares. I publish this
in the wake of the situation Charles Seymour alluded to: "The moralist
unquestionably secures wide support; but he also wearies his audience."
Most Americans are beyond being tired; the revelations have benumbed them.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Most Freemasons apparently have no idea of the
evil that is part of Masonry, and if they do know about it they don't believe
it. The same holds true for most members of the "Clandestine Lodges"
and Masonic-oriented fraternal organizations as well as Androgynous Masonic
Societies.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    It is certain that onomatology, or the science
of names, forms a very interesting part of the investigations of the higher
Masonry.... --(

    When the ancients saw a scapegoat, they could at
least recognize him for what he was: a pharmakos, a human sacrifice. When
modern man sees one, he does not, or refuses to, recognize him for what
he IS; instead he looks for "scientific" explanations-to explain
away the obvious.

  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The "science of names" word wizardry
forms only one segment of the science of symbolism used by Masons. The JFK
assassination encounters this science in a decisive way and contains a veritable
nightmare of symbol-complexes having to do with violence, perversion, conspiracy,
death and degradation. These elements are important not only as cause-and-effect
in the murder of a president but in the ensuing reaction of the people of
America and the world.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The fertility and death symbolism in the "Killing
of the King" rite which is part of Greening Ritualism that has to do
with JFK, has been suppressed because examination of it must necessarily
link it to "Freemasonry" and its mysticism, as well as to the
political influence it exerts. Obviously this would do some damage to public
confidence in:
   </font>

    a. Masonic progressivism. i.e. Iiberty, equality,

   </font>
  </p>

    c. The entire mental concept that passes for knowledge

     Mystical Toponomy
    </font>
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Mystical toponomy incorporates word wizardry (onomatology)
and the Masonic science of symbolism. In considering my data it would be
helpful to consider a dictum of Einsteinian physics: "Time relations
among events are assumed to be first constituted by the specific physical
relations obtaining between them."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    My study of place names imbued with sorcerous significance
necessarily includes lines of latitude and longitude and the divisions of
degrees in geography and cartography (minutes and seconds).
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Let us take as an example the "Mason Road"
in Texas that connects to the "Mason No El Bar" and the Texas-New
Mexico ("The Land of Enchantment") border. This connecting line
is on the 32nd degree. The 32nd degree is the penultimate Masonic degree
awarded. When this 32nd degree of latitude is traced west into the "Land
of Enchantment" it becomes situated midway between Deming and Columbus,
New Mexico.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Slightly to the north of the town of Columbus are
the
    <i>
     Tres Hermanas
    </i>
    (three sisters) mountains. It is approximately
32 miles between Deming and Columbus. The Three Sisters mountains are a
minute and some seconds south of the 32nd degree line. When this line is
traced further west it passes the ghost town of Shakespeare at a distance
south of the town which is roughly equivalent to the distance which the
32nd degree line passes north of the Three Sisters mountains. The names
"Shakespeare" and "Three Sisters" find a connection
in the tragedy Macbeth which comprises such a large part of JFK assassination
imagery.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    When this 32nd degree line is traced a little distance
farther west, into Arizona, it crosses an old trail which meandered north
of what is now another ghost town but which at one time was called the town
of "Ruby." Part of the old winding trail became known as the "Ruby
Road." The town of Ruby acquired its name officially on April 11, 1912,
and was notorious for many brutal murders which had ritual aspects. Four
of these homicides occurred in a store attached to the post office which
had been erected over the grave of a Catholic priest.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Continuing on with mystical toponomy, one encounters
the fact that Ruby road twists north into the area known as the Kennedy
and Johnson mountains.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Johnson Mountain is supposedly named after the
general manager of the Peabody Mining Company who also had a town named
after him which was the location of the Keystone and Peabody copper mines.
The 32nd degree of latitude is but a few seconds from Johnson. In this frontier
town on a December evening, 1883, a Colonel Mike Smith and a man Mason were
ambushed by gunfighters described as being of questionable reputation and
questionable character. These terms are employed in Masonic writings:
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    He [Captain William Morgan, victim of an early
19th century torture-murder by Masons] was a man of questionable character
and dissolute habits, and his enmity to Masonry originated in his refusal
of the Masons of Leroy. (
    <i>
     Encyclopedia of Freemasonry
    </i>
    ).
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    A "keystone" is the designation for which,
when set in place, "keys" or locks the whole. A symbolic keystone
is vital to the legend of the Masonic Royal Arch Degree of York. The earliest
known record of such a degree is in the annals of the city of Fredericksburg,
Virginia, on December 22, 1753. Fredericksburg is also the location of the
"House of the Rising Sun," a masonic meeting place for such notables
as founding fathers George Washington and Benjamin Franklin (of Hell-Fire
Club fame) and George Mason.

     The Killing of the King
    </font>
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Never allow anyone the luxury of assuming that
because the dead and deadening scenery of the American city-of-dreadful-night
is so utterly devoid of mystery, so thoroughly flat-footed, sterile and
infantile, so burdened with the illusory gloss of "baseball-hot dogs-apple-pie-and-Chevrolet"
that it is somehow outside the psycho-sexual domain.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The eternal pagan psychodrama is escalated under
these "modern" conditions precisely because sorcery is not what
20th century man can accept as real. Thus the "Killing of the King"
rite of November, 1963 is alternately diagnosed as a conflict Needless to
say, each of these groups has a place in the symbolism having to do with
the Kennedy assassination.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    But the ultimate purpose of that assassination
was not political or economic but sorcerous: for the control of the dreaming
mind and the marshalling of its forces is the omnipotent force in this entire
scenario of lies, cruelty and degradation. Something died in the American
people on November 22, 1963-call it idealism, innocence or the quest for
moral excellence. It is the transformation of human beings which is the
authentic reason and motive for the Kennedy murder and until so-called conspiracy
theorists can accept this very real element they will be reduced to so many
eccentrics amusing a tiny remnant of dilettantes and hobbyists.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    President Kennedy and his wife left the Temple
Houston and were met at midnight by tireless crowds present to cheer the
virile "Sun God" and his dazzlingly erotic wife, the "Queen
of Love and Beauty," in Fort Worth. On the morning of November 22,
they flew to Gate 28 at Love Field, Dallas, Texas. The number 28 is one
of the correspondences of Solomon in kabbalistic numerology; the Solomonic
name assigned to 28 is "Beale."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    On the 28th degree of latitude in the state of
Texas is the site of what was once the giant "Kennedy ranch."
On the 28th degree is also Cape Canaveral from which the moon flight was
launched-made possible not only by the President's various feats but by
his death as well, for the placing of the Freemasons on the moon could occur
only after the Killing of the King. The 28th degree of Templarism is the
"King of the Sun" degree. The President and First Lady arrived
in Air Force One, code-named "Angel."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The motorcade proceeded from Love Field to Dealey
Plaza. Dealey Plaza is the site of the Masonic temple in Dallas (now razed)
and there is a marker attesting to this fact in the plaza.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Important "protective" strategy for Dealey
Plaza was planned by the New Orleans CIA station whose headquarters were
a Masonic temple building. Dallas, Texas is located ten miles north of the
33rd degree of latitude. The 33rd degree is the highest in Freemasonry and
the founding lodge of the Scottish Rite in America was created in Charleston,
South Carolina, exactly on the 33rd degree line.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Dealey Plaza is close to the Trinity River. At
12:22 p.m. the motorcade proceeded down Main Street toward the Triple Underpass,
traveling first down ("Bloody") Elm St. The latter was the scene
of numerous gun fights, stabbings and other violence, and it is the location
of the Majestic Theatre, the pawn shop/negro district, and industrial district.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    It was also the home of the Blue Front Tavern,
a Masonic hangout in the grand tradition of "tavern-Masonry":
Sam Adams and the Masons of the American Revolution did much of their conspiring
at the Green Dragon Tavern in Boston. One of the many bars claiming the
honor of being the first Masonic lodge is the Bunch of Grapes Tavern, also
in Boston.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The Blue Front was the site of the "broken-man"
ritual in which various members of the "Brotherhood of the Broom"
swept the floor and tended some fierce javelino pigs. The Blue Front was
once a fire-house and was still sporting its fire-pole in the late 1920s.
This is extremely germane symbolism. The national offices of the Texaco
Oil Corporation are located on Elm St., Dallas. Its chief products are "Haviland
(javalino) Oil" and "Fire Chief" gasoline.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    On the corner of Bloody Elm and Houston is the
"Sexton Building." "Sexton" is heavily laden with graveyard
connotations. It is closely associated to the beetles of the genus Necrophorus
or Sexton Beetles, so-called because they bury the remains of tiny animals
with their eggs.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Bloody Elm, Main, and Commerce form a trident pattern
in alignment with the triple underpass as any Dallas map will show. Many
analysts contend that at least three assassins were involved in the crossfire
ambush of Kennedy.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    It is a prime tenet of Masonry that its assassins
come in threes. Masonic assassins are known in the code of the lodge as
the "unworthy craftsmen." Because Masonry is obsessed with earth-as-gameboard
(tessellation) and the ancillary alignments necessary to facilitate the
"game," it is inordinately concerned with railroads and railroad
personnel to the extent that outside of lawyers and circus performers, no
other vocation has a higher percentage of Masons than railroad workers.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Minutes after John Fitzgerald Kennedy was murdered
three "hoboes" ("unworthy craftsmen") were arrested
at the railyard behind Dealey Plaza.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    No records of their identities have ever been revealed
nor the "identity" of the arresting officer. All that remains
of those few minutes are a series of photographs which have reached legendary
proportions among persons concerned with uncovering the real forces and
persons behind the assassination.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Dealey Plaza breaks down symbolically in this manner:
"Dea" means "goddess" in Latin and "Ley" can
pertain to the law or rule in the Spanish, or lines of preternatural geographic
significance in the pre-Christian nature religions of the English.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    For many years Dealey Plaza was underwater at different
seasons, having been flooded by the Trinity River until the introduction
of a flood-control system. To this trident-Neptune site came the "Queen
of Love and Beauty" and her spouse, the scapegoat in the Killing of
the King rite, the "Ceannaideach" (Gaelic word for Kennedy meaning
"ugly head" or "wounded head").
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The systematic arrangement and pattern of symbolic
things having to do with the killing of Kennedy indicates that he was a
scapegoat in a sacrifice. The purpose of such macabre ritualism is further
recognizable in patterns of symbolism culminating in the final "making
manifest all that is hidden."
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>

    <font color="#ED040D">
     Oswald
    </font>
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Oswald means "divine strength." The diminutive
form of the word is "os" or "Oz": denoting strength.
The role which "Divine Strength" played in the Dealey "Goddess
Rule" Killing of the King ritual should be given careful consideration.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    One should also note the significance of (Jack)
Ruby's killing (destroying) of "Ozwald" in reference to the "Ruby
Slippers" of The Wizard of Oz which one may deride as a fairy tale
but which nevertheless symbolizes the immense power of "ruby light,"
otherwise known as the laser.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Oswald may have undergone biotelemetry implantation
in the Soviet Union while a "volunteer" at a Behavior Control
Center at Minsk. Oswald roomed with Cubans and was allegedly friendly with
a Castro-man identified only as being "burly" and a "key
man." "Burly" can mean burlecue, burlicue or burlesque. The
"key," of course, is one of the most important symbols in Masonry
and the symbol of silence.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    If Oswald was the result of some Soviet Frankenstein
process why did he have to travel several thousand miles for such treatment
when it is a routine operation in America?
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    While such activities of the Mill-of-Dread are
pro forma at a variety of institutions at the present, there was once a
time when it was deemed necessary to do such work at Walter Reed Hospital.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    These implants were back alley operations in which
the victims were overpowered in some place or other, drugged and then dragged
to this government hospital. They were operated on, continued on a heavy
drug regimen and varied from somnolent to comatose for a number of days.
The electrical function of the victim was recorded and monitored and the
biotelemetry plant tested. Subsequently the victims were "brainwashed"
and returned to the place where they had been seized. The targets then continued
their existence, unaware of how their bodies had been invaded and their
autonomy stolen.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Occasionally, victims were returned to Walter Reed
because of abscesses at the incision or for the replacement of the obsolete
device with an updated one. Biotelemetry implants were made in various parts
of the body depending on the desired effect and function.
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    Like the disgraceful treatment of the autopsy of
President Kennedy, Oswald's is similarly weird. Oswald was literally butchered
in the "postmortem examination." Pieces were actually cut out
of his body. The major incision in his torso resembled a huge "Y"
which ran from the area of his groin to the solar plexus region. From there
incisions were made to the right and left armpits. The so-called "two
horns of the letter Y" supposedly symbolize the paths of virtue and
vice: the right branch leading to the former and the left to the latter.
The letter is sometimes referred to as the "
    <i>
     Litera Pythagorae
    </i>
    "
(
    <i>
     The Letter of Pythagoras
    </i>
    ): "
    <i>
     Litera Pythagorae, discrimine
secta bicorni, Humanae vitae speciem praeferre videtur"
    </i>
    (The Letter
of Pythagoras parted by its two branched division appears to exhibit the
image of human life).
   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    In the 47th Problem of Euclid lies a secret of
the 3rd Degree of Masonry. Pythagoras is called by Freemasons "our
ancient friend and brother." One of Pythagoras' main doctrines was
the system of "Metempsychosis" which pertains to the passing of
a human soul into the body of an animal. Perhaps this was the intention
of the autopsy-by incising in Oswald's body the "Letter of Pythagoras"
they sought to expedite transmigration, and they may even have gone as far
as feeding sections of Oswald's corpse to the intended animal, for this
too is a practice of what used to be widely feared as necromancy.

    At the Kennedy gravesite there is a stone circle
and in its middle a fire that is called an "eternal flame." The
fire in the middle of the circle represents a point in the circle, the same
type of symbolism that is recognizable in Kennedy's bier and cof fin being
in the center of the rotunda in the Capitol. A point in a circle symbolized
the sun in ancient sun worship. It was also a symbol of fecundity, with
the point symbolizing a phallus and the circle a vagina.

same twig. Such a procedure couldn't help but be more efficacious in bringing
the murderers of JFK to justice than the Warren Commission was.

    In the ancient mysteries the aspirant could not
claim a participation in the highest secrets until he had been placed in
the Pastos, bed or coffin. The placing of him in the coffin was called the
symbolical death of the mysteries, and his deliverance was termed a rising
from the dead; the "mind," says an ancient writer quoted by Stobaeus,
is afflicted in death just as it is in the initiation in the mysteries.
    <i>
     And word answers to word,
    </i>
    as well as thing to thing; for burial is
to die and death to be initiated. The coffin in Masonry is found on the

a part of the symbolism of the Third Degree, where the reference is precisely
to the same as that of the Pastos in the ancient mysteries. [My emphasis.]

    In the lore of mystery cults and fertility religions
was invariably the legend of the death of the hero god and the disappearance
of his body. In the subsequent search and supposed finding of the body we
see the contrivance of an elaborate psychological ruse. The body was said
to have been concealed by the killer or killers of the hero god. The concealment
of the body was called "aphanism" and is a rite of the Masonic
3rd Degree. Anyone interested in comprehending the mechanics of group mind
control would do well to study the 3rd and 9th degrees in particular, and
all the grades of Masonry in general. The disappearance of the body, this
aphanism, is to be found in the assassination of President Kennedy:

buried without it ... Dr. Cyril Wecht, chief medical examiner of Allegheny

Scientists, and a professor of pathology and law, received permission from
the Kennedy family in 1972 to view the autopsy materials (at the National
Archives) ... When he routinely asked to see the brain, Wecht was told it
was missing, along with the microscopic slides of the brain. Marion Johnson,
curator of the Warren Commission's material at the Archives said, "The
brain's not here. We don't know what happened to it." (

    After the Kennedy coffin was removed from the center

Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the "Occidental Restaurant" and
a picture was taken of the flag draped Kennedy coffin with the word "Occidental"

was made that "Until

    there was only one way to cash in on
Group Insurance" (my emphasis); apparently some rather profound changes

    John F. Kennedy had demonstrated affection for
the performance of a lady who was a renowned ostrich-feather fan-manipulator
(Norma Jean Baker a.k.a. Marilyn Monroe). In Egypt, lamenting girls with
ostrich feather-fans sang a song of entreaty of the type that Nephthys and
Isis reputedly sang as a dirge, before the partial resurrection and/or erection
of Osiris. The sad dirge or lamentation has become known as a "Maneros"
consisting primarily of the singers entreating the dead to return, by singing
"come to my house" and then offering inducements of some type
or other.

    It is a damn pity that the ritualists didn't have

Rosemary Clooney just couldn't believe that JFK was dead at the time, and
Marilyn Monroe was killed because of JFK. In Ancient Egypt the entreaty

performed with a hawk-fertility-goddess statue present along with other
funerary symbolism.

was said to be named
    <i>

    Before JFK began his
    <i>

the winding stairs in the White House. Tito is a significant name in Masonry
since it was the title given to Prince Harodim, the first Judge and Provost
said to be appointed by King Solomon. The Tito was a reputed favorite of
Solomon, whose temple was a hotbed of thievery, money-changing, male and
female prostitution and sorcery. This ancient Tito presided over the Lodge
of Intendants of this temple and was one of the "twelve knights of
the twelve tribes of Israel."

    The degree of the winding stair is taught in the
degree of Fellow Craft. This is the Second Degree, and a person at this
grade is of course a candidate for the symbolic assassination, euresis,
autopsy and coffin resurrection of the Third Degree.

  </p>
  <p>
   <font color="#ED040D">
    The number of steps in the winding stair are "odd"

as "those who rule over" the activities of the temple Solomon.

    The winding stairs of this temple, according to

Presence (Shekinah) and dominated by the Divine Strength (Oswald).

    President Kennedy preceded Tito down the stairs
to a portrait of the assassinated President Garfield where he was photographed,
and another picture was taken on the stairs before a picture of Lincoln
(recall the black walnut rocker of JFK, comparable to the black walnut rocker
Lincoln was assassinated in; the "Lincoln Continental" limousine
in which Kennedy was shot and the dozens of other parallels between the
two men). It's unfortunate that President Kennedy didn't trip Tito and then
slide down the stair-rail, for he was in a very vulnerable position as related
to Masonic sorcery, and such unorthodox action might have rattled the "Prince
of Harodim."

the victim and his comrades, a sign of frustrated inquiry-- the supposedly

a mirror or doppelganger of the three assassins who execute the actual murder.
