           Many things have gone through technological advances over the year, thats the great thing about technology; it changes things usually for the better. Technology can make life easier in many ways and it also affects the way we do things. Not all technological advances are based around gadgets or exciting things, often technology changes things we need or use in a mundane way, its these changes that often go unnoticed unless youre in the know.
          </p>
          <p>
           These types of techno advances often go unrecognised until you need the item or service that has changed; its often a case of things you didnt know you didnt know.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.pixuffle.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a-leaky-flat-roof.jpg">
            <img alt="a leaky flat roof" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-86" height="200" src="http://www.pixuffle.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a-leaky-flat-roof-300x200.jpg" width="300"/>
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           I came across one such technological advance that I never knew existed quite recently when I had a leaky flat roof on my garage and needed a repair. I noticed that I had a puddle of water on the floor and all my stuff was sapping wet, the obvious next step was to call out a roofing company that can do flat roof repairs but as with most tradesmen I was worried about the costs. I trawled the internet looking for a roofer who could repair the asphalt covering that was already on my flat roof, after having a couple of people round to quote for a patch putting on using a blow torch and bitumen (I was a bit concerned that using a blowtorch may set my garage alight as I had a petrol lawnmower etc. in there so wasnt keen on that idea) I eventually came across a tradesman or roofing technician (even the name has advanced) who told me about a product he uses for flat roof leaks and repairs called EPDM made by the tyre company Firestone. Obviously at this stage I had no idea what EPDM was or what you did with it and to be honest all I was interested in was, a) will it repair my flat roof and stop it leaking and b) will it be expensive. To which he assured me that it would fix the problem at a reasonable cost and without the need for a blow torch, so without further ado I booked him in to do the job.
          </p>
          <p>
           A week later the tradesman turned up and got cracking with the repair, he removed a large part of the asphalt coating that had been there years only to reveal that the boards underneath were actually rotted, my flat roof had been leaking for longer than I had realised. The roofing technician said it would be better in the long run if we replaced the boards with modern ply sheets which would be sealed with the roof rubber roofs coating as it had a 10 year guarantee (which at this stage I thought was a type of paint) so I agreed. In no time at all the sheets were replaced and the guy pulled out a roll of rubber from the back of the van, the rubber was the type you see in bicycle inner tubes, I mentioned this to him and he said yes rubber roofing is very similar to that compound, I decided to stick around and see how he installs it.
          </p>

            roofline rubber roofs
           </a>
           coating was really quite straight forward, they simply cut the rubber sheet so it fits the entire flat roof in one piece, doing one half first they added a glue or solution to the newly fitted boards then fitted the rubber sheet, using a brush to smooth it down and push any air bubbles out, once this half was done they simply repeated it on the other half of the roof and then folded the edges over and trimmed them. At this point the roof was looking very neat and I must admit I was impressed, not just by how clean and new it looked but also how easy it was to put on. In less than 2 hours I had a brand new fully water proof not leaking flat roof. The roofer said that using the old style roof coating such as asphalt and bitumen would have been a days work removing the old tar based coating.
          </p>
          <p>
           I now had a perfect flat roof repair or replacement so all that needed doing was to replace the soffits, facias, add some new gutters and the job was complete, and what a difference it made too.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           So this one mundane, but for me at least, quite brilliant technological advance that has happened without me even knowing about it. I know its just a flat roof repair but things like this make me think about what other things are out there that I didnt know that I didnt know..

           Desktop inkjet printers refer to those printers that print by placing small droplets of ink onto a piece of paper thus creating an image. There are a number of these types of printers that exist ranging from inexpensive small machines to expensive professional machines/printers. This makes them very appropriate for use at home for example the small ones as they may not manage heavy commercial work.

           As compared to large laser jet printers, inkjet printers come in suitable small sizes which makes them fit in even a small room at home or even on top of a table easily. Space in most homes is unavailable hence need to go in for options which will be accommodated with ease. This is what inkjet printers offer that you can be able to print your work from the comfort of your home.

           The print out of an image or document may not necessarily be the true reflection of the original one. Inkjet printers ensure that what you have for instance photos in your camera is exactly what you get when you print them. Inkjet printers have been made using powerful technology which ensures that proper effects are created on your image thus giving you the best quality. Secondly, because of this technology, you will get vivid and clear photos or documents at home without having to visit a studio. Not all

           Desktop inkjet printers are not highly priced as compared to other printers in the market. You do not have to invest in a lot of money for you to own such a small printer at home as it will save you the inconvenience to move from home to print for instance a single photo. The lower buying price does not mean that the overall quality of your print outs will be compromised. Thanks to the powerful technology which was incorporated in the manufacture of desktop inkjet printers.

           As compared to other types of printers such laser jet, inkjet printers do not require to heat up before printing. This is an important aspect

           . On the other hand, inkjet printers have a shorter delay period between documents sent for printing. This enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of inkjet printouts such as photos as opposed to other types of printers (laser jet).

           In the current world, its almost impossible to imagine that someone can live without computers. Computers have become an electronic device of almost every day use for individuals of every age. They are essential in almost all the business dealings that are made nowadays. The most that any industry has gained from the discovery of the computers is the business industry because of its nature. Computers have gained significance as they have improved the efficiency and productivity of work done.

Now tracing the advances in music technology and recording, it started in the early 1870s when Thomas Edison &amp; Emile Berliner created experiments in recording sound, this technology was used right up until the year 1935, where a magnetophone  magnetic tape recording was developed in Germany. Max Matthew introduced the first digital synthesis in the year 1957-58 along with the Music I and Music II at Bell Labs. During the year 1970s to 1977, music technology keeps on evolving to its most advanced form in year 1982, where the new Compact Disc system was introduced. With the fast paced advance of the music technology industry, people have used a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), rolling to the Cmix, Csound, High quality digital audio work stations for PCs or personal computers until the early years in 1990s using digital multi-track systems.

           EBay is one of the largest e-commerce websites in the world and has a given other major competitors like Amazon a run for its money. Founded in the year 1995, its growth has been phenomenal since its inception and it has now reached a stage where it is capable of handling millions of transactions in every part of the world on a daily basis. EBay is a virtual marketplace where anybody can become a member and sell their merchandise. In addition to that, you can also conduct auctions on products and sell it to the highest bidder. The ease of conducting commerce online has allowed several businesses to script their own success stories and the number just keeps growing with each progressing day.
          </p>

           <a href="http://www.pixuffle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ebay-logo.jpg" style="color: #000000; outline: #000000;">

           If you follow the guidelines set up by eBay, you will find that it is very easy to conduct your business without any problems or whatsoever. Failing to adhere to these guidelines might result in your online store getting blacklisted and you will not be allowed to sell your goods anymore through eBay. To become a successful eBay entrepreneur, you need to showcase yourself as a trustworthy person with whom consumers can do business with. The trust factor is the one which makes consumers repeatedly come back to make purchases in your store. If you are not going to behave in a trustworthy manner with your consumers, you can forget about succeeding in eBay. Likewise, there are no shortcuts to enjoy success in eBay. You need to work the hard and build your business up from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
           With consumers increasingly spending more time shopping online, the time is just right for you to start developing your business via eBay. Never compromise on the quality of the goods that you sell because consumers never like to be cheated. If you are selling a product which is worth 10, make sure that you give the consumer quality worth 10. Reveal all the details pertaining to each and every product that you sell. Consumers value and appreciate honesty. By revealing the details of your products, you are not hiding anything from the consumers and they know exactly what they are buying. Apart from that, this will also help you to avoid misunderstandings with the consumers so that in case of any issues with the product, you will not be liable for it.
          </p>
          <p>

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           It takes time for you to establish yourself as a major player in eBay and it cant be achieved overnight. Try to be patient and focus on the job at hand. As you continue to expand your business, consumers will start giving you positive feedback and this will give you greater visibility when compared to your rivals. A positive feedback will help distinguish your business from those which are not that consumer friendly. Respond to the feedback, suggestions and complaints of your consumers. Ignoring them will spoil your reputation and it takes a great deal of effort to earn it back. So dont harbour the false notion that you can get away by not responding to the pain points faced by your consumers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anyone can trade on EBay and other online platforms like this, it allows the sole trader or part time trader to compete with big corporate businesses on a level playing field. This is a great way to earn some extra cash to either subsidise your income or to make extra money for lifes little extras such as holidays etc.

           The modern technological advancement has instilled a new era of civilisation in the information technological sector. This is clearly demonstrated by the number of applications that is hosted in electronic devices. By the end of 2013, millions of applications had been developed and distributed in both the Google and the Apple stores. Both stores recorded over fifty billion download marks. The presence of applications has been felt across a swathe of sectors from the publishing sectors, to the entertainment and games industries. It has attracted big financial ventures that has propagated lucrative acquisitions and made revenues worth billions of dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although there has been a widespread positive outcome with the introduction of apps, it has also spurred hot debates on issues regarding regulation, privacy and the question of whether it is encouraging another era of dotcom- style bubble.
          </p>
          <p>
           Studies reveal a number of trends, brands, developers and start-ups popping around apps in this New Year. There are a number of brands that have been identified as some of the best apps in both mobile and computer technology.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the entertainment section, some of the best technological applications found on both Android and iPad tablets include BBC iPlayer, which shows television shows from the BBC. Similarly, users can download these shows offline; Spotify, which allows users to stream a vast catalogue of music, share playlists and get customized radio stations; Kindle, that supports various reading applications from Amazon through synchronizing users e-books over all devices; Netflix, which operates like the Spotify application but only specialises with films and television shows (Dredge, 2013).
          </p>
          <p>
           Technological applications have also been developed for the games category. Examples of this include the Minecraft  Pocket Edition, which is a crafting game appropriate for both the adult and children.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Room app is a delightful puzzle game that sees its users exploring 3D objects in a room while solving puzzles.
          </p>
          <p>
           Clash of Clans is an intensive and fulfilling technological app that prompts users to make and fortify a village while raiding other players.
          </p>
          <p>
           Real Racing 3 on the other hand, is a console quality application that gives users the ability to race their Facebook friends even in they are offline (Dredge, 2013).
          </p>
          <p>
           For the kids category, a number of applications have been developed to enhance their critical and learning skills. Toca Hair Saloon 2 for instance, turns the little children into hairdressers and allows them to make the characters hair. Endless Alphabet on the other hand, is an application that makes spelling activities fun through the aid of a band comprised of mischievous monsters. BBC CBeebies Playtime app is comprised of mini games of characters featured in television shows including Octonauts, Tree Fu Tom, etc.(Dredge, 2013).
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.pixuffle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/aa-apps.jpg">
            <img alt="aa-apps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21" height="142" src="http://www.pixuffle.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/aa-apps.jpg" width="356"/>
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           The greatest achievement in the advancement of technological application is the incorporation of social tools in the electronics gadgets. Here, some of the apps include Facebook app, which is a slick program with user friendly software allowing users to message and interact with each other; Twitter app which is similar to face book but users tweet using only 140 characters or less, flippboard, wunderlist and quip, are great tools significant for word processing (Dredge, 2013).
          </p>
          <p>
           Studies also forecast the coming of a potential apps crash. In the year 2013, Apple released its figures which were paid out to iOS developers. This cost was stipulated at approximately $8 billion (USD). Since the firm made more than a million apps, the average cost of apps was about $ 8k per app. While a considerably small number of apps are generating big revenues, a lot of apps are generating small amount of revenues; which is no problem since some of them apps are spare time projects (Reynolds, 2014).
          </p>
          <p>
           The problems is however, stipulated in the middle app market, where the crash of apps is predicted to come from. For instance, the start-ups that financed ventures but did not break even and/ or ventures that managed to find users but are struggling to generate money for them. Health tracking tools, photo sharing apps, fermium games, messaging apps and other apps that have demonstrated an overstuffed trend is predicted to curl by the end of year 2014. As the advancement continues to grow so will the numbers with research analysts predicting that most innovative apps will be centralized to few hundreds or thousands of users since, the apps shall be developed for organizational purposes (Reynolds, 2014).

           Without being too nostalgic I can clearly remember the days before mobile phones, the days when if you wanted to call someone you had to use a landline phone or even a payphone box and if you wanted to receive a call you had to hang around and wait for someone to call you. Make no mistake the mobile phone and smart phone has certainly changed many aspects of our daily lives. The days before mobile phones seemed a little less hectic, and maybe even peaceful. How many times have you been on a bus or train and made to listen to some random persons conversation? Where you are forced to endure everything from a domestic argument to some love struck idiot broadcasting his love life to all in earshot, its cringe worthy!
          </p>
          <p>
           As with all technology it has a good side that helps us through our daily lives and makes things easier and also a dark side too, with the advancement of mobile phones there are plenty of arguments for both-sides. One thing that you cant get away from is how complicated these devices are becoming. My first mobile phone was a Philips, not a great phone by any stretch of the imagination and a far cry from my I phone I use today but the good thing was its simplicity it made and received calls and thats all I ever asked or expected from it, nice and simple phone calls.

           Phones or smart devices as they are referred to these days are now a device first and a phone second which means that we use our phones/devices for many other things first and the fact that it can also make calls is a secondary bonus. If, like me, your aged between 20 and 45 years old you will no doubt remember when a mobile phone was a mobile phone for calling and if you were lucky it had a game called snake or similar, snake itself was considered a real novelty must have back then, it was also hard to lose your phone as it was so bulky and heavy that you noticed immediately if wasnt weighing your pocket down, I bet there was a few back injuries that can blamed on carrying the big brick of a phone around.

           Todays smartphones come preloaded with a simple OS or operating system like Apple or Android, this system will operate the very basics of the device, to customise your device you need to download apps or applications. What is an app? According to wiki it is:A self-contained program or piece of software designed to fulfil a particular purpose; an application, especially as downloaded by a user to a mobile device.Apparently there are these new apps that will actually read your emails to you

           Basically the smart phones of today can log onto a website and download an app for pretty much everything. You can buy apps that wake you up on a morning, count your calories from your meals, monitor your heart and health, socialising, control your central heating at home, play games, the list truly is endless. If you are using an android or droid phone you can download millions of apps to your phone and Apple have a similar system too simply called apps store.

           Having apps on your phone is not just about making your life easier or giving you more options to communicate with the rest of the world using apps like Facebook or Twitter nor is it about any other of the apps we mentioned above it is also about making money. Many of the apps carry advertisements and in app purchases which make lots of money for the app creators. Apart from all this your new shiny smart phone also comes with an inbuilt GPS locater, this could be useful if you needed to down load a sat nav app but it is also used to track your location, this information can be used by all manner of agencies as well as for sending you advertisements too. If you happen to be walking passed Mc Donalds your phone has the capability to text you and say Hey did you know that McDonalds have a deal on today and you can buy a cheeseburger for 1 Like it or hate it this is defiantly the way it is going, in fact in many cases its already on its way. Some people may find this helpful and useful but many like me find it an invasion of our privacy.. If I want a burger Ill buy one and dont need to be coaxed in by a smart arse phone.

           This advancement in technology genuinely concerns me, today its used to sell me stuff but what else are people learning about me by gleaning information from my smart phone?

           As much as I love my little Iphone I am seriously considering going back to a non-smart phone, ok I wont be able to use Facebook etc. on the move and I wont know what rate my heart is beating or what setting my central heating is on but big brother will also not be able to track my every move and use me as a cash cow by ramming text into my inbox.
