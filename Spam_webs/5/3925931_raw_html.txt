        <p style="text-align: left;">
         Its clear that from the outset my parents never intended for me to amount to anything. How could I? With a name like Ninie? Please.
        </p>
        <p>
         <br/>
         Fame and fortune do not come to people named Ninie Bovell (My maiden name.)
         <em>
          Gabriella Bovary
         </em>
         ? You could work with
         <em>
          that.
         </em>
         Even something as pedestrian as Madeline Bovell or Rebecca Bovell or (though youd lose points here for lack of originality) Elizabeth Bovell. But Ninie? I never had a chance.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         If I sound a mite hostile, bear in mind that in one decisive stroke my parents sentenced their precious newborn daughter to a lifetime of explanations that began my first day at Muleshoe Elementary School. (Yeah, Muleshoe. The hits just keep on coming.) After a painful week, I had a rap down that I still use today:
         <br/>
         <br/>
         No, its not Ninnie like skinny and penny. Its Ninierhymes with tiny and shiny. 9eget it? And no, it doesnt mean anything, it isnt short for anything, long for anything, or a substitute for anything. It just
         <em>
          is.
         </em>
         (Pause here for the inevitable Why?) You got me, pal, I couldnt tell you.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         So my question to you, my writer friends, is this: have you done something similar to the characters in your novel? Have you given serious thought to the names of the people who will live your tale
         <em>
          serious
         </em>
         thought? Or did you just glance up one day at a television commercial and now the dashing hero who rescues the beautiful countess in your French Revolution romance novel is Aflak Geico.
         <br/>

         "A rose by any name would smell as sweet" does NOT apply to naming fictional characters. Here are four mistakes you can avoid when you name yours.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         1. Names have to line up with the time, the culture and the setting of your novel. But remember to take it back a generation. If your novel is set in Atlanta during the Civil War, the characters were born in the 1840s. Probably werent a lot of Georgia mamas naming their baby girls Lindsay or Shamika or their boys Shane or Tyrone in 1840. Check the origins of the names you choose. Sure, its a safe bet you can name an Irishman Patrick OMalley. But if you pick Nguyen for an Asian characteris that a Vietnamese name? Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         2. Say the name out loud. Is it pronounceable? Loyal Reader will skip over it if he cant say it in his head when he reads. (I refer you to
         <em>
          War and Peace.
         </em>
         ) Check how the names of character combinations fit, so you dont wind up with best friends Bert and Ernie or Laverne and Shirley. Is the name an inadvertent tongue twisterSeth Sainsbury, Elizabeth Thornton, Keith Police? Dont repeat first lettersJeff, Jake, Jenny, Jessicaor ending sounds, Billy, Johnny, Becky, Shirley. Vary the number of syllables between first and last names and among characters. Change co-conspirators Caleb Wilson, Richard Jacobs and Lisa Martin to Caleb Wilkerson, Rick Jacobs and Lisa Martinelli.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <a href="http://www.niniehammon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Annex-Wayne-John-Chisum_02.jpg" rel="example_group">
          <img align="left" alt="" class="cmsImage" height="150" src="http://www.niniehammon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Annex-Wayne-John-Chisum_02-150x150.jpg" title="John Wayne" width="150"/>
         </a>
         3. Truth is, no matter what name you pick, you cant stave off every adverse reaction. Though Isaiah Dunstable may be a dignified federal judge in your political suspense novel, he may also have been the kid in Loyal Readers third grade class who threw up his hot dog every Friday. But unless youre trying to achieve a desired effecthumor or satireyoure asking for trouble if you start pilfering names from the realm of the iconic. Yes, you absolutely can name your heroine Scarlett OHara. Just understand whose face will come into Loyal Readers mind every time the character is mentioned. No amount of elegant prose on your part will be powerful enough to change that. Name your hero Ricky Ricardo if you choose, and you got some splainin to do, Lucy, will echo behind every line of dialogue. And if you decide to name the bad guy in your Western adventure novel John Waynegood luck with that.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         4. My favorite gem of character-naming advice was gleaned from experience: dont give any of them names that end in s. Or if you do, dont let them own anything because making s-characters possessive is a bear. It looks strange on the page and saying it aloud gives you a lisp. The only thing worse than ending a characters name with s is ending a characters name with two ss (s-es?). In
         <em>
          Five Days in May
         </em>
         , my main character was Princess. And when I wrote about Princesss successes, I thought I heard a Raven knocking, knocking at my chamber dooronly this and nothing more.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The bottom line in character names is simplebe
         <em>
          intentional.
         </em>
         Dont pick the first name that happens to pop into your mind. This character will carry whatever name you select through the life of your story and into the hearts and minds of your readers. If you discover a name doesnt work or is awkward in combination with another characters name, swap it for something more suitable. Why do you think God created global change?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <a href="http://www.niniehammon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/phone_book_web.jpg" rel="example_group">
          <img align="Right" alt="" class="cmsImage" src="http://www.niniehammon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/phone_book_web.jpg" title="phone_book_web"/>
         </a>
         So where do you go to find character names? Start with the phone book. From there move on to baby-naming books. Check the internet for most popular names 20 years prior to the timeframe of your novel. Look in the Bible.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         And if all else fails, put some syllables together, wallow them around in your mouth and see how they sound.You can, after all, simply make up a name. Look how well it worked out for my parents.

         I came upon this interesting piece of information purely by chance and so glad I did. It's plain common sense but common sense doesn't always make itself available when writing. It's the plot, the dialogue, the background information that is in the forefront of a writer's mind. When I first read out parts of my debut novel at my writer's circle I was advised to change the main character's names (James and Jo) I couldn't alter Jo because it was important to the storyline and as for James...well I was stubbornly determined that it was the only name that suited him. Needless to say both names remained unaltered...oh dear.
Thanks for the interesting post and good luck with your writing.

            Hope these suggestions catch writers BEFORE they name characters. Sure, global change can replace unfortunate names in an instant, but after the writer has invested in the characters emotionally, it's as hard as re-naming your kids. You think, "But Joe IS Joe. He's not Bill or Harold or Otto Smidlap." I certainly wish I'd done a little research about character naming before I shoved my canoe out into the water and started paddling. Besides the "s" parade in Five Days in May, there's a rash of names starting with J in Home Grown, and both Black Sunshine and When Butterflies Cry are "plum broke out with" two-syllable names. 
Best of luck to you!

         Thanks so much for your post! I remember reading Dan Brown's series and thinking, "Langdon? Seriously?" A Landon as a first or last name would've been fine, but "Langdon" was so awkward, I re-named him throughout the book, but I still think it was a missed opportunity.

As luck would have it, my now completed first draft features a name ending in "s" but I think it'll work. His name is "Matthias" and he's German. The name works for the time and place of the story (Germany, 1993) and luckily it doesn't seem he owns much. The protagonist in the book is "Lara" which I only recently realized can rhyme with either "Sara" and "Mara" but oh well. I will be sure to give her a multiple-syllable last name like Peterson. That suggestion was clever and spot on!

            Glad it was helpful. I wish I could say my own novels are sterling examples of proper naming. Not. I figured things out as I went along--from a review saying it was hard to keep track of all the "J" people in Home Grown to a reader commenting that the name Yesheb from The Last Safe Place was unpronouncable. (Though that name was an acrynom vital to the plot, an unpronouncable name was still a valid critique.) The problem with figuring things out as you go along is you have to screw things up to learn. 
Perhaps now that I've gathered here the tidbits my mistakes have taught me, I'll be able to apply good naming criteria to all my future novels. It's certainly been hit and miss so far, with more miss than hit. As I was writing this post, I mentally thumbed through When Butterflies Cry, the novel I just sent to the publisher, and realized almost every character had a two-syllable first names. Sigh. I'll do better next time, Ma, I promise.

            I thought it was totally unique, too, had never met anyone else with the name...until we visited Wales. After I was introduced to a group of Welsh speakers, one of them said, "You do know, don't you, what Ninie means in Welsh?" And I was thinking, "Oh, please, no--not something like puke or toe jam or spider." Then he told me that in Welsh, Ninie means "grandmother." (Actually, better translation would be "Granny.") So it occurred to me that I went from being the only Ninie to finding a whole country full of them. Holler, "Ninie!" in a Welsh village and see how many old ladies turn around.

         I agree with all of the above!  I would also say that it's important to make sure that not all of the characters' names begin with the same letter.  I had accidentally done that in a WIP, and had to change the majority of their names.  I've got a post on creating names scheduled for this week, so I feel like this was a great forethought!

            This post is a bit like my mother's mantra: Don't do as I do, do as I say. I haven't been nearly as intentional about character names as I urge other writers to be. I'm going to get serious about it from now on.

         This was a great post. Informative, with a few chuckles thrown in. I just heard Margaret Atwood comment on this subject on NPR today. Shed said that the name should sound like what you mean the character to be. So Satan would NOT be her top choice for an angelic character...LOL

         I love this! I have a love/hate relationship with naming my characters. Such wide open possibilities, and such opportunities to screw it up. I use google to find my names. I search for something like "most popular girl names in Alabama in 1923." Believe it or not, the internet has lists that are that specific. 

And don't sweat your name! It's unique. No one can forget Ninie. :)

            I have a hate/hate relationship with naming my characters. I had jotted down all these character-naming tips in different places in my writing notebook and when I pulled them all together for this post I wanted to open a wrist. I don't do this stuff; why should I expect anybody else to? Still, as Scarlet O'Hara noted, tomorrow is another day. I'll do better. Really. No, really.
My name is, indeed, unique. You can say that much for it. If I had a nickle for every lame attempt at 9e-humor, I wouldn't have to worry about marketing my books-

         One of my passionate HATES! Names are so bloody important! It takes me forever to come up with something I like and 'works' for me. I want the name to mean something to the story, sound good, work with all the other characters and be 'right' for the character. My female lead right now is named 'Kassandra' and is often called 'Kass' so yeah....getting the 's' hassle going big time. Thanks for the post!

            I'm with you. Don't much like picking. I just call them The Little Kid, Famous Guy, The Doctor until I settle on something. (Gotta LOVE global change.) Even them, I change them, sometimes, later on. Current favorites are brothers Carter and Grayson--the names of two Kentucky counties! Would like to name a girl Bailey DuChene just because I like the sounds.

         Great article! I use a lot of name generators online to help come up with names. I also use our company's inhouse magazine. They list name of fellow employees for number of years service with the company. As suggested, I try to look at popular names during whatever era I'm writing in. Right now I'm doing stories in the 70s which is when I was in elementary school. So, most likely former school friends will be used.

            Hadn't thought of using the names of former classmates. Wrote one novel set in timeframe when I was 16 and used all the songs, TV shows, etc. I remember. (Plus Googled them, of course.) Never used a name generator, either. Maybe I should try it. Thanks for the tip.

         For me, names must come late in the character profile development process or I tend to lean cynical and stereotypical.  That's a fault in myself I suppose.  But once I've fleshed out the character some I can try to come up with appropriate names.  Thanks for all the great tips, they will help.

            Usually I have the main characters' names before I start to write, though I often change them to something that later seems more appropriate. But other characters--the boss, the old Army buddy he runs into, the little girl in the park--I call them the first name that comes to mind so I don't stop the flow to think up a name. I fix those on later drafts. 
Glad the tips are helpful.

         This is the point I struggle with most, naming characters. I don't know why but every time I do I feel like they sound silly or clichd. This post was very helpful to say the least! Although I think it's a lack of self confidence that makes my character names sound wierd in my head, I bet no-one else even bats an eyelid! Writing the novel in working in at the moment, as well as my flash fic/short story page (http://sketchbookfiction.blogspot.com.au) means I'm constantly needing to create characters, and therefore, names. And I thought naming two daughters was hard enough!

            I think naming children is DEFINITELY harder than naming characters--no such thing as global change. Just yesterday I got around to naming the gang of six kids who terrorized the main characters of my WIP when they were children and later as adults. I'm so proud of myself--I actually followed my own advice!! (Seldom dosigh.) I varied the numbers of syllables first and last names, no Mutt and Jeff (there's a Jeff, but no Mutt), none end in s. And the naming process took me two hours!!! Truth is, nothing about writing a novel is easy. If it were easy, everybody would do it. No, waiteverybody IS doing it. Let's amend and say "everybody would do it WELL."

         # 1 is my problem, I think, with the novel I'm writing now. I have to name the characters that way, and I cannot change them. I must not. Even if the names sound a little foreign to the setting (a post-apocalyptic nation "on the eastern side of the earth"). Aiming that the "post-apocalyptic aspect" can do it some justice, though (I mean the background history, explaining why such foreign races are there). Hope I can do it.

Thanks for a very helpful article.

            I think you are doing just fine with #1. Sounds like the names do conform to the timeframe and culture you're writing about--your INTERNAL timeframe and culture. Since you're inventing it, you get to decide what names are appropriate. And readers will sail right along with you, happy to accept whatever world you give them--if you are CONSISTENT and abide by the rules, spoken or implied, of your universe. If readers need a little backstory to understand, that's fine. Creates curiosity and curiosity keeps those pages turning.

         Or, if you write fantasy, you can use a
         <a href="http://www.rinkworks.com/namegen/" rel="nofollow">
          fantasy names generator
         </a>
         :D Joking aside, if all else fails you, it can at least give you something to work with.

I know you're not a fantasy writer so you probably haven't seen it often, but fantasy writers are notorious for riddling the names with hyphens, the harder to pronounce the better. No one can choose a more tongue twisting, harder to figure out how to pronounce names like fantasy writers. Except sci-fi writers when they name characters that are members of alien species. Cause nothing says alien like Mrh'Tung'grhk'Ong.

         There's gotta be a part wherein you choose a different first letter of the alphabet for all of your main characters, simply because it's a good idea....

         Right now I'm editing a novel with a main character named Shay. I'm having to be very careful about using other words starting in sh or even just S beside his name, or it all gets very 'She sells sea shells on the sea shore.' One thing I've decided is he'll mostly wear boots,  not shoes. ;)

            Didn't think about the difficulty of "s" as a first letter. StillShay's shoes is easier to say than "Princess's successes." I cannot believe I wrote that!

Definitely ! At some point, it's unavoidable ;)

There's also a tool which may be helpful in Scrivener (in the Edit Menu/Writing tools): its name generator. Lots of options (however lacking of french names :( ). Not a silver bullet but it may be a good start.
I also lately tried a poll through readers and community... Awkward results :)

            I just started using Scrivener. I'll have to check out the name generator. Didn't know it was there. I did the "readers" poll gig. One of them, a former journalist friend, suggested I name the characters in my next book after the counties in Kentucky. I blew him off, then thought better of it... The two main characters in When Butterflies Cry are CARTER and GRAYSON Addington. Check out a Kentucky map and you'll see where the first names came from.

         Choosing names is undermining. Or rather having difficulty choosing them can be. Heck. If I can't even dream up a correct name for a character, good grief, what on Earth makes me think I can even dream of some day getting called a writer? Example: I'd wanted a pen name for myself ever since I was a teenager. Godfrey Geldart was my early favourite. Then I thought that sounds Jewish, which I'm not. Finally, finally, I decided on one ..ha ha .aged 72!!! "Godffrey Greatorex." Nobody but me seems to like it.... :(   I'm pleased, though, reading through these comments here that I may be alone in feeling undermined by mere name creation, let's face it, a bog-standard routine blooming task for Pete's sake ...

            You're joking. Your real name is Nigel Hanson and you want a pen name!!!! That's like Harper Lee deciding to write To Kill a Mockingbird as Susie Mae Snodmotz. You've got a great real name. If I had one half as cool, I'd use it!

         Very good points. I would like to emphasize the importance of selecting a name that works in the setting of the story, and also add that writers need to broaden their pool of choices, especially when setting their works today in a large city. Don't forget about names from cultures other than your own! Cities in North America and Europe today are very cosmopolitan, so choosing ethnically English or Irish names is limiting. A doctor could easily have a Vietnamese, Polish, Arabic or African name. For that matter, it's not inconceivable that a character in a French Revolution romance could have a name that sounds Italian, German or Spanish, as people have been known to move around throughout history.

            You are so right! Ethnicity adds authenticity. (Was that inadvertent alliteration?) None of my books is set in a city with much diversity. But the authentic rendering of names that reflect the heritage of the original settlers in rural areas makes it that much more real. The hills of Eastern Kentucky were settled by the Welsh, Scots and Irish--coal miners who came to ply their trade in the new world. Still lots of McIntyres and McDoogles and Fraziers in the phone books there.

         Great article. I wish I'd read it before I'd written my first novelette. I was so busy struggling not to give my villains the name of anyone I know, or their kids, that I may have floundered elsewhere. I managed to get a Matt and a Mike. And I have a Graham, whose name I wanted to shorten to Gray, which was fine until I had his wife say, "Gray? You've gone a very funny colour!" Doh! *slaps head* I didn't dare risk changing the name again. I'd already done so once after ending up with a ridiculous combination which has since, mercifully, been wiped forever from my brain.

            You wish you'd read the post before your first work; I wish I'd WRITTEN it before mine. It's disturbing to write about the best way to do some part of the writing craftand then look back to see that I didn't do anything like it in my own work. My book, Home Grown, is positively broken out in J-names. Jennifer and Jake Jamison and their friends Joe and Jason. Yup. Did that. What was I thinking!! In When Butterflies Cry, I have a character named Grayson who is called Gray, but it works because the little Vietnamese girl calls him Grape and that's endearing. 
Did MUCH better in the name game for my WIP. Followed all the rules--I think--and like the result.

         I started writing my book by first creating a short biography of the main characters. I ended up with a Joseph, David and Sarel (all reasonably popular name in South Africa - and yes, I now notice they're all two-syllable). I "finished" the book about three weeks ago. I'm putting the final touches on it, hoping to have it on a publisher's desk in a few weeks (luckily I have a contact there).

In the editing process, I found a flaw in the whole naming thing: In my office, within spitting distance (I wouldn't spit, but Americans don't understand meters, and I don't do feet) from my desk sits... a Joseph, David and a Sarel. In my defense, I chose those names long before I even applied for this job. Joseph and David will have to go. I'm going through the harrowing process now of finding new names for my "kids", but they'll just have to live it down. Sarel will have to stay, as he's named after a certain historical character, which is sort of part of the plot. Luckily, the other characters refer to him either as Sakkie (don't ask - same as William becomes Bill, etc.) or his nickname - White Lion. Plus, he's a "second level" character.

Even Sakkie will have to go for the English translation though. I just can't hear any English person pronouncing it correctly.

Thanks for the great tips. Many of them have helped me so far. Especially the one about not leaving gaps (what happened to the little doggy... ). I'm now extremely meticulous not to leave any gaps, as that happens to be my pet peeve with the when reading the works of others.

            Thanks for the thoughtful comment.
This is fact: in 1989, US Federal Authorities busted what they called the Cornbread Mafia, the largest domestic marijuana-growing operation in American history. They confiscated 187 tons of dope with a street value--in 1989! of $400 million--and arrested 56 men in five states. But all the men came from one small Kentucky county--and I ran the newspaper there at the time. I covered all the events of what locals called "the marijuana years" and decades later when I decided to write a book inspired by what happened, I made it FICTION because I wanted to make up a story around the real events. (There is a non-fiction book called The Cornbread Mafia, written by the son of the man who ran the grocery store down the street from my newspaper office.)
So I had to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL with names. If I dared to name a character in that book the name of an actual person living in that county, I'd have been standing in a large pile of the warm, sticky substance you find on the south side of a horse going north! Maybe even legal trouble, defamation-of-character trouble, because I was writing about criminals and if I gave one of them the same name as the minister of the First Baptist Church ... 
I checked and re-checked, then sent the manuscript to friends of mine who still lived there to be certain I hadn't inadvertently used the name of somebody who'd moved to the community after I left. My friend found one minor character whose name was the same as the post master's and I changed it, then heaved a sigh of relief. Now, the book's been out for several years and thousands of people in that county have read it. Haven't heard a peep of protest. 
Even sothe names in Home Grown wouldn't pass muster with this blog post. Too many start with the letter J; too many with the same number of syllables. I am sure I don't have to tell YOU---naming characters is hard!

         In my first two novels (and the in-progress third one), I used the actual first names of people I know or have met, with their verbal permission.  Avoiding last names (with an appropriate disclaimer early in the first book) made it easy.   But I had one character I named Debbie Jackson, and whenever I meet a Deb, Debbie or Deborah/Debra, I apologize to her in advance for how that character is treated in the book (kind of a slut); same for a Ron or a Steven Bruce; (Luckily, the actual Ron refuses to speak to me anymore, which is a great relief; he also refuses to read the books, to the delight of the other regular beachgoers who know him and have read them.  He's not well liked and has certain character defects, like arrogance and a thin skin.) And a married couple, John and Kelly, became John Kelly, the new Treasury Secretary; they like that. 

For local businesses (in Bonita Springs, Florida), I got written permission to use two names (Fishbuster Charters and Master Bait &amp; Tackle; yup, really), but for the rest, I just changed the names (e.g., Sneaky Pete's became Slinky Joe's, Doc's became Pop's).  I checked trademark laws and got around those that way.  (BTW, the owners of the actual Sneaky Pete's read the first book and loved it and their role in it, and now stock both books in their restaurant/bar and invited me to do a couple of book signings there.)

And I recently met a woman named Shantal Deserai (first and middle), and I have GOT to find a role for that name in the third book.  Maybe I'll make her an assassin ... or possibly a bodyguard ... or maybe split her into two women and make them antagonists in those roles.  She's about 55 and jokingly asked if I'd make her a hooker (in the book).  I get lots of similar requests from that younger-then-me generation; hmm.

In any event, both local residents and our snowbirds and tourists are getting a kick out of figuring out the actual names of the businesses in the books.  (And when he's on the beach, I might point the actual Ron out to folks who've bought the book(s) and bring it/them to me to sign; hee-hee.)

         You've hit on something that is a real sticking point with me. As a historical romance writer, I choose names that are historically and geographically appropriate. I'm finding that with romances today, innovative and unconventional names are finding their way into Regency, Highland and Victorian times. I find that very disruptive because every time I read the name, I'm wrenched from the story. You are absolutely right - names are important!

            Amen! Preach it, sister!
Names that don't fit are evidence of sloppy writing and research. And the problem with a name that's wrong is that it's not just wrong once. Every time the name is used, the reader bumps her head on it. I have so very little time to read that I'm massively picky about such things. One inappropriate name and I chuck the book and start on something else. It's the iceberg theory--you only see 10 percent. If the name is wrong, I'm not willing to hang around to find out the other 90 percent that's also poorly done.

         I really liked this read. Pointed out a few things to keep a watchful eye on for me. I think I may be one of the few to respond that loves naming my characters - at least the main ones, secondary characters sometimes need more work. After reading the responses here, I guess I should be thankful this isn't a thorn in my side (Transitions?? That's a whole other can of worms!). My main character for Going for Gold is Julia Summers from Vancouver Canada - so there's the 's' issue. I will see if it strikes problems when I finish editing the draft. She is along side Liam MacInnaly of Stirling Scotland - current time period. I have a secondary character that has the same letter for first and last name. Is this the be all and end all? I like the sound of her name: Rosalind Ramirez. I know she's secondary character for now, but won't be in the next book...
Thanks again for sharing this post!

         Just a brief call out to Google your character name and location. Search engines are very powerful. You might be surprised...

         Love this article! I always have trouble with my secondary characters. My first book was a romance with a historic/paranormal subplot. My guy was a cursed Confederate soldier so I had to make sure his name was historically correct but could still work for today. I looked up the US Census to make sure that his name would work. I also checked out Confederate soldiers' names for the Battle of Gettysburg since it is a focal point of the story. One of my secondary characters was the same way. Her name is Kathryn with the old spelling. Also I do name characters after my friends. They don't mind and love seeing their name in my books.

            When Butterflies Cry, my novel that will be released this fall, has two characters named after counties in Kentucky. Whatever works!

         If your story has a lot of named characters, use a combination of ordinary and less common names. In my opinion, this makes your story more believeable. Also, don't try to be "cute" with names. One time, I was working on a story about a 40-year-old man convicted of murder in Florida. The name I had given the character was Gerald MacPherson, which is not overly common but not too unusual or wierd. One of my friends suggested I call him "Jeffrey Bundy (combination of Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy).

I learned the S one the hard way, when James Ligatos employed Tanis Sparks. My first novel was a bit of a trial by fire.

         This was laugh out loud funny and also great advice. Once my characters are "named," they really come alive in my imagination. It's hard to make changes once this happens, so I consider carefully before committing.

            Yup. Changing a name is like re-naming a child. I once had a character who had two dogs--Mutt and PD (Puppy Dog) that were vital to the plot. Was in FINAL edit before I caught the "Mutt and Jeff" issue. I renamed the dog.

         I use a spreadsheet with a list of first and last names and keep track of names used in my various writing projects. On another spreadsheet I keep track of names beginning with the letters of the alphabet so I don't have John, Joe, Josh, James, etc . . . the same with last names. Often a name will convey different feelings - one character in my current mystery novel was originally named Aaron Crawford, but I changed to Aaron Randall, because "Randall" (at least to me) sounds more powerful. Names and words for that matter beginning with hard sounds (like 'K') speak more "loudly" on the page.

         I like the fact that writing a sci-fi adventure allows for plenty of creativity when it comes to naming my characters. No Tims or Kims allowed. The closest I have to normal names are Rey and Syd, and those are the characters' nicknames. That said, I still struggle a bit with some of these issues, particularly the varying syllable count and names ending in 's'. With a large cast, there's only so many letters to go around. What I do try to do though is make the names species/world-specific. Some are genteel and lofty-sounding, while others are short and primitive. I want the reader to be able to discern by a character's name what their heritage and ethnicity is. Whether they end in an 's', or tend to end in similar vowels such as 'a' or 'r', I try not to worry about for now and will wait for my beta-readers to complain if they find it off-putting.

            I think when you write sci-fi, all bets are off in terms of naming characters. As a reader, I do want to be able to sound out the name--however odd it might be--so I can say it in my head when I read. Might want to keep that in mind.

         Love this post.  I will definitely stay away from names ending in "s" for the mere reason of having to make it possessive. Also, I once read a book with three female characters with names starting with "L" and I proceeded to get them mixed up I my mind. Frustrating, and I don't want readers to feel that way.

         I think your name is just fine.

         I tend to overthink when it comes to names, and then I wind up looking to the Social Security baby name database (broken down by decade). My beef is with writers who create names so of out of the ordinary they have to take a break during the story to explain it (movie-wise, check out 'Pizza,' 'Feeling Minnesota,' and 'Juno'), creating a huge distraction.

         I am dealing with this exact thing right now. My MCs were brought up in new age circles and they tend to have different sounding names. I am trying to decide weather to just go with Irish/English sounding names and let it be at that or go with what I really want which is uncommon and may be hard for the reader to pronounce. I really appreciate the tip about not ending in S though, I never thought of that.

            I won't advise one way or the other. (Don't want to get in the middle of a mother naming her children." The important thing for you, I think, is to be sure you make the name something the reader can say in his head. If it's an odd word, try rhyming it with something. I have said the following at least ten thousand times when being introduced to people," Hi, my name's Ninie. Rhymes with tiny and shiney." If I don't do that, people are embarrassed because they can't remember how to pronounce my name.

         I like the advice about checking the popularity of a characters name at the time of their birth - not when the book is set, something that many people may forget to do.
         <br/>
         Personally, I have a 'thing' about the number of syllables in names. If there's 1 in the first name then there has to be more in the surname and vice versa. I bit odd agreed, but that's how I make them sound right in my head!
         <br/>
         I was going to give my main character the surname 'Last' but then realised that caused problems. 'William Last walked into the house' has two different meanings when read, so that is also something to watch out for.
         <br/>
         Great blog Ninie.

            Thanks, Mark. I started using Scrivener in September, 2013 when I started writing my first series, figured I needed something a little more complex than 2008 version of Microsoft Word. Eighteen months later and YESTERDAY I discovered that Scrivener has a name generator. You click on it and it gives you 25-50-75 random names. Don't like those? It'll give you another batch. I haven't actually used any of the names yet--they seem a bit bland to me--but something like this will be glorious the next-door-neighbor and the doctor and the baker--folks who show up and vanish. I'm having fun with it.

         I loved this article/blog/whatever!  I for one love the naming of characters, such so that I don't get farther than figuring out what the characters names are going to be.  Favorite part of writing, for sure!  That said, I do remember reading Harry Potter, and not having a clue how to pronounce Hermione's name until book 4 when she's trying to teach Victor Krum how to say it! Oh if only Rowling had done that in book one!!!

            I had the same problem with Galadriel in Lord of the Rings. Was it GAL-adriel or Ga-LAD-riel. In my head, I always said GAL-adriel; the movie pronounces it Ga-LAD-riel. Tolkein never said, so I figure my way is just as valid a pronunciation as the movie folks came up with.

         9e, my last name is Toohey, the H is silent, so I can say I totally get your spiel. Some days I think if I hear one more joke about Too Hey, I may just scream. My family has taken to spelling it 2e, much like your own name.

         Great advice on naming characters by the way! Own that unique name, no one else has a signature quite so awesome as yours!

            Hey9e and 2e make 11e. Lame humor. Way tired of it, too. But you have to admit our names are memorable. That's why I decided to just own 9e and run with it, use it as a logo on my website, book jackets, business cards. When you have to eat a frog in life, might as well add a little salt and swallow hard.

           I have soooo many stories I want to tell you, so many worlds I want you to see, so many people I want you to meet. People in trouble, most of them. Big trouble they didn't ask for but there it is. Ordinary folks like you and me who are forced by circumstances to fight for their lives. And then, smack in the middle of their everyday worlds they encounter the unexplainable. It's always the game-changer.

           and you'll see. My life isn't really an open book; it's more of a pamphlet, and you are cordially invited to read it. I'd love to interact with you in all those virtual realms;
