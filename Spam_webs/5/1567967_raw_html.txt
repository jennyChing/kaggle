       One of the basic situationist practices is the
       <i>
        drive
       </i>
       [literally:drifting], a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances. Drivesinvolve playful-constructive behavior and awareness of psychogeographical effects, and arethus quite different from the classic notions of journey or stroll.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a drive one or more persons during a certain period drop their relations, theirwork and leisure activities, and all their other usual motives for movement and action,and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they findthere. Chance is a less important factor in this activity than one might think: from adrive point of view cities have psychogeographical contours, with constant currents,fixed points and vortexes that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the drive includes both this letting-go and its necessary contradiction: thedomination of psychogeographical variations by the knowledge and calculation of theirpossibilities. In this latter regard, ecological science  despite the narrow socialspace to which it limits itself  provides psychogeography with abundant data.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ecological analysis of the absolute or relative character of fissures in the urbannetwork, of the role of microclimates, of distinct neighborhoods with no relation toadministrative boundaries, and above all of the dominating action of centers ofattraction, must be utilized and completed by psychogeographical methods. The objectivepassional terrain of the drive must be defined in accordance both with its own logic andwith its relations with social morphology.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his study
       <i>
        Paris et lagglomration parisienne
       </i>
       (Bibliothque deSociologie Contemporaine, P.U.F., 1952) Chombart de Lauwe notes that an urbanneighborhood is determined not only by geographical and economic factors, but also by theimage that its inhabitants and those of other neighborhoods have of it. In the samework, in order to illustrate the narrowness of the real Paris in which eachindividual lives ... within a geographical area whose radius is extremelysmall, he diagrams all the movements made in the space of one year by a studentliving in the 16th Arrondissement. Her itinerary forms a small triangle with nosignificant deviations, the three apexes of which are the School of Political Sciences,her residence and that of her piano teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such data  examples of a modern poetry capable of provoking sharp emotionalreactions (in this particular case, outrage at the fact that anyones life can be sopathetically limited)  or even Burgesss theory of Chicagos socialactivities as being distributed in distinct concentric zones, will undoubtedly proveuseful in developing drives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If chance plays an important role in drives this is because the methodology ofpsychogeographical observation is still in its infancy. But the action of chance isnaturally conservative and in a new setting tends to reduce everything to habit or to analternation between a limited number of variants. Progress means breaking through fieldswhere chance holds sway by creating new conditions more favorable to our purposes. We cansay, then, that the randomness of a drive is fundamentally different from that of thestroll, but also that the first psychogeographical attractions discovered by drivers maytend to fixate them around new habitual axes, to which they will constantly be drawn back.
      </p>
      <p>
       An insufficient awareness of the limitations of chance, and of its inevitablyreactionary effects, condemned to a dismal failure the famous aimless wandering attemptedin 1923 by four surrealists, beginning from a town chosen by lot: Wandering in opencountry is naturally depressing, and the interventions of chance are poorer there thananywhere else. But this mindlessness is pushed much further by a certain Pierre Vendryes(in
       <i>
        Mdium,
       </i>
       May 1954), who thinks he can relate this anecdote to variousprobability experiments, on the ground that they all supposedly involve the same sort ofantideterminist liberation. He gives as an example the random distribution of tadpoles ina circular aquarium, adding, significantly, It is necessary, of course, that such apopulation be subject to no external guiding influence. From that perspective, thetadpoles could be considered more spontaneously liberated than the surrealists, since theyhave the advantage of being as stripped as possible of intelligence, sociability andsexuality, and are thus truly independent from one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the opposite pole from such imbecilities, the primarily urban character of thedrive, in its element in the great industrially transformed cities  those centersof possibilities and meanings  could be expressed in Marxs phrase: Mencan see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them ofthemselves. Their very landscape is alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can drive alone, but all indications are that the most fruitful numericalarrangement consists of several small groups of two or three people who have reached thesame level of awareness, since cross-checking these different groups impressionsmakes it possible to arrive at more objective conclusions. It is preferable for thecomposition of these groups to change from one drive to another. With more than four orfive participants, the specifically drive character rapidly diminishes, and in any caseit is impossible for there to be more than ten or twelve people without the drivefragmenting into several simultaneous drives. The practice of such subdivision is infact of great interest, but the difficulties it entails have so far prevented it frombeing organized on a sufficient scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average duration of a drive is one day, considered as the time between twoperiods of sleep. The starting and ending times have no necessary relation to the solarday, but it should be noted that the last hours of the night are generally unsuitable fordrives.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this duration is merely a statistical average. For one thing, a drive rarelyoccurs in its pure form: it is difficult for the participants to avoid setting aside anhour or two at the beginning or end of the day for taking care of banal tasks; and towardthe end of the day fatigue tends to encourage such an abandonment. But more importantly, adrive often takes place within a deliberately limited period of a few hours, or evenfortuitously during fairly brief moments; or it may last for several days withoutinterruption. In spite of the cessations imposed by the need for sleep, certain drivesof a sufficient intensity have been sustained for three or four days, or even longer. Itis true that in the case of a series of drives over a rather long period of time it isalmost impossible to determine precisely when the state of mind peculiar to one drivegives way to that of another. One sequence of drives was pursued without notableinterruption for around two months. Such an experience gives rise to new objectiveconditions of behavior that bring about the disappearance of a good number of the oldones.

      </p>
      <p>
       The influence of weather on drives, although real, is a significant factor only inthe case of prolonged rains, which make them virtually impossible. But storms or othertypes of precipitation are rather favorable for drives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The spatial field of a drive may be precisely delimited or vague, depending onwhether the goal is to study a terrain or to emotionally disorient oneself. It should notbe forgotten that these two aspects of drives overlap in so many ways that it isimpossible to isolate one of them in a pure state. But the use of taxis, for example, canprovide a clear enough dividing line: If in the course of a drive one takes a taxi,either to get to a specific destination or simply to move, say, twenty minutes to thewest, one is concerned primarily with a personal trip outside ones usualsurroundings. If, on the other hand, one sticks to the direct exploration of a particularterrain, one is concentrating primarily on research for a psychogeographical urbanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every case the spatial field depends first of all on the point of departure the residence of the solo driver or the meeting place selected by a group. The maximumarea of this spatial field does not extend beyond the entirety of a large city and itssuburbs. At its minimum it can be limited to a small self-contained ambiance: a singleneighborhood or even a single block of houses if its interesting enough (the extremecase being a static-drive of an entire day within the Saint-Lazare train station).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exploration of a fixed spatial field entails establishing bases and calculatingdirections of penetration. It is here that the study of maps comes in  ordinary onesas well as ecological and psychogeographical ones  along with their correction andimprovement. It should go without saying that we are not at all interested in any mereexoticism that may arise from the fact that one is exploring a neighborhood for the firsttime. Besides its unimportance, this aspect of the problem is completely subjective andsoon fades away.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the possible rendezvous, on the other hand, the element of explorationis minimal in comparison with that of behavioral disorientation. The subject is invited tocome alone to a certain place at a specified time. He is freed from the bothersomeobligations of the ordinary rendezvous since there is no one to wait for. But since thispossible rendezvous has brought him without warning to a place he may or maynot know, he observes the surroundings. It may be that the same spot has been specifiedfor a possible rendezvous for someone else whose identity he has no way ofknowing. Since he may never even have seen the other person before, he will be encouragedto start up conversations with various passersby. He may meet no one, or he may even bychance meet the person who has arranged the possible rendezvous. In any case,particularly if the time and place have been well chosen, his use of time will take anunexpected turn. He may even telephone someone else who doesnt know where the firstpossible rendezvous has taken him, in order to ask for another one to bespecified. One can see the virtually unlimited resources of this pastime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our loose lifestyle and even certain amusements considered dubious that have alwaysbeen enjoyed among our entourage  slipping by night into houses undergoingdemolition, hitchhiking nonstop and without destination through Paris during atransportation strike in the name of adding to the confusion, wandering in subterraneancatacombs forbidden to the public, etc.  are expressions of a more generalsensibility which is no different from that of the drive. Written descriptions can be no more than passwords to this great game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lessons drawn from drives enable us to draw up the first surveys of thepsychogeographical articulations of a modern city. Beyond the discovery of unities ofambiance, of their main components and their spatial localization, one comes to perceivetheir principal axes of passage, their exits and their defenses. One arrives at thecentral hypothesis of the existence of psychogeographical pivotal points. One measures thedistances that actually separate two regions of a city, distances that may have littlerelation with the physical distance between them. With the aid of old maps, aerialphotographs and experimental drives, one can draw up hitherto lacking maps ofinfluences, maps whose inevitable imprecision at this early stage is no worse than that ofthe first navigational charts. The only difference is that it is no longer a matter ofprecisely delineating stable continents, but of changing architecture and urbanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today the different unities of atmosphere and of dwellings are not precisely marked off, but are surrounded by more or less extended and indistinct bordering regions. The most general change that drive experience leads to proposing is the constant diminution of these border regions, up to the point of their complete suppression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within architecture itself, the taste for driving tends to promote all sorts of new forms of labyrinths made possible by modern techniques of construction. Thus in March 1955 the press reported the construction in New York of a building in which one can see the first signs of an opportunity to drive inside an apartment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The apartments of the helicoidal building will be shaped like slices of cake. One will be able to enlarge or reduce them by shifting movable partitions. The half-floor gradations avoid limiting the number of rooms, since the tenant can request the use of the adjacent section on either upper or lower levels. With this setup three four-room apartments can be transformed into one twelve-room apartment in less than six hours.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
