     BUILDING A HYDROPONIC TRAY

     The tray is nothing more than a wooden trough lined with plastic, filled with a medium( cypress mulch in this case) with nutrient fed into one end and drained out the other.

     Follow the steps on building a drip system until the plastic is placed in the trough.(fourth photo)

     <br/>
     Cut a piece of fiberglass screen about 12 inches long and wide enough to form fit with the top stapled to the trough top. Place on the  on the outlet end with the end folded back to prevent the medium from washing out.  Staple only on the top to prevent a leak in the plastic.

         Remove the top 1 inch layer of mulch and place a piece of paper toweling the entire length of the tray. Place the end of the toweling under the mulch to insure the nutrient will touch it so it will act as a wick.   The sides of the toweling can be pushed down to the bottom also.
Lay the seeds on the toweling at the proper interval and cover with the 1 inch of mulch.  After a few minutes, the toweling should be wet. The toweling will keep the seed wet and help keep it in place until germination when the roots will penitrate it.  I am using water with no nutrients to germinate the seed.

         Bibb and Romaine lettuce plus Basil were planted.

           NOTE:
          </center>
          Original parameters: Nutrient volune 2 quarts/minute, slope 2 inch drop in 6 feet.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This arrangement allowed too much nutrient to be retained causing plant damage.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Changed to 1 quart/minute with 5 inch drop in 6 feet.  Plant damage stopped and everything back to growing normal.
