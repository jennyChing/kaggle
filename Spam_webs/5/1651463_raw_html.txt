                 <p>
                  Theres a scene in Disneys The Lion King that captures the majesty of Africa with all the reverence and hyperbole weve come to associate with life on this wild continent. Illuminated in the dusty light of sunrise, herds shuffle, predators stand regal and everything from beast to bird revels in our immaculate perception of another perfect day in Africa  and then Pumbaa the warthog lets out a ripper that could melt the bark off a mopani tree.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For all the awe-inspired gazing and gushing that takes place this side of your binoculars, theres a rather indecorous and oft-gross side to some animals, and a farting warthog doesnt even begin to hold a (precariously positioned) candle to some of them.
                 </p>
                 <h2>
                  THE JACKAL
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  <img border="0" height="386" src="/sites/default/files/2013-1/Disgusting%201%20Africas-most-disgusting-jackal_1.jpg" style="color: #656565; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;" width="578"/>

                  These sub-Saharan scavengers will gladly munch on decomposing or diseased flesh, even if its been rotting for days. But old meat isnt the only thing on the jackals menu: aside from carrion, they eat bones, small mammals, berries, grass, insects and even reptiles. On the west coast of Namibia, jackals have been known to survive entirely on marine life, occasionally even chowing down on sea birds. Their stomachs adapt to the predominant food supply available in a survival tactic that allows jackals to exist as predators (on small game), scavengers or even purely on insects and rodents. Perhaps unbelievingly, theres a plus side to their foul-flesh fetish: by eating rotting leftovers, jackals actually contribute towards the control of disease.The jackal might just be the ultimate Fear Factor teammate. Regardless of whatever vile concoction nature conjures up, whack it on a plate and start counting the prize money because theres nothing these opportunistic omnivores wont gobble down. And much like a hungover, blurry-eyed varsity student in front of the fridge, they also have a knack for completely ignoring the sell-by date.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Is that shrivelled piece of boerie in your refrigerator from last weeks braai suddenly looking tasty again?

                 <h2>
                  THE DUNG BEETLE
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  <img border="0" src="/sites/default/files/2013-1/Disgusting%202%20Africas-most-disgusting-dung-beetle_0.jpg"/>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Not only do they roll animal faeces, they also lay their eggs in it and hang around to watch as their young hatch and immediately go about feasting on the poo pie. In fact, these beetles are so passionate about dung that some, known as tunnellers, hide their smelly stash in the ground as if it were treasure. Others, called rollers, have been known to steal balls of poo from one another by shoving their heads under another beetle and flipping it into the air.The dung beetle is an obvious choice. These master poo rollers spend their days diligently cleaning up after the rest of the animal kingdom, all without a glimmer of career progression. Even after years of taking k*k from the big man (a.k.a. elephant) you wont suddenly find this beetle rolling a disco ball down Krugers H1 flaunting its well-toned calf muscles.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Still, dung beetles dont just do all this for the fun of it; their intricate antics play an important part in the environment  by burying dung they improve nutrient recycling and build soil structure and through eating it theyre effectively protecting larger mammals by removing dung that could provide a habitat for pests.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It might be a dead-end job in a malodorous workplace, but with an eye on the big picture the dung beetle has certainly earned its right to dabble in the disgusting.

                 <h2>
                  THE FULMAR
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  <img border="0" height="385" src="/sites/default/files/2013-1/Disgusting%203%20Africas-most-disgusting-fulmar_0.jpg" width="578"/>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Youd think that living on a moated fortress inaccessible to most land predators would make the fulmar carefree and quite laid-back. It doesnt  especially not for the chicks.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The young birds are left alone in their breeding colonies off the southern coast of South Africa for hours while their parents take long, fanciful fishing trips far offshore. And much like Home Alones Macaulay Culkin with unsupervised time on his hands, fulmar chicks have devised an extraordinarily messy way to deal with unwanted visitors. They brew up a vile stew of fish oils, made up of indigestible fatty acids and triglycerides in their stomach, and then vomit it over anyone who comes too close to their nest. Its a less-than-charming defence tactic that not only smells hideous, its also dangerous: the blast of vomit is highly acidic and can damage predatory birds plumage, causing hypothermia or even drowning.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  While the usual threat is other birds, the fulmar will barf on pretty much anything that comes within spitting distance, which is an impressive two metres. Their unwitting victims include climbers, many of whom claim its the most disgusting thing theyve ever smelled. For those of you who have ever taken it a little too far on a heavy night out, this curious habit gives a new meaning to the term tactical chunder, doesnt it?

                 <h2>
                  THE HAGFISH
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  <img border="0" src="/sites/default/files/2013-1/Disgusting%204%20Africas-most-disgusting-hagfish_0.jpg"/>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The eel-like hagfish is almost blind, toothless and spends most of its time moving slowly along the ocean floor. If youre thinking, thats not disgusting, thats just an old timer waist-deep in water at the beach, then get a load of this: the hagfish is also one of the slimiest creatures in the world.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They produce up to eight litres of mucus in one go by firing protein pellets out of their glands. These swell as they come into contact with water to form an impenetrable slime barrier around their bodies. Hagfish produce a goop so thick it can suffocate predators that come too close and even hungry birds find this fish too slimy to swallow. Its a defence tactic that has allowed the hagfish to survive for more than 300 million years, making it one of the oldest species on the planet.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To avoid the same vile fate, the hagfish slips off its slimy coat by passing a knot down its body. If thats not enough of a bowl full of gross, hagfish have been known to feed on dead and still-living fish by entering any orifice and feasting on the animal from the inside out.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  With no sight, no teeth, a gratuitously gooey body, an affliction for dead flesh and creepy way of getting it, the hagfish has to be one of the most disgusting creatures on the planet.
                 </p>
                 <h2>

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Whether you take your bath with bubbles, aromatic oils or a little toy boat, youll agree that the purpose is to come out smelling fresh. The hippo didnt get the memo on this one.
                 </p>

                  These water dwellers have an affinity for emerging from their mud baths only to fling a mixture of urine and faeces at one another. With a quick swirl of their tail, male hippos will launch a disgusting cocktail of excrement in every direction, not dissimilar to a Catherine wheel. While this behaviour may seem disgusting and juvenile it is, in fact, a very effective method of marking territory as well as a neat party trick to impress the ladies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But thats not all: when hippos are out of the water they sometimes appear to be covered in what looks like a thin film of blood, a little like Freddy Kruger. However, this mechanism is an incredibly useful one that acts as a sunblock as well as an antibiotic. The pigment inhibits the growth of bacteria, which protects against infections from terrible cuts and wounds they incur during fierce territorial battles.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When you consider the amount of time they spend in the sun and sometimes less-than-pure river water, suddenly a natural antibiotic and sunblock comes across as a very useful thing to have, even if it does look a little like they sweat blood.

                  THE AFRICAN WILD DOG
                 </h2>

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Times are tough and were all scrimping and saving as best we can, but even our best efforts to curb our wastefulness seem paltry in comparison to the African wild dogs prudent, definitely disgusting, habit. While its common for many animals to regurgitate food to feed their young until theyre able to hunt for themselves, the wild dog takes this concept to a whole new level.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They regurgitate food not only for their biological pups, but also for every other member of the pack, from other mothers children to adult companions (particularly those which are sick or injured) who feel like a bit of silver service. Related or unrelated, it doesnt matter, this second-hand dinner dance is a feast for all, with the same bit of delicious steak often going around more than once. This regurgitative behaviour is most commonly seen during the denning season when pups and their adult babysitters stay close to home and therefore need to be fed by some other means than hunting.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In their defence, field studies have shown wild dogs are highly intelligent and social animals and, like most predators, they play an important role in eliminating sick and weak animals, thereby helping to maintain a natural balance. While theyre not the most amicable dinner guest, the waste-not-want-not eating habits of these colourful, bushy-tailed hunters is in the interest of the pack and the survival of a species thats very much endangered.

                  THE HAIRY FROG (ALSO KNOWN AS THE HORROR FROG)
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  <img border="0" height="363" src="/sites/default/files/2013-1/Disgusting%207%20Africas-most-disgusting-hairy-frog_0.jpg" width="578"/>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The hairy frog, also known as the horror frog, is a real-life version of the X-Men comic-book hero Wolverine, minus the charm. With tufts of hair growing in places only your doctor would know about and claws that pierce through its skin, this Central African species of frog earns its place on the gross list with its strange self-flagellating defence mechanism and even stranger breeding habit.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When attacked, the hairy frog produces a set of claws by breaking the bones at the tips of its toes and contracting a muscle attached to those bones, thrusting them out through its flesh. What you have left is a highly intimidating, not to mention stomach-curling set of claws. When they breed, male frogs grow long strands of skin and arteries that resemble hair. Researchers believe this might bring in more oxygen.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Whatever the reason, the combination of claws and hair make this aptly named amphibian an abhorrence that does as bad a job at keeping its skeleton inside its body as it does looking good for the ladies.
                 </p>
                 <h2>
                  AND THEN THERE IS YOU
                 </h2>
                 <p>
                  While poking a bit of fun at the weird antics in the animal kingdom is a lot less harmless (to both parties) than poking them with a stick, its interesting to note that all of the habits above ultimately achieve a goal, whether its for survival or preservation. Despite the poo-flinging, rotten-leftover eating and spine-curling vomit, the seemingly disgusting habits of our animal counterparts all serve a vital purpose.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  However, when it comes to humans the same thing cant be said. Those dishes youve left in the kitchen sink for days, that little fart you cupcaked into a fist and quietly lifted up to your nose and the chocolate wrapper you nonchalantly tossed on the pavement dont contribute anything to the preservation or evolution of our species  in fact, its often counter-intuitive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For a species that seems to have foregone evolution in favour of social definition, in the eyes of the animal kingdom our habits must come across as even grosser, weirder and ultimately pointless. I imagine them standing around in their herds, groups and troops wondering how exactly humans ever came so far as a species.

It sounded like a great idea; after all, our thoughts of the Karoo were of wide open spaces and flat terrain, perfect for cycling, and it was something new for a group of us who were trying to prove that age doesn\u2019t stand in the way of a challenge. So 8 of us made a vague agreement to this plan and proceeded to get on with our everyday lives, lives that did not include cycling!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cycle%20Karoo%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning to ride again.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only when we needed to make a commitment to David Southey of Great Karoo Cycling that the memory of an energetic holiday idea resurfaced. It still didn\u2019t prompt any major moves towards real training. We were woken up from our complacency a couple of weeks prior to departure when the final itinerary was sent to us. Suddenly the reality loomed that we had to ride about 200 kilometres over four days. Our organiser desperately asked if gel seats would help a bunch of amateur cyclists accomplish this. The answer was a very firm message from David Southey that we must not think of this as a \u201cSunday afternoon tea party\u201d. Wow, that certainly got the nervous energy flowing! The average age of our group was 57. Only the youngster of 41 owned a bicycle, the rest of us hired them through a rental company in the Karoo.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We scrambled off to buy the gel seat covers and proper cycling attire. Some of us spent a bit of time on exercise bikes or riding around the block. Real fear reigned the night before departure, especially amongst the four ladies. Would our bums be too sore to attempt the second day? Could we keep up with the others? Would the non-cycling years result in undignified falls?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cycle%20Karoo%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are six different routes. Colesberg is the start of the Gariep trail.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colesberg was the starting point for what was to become one of the most interesting trips of my life, full of awesome surprises. We were warmly welcomed at the Lighthouse where our enthusiastic hostess distributed the hired bikes and suggested riding up and down the main street as a warm-up. No one fell off so we decided we were ready and spent the rest of the afternoon doing a walking tour of the very interesting old town. This generated a healthy hunger, satisfied by a lavish Karoo-style dinner which include new delicacies such a sheeps' tails.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Day 1 our introduction to the \u201cTour de Karoo\u201d was \u201cHeartbreak Hill\u201d. It didn\u2019t take long to discover that the Karoo is NOT flat. We\u2019d barely got onto the dirt road outside Colesburg when we had our baptism of fire! Obviously the compensation of going uphill is the relieving downhill on the other side, but sometimes the \u201ctop\u201d is an illusion and there are several climbs before you reach the easier bits.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cycle%20Karoo%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only two cars were seen on the first day once we left Colesburg.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that we started appreciating having signed up. There\u2019s just the sweeping landscape of the Karoo, flawless blue skies and no cell phone signal, so we could simply enjoy the nothingness. Yes, there are the occasional homesteads with their broad stoeps and of course you see the famous Karoo sheep. Then you might get lucky, as did one of our group, in racing a duiker which overtook him as he reached 37 kilometres per hour.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day one\u2019s cycling ended in a brunch where we were to stay at Karoo Nights Country Lodge. One of the things we learnt quickly is that the \u201cKaroovians\u201d aim to fill you up. The snacks along the way, I thought was the brunch. Diets were soon forgotten. Main meals on the tour usually included succulent Karoo lamb, vegetables, yes fresh ones locally grown, followed by scrumptious puddings. And the homemade rusks are irresistible. All \u201ceaters\u201d are catered for whether gluten intolerant or \u201cBanting\u201d. Any weight that we hoped to lose cycling, was soon put on with all the amazing meals. Our hostess at Karoo Nights, Marine, is a cooking enthusiast and in true Karoo-style hospitality, gave us a goat\u2019s cheese making demonstration the afternoon we were there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cycle%20Karoo%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stories about actor Patrick Mynhardt of Herman Charles Bosman fame.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I learned about the Karoo \u2013 it\u2019s full of history. The people are the friendliest, most hospitable you could wish to meet and go back generations. They\u2019re proud of their heritage and full of good stories to tell. Homes we visited are full of relics, like a bible we saw dating back to the 1700s and a massive twenty-seater dining room table. The gardens are lovingly cared for and equally full of charm. Among the rolling plains are reminders of the Anglo Boer War Concentration Camps and there are monuments to Boer heroes, but then you\u2019ll also find a 1950s Chev in the veld, now used as a shelter for lambs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day two of our \u201ctour\u201d saw us tackling a more technical section for cycling. What this meant was some stoney and rocky roads and a few more rutted sections on jeep trails. These are, however, navigable and it\u2019s no disgrace to walk the extra steep parts. In any case there are plenty of stops and sustenance plus the reassurance of a back up vehicle.This was a day we had some bike troubles \u2013 brakes sticking, a pedal falling off, stiff gears etc. We had a spare bike and managed to overcome the problems, but it was a lesson that you cannot fully enjoy a cycling trip if your equipment isn\u2019t functioning properly.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cycle%20Karoo%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some interesting vintage cars now used for shade for lambing.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethulie, location of our third and fourth nights looks to consist of unassuming houses typical of a Free State dorpie, but we were told some were the homes of famous missionaries, actors, and ghosts. Our host and owner of the fascinating Royal Hotel, is a marvellous raconteur and tour guide. His tour of the town ended with a piano recital by an internationally recognised concert pianist! Another stunning surprise.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On days 3 and 4 we cycled through the Oviston Game Reserve then the Gariep Game Reserve, becoming part of a unique vista. The plains around the Gariep Dam are simply teeming with game. There are great herds of a variety of antelope, wildebeest and zebra, often thundering along at great pace. Move over Serengeti! The spectacle of these species in such numbers and cycling along behind the clouds of dust left by the hammering hooves, made us feel absolutely part of the landscape.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a real pity to leave these special areas and head back out onto the tar. Our compensation was a ride over the impressive Gariep Dam wall and a stay at Waschbank, a beautiful retreat on the banks of the Orange River.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cycle%20Karoo%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A private recital by concert pianist Benjamin Fourie was one of many highlights in Bethulie.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our final day of cycling once again involved a variety of terrains, from rather steep tarred sections to negotiating very rocky inclines. By now, we were so blas\u00e9 about our cycling skills that the challenges were something of a pleasure. The end of the trip saw us wend our way around the local Bethulie Dam before finally enjoying a well-deserved bottle of celebratory champagne.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we had cycled 185 kilometres through the Northern Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Free State. And yes, it\u2019s perfectly possible for a group of multi-generational amateur cyclists to accomplish this feat.

Life for him has always been about tides.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before becoming dhow captain, he skippered boats carrying sea cucumbers to Tanzania and electronic equipment back to Mozambique. He says an old man taught him to sail when he was a youngster, and now he feels more comfortable on the ocean than on land.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"float-left\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/East%20Coast%20Odyssey.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"270\" height=\"338\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waiter Jordan Jamali serves us a full English breakfast on the beach at Matemo, before we head out in the direction of Mogundula Island.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re just an hour into our three-day dhow safari from Ibo to Matemo, Mogundula and Medjumbe islands in the Quirimbas archipelago in far northern Mozambique.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny islands of the archipelago \u2013 there are 32 in all \u2013 have skirts of bright turquoise Indian Ocean. The sea here is tepid and twinkling, home to magnificent, tropical marine life, including dolphins and turtles that are protected by law.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive cotton sail has been hoisted by the nimble crew of six, and the dhow cuts through the water in silence, but for the whish-whish of sea lapping at the sides of the boat. The capable crew of vice-captains Challi and Amissi, assistant manager of Ibo Island Lodge, Harris, along with helpers Richard, Jordan and Anli, is reclining on the deck. Life jackets are threaded on a pole in the centre of the deck and rustle softly as the dhow tilts gently in the water.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crafted in Kenya by master-dhow builders in the traditional East African style, the 14-metre dhow is made entirely of wood and is sturdy and stable, carrying cargo of up to 20 tons. Everything you can imagine for comfort is on board \u2013 all the supplies for the trip, a fridge, stove, water, diesel and petrol for Zazu the tender boat trailing behind us \u2013 and solar panels to power the lights and electrics on board.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perched on a high stool with one hand on the wheel, Captain Shakuru has a mischievous face and a distant look as he scans the ocean. \u201cWe\u2019re about halfway to Matemo,\u201d he says staring straight ahead, \u201cwe\u2019ll be there for sunset. The tide will be low and it will be beautiful.\u201d For the next hour we are gently rocked and lulled. The dhow creaks as we tilt and the captain smiles and reads our minds. \u201cNo, it\u2019s in perfect condition. It has to move a little.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big boat that\u2019s rigid is not good.\u201d It seems that just a minute later the crew is dropping sail and rolling it up on a horizontal mast. Captain Shakuru edges the dhow closer to Matemo Island. The dhow needs just three metres of water and he\u2019s getting as close as he can to land.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He switches on his depth finder to double check himself. We\u2019re at three metres exactly, but he knew that all along and simply wanted to reassure us.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into Zazu we step, carrying just our day bag and camera, and putt our way slowly to shore. The tide is low and it soon becomes too shallow even for Zazu, so we walk the last stretch through warm water. Matemo is a big island with working villages. In the old days it was a stop over for slave trading in East Africa, but now life is serene and lived according to the tides. Locals are fishermen and palm farmers; tomorrow we\u2019ll venture to the village and meet them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/East%20Coast%20Odyssey%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fishing dhow from the deck of ours, with Ibo Island in the background.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the dhow safari guests do nothing but enjoy themselves. So we watch the natural theatre of sunset and light a fire of palm fronds on the talcum powder beach that is sprinkled with delicate white pansy shells. In the background, tents are pitched and dinner is prepared without fuss. It\u2019s seafood, Mozambique style \u2013 fresh, fire-fried and finger-licking.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishermen are up early next morning and we meet them returning to sell their catch. Some spearfish using ingeniously handcrafted masks, and snorkels of inner tubing and plastic piping. When we arrive in the coral rag village of neat huts in the sand, the day\u2019s catch is already available for sale from twig racks under the palm trees. Trade is swift and prices always fair.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us the day will be spent sailing to Mogundula Island, stopping en route to snorkel from the dhow. Marine life in the Quirimbas is vibrant and typically tropical. As we bale off the back of the anchored dhow, we\u2019re greeted by rainbows of marine life just below the surface. A mask and snorkel is enough to be transported into a world of wild colour and curious creatures. It\u2019s playland down there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mogundula is unusual. It\u2019s an elevated island with the welcome mat of a sandspit at low tide. At high tide, waves meet each other head on exactly where we\u2019d strolled on dry sand just hours before. After a short climb past a little beach strewn with starfish, bamboo-lined paths edged with giant conch shells welcome us as we reach the highest point. Our views are forever, and tucking in to fresh seafood, under a sky of a million stars, is what awaits.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two days we have been sailing between the mainland of Mozambique and the islands, roughly 5km from shore. Sailing is easy in these calm waters, with land in sight. Today Inshallah \u2013 \u2018God willing\u2019 in Arabic \u2013 will head out into open sea en route to the remote and tiny Medjumbe Island. It\u2019s a swathe of white sand 800m by 350m and marked on the tip by a derelict lighthouse. And with it comes a barefoot luxury lodge experience hard to match \u2013 and the ultimate way to finish up an East African sailing odyssey.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anantara Medjumbe Island Resort &amp; Spa has a lodge with a handful of idyllic beach villas that offer a luxurious Robinson Crusoe existence, living by the tides, swimming and snorkelling in the warm ocean \u2013 or dipping in your private plunge pool with sea views. We plan to swing in the deck hammock, secluded and cocooned with a good book \u2013 between enjoying fresh seafood prepared by superchef Lino. But first we have a day of sailing to do.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In open ocean, the dhow tilts a little more and we lie back against giant cushions and enjoy the ride. \u201cI can hold my breath for a minute,\u201d says Captain Shakuru breaking the silence. \u201cUnderwater.\u201d And then he tells us of his spearfishing escapades with giant kingfish. \u201cI have a wife and seven children at home,\u201d he says with a smile, \u201cand they like eating fish.\u201d As he says this we cast our eyes seawards and a cloud of newborn flying fish break the ocean\u2019s surface like a shower of crystals \u2013 and drop back into the water. We\u2019re still open-mouthed when the captain points in the opposite direction and says,\u201cSuki. Look.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming alongside the dhow are dolphins, or suki in local lingo, seemingly escorting us to Medjumbe. \u201cThey\u2019re late,\u201d says Shakuru, smiling. \u201cThey almost missed us.\u201d But they didn\u2019t. Playfully the dolphins circle the boat as we drop anchor off Medjumbe and wait for high tide and to jump ship to the idyllic tropical island, that\u2019s a mere punctuation mark of sand in the Indian Ocean.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s here, in remote and scattered islands, that the soul of the Indian Ocean lives. Far from mainland madness and close to the tides. Listening for news carried along on the trade winds.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\/subscribe\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Country Life&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/CL%20Cover_8.jpg?itok=mzneeGTq\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Country Life&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9988\" class=\"publisher-2376 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/spectacular-lake-kivu\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Spectacular Lake Kivu&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Spectacular Lake Kivu  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Spectacular Lake Kivu\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wheels-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Kivu%201.jpg?itok=X6cDeneE\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/spectacular-lake-kivu\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/spectacular-lake-kivu\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/spectacular-lake-kivu&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Kivu%201.jpg&amp;description=Spectacular Lake Kivu\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/spectacular-lake-kivu\" data-text=\"Spectacular Lake Kivu\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/spectacular-lake-kivu\" data-title=\"Spectacular Lake Kivu\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jul 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Andrea Dijkstra, pics Jeroen van Loon&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The banks on the Rwandan side of Lake Kivu are marked by picturesque villages and dozens of wooden fishing boats in spectacular bays, but the views over the lake and the lush green mountains on the Congolese side are even more breathtaking. Andrea Dijkstra and Jeroen van Loon drove around the immense lake \u2013 and entered the war zone.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smooth tarmac roads are appearing all over mountainous Rwanda. Though this development is very positive, we were more interested in the Congo Nile Trail \u2013 a dirt road (in Rwanda) along the eastern shore of Lake Kivu that has recently been marked by the Rwandan government.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The route\u2019s name is derived from \u201cthe real source of the Nile\u201d, located in the nearby Nyungwe Forest, and the trip takes two to three days. A map can be downloaded using the link at the end of this article. You will definitely need it, as it isn\u2019t always available at the tourist office in Musanze.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just outside of the beach town Gisenyi, on the northernmost tip of Lake Kivu, we turned onto a dirt road marked by a big signboard saying \u201cCongo Nile Trail\u201d. This is where we left modern Rwanda behind.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small children dressed in rags ran behind our car, laughing and screaming. Women carrying large bunches of branches on their heads stared at us. For hours we hardly encountered any other vehicles.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We crossed a patchwork of gently sloping farmlands with corn, cassava, sugar cane, coffee and banana palms. In a more forested area, we encountered a spectacular waterfall right beside the road, allowing us to take amazing pictures.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Land Rover suddenly felt quite big in the very narrow main street of the dusty village of Nkora, passing only inches away from a hairdressing salon, a brick mosque and a crowded market place. The people seemed to like our car. They were clearly not used to seeing tourists, and enjoyed the interest we showed in their way of life.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kivu%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The \u201cNile Trail\u201d signboards had been placed all along the route, except for the places where we really needed them. And asking locals for directions didn\u2019t help much. Apparently the government had not informed the local population about this scenic route, and we were invariably directed towards the tar highway dozens of miles away.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the campsites, or so-called \u201cbase camps\u201d, have been marked properly. Rwanda is too densely populated for bush camping, so we decided to stay in a \u201cbase camp\u201d halfway up the route. Unfortunately, the camp was nothing more than a messy lawn next to a coffee plantation. The young \u201ccamp manager\u201d told us that camping on the lawn cost US$10 a night, and showed us the toilet and shower facility. It had not been cleaned in years. Because it was getting dark we decided to stay, but refused to pay until the toilet had been cleaned. When the camp manager said we now had to pay $20 as he needed to pay a woman to clean the toilet, we laughed and asked him why he couldn't do it himself. The manager just stood there, unable to respond.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we drove through a green valley where men, women and children were cutting grass with small scythes. With the increasing altitude the landscape became drier, the road dustier and the number of begging children greater.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee plantations gave way to a plush carpet of tea fields, but soon the dirt road widened and the presence of Chinese road workers indicated that this stretch would undoubtedly be tarred soon. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening we camped for $10 again, but this time in the gardens of the Tshana Beach Motel, with stunning views over Lake Kivu.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we had feared became a reality the next day. The dirt track turned into a smooth tarmac road. Still, we recommend the Congo Nile Trail, especially the northern part, starting at Gisenyi. This is a beautiful, unspoiled part of Rwanda.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vacation time was over for us and since we were taking on several assignments in eastern Congo it was time to enter the country at Bukavu \u2013 as soon as we could resolve a \u201csmall\u201d problem. Our Congolese translator told us at the last minute that we absolutely had to have a valid international driver\u2019s licence, otherwise corrupt police would keep demanding bribes from us. We both had international licences, but they had expired and since nobody ever asked for them, we hadn\u2019t thought of renewing them. Because we could only get new licences in the Netherlands, we were very worried. How could we obtain driving licences in a small border town in Africa?&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kivu%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After staring at the beige documents for a while, we hit on an idea. Why not just forge them? Who would know? After some creative \u201cscrap-booking\u201d, we were ready to go.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once at the border, we met Honeur, a friendly Congolese man whose sister turned out to be an immigration officer working at the border post. We had heard stories about corrupt Congolese border officials, so meeting Honeur was a blessing. His sister stamped our passports, and after paying just $30 for a car permit and road tax, we entered the Democratic Republic of Congo. The crossing had taken only ten minutes, and turned out to be the easiest of our trip!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bukavu is a beautiful African city. Because the border town is spread across several rolling peninsulas, at every corner you have a different view over Lake Kivu. And thanks to its high altitude (1500m), it has a more pleasant climate than the rest of the country.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bukavu was apparently a favourite holiday destination for Belgian colonists. Their influence is still visible in the architecture. In contrast to other African cities, many of the colonial buildings haven\u2019t been replaced by shopping malls \u2013 yet.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bukavu has a big Catholic cathedral, and in one of the lakeside bays we discovered an old dock that had been built in 1941 and is still in use today.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We filled most of our time in Bukavu by hopping from one ministry to the other to collect dozens of stamps and signatures we needed to visit a \u201cconflict free\u201d tin mine backed by the Dutch government. After three days we had all the paperwork we needed and, accompanied by a translator, resumed our journey on a rocky dirt road, heading for Goma. The locals, walking along the road, were clearly amazed at the spectacle of two whites and a Congolese travelling in a Land Rover with Dutch number plates. Although this is the only road between Bukavu and Goma, hardly anybody uses it because it is in such bad condition. And, of course, there is the very real risk of rebel attacks.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kivu%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we passed a heavily armed convoy of UN soldiers, we started to feel a bit nervous.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we were overawed by the beautiful landscape. Although eastern Congo has been trapped in violence for more than two decades, costing the lives of millions of people and infamous for the combatants' terrible reputation for rape, it looks like paradise on earth.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hamlet of Kalehe we collected more stamps and signatures. When we returned to our car, we found that our right rear tyre was flat, having probably been sliced by the sharp rocks on the road. Thankfully we had two spares and quickly changed the wheel in front of a curious Congolese crowd.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We finally reached the mining town of Nyabibwe after two more hours of driving. After a final round of collecting stamps and signatures, we were allowed to descend into the 100m-deep mine pit. Wearing rain boots, we walked through the flooded tunnels, anxiously watching the electrical wires hanging in the water.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miners were using steel hammers and pins to remove rocks, while sweat ran down their mud-smeared faces. Although a noisy compressor was blowing oxygen into the tunnel, it was quite stifling in there. Working in that environment must be difficult.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heading back to Bukavu, we suddenly heard a loud hissing sound. Yet another puncture! We quickly put a jack under the car as an amused crowd gathered.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment that Jeroen began to crawl under the car to boost up the jack, the vehicle fell from it, nearly crushing him. To our dismay, the crowd howled with laughter. Fortunately Jeroen wasn\u2019t hurt, but were not impressed by the actions of the crowd. It took more than an hour to change the wheel in the difficult circumstances, using our hi-lift jack.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continued on our way, now driving without any additional spare tyres. Every sharp rock was now a dangerous obstacle. When we finally reached the tar after two hours, we breathed a sigh of relief. It was now dark and our translator mumbled, \u201cIf you run into anyone, continue to drive as fast as possible, otherwise people will lynch us.\u201d Fortunately we made it to Bukavu without facing such a dire situation!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following week we again took the harsh dirt road, but this time all the way to Goma, hundreds of kilometres away. We camped about halfway there at a missionary compound run by nuns at Minova.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kivu%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, soldiers stopped us at a checkpoint. With arrogant smiles and raised eyebrows, they walked around the car and told us that they wanted to check it. We handed over our fake international driving licence. It was carefully studied, but ultimately accepted.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, though, the recently issued car permit had already expired. Customs officials at the border hadn\u2019t told us that it would only be valid for two weeks. (In most countries such a permit is valid for a month.)&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soldiers triumphantly told us that our only option was to go all the way back to Bukavu as we could not pay a fine in Minova. After we had haggled and pleaded for ten minutes, the commander said he would let us go for $50, though the permit would have cost only $15. We eventually settled on a \u201cfine\u201d of $25.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as we were back on the road, we added a few days to the date on the permit, so we wouldn\u2019t have to pay any more fines. We were quickly becoming master forgers!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Goma, we stayed with a rich Congolese family who owned two large passenger boats on Lake Kivu. They suggested we take a ride in their speedboat. Slightly astonished, we took our seats in their white, luxurious boat.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short while later, our mouths dropped open when we docked at a festival where a band was playing live music to which hundreds of young people were dancing. We definitely hadn\u2019t expected this in Goma. It was still a war zone, after all.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fighting between the rebels and the army flared up again a few days later, just 14km from the city. We wanted to write a story about the new UN intervention force, so we decided to go to the front. Ideally, we would have gone with the UN forces but they had been brushing us off for more than a week, so we decided to make a go of it on our own.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kivu%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mixed feelings, we stuck A4 pages with the word \"PRESS\" on all sides of our car. Just outside the city we passed many army tanks, and our translator instructed us to stop close to one group of Congolese soldiers. He went over to talk to them.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFollow that motorbike,\u201d he shouted as he jumped back into the car, pointing at a soldier on a rickety bike. Following him, we went through countless deserted streets with empty, bullet-scarred houses.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a more forested area, we suddenly came across dozens of soldiers, resting. We got quite a fright, but they were very friendly. All they wanted was to have their pictures taken with the Land Rover.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there were deafening explosions. We dropped to the ground, but the soldiers just laughed.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThese are our shots, not theirs,\u201d said a commander named Moses, pointing to some trees a few hundred metres away. There were more soldiers, firing grenades at the rebels, who were apparently close by.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Commander Moses was telling us that the UN often assisted the Congolese Army, two white helicopters showed up and, to our astonishment, started firing at the ground.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they are bombing the militants, not us,\u201d laughed Moses.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were hardly reassured. How stupid had we been, travelling to the front line in our own 4x4?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the commander asked if we would like to join some soldiers who were about to carry out an attack, we quickly shook our heads.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, we had to leave Congo because our visas were expiring. (No thoughts about forging this time!)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We drank a beer in the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi, celebrating our successful four weeks in the Congo. Unfortunately, the eastern Congo just isn\u2019t a suitable tourist destination at the moment. This is a real shame, because at a peaceful time it really would be heaven on earth.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to the map of the Congo Nile Trail&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/responsiblenomad.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/08\/img_7354.jpg\"&gt;https:\/\/responsiblenomad.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/08\/img_7354.jpg&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kivu%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"463\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/travel-stories\/spectacular-lake-kivu\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leisure Wheels&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/1505_LW.jpg?itok=v72PMdgI\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Leisure wheels&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-10262\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/three-wheels-my-wagon\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Three Wheels On My Wagon&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Three Wheels On My Wagon  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Three Wheels On My Wagon\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/1.%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg?itok=hemaknCa\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/three-wheels-my-wagon\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/three-wheels-my-wagon\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/three-wheels-my-wagon&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/1.%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg&amp;description=Three Wheels On My Wagon\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/three-wheels-my-wagon\" data-text=\"Three Wheels On My Wagon\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/three-wheels-my-wagon\" data-title=\"Three Wheels On My Wagon\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Matthew Holt, Pics Matthew Holt, Mandy Ramsden&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passing villagers paused to inspect the brightly-painted auto-rickshaw, with amusement verging on incredulity. With no oncoming traffic, potholes or cows in the road, it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious how the vehicle came to be down in the ditch, suspended in a bush. As the responsible driver, I duly shrugged and smiled, though I was quite anxious how we were going to reach Kanyakumari.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the discerning traveller, each place has its quintessential mode of travel. In California, it\u2019s a convertible, in Venice a gondola, in the Caribbean a yacht and in India an auto-rickshaw. Known elsewhere as a \u2018tuk-tuk\u2019 or \u2018moto-taxi\u2019, this two-stroke, three-wheeler is the backbone of India\u2019s public transport system.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%202.%20Rickshaw%20and%20sacred%20cow%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rickshaw and sacred cow.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I stood contemplating our stricken vehicle and my co-pilot disassociated herself from the embarrassment, a small truck pulled alongside. Gesticulating that I should stay put \u2013 though I had few other options - the driver returned after five minutes with a rope, which he hitched around my vehicle and tied to his tow bar. And when several villagers in flip-flops slithered down into the foliage and started to push, I felt obliged to clamber into the cockpit and steer. With much grunting, revving and tyre spinning, the rickshaw was hauled back onto the road and, after a round of handshakes, we were on our way again.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%203.%20Maps%20were%20of%20limited%20use%20%28MandyRamsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maps were of limited use.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were taking part in an auto-rickshaw rally, over nine-days and covering some 1200km, depending how badly you got lost. The starting point was Chennai, formerly Madras, where in 1639 the East India Company set up a small shop that morphed into the British Empire, punkah wallahs, tiffin and G&amp;Ts. The small colonial fort looked lost amidst the congested, chaotic sprawl of India\u2019s fourth largest city, with the only remnant of the Raj being an obsession with cricket.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%204.%20Visiting%20Thanjavur%20temple%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visiting Thanjavur temple.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the rally started, we attended a practice session on the outskirts of the city. The founder and organiser, of sorts, Aravind Bremanandam, gave us the keys to our vehicle plus some tips on cultural etiquette and survival. My co-pilot, Mandy, was bereft of mechanical and navigational skills, but she did have a penchant for fancy dress and our rickshaw looking resplendent in South African colours. While neglecting to bring a tool kit or GPS, Mandy had remembered makarapas and vuvuzelas.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling the rickshaw took some getting used to. Excepting the brake pedal, everything was operated by hand, including the all-important horn and manual windscreen wiper. Nonetheless, after a cursory driving test - which we passed despite stalling - we were declared roadworthy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%206.%20Rural%20roads%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rural roads.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, all the teams gathered in the hotel parking lot.&nbsp;While I didn\u2019t spot Lewis Hamilton or Fernando Alonso, there was a German team calling themselves the \u2018Shawmachers\u2019; two Aussie bodybuilders dressed as superheroes and both named Bob; a pair of Scots sporting kilts and hangovers; three European girls in tight-fitting, red overalls branded \u2018Masala\u2019; Santa and his elf; a couple of ducks; and a trio of languidly-spoken English public schoolboys, who were to leave a trail of destruction and hush money. In total, there were 21 teams, each comprising two or three members. One by one, we climbed aboard, yanked our ignition levers, revved our wailing engines and \u2013 accompanied by camera flashes and ironic cheers - kangaroo-hopped down the hotel driveway into the maelstrom of Chennai\u2019s rush hour traffic.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%207.%20The%20scenic%20route%20to%20Tuticorin%20%28Matthew%20Holt%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The scenic route to Tuticorin.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first hour was, quite frankly, traumatic. The triple carriageways carried at least eight lanes of traffic, plus occasional vehicles coming the wrong way, pedestrians, goats and cows. Meanwhile, the only law of the road was Darwinian, with articulated trucks as the apex predators, travelling flat out, horns blaring, forcing everyone else into the gutter. Cyclists and pedestrians were supposedly beneath us in the hierarchy, but we\u2019d been warned to avoid any collisions since, as \u2018&lt;em&gt;feringhis&lt;\/em&gt;\u2019 we\u2019d be to blame. It was a fraught hour before we escaped the city and found the more sedate coastal road towards Puducherry.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%208a.%20On%20the%20main%20road%20to%20Manapad%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the main road to Manapad.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rally wasn\u2019t an all-out race as such, with teams required to make each day\u2019s destination before a cut-off time, earning points by visiting obscure landmarks along the way. The daily stages were typically around 150km, which - allowing for a cruising speed of 50kph, fuel stops, breakdowns and navigational blunders \u2013 generally took us six to eight hours. While we weren\u2019t too bothered about winning, the event was an ideal way to explore the birthplace of four major religions, yoga, the Kama Sutra and vindaloo.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%208b.%20Bemused%20cyclist%20in%20Manapad%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bemused cyclist in Manapad.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next eight days, we travelled south through the heart of Tamil Nadu, past intricate temples, abandoned forts and flooded paddy fields, where women in elegant saris worked up to their ankles in mud. In the former French colony, Puducherry, we boisterously celebrated surviving the first stage; at the next overnight stop, Thanjavur, we crashed into a bollard and knocked over a row of motorbikes like dominoes; and in Madurai, we spent New Year\u2019s Eve visiting the ancient temple.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%209.%20Race%20action%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Race action.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thiruchendur, we were blessed by a rheumy-eyed, old elephant, which took our 10 rupee donations in his trunk and passed them to his handler, before deftly patting us on our crowns. In Tuticorin, we stayed down by the harbour, which had an unhealthy fishy pong; in Tirunelveli I spent the night sweating and shivering with fever; and in Kanyakumari, we watched the sun set into the confluence of the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%2011.%20Traffic%20jam%20in%20Tirunelveli%20%28Matthew%20Holt%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traffic jam in Tirunelveli.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a saying, \u2018If you don\u2019t hate India, you haven\u2019t spent enough time there,\u2019 which eventually might prove true, but our experience was just the opposite. The longer our journey went on, the more we enjoyed it. Initially, we\u2019d been terrified at the prospect of breaking down. After the second day, however, when our rickshaw had stuttered to a halt and we\u2019d been ushered to a back-street garage where they stripped and cleaned our engine, and offered us lunch - all for US$ 4 - we almost looked forward to technical mishaps and the ensuing social interactions.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%2011b.%20As%20ferringhis%2C%20we%20even%20had%20to%20give%20way%20to%20cyclists%20%28Matthew%20Holt%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As 'feringhis', we even had to give way to cyclists.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we got used to being hopelessly lost. With road maps of limited assistance, the only means of navigation was to stop and ask directions from locals, who would invariably smile, say \u2018Yes\u2019 and wobble their heads.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We even became cavalier about regular near-fatal collisions, dismissing them with a sanguine shrug. Four teams rolled their rickshaws during the rally, with the English public schoolboys managing to do so three times, shatter their windscreen twice and collide head-on with a motorcyclist. On reflection, it was a miracle nobody was maimed, or perhaps it was due to visiting all those temples.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%2012.%20Roadside%20repairs%20on%20the%20way%20to%20Kanyakumari%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadside repairs on the way to Kanyakumari.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final stage from Kanyakumari into Kerala took us past green hills, coconut trees, hyacinth lakes and sandy white beaches. Reaching Trivandrum, we pulled up at St Joseph\u2019s Cathedral, where all the teams eventually gathered, save for the English public schoolboys who\u2019d reportedly crashed again. From the cathedral, we\u2019d been requested to proceed in convoy to a hotel just around the corner, where the local media was assembled to record our triumphant arrival. Competitive spirits got the better of us, however, and the procession quickly became a mad-cap race, cutting each other up, squeezing through gaps and jumping traffic lights. We screeched up the hotel drive on two wheels, only to find the press had gone to the wrong venue.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%2013.%20Now%20how%20did%20that%20get%20there%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now how did that get there?&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that afternoon, over a tub of iced beers, Aravind declared the winners to be the three shapely girls from Team Masala, who received a free entry into the next rally. Reluctantly surrendering our keys and bidding farewell, we caught a taxi along the coast to Varkala. As our taxi driver darted between cars and swerved round trucks, we didn\u2019t even flinch. We were veteran Indian road hogs ourselves now. The next few days were spent lounging in cliff top bars, dining on pesto tuna and quaffing mojitos, which was very pleasant, if hardly the real India. You need an auto-rickshaw to experience that.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rickshaw%2014.%20Welcome%20to%20Kerala%20with%20a%20%20speeding%20fine%20%28Mandy%20Ramsden%29.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Kerala with a &nbsp;speeding fine.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-10106\" class=\"publisher-1651 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/robertson-round\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Robertson Round Up&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Robertson Round Up  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Robertson Round Up\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.goodtaste.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #ecdd44' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/goodtaste.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Robertson%201.jpg?itok=Q8A7YByk\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/robertson-round\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/robertson-round\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/robertson-round&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Robertson%201.jpg&amp;description=Robertson Round Up\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/robertson-round\" data-text=\"Robertson Round Up\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/robertson-round\" data-title=\"Robertson Round Up\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Karen Rutter, pics Tracey Derrick&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018The problem with the Robertson Wine Valley is there is just so much to do. One needs to spend quite a few sundowner sessions in the area to get a fair grasp of things\u2019&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cShake. Sniff. Slurp. Swallow.\u201d These are the rules for olive oil tasting. Clive Heymans shows us with such infectious enthusiasm we\u2019re soon slurping away like professionals. Who would have thought a shot glass of oil could be so delicious?&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, we\u2019re getting all sorts of surprises on this road trip through the Robertson Wine Valley. &lt;strong&gt;The MARBRIN OLIVE FARM&lt;\/strong&gt; is one of them. Clive\u2019s partner, Briony Coetsee, explains that her dad bought the land in the 1990s and started planting olive trees, much to the scepticism of his grape-growing neighbours. But more than a decade later they have 8 000 trees spread over 25 hectares, and have picked up several awards for their oil. The family-run boutique farm now also holds tastings and tapas sessions, where they explain the olive growing process. \u201cWe use three different cultivars - Frantoio, Coratina and Mission - and two-phase decanter technology. This basically means our oil is extra virgin, and has a unique flavour,\u201d explains Briony. She and Clive pour bowls of the honey-coloured nectar and encourage us to soak up the taste with bread. Later, we sample different tapenades and green fig preserve, and are splashed with a tot of homemade Limoncello to \u201cfreshen the palate\u201d. When we finally leave, we feel we are gliding...&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Robertson%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marbrin forms part of a horseshoe route known as the &lt;strong&gt;KLAASVOOGDS MEANDER&lt;\/strong&gt;, which leads off the road to Ashton. Here you can find the upmarket &lt;strong&gt;ROSENDAL WINERY AND WELLNESS CENTRE&lt;\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;KRANSKOP WINES&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MO AND ROSE BISTRO AND GUESTHOUSE&lt;\/strong&gt;. And there are also other gems that add to the surprise factor - such as the 65-year-old &lt;strong&gt;SHEILAM CACTUS AND SUCCULENT GARDEN&lt;\/strong&gt;, boasting around 2 000 species of plants. You can take a stroll through prickly swathes of cacti, succulents and cycads, some with the most beautiful bright flowers and others with evocative names such as \u201cMother in Law\u2019s Chair\u201d and \u201cHorse\u2019s Teeth\u201d. Johanna Geduld, who has worked here for several decades, helps us choose a small selection of baby cacti to buy, while owner Minette Schwegmann tells us international clients are among her biggest customers for seeds. \u201cEspecially the Japanese,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, we are very careful about what we export and how - the rules are very strict.\u201d Minette, who has a Botany degree, says she often gets emails or calls from people if their succulents are ailing. \u201cI\u2019m like a kind of botanical Agony Aunt,\u201d she laughs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further up the road, different plants are cultivated for different reasons at &lt;strong&gt;OWL\u2019S REST OLIVE AND LAVENDER FARM&lt;\/strong&gt;. Martha Hattingh holds demonstrations of lavender harvesting and the steam distilling process that produces lavender water and essential oils. She creates a whole range of bubble baths, natural soaps, lip balms and more out of purely natural elements. Martha shows us her simple but effective method of extraction using a home-built distiller that includes a kettle she \u201cborrowed\u201d off her husband Jack\u2019s yacht (they plan to sail to the Caribbean at some point). Martha explains the many advantages of lavender water, ranging from being an anti-bacterial agent to an asthma retardant. \u201cAnd people with birds use it to stimulate feather growth in their parrots and budgies,\u201d Martha smiles. Later, sitting chatting in her heavenly-smelling workshop, she pours us a drink of rose geranium cordial mixed with sparkling water. \u201cCome sundowner time, you can add gin or vodka,\u201d she says with a twinkle in her eye.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Robertson%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with the Robertson Wine Valley is there is just so much to do. One needs to spend quite a few sundowner sessions in the area to get a fair grasp of things. We are lucky enough to spend one evening at the five-star &lt;strong&gt;ROBERTSON SMALL HOTEL&lt;\/strong&gt;. Situated in what was one of the original Robertson houses\u2014complete with wrap-around stoep and beautiful broekie-lace filigrees - the boutique hotel has expanded to include several pool-side rooms, stable rooms and a honeymoon suite. The accommodation is state-of-the-art comfortable, but with only ten rooms in all, there\u2019s a warm, intimate feel. The service is outstanding, and the menu at their on-site &lt;strong&gt;REUBEN\u2019S AT THE ROBERTSON&lt;\/strong&gt; restaurant is stylishly divine. The Ragout of Field Mushrooms with Basil Butter and Onion Soubise is worth driving all the way to Robertson for.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s the little touches and gestures - including homemade chocolate fudge and a specially printed-out Emily Dickinson poem on my pillow when I go to bed - that make the place memorable.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of accommodation both in town and on neighbouring farms and estates, which makes an extended exploration of Robertson relatively easy. There are various different routes stretching spider web-like out of the hub of the town itself, leading to Ashton, Montague, Bonnievale, McGregor and the R62 back to Cape Town. On the latter road we are very amused to see a massive red chair perched on the side of the road at &lt;strong&gt;ROOIBERG WINERY&lt;\/strong&gt;. We stop to look, and a sign informs us it is the \u201cbiggest chair in Africa\u201d, which, at nine metres tall, is easy to believe. There\u2019s also a \u201clove wall\u201d where romantic partners are encouraged to affix a padlock and then throw away the key, symbolising their eternal love. PR and Export Manager Marianne Lochner, says people really like having their pictures taken with the chair. \u201cWe have queues when there are special occasions, like during the Wacky Wine Weekend,\u201d she smiles.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also explore the onsite restaurant and bakery, which is exuding irresistible wafts of all things non-Banting. Marianne says the two young men responsible for the croissants, breads and pastries on display were initially working on the Rooiberg wine farm. They expressed an interest in baking, were trained, and now Neville Olckers and Wilfred Jacobs have a reputation that stretches all along the R62.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also along the stretch is the eco and art-conscious &lt;strong&gt;GRAHAM BECK WINES&lt;\/strong&gt;; the estate, named Madeba, is known not only for its award-winning ranges but for the conservation work being done on its private nature reserve. These efforts have in turn inspired the Game Reserve Range, seven wines which are individually named after animals which are endemic to the region - with beautifully illustrated labels for each. The Graham Beck tasting room also has to be one of the most visually pleasing venues, not only for its sprawling view of the vineyards and mountains, but for the selection of artworks from Graham Beck\u2019s private collection that grace the space.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you venture down a different strand of the Robertson web, you hit the R317 to Bonnievale. The road winds through a plethora of vineyards and wine farms, making it very difficult to choose a place to stop. There\u2019s &lt;strong&gt;SPRINGFIELD&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CLOVERFIELD&lt;\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;BON COURAGE&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;DE WETSHOF&lt;\/strong&gt;, for tastings. And then there are alternative activities, such as taking a picnic cruise at &lt;strong&gt;VILJOENSDRIFT&lt;\/strong&gt;, where you can stock a basket at their deli and then float down the Breede River while sipping something cool. For the more adventurous, there\u2019s the Fish Eagle Biodiversity Hiking Trail at &lt;strong&gt;VAN LOVEREN&lt;\/strong&gt;. The 7,5km route starts and ends at the cellar, and offers beautiful views as well as educative signposts along the way.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We push on a little further to &lt;strong&gt;WELTEVREDE&lt;\/strong&gt;, a wine farm that has been in the Jonker family for over four generations. Here, PR Manager Elzette Steyn has something special in store\u2014a walk through some of the original underground wine cellars, which cover more than a hectare of ground. She\u2019s lit candles to guide our way through the narrow passageways, some of which are lined with thousands of bottles of sparkling wine, waiting their turn to be declared ready to drink. \u201cThey\u2019re in here for four years,\u201d explains Elzette. She leads us to a small chamber where she and her team usually have group wine tastings. It\u2019s dark, but the candles provide a warm glow and there\u2019s a pleasing, faint, musty smell of old wine. Sometimes couples request the cellar tour, for a special romantic occasion, says Elzette. \u201cBut then I try to hang in the background - it\u2019s embarrassing to get in the way,\u201d she grins.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wind our way back to the centre of Robertson and find yet another surprise, this time one suggested by the friendly staff at the Robertson Small. We find &lt;strong&gt;ART METAL WORKS&lt;\/strong&gt;, the premises of Pieter Heunis, a steel and metal-worker. He has become somewhat famous in the town\u2014and further afield\u2014because of his sculptures, made out of hundreds of horseshoes. \u201cI used to fix horseshoes for the local farrier, and for some reason I got this idea to try and make a horse,\u201d says genial Pieter, when asked how he started. \u201cThis was about three years ago - I never had any art training, but I always liked drawing, and I like music, so maybe that counts. I did the one horse, and then somebody wanted me to make another, and so it has gone,\u201d he says modestly. Pieter\u2019s sculptures can now be seen as far away as KwaZulu Natal, and he has been featured on the &lt;em&gt;Mooiloop&lt;\/em&gt; TV programme. \u201cBut this one here I won\u2019t sell,\u201d says Pieter, patting the neck of a pretty horseshow horse with a metal flower in her mane. \u201cHer name is Blommetjie, and she\u2019s the legacy I\u2019ll leave for my family,\u201d he explains.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Robertson Wine Valley has so much to offer - from the established beauty of a family wine farm and quirkiness of a cactus garden to the graceful opulence of a five star hotel. Then there are the many things to do, from hiking and canoeing to mountain biking and beyond. And you still have to make time for olive, wine, grappa and cheese tasting. We\u2019ll be back, that\u2019s for sure.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Famous for Its Festivals&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Robertson Wine Valley has a festival for every season. Make sure to mark down at least one of them on your calendar this year.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hands on Harvest, 7 Feb - 29 March:&lt;\/strong&gt; Held over the two-month harvest cycle, this festival takes the format of a boutique event that offers wine aficionados and budding vintners a chance to experience the magic of harvest for a day.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wacky Wine Weekend, 4-7 June:&lt;\/strong&gt; Seen as South Africa\u2019s biggest regional wine festival, it has close to 40 wine farms and boutique producers taking part.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robertson Slow, 7-10 August:&lt;\/strong&gt; Wineries and guesthouses from Ashton, Bonnievale, McGregor and Robertson welcome visitors into their homes, to their dining tables and onto their farms for a food and wine experience.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mmm McGregor, 25-27 September:&lt;\/strong&gt; McGregor links its creativity to a celebration of comestibles, in its mmm...McGregor festival of food and drink.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wine on the River, 16-18 October:&lt;\/strong&gt; Held on the banks of the Breede River, you can taste over 300 wines from 42 wineries. Add to that live music, great food, kids activities, boat trips, tutored tastings, local produce and more.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodtaste.co.za\/Winelands\/Robertson-Round-Up\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Good Taste&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2038\"&gt;Mo and Rose at Soekershof&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2036\"&gt;Sheilam Cactus Garden&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/7854\"&gt;The Robertson Small Hotel&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2046\"&gt;Viljoensdrift Ferry&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodtaste.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/GT%20cover_1.jpg?itok=SF1vnCWj\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Good Taste&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9931\" class=\"publisher-4076 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/wide-awake-seattle\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Wide Awake in Seattle&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Wide Awake in Seattle  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Wide Awake in Seattle\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.travelideas.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #f69220' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Travel%20Ideas%20s.jpg\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20Seattle.jpg?itok=D3qby804\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/wide-awake-seattle\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/wide-awake-seattle\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/wide-awake-seattle&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20Seattle.jpg&amp;description=Wide Awake in Seattle\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/wide-awake-seattle\" data-text=\"Wide Awake in Seattle\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/wide-awake-seattle\" data-title=\"Wide Awake in Seattle\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Franki Black&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle is like a friend who is somewhat surprised and completely over the moon when you choose to visit her. She is modest, she oozes quiet confidence and she\u2019s a bit of a hipster. In fact, when you meet her you\u2019ll be tempted to think that she sparked the global hipster movement. She delights you around every corner and soon you discover that she is, after all, your best friend.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This northwestern American city is famously known for its rainy winters. It is far from gloomy, however. The benefits of rain are in fact substantial: it encourages people to turn to creative outlets such as theatre, music, museums and markets. Seattle ticks all of these boxes and, to top it off, it has spectacular forest trails, waterfalls and a vast bay where you can spot passing pods of orcas. If you\u2019re still not convinced, opt to visit in summer when its weather is said to be glorious.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the city remains relatively undiscovered by tourists. It was only in the 1990s that Seattle\u2019s widespread underground music scene pushed the city into the limelight. The \u201cgrunge\u201d movement, spearheaded by Nirvana and Pearl Jam, took off around the world and it all started here. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I landed at the airport late at night and met my taxi driver. He set the tone, \u201cSeattle is by far the best city in America \u2013 you\u2019re in for a treat.\u201d I was ready to get active.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Evergreen Escapes&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I joined an orientation tour with Evergreen Escapes, a regional tour company that specialises in adventure tourism for small groups. Our starting point was Pioneer Square, the oldest part of the city. &nbsp;Face-brick buildings were covered in green ivy and streetlamps embellished with wrought-iron twirls. It felt like a time-warp. Shana, our guide, led the way down a flight of stairs. We entered an underground world centered around book stores, artisan workshops and coffee cafes. Large parts of Seattle are apparently built on the remains of an underground city that existed in the mid-1800s.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above ground, we continued to the Tlingit Indian Totem Pole, a tall wooden shaft that honours Native American culture in Washington State. \u201cThroughout North America, Native American tribes use these totem poles to connect to the spiritual world,\u201d explained Shana, as we looked up at painted faces of carved bears, monkeys and owls.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was West Seattle, a popular suburb that is home to people like Eddie Vedder - lead singer of Pearl Jam. En-route, Shana pointed out the headquarters of Starbucks and impressive views of the harbour, one of the biggest and deepest ports in the west. Ships, containers and cranes were moving around like worker ants. The driver dropped us at a neighbourhood park for a walk through the forest. It was like something out of a fairy-tale. Giant, furry trees soared above me, dew drops shimmered from flowers and the sound of a woodpecker knocking on wood resonated throughout the forest.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My morning with Evergreen Escapes came to an end at West Seattle\u2019s promenade with homemade muffins and freshly-brewed coffee. A vast bay, known to be a sailing and kayaking mecca in summer, stretched out in front of us like a sheet of navy-blue ice. I bid Shana and her team farewell and navigated my way to one of Seattle\u2019s most popular attractions for locals and tourists.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pike Place Market&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pike Place Market is the thumping heart of Seattle. Locals say that it\u2019s the glue that keeps the city together and if you ever find yourself in Seattle, you will naturally gravitate towards it. This vibrant market is the longest continuously-operated farmer\u2019s market in the USA and it encapsulates Seattle\u2019s enterprising spirit better than any other place. I joined a tour, offered by Savor Seattle, for a taste of the market\u2019s best. All Savor Seattle employees have musical and theatrical backgrounds, and to my delight, our guide Bridget periodically broke into song.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWho wants to catch a fish?\u201d asked Bridget animatedly. We were standing in front of the Pike Place Fish Company and there were mounds of mussels, clams and silver fish on show. Confident mongers were trying to lure the crowds closer for a taste. A hesitant bride-to-be in our party was pushed forward by her friends to \u201ccatch the fish.\u201d She steadied her feet and waited as a fishmonger threw a large, quivering Alaskan salmon from behind a counter, through metres of air into her hands.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continued past rows of colourful tulips and vegetable stalls filled with purple artichokes, Fiddle Head Ferns and morel mushrooms. Guitar players, violinists and singers entertained throngs of people pouring into the market. &nbsp;In between all the action, we stopped at different stalls for tastes of clam chowder, dried fish, macaroni and cheese, and doughnuts. The tour ended near the market at a bubblegum-covered wall, known to be one of the world\u2019s most unhygienic tourist attractions!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The EMP Museum&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, Paul Allen\u2019s (co-founder of Microsoft) love for rock music led him to open the EMP Museum, a space that focuses on all things pop-culture related. I hopped on a bus and made my way to what has to be one of the most eccentric buildings imaginable. Architect Frank O. Gehry designed the EMP Museum with the intention of portraying the evolving rock \u2018n roll experience. The result is a multifaceted, futuristic building - made largely from aluminum and steel \u2013 that looks more like a silver-and-pink space station than a museum.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the inside, I walked through a series of exhibitions of Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), Jimi Hendrix, and myths and magic. Letters exchanged between Cobain and his bandmates, and Hendrix\u2019s psychedelic outfits were some of the items on show. In the middle of the museum, I watched classic rock performances screened on an IMAX screen. A highlight was the interactive section where visitors can step into technology-driven booths and learn how to play the keys, drums and guitar. For aspiring singers, there is a mini recording studio and a stage, set in front of a pseudo audience.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Space Needle&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EMP museum is situated within walking distance from the Pacific Science Centre, a glass sculpture exhibition, a children\u2019s museum and the Space Needle - my next stop. Soaring above the city like a gigantic mushroom, this observation tower is the most prominent feature on Seattle\u2019s skyline. Instead of walking up its 848 steps, I squeezed into an elevator and shot up to an elevation of 184 metres in a matter of seconds. At the top, I looked out over spectacular views of skyscrapers, faraway lakes and the Pacific.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden Treasure&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A South African architect urged me, before I left for America, to visit the Seattle Central Library. He described it as one of the most revered buildings on earth. &nbsp;With a few hours spare, I plotted the library on a map and made my way there. It proved to be worth every step. Designed by Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus, its hard-edged exterior is made of glass and steel, whilst its interior is finished in woods and surfaces tinged in reds and butter yellows. Elevators and a four-floor spiral walkway lined with a bookshelf, led me to the 11th floor where generous rays of natural light flooded through large, angular glass panels. People were reading, studying and browsing. &nbsp;It felt more like a home than a public library. A few hours later, when I was sitting on a plane homeward-bound, I realised that Seattle enchanted me until the very end.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Seattle%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make it Happen!&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Where to Stay:&nbsp;&lt;\/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sheraton Hotel:&lt;\/strong&gt; Situated in the heart of downtown Seattle, the Sheraton Seattle Hotel is a contemporary urban retreat that offers state of the art facilities.

Our goal was to be the first to walk cross this stretch of sand unsupported and unassisted. It was a suffer fest from first to last. Weeks were spent trapped in a prison of self-deprecation and dwindling food. Somewhere, in the midst of that misery a rather pleasant thought took root. To return, and do it all on a Fatbike.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I fell in love with the sand. Truth is, having spent 40 days walking across it, I knew it well. And so, almost a year later, in the company of two other adventure-hungry riders, I set off from the edge of the Arabian Sea.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Salalah in Southern Oman, I thought 12 days would be enough time to cycle 1200km north across the desert to Dubai. In retrospect, this was unrealistic. Nic Jordan, Justin Mcleod and I were riding: Humood from Oman, and Dino De Angelis from our South African office provided vehicle support. Dino was the general dog\u2019s body and scapegoat if things went pear-shaped.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 1 saw us climb up into the Dhofar Mountains and eventually reach Wadi Arun. It was a good introduction to Fatbikes as the first 50km were tar. How these bikes with wider wheels were going to work was still a question. But for now we were content to put some miles between the ocean and us. Early into Day 2 we turned onto a remote military track where we had our first encounter with the Oman army. They were intrigued with our bikes but happy to let us go on, as long as we turned right at the fork. Left would take us towards the very remote Yemen border and potential trouble. We had no problem turning right.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once on the other side of the Dhofar Mountains, we were technically on the edge of the Empty Quarter. We were now in an area called the Nedj. Miles and miles of open gravel plains led to the sands proper. Progress was fast during these first few days with the vehicles occasionally getting lost. They were not always able to go where the bikes went and would sometimes take a detour that would leave us thirsty and hungry for hours. By day 6, however, things were more complex. The previous day we had entered an area of closely linked dunes and soft sand, dotted with countless saltbushes. In fact, the previous year when we walked through the area we dubbed it Wurglewood, home to the notorious Wurgle monster. The soft sand and constant punctures were almost our downfall and we struggled at a snail\u2019s pace for four days before we were at last free.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time I headed further north from the small village of Mughshin before turning north west, hoping to avoid most of the mayhem. Now, once again, Wurglewood was casting its disastrous spell. We had cycled about 50km that day before we got the call that both our Landcruisers were stuck in soft sand. Fortunately, we had ridden past a Polish seismic survey camp and they rescued our support crew. The night was spent in the company of the Poles swopping whisky and war stories.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set off the next morning feeling a little under the weather but mindful that we needed to somehow make up time. We followed a track towards the Saudi border and into the heart of nowhere proper. It was a glorious day even if the wind continued to pound our resolve. We were now in big dune country and around us the majestic red sands soared and swayed as far as the eye could see. We were buoyed by the fact the Fatbikes were working better than we could ever have hoped. Whether it was the small dunes of Wurglewood or the endless soft sand plains between the bigger dunes, there was not much we were unable to ride. But it was grueling stuff.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then came Day 8: one of those bittersweet days - sweet, in the sense that the dunes were now a glorious red, but bitter as it would be our last day in them. We were now basically following military tracks close to the Saudi border, and half the time rode on them and half the time off. Why you might ask? Well the tracks were mostly hard, bumpy gravel, and while the going was faster, it was hard on the legs and rump! The gravel plains between the dunes always offered a softer passage, but inevitability at the cost of speed or energy. And so we mixed it up, constantly trying to find the best line.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before lunch I decided to ride about 100m off the track and visit one of our campsites from the previous year. It brought back deep memories of that special but desperate time. However, what totally stumped me was the complete lack of any evidence that we had ever been there. Not a sign, not a print in the sand, nothing. It was like we were never there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after we stopped at an army base to refuel, we were picked up by the army again and ordered to accept an armed escort for about 120km. It turned out that just the previous week ago the Oman army had caught a group of smugglers trying to sneak across the Saudi border, right here in this very remote part of Oman. As a consequence, they worried for our safety and felt personally responsible for us. No amount of explaining that we were trying to be the first people to ride the entire way across the desert would dissuade them. We were left with few options. It was now almost 6pm and time to call it a day. They said we were quite welcome to ride on through the night with the escort to a base about 160km away. Or we could jump into their jeeps. We simply could not camp where we were. We had already ridden 115km, in about 10 hours, our biggest day yet. To ride on for another 160km was simply not tenable. And so, resigning ourselves to whatever fate lay ahead, we sadly climbed in.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hours later we were dropped in the middle of nowhere. We made a call to drive on to the town of Ibri, spend the night there and then decide in the morning as to what we should do. The next day dawned with dissention in our ranks. Nic was keen to bail and felt that if we could not achieve the world first and ride all the way, there was no point continuing. Justin was in the middle. I was adamant we should press on.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After much debate it was decided that we would return to a point roughly where the army had said it would be safe for us to continue, and carry on from there. Of course this meant a late start, but we pressed on into what had now become a pounding wind. That day sand got into every exposed part of our body. We rode 70km before finally crawling into camp for some sandy but delicious chicken. It was a tough day for all, both physically but also emotionally. It\u2019s hard enough to psyche yourself up for something grueling if there is the promise of glory at the end. But it\u2019s even harder when all that waits is a step into obscurity.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparing for our longest day yet, we rose early and in the faint light pedalled off into a surprisingly cold morning. Dino and Humood had to drive back to Muscat and drop off one of the vehicles while we cycled 140km to the border. Here we would change over into another vehicle and meet Mahmood on the UAE side. We knew it was going to be a long and complicated day as we left Oman and entered the United Arab Emirates. The first 60km was the now familiar desperate, rutted and bumpy gravel road that took us past a Petroleum plant. Stopping for some water we were pleasantly surprised to be welcomed in and given a buffet lunch! This seemed to galvanize Nic and Justin. W pedalled off with renewed vigour. Finally, just as the sun was setting we arrived at the Oman\/U.A.E border and begun the formalities of crossing over.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once on the other side it was dark. It had been a long day for everyone and no one was too keen to camp. Dino mentioned there was a Hilton in Al Ain, a town about 20kms away. And so, with a frenzy not unlike a swarm of hornets, we pedalled like mad to this newfound oasis. All told that day we rode for 13 hours and 160km. A record we were not about to break any time soon.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hilton served as an elixir of sorts and as we rolled out of town the next morning everyone was chirpy. A tar road added to the enthusiasm. I had a most unusual but very pleasant surprise sneak up on me out of the blue. Nadia, my wife, had been toying with the idea of finding out the gender of our unborn child. She was seven months pregnant. It was going to be a surprise but the last month or so she had been contemplating giving in. I got an sms the night before to such effect, but I thought it was the usual banter and so said, as I had before, \u2018just go find out\u2019. I didn\u2019t think more of it. Now, two hours into Day 11, my phone suddenly beeped. When I casually turned it on, I read \u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was stumped. Shocked almost but I let out a yelp and with teary eyes shouted out the news to Justin and Nic who were a short way up the road. Buoyed along by the news, we upped the pace until, finally, late that day, we had to cross a few kilometres of short sand dunes. It was arguably the most fun yet with the Fatbikes making short work of the ups and downs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 50km from Dubai we settled on an area that was suitable for our final night camping out in the sands. As Dino and I went about making a fire, Mahmood was called out time and again on rescue missions to pull stranded expats from Dubai out of the sand. It was the weekend and many had made their way out into the nearby desert with \u2018normal\u2019 cars. Mahmood told us the next morning that he rescued the same group of German girls three times the previous night! Hmmm\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thick, damp mist lay low over the sand as we made our way onto a tar road and off towards the mayhem that is Dubai. Two hours later we faced what would be unquestionably the most dangerous part of the expedition, crossing Dubai\u2019s nine-lane highways. Mahmood followed close behind to try and give us some relative safety but it was still a nightmare. Luxury vehicles sped past at 150km\/hr, completely oblivious to our presence and totally indifferent to our plight. Finally, at around 11am we rolled into the reception of the Park Hyatt on the old Dubai creek and completed our crossing. All told it was an epic journey of 1130km and 12 days. Unfortunately though, we missed those crucial 120km that would have allowed us to claim a world first.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Thesiger said, the sand makes its way into a man\u2019s bones. And while it is true that in our case it made its way into absolutely everything, not just our bones it did so in a lasting and powerful way. The sand of Arabia is a lonely and forgotten sand; humble and quietly spoken that whispers of an age past when people lived with nothing more than each other and their dreams and aspirations. Sadly, it also speaks of a time past. We were privileged, just for a while, to be part of this very special place. I have no doubt that our tracks are no more, gone with the wind and covered by the inexorable flow of the sand. What is left in us is lasting. Something to take back to the hectic hustle and bustle of a known world, and remind us that even as strangers in an unknown world, it is possible to come alive!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.xplorethisworld.com\"&gt;www.xplorethisworld.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Empty%20Quarter%2011.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9935\" class=\"publisher-1338 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/paula-radcliffe-running-sensation\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Paula Radcliffe - A Running Sensation&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Paula Radcliffe - A Running Sensation  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Paula Radcliffe - A Running Sensation\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.doitnow.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #d22127' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/din.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20Paula%20Radcliffe.jpg?itok=EUNwgm89\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/paula-radcliffe-running-sensation\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/paula-radcliffe-running-sensation\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/paula-radcliffe-running-sensation&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20Paula%20Radcliffe.jpg&amp;description=Paula Radcliffe - A Running Sensation\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/paula-radcliffe-running-sensation\" data-text=\"Paula Radcliffe - A Running Sensation\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/paula-radcliffe-running-sensation\" data-title=\"Paula Radcliffe - A Running Sensation\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Elana Meyer, pics Shutterstock&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many gifted athletes with loads of talent all over the world. Of those talented athletes you will see some that come and go, and then you get those who stick around to become the sporting icons who shift beliefs of what is possible.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the belief was that women were not physically strong enough to race over distances longer than 800 m. However, history was to change, albeit very slowly, at the 1972 Olympics, when the 1,500m was added for the first time. It took another 12 years to add the 10,000m and marathon for women. And then Paula Radcliffe came along and redefined what women are capable of when she ran the marathon in a time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, setting the current women's &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_world_records_in_athletics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;world record&lt;\/a&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 41 and after a 25-year long-distance running career, Paula Radcliffe ran her farewell race at this year\u2019s London Marathon.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what did Paula, undoubtedly the greatest female marathon runner ever, do to take her from good to great?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paula had talent and did really well as a junior, however she was often beaten by athletes with an explosive kick over the last 400m. Then in 1998, Paula started working with Irish physical therapist Gerard Hartmann, who played a major role in turning her into the running machine she was.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Paula%20Radcliffe%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paula Radcliffe breaking record at Great North Run, 2003. Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was not just her talent and therapist that saw Paula dominate the ladies in marathons, her incredible work ethic, commitment and professionalism took her to a whole new level. The saying, \u201cTalent will only take you so far in your journey to excellence, but hard work will separate you,\u201d was never truer than for Paula.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testament to this is what was said by Hartman, who has worked with many Olympics champions over the years, \u201cI\u2019ve seen plenty of athletes with much more talent than Paula Radcliffe. The uniqueness of Paula is that her success defies the talent. She had respectable cross-country talent, but she wasn\u2019t your thoroughbred athlete. She needed to train at 110 percent as opposed to 90. She had to run 150 miles a week, but it wasn\u2019t the mileage, it was the intensity and the pain she endured. Her talent, if she didn\u2019t train hard, would have got her to 31:50 or 32:00 for 10K; to run 30-flat, 2:15 [marathon], took extraordinary will power, extraordinary mind set, extraordinary preparation, an excellent support structure, to be fastidious about every aspect of her nutrition, working with a dietitian, a homeopath, an exercise physiologist, physical therapist, osteopath, and collaborating all of that with her husband, Gary, and her coach.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Paula is the holder of the ladies marathon world record, her true legacy is that she\u2019s proof that athletes can break records by abiding by the rules. Furthermore, she is also a great example that it can take years to develop into a champion.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many talented athletes (and parents) out there who can learn from Paula. Ultimately though, it is not about the talent spotted at a tender age, but rather the long-term commitment, exceptional inner drive and ability to overcome setbacks.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I salute Paula Radcliffe on a phenomenal career that we can all aspire to.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Paula%20Radcliffe%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paula Radcliffe, winner of the 2007 New York City Marathon, photographed at Mile 14. by Ed Costello from Brooklyn, NY, US&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More about Paula Radcliffe&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Paula Jane Radcliffe, born 17 December 1973, is an English &lt;a href=\"&lt;http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Long-distance_runner&gt;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;long-distance runner&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 She is a three-time winner of the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London_Marathon\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;London Marathon&lt;\/a&gt; (2002, 2003, 2005), three-time &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_Marathon\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;New York Marathon&lt;\/a&gt; champion (2004, 2007, 2008), and won the 2002 &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicago_Marathon\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Chicago Marathon&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Radcliffe is a former world champion in the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marathon\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;marathon&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Half_marathon\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;half marathon&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cross_country_running\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;cross country&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 She has also been European champion over &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/10,000_metres\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;10,000 metres&lt;\/a&gt; and in cross country. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 On the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Track_running\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;track&lt;\/a&gt;, Radcliffe won the 10,000 metres silver medal at the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1999_World_Championships_in_Athletics\" target=\"_self\"&gt;1999 World Championships&lt;\/a&gt; and was the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Athletics_at_the_2002_Commonwealth_Games\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;2002 Commonwealth&lt;\/a&gt; champion at &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/5000_metres\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;5000 metres&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 She represented &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great_Britain_at_the_Olympics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Great Britain at the Olympics&lt;\/a&gt; four times consecutively (1996 to 2008), but did not win a medal on the Olympic stage. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Radcliffe is an asthma sufferer who has campaigned against the use of&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Drugs_in_sport\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;drugs in sport&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;\u2022 Her running has earned her a number of accolades, including the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BBC_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;BBC Sports Personality of the Year&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Laureus_Awards\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Laureus World Comeback of the Year&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/IAAF_World_Athlete_of_the_Year\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;IAAF World Athlete of the Year&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AIMS_World_Athlete_of_the_Year\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;AIMS World Athlete of the Year&lt;\/a&gt; (three times) and a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Member_of_the_Order_of_the_British_Empire\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)&lt;\/a&gt;.

Andrew \u201cAverage Andy\u201d Steer didn\u2019t need an excuse to revisit them in the new year\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just around the corner in the Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve, Wendell secured a 10-year lease to build his own trails on 450 hectares of pretty, pristine, privately-owned bushveld. Thaba Trails was born, and over the years \u2013 largely through Wendell\u2019s endless passion \u2013 it has built up a bit of a cult following while serving as host to numerous XCO races, 12 and 24hrs, the Thaba Toughee and even the odd Enduro and Downhill race. In need of shedding some Christmas excess, I headed out towards Alberton to sample this playground once again.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Thaba%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The riding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaba has rightfully built up a reputation as having some of the toughest trails around, but if you bite off the right bits and build up your strength and skills appropriately on each visit, it will take your cycling and enjoyment thereof to new levels. There is something for everyone: An entry level 6km Yellow route, the more challenging 17km Green route with its guaranteed game sightings &nbsp;(its shortened 10km route is also a popular option for the not too fit) and the master track that is the 30km Blue route, a challenge for riders of pretty much any level. You can take on this challenge in smaller bits, though, as many of the technical sections are loops that branch off the main track.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow Route&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimed very much at beginners, the 6km yellow route is a very simple undulating route suitable for riders of any fitness or skill level. Although a good chunk of it is still singletrack, it\u2019s very easy and smooth riding and a great little route for kids and newbies alike. The fun switchbacks through the forest at the finish will put a smile on most people\u2019s dial.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Route \u2013 10 &amp; 17km&lt;\/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most riders, this is their bread and butter at Thaba. The main 17km loop is made up mainly of singletrack and is a relatively challenging, but highly enjoyable loop around much of the park. The main thing with Thaba on a whole, is that it\u2019s just never really flat, you are either going up, or coming down one of the many koppies that litter the area. The green route for the large part sticks to the friendlier gradients, but there are still some little challenges (and some not so little ones \u2013 Wendell\u2019s Way!) that will nudge you out of your comfort zone.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toughest sections are avoidable towards the western side of the park and there is also a shorter 10km route on to which riders with leg and lung failure can cut short their ride if required. The 17km route as a whole is great fun, with a bit of everything in terms of riding challenges, while the game viewing is always a special bonus.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Route&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue route, at 30km in length, is a tough challenge for pretty much any cyclist. After doing a few of the little loops off the main path, it\u2019s obvious to see why this is such a popular training ground for the more serious XC racers. When I say tough, though, it\u2019s not as technically challenging as one might think, the biggest challenge is without doubt the gradients. Your heart rate is likely to be up near max most of the time and your legs will be screaming as you scramble for gears yet again. Yes, the course builder is a track cyclist of some serious pedigree.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s singletrack 90% of the time, and while the full 30km isn\u2019t achievable by all cyclists in one bite (this one in particular), it\u2019s great to push yourself by adding extra sections each time you ride the park, or even just alternating the challenges you take in from week to week. Another serious plus is that the Blue route, in Wendell\u2019s own words, is never finished. He upgrades, adds and removes sections all the time to ensure the best possible experience for the riders.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the little loops, varying in length from 600m to 2km (read the signs) (Prince, Lawrence, Yafta, Kudu, Mzuzu, etc) are made up of steep descents followed by equally steep climbs. Some of the rocky descents have been brilliantly crafted and as much as I suffered on some of the climbs (even walked), it was seldom not worth it!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climb up Wendell\u2019s Way (also part of the green route, although I am sure it gets skipped by most) is a real long slog, but the fast descent to the fun fire station section, makes it all worthwhile. And if the suffering ever gets too much for you and you\u2019re feeling a little sorry for yourself, just remember: Wendell rides this route daily\u2026 and um, he\u2019s well into his 60's!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Thaba%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overall Experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thaba has a huge amount to offer, the passion of the owner and his trail builders can be seen throughout the 30km of pristine, hand-built, largely singletrack trail that they have prepped and fine-tuned into one of South Africa\u2019s finest and toughest offerings. The terrain has a great mix of everything, the bushveld is beautiful and it\u2019s often hard to believe you are still in the city \u2013 and game sightings, well, it\u2019s not bad to see wildebeest, impala, zebra, blesbok and even a springbok on your morning ride. Not to mention the littering of porcupine quills you will be dodging along with the centipedes out on the track. The neat shop for coffee afterwards is most welcome and if you\u2019re looking for a bite, the Two Trees Bakery (in the same brickyard) is a great spot to refuel while the kiddies enjoy the great play facilities.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cycling hours&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open seven days a week, the trails are open from 6.30am to 5pm&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weather&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the trails hold up pretty well to the rain, but after typical Johannesburg thunder storms, you can expect some mud out on the course which can make some of the blue sections, in particular, extra challenging. Apart from that, sunscreen is a must during the warmer months as you will get pretty exposed out there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rates&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;R35 per rider, per visit. Just sign in at the small shop\/kiosk and you will be issued with a number board.&lt;br&gt;Annual passes available.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Thaba%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get There&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;101 Klip River Drive&lt;br&gt;Mulbarton&nbsp;(entrance via the Southern Brickyard)&lt;br&gt;GPS: S 26\u00b0 18' 02.5\" \/ E 28\u00b0 02' 56.3\" \/&nbsp;26.301206S, 28.048804E&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Directions&nbsp;to Thaba Trails:&lt;\/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions from Johannesburg:&lt;\/strong&gt; From the CBD, take the M1 south-bound.

pics Andrew Brukman&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think now would be a good time to come out the closet. You see, we all enjoy cross-dressing and somewhere stuffed in the back of the Landy, tucked in-between my rusty trumpet and Zanne\u2019s drying panties, is a bag we bought especially for dressing up\u2026 for practical reasons of course. Among the various thrilling outfits are a tutu, silver sequin dress and a full on transgender gorilla suit (gender bending depending on whether a male or female is wearing it). And for extra &lt;em&gt;pizzazz&lt;\/em&gt;, and security, we had two wigs, dubbed Auburn and Shaniqua, which, when positioned on the seat headrests whenever we weren\u2019t in the car, looked like seated occupants. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"323\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had just crossed over the border into Namibia at Onseepkans and decided to follow the Orange River as far west as we could go. It\u2019s an amazing route that follows the river\u2019s rocky flow. Occasional green patches of cultivated land characterise much of the immediate riverbank. I remember looking out away from the river at the harsh baked earth and feeling comforted; that no matter what we had water. This appreciation for water, we later realized, would take on an almost religious awareness.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noordoewer was the first town on the road. Paul decided to give Auburn a go. Much to the amazement of the locals, he donned the wig while we stocked up our bar\/pantry with the essentials.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The river eventually carries on to the west coast while the road turns up north toward Aus, running parallel to Sperrgebiet, a barren old mining area, meaning \u201cRestricted Area\u201d in German. As we turned northwards the landscape opened up and we were surrounded by vastness. That evening we pulled off the side of the road just before Aus and, still without a proper tent, managed to construct a pitch tent on the side of our Landy. The wind picked up as we huddled inside, covering holes where the howling wind sang through and giggling at the awesomeness of nature all through the night.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning we woke up psyched from the wildness of the previous night. We decided that we would walk, so set off into the desert. After an hour we identified a random mountain far in the distance. Walking towards it was freedom at its best; nothing but sand around us for miles.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perpetual motion of our feet reminded me of the opening paragraph of a National Geographic article by Paul Salopek, who embarked on a seven-year global trek. He writes:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking is falling forward.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each step we take is an arrested plunge, a collapse averted, a disaster braked. In this way, to walk becomes an act of faith. We perform it daily: a two-beat miracle\u2014an iambic teetering, a holding on and letting go. For the next seven years I will plummet across the world.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hike took us the whole day and we came back heavy-footed, ready to head to the coast at L\u00fcderitz.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L\u00fcderitz &lt;em&gt;is&lt;\/em&gt; beautiful, but you really have to squeeze your eyes and look hard to realize it. Approaching the town from a distance, with the sun setting in the horizon, is amazing. The old German Lutheran church, the town\u2019s famous landmark, peaks out of the rolling hills in a series of salty silhouettes. The town itself is a pastiche of German architectural prowess and grey-cemented Namibian modernism. &nbsp;On the slopes, the buildings seem to hang on to each other in a bric-a-brac manner, almost like a seaside &lt;em&gt;flavela&lt;\/em&gt;, just less crowded. It has a certain lure to it; maybe it\u2019s because of the history of the port town (Bartholomew Diaz stumbled upon the bay in 1487) or the fact that it is a largely isolated town on an extremely inhospitable coastline.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our fiendish thirst for alcohol kicked in when darkness fell and the full moon rose. We headed to a local tavern called Gold Coin Hotel \u2013 actually a dingy motel with slot machines, pool table and soccer on a TV. As the evening progressed to the rhythm of the slot machines \u2013 &lt;em&gt;ching ching, doo doo dooop ching ching ching&lt;\/em&gt; - we met a fleet of people including a group of &lt;em&gt;buchtermeisies&lt;\/em&gt;, \u2018&lt;em&gt;buchter&lt;\/em&gt;\u2019 being a colloquial term for bay and \u2018&lt;em&gt;meisies&lt;\/em&gt;' Afrikaans for girls. They had attitude: the girl gang out on the town that evening. With Ice, a Herero from northern Namibia who was working as a charter pilot in L\u00fcderitz, we watched soccer and talked about the difference between north and south Namibians.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the night crawlers came out and we sparked up a conversation with two Romanian sailors who had sheepishly emerged from \u201cout back\u201d of the motel. They were great and, through broken English and interpretive hand-dance conversation, we became friends. They invited us back to their ship that evening (which we declined) and the following day (which we gladly accepted).&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring L\u00fcderitz\u2019 coast was also interesting. There are many coves, locally called fjords, which are scattered around the peninsula and a cool beach called Agate ten minutes north of town.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get it on a hot day and the sun will warm you up as you lie on the agate-speckled sand. The water is refreshing, but close your eyes, squeeze hard and you\u2019re in Mauritius!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last night was spent having sundowners on Seal Island, which offers a view back onto the harbour and town. We squatted next to the lighthouse at the top, sleeping under the stars with a machete under the pillow for security. I\u2019ve experienced a few breathtaking sunsets and still evenings, but this was something special; all through the night a warm breeze blew on to the lighthouse while we looked onto a beautifully lit harbour. A hum emanated from the gigantic ships docked at bay. From our epic vantage point, snuggled up in our sleeping bags we felt like we were on the craziest, wildest coast on Africa.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Luderitz%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9932\" class=\"publisher-2809 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/riebeek-valley-talking-about-revolution\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Riebeek Valley - Talking About a Revolution&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Riebeek Valley - Talking About a Revolution  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Riebeek Valley - Talking About a Revolution\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.hsm.co.za\/magazines\/details\/cape-etc' target='_blank' style='background-color: #ffffff' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/capeetclogo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20Riebeek.jpg?itok=RunrK5GP\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/riebeek-valley-talking-about-revolution\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/riebeek-valley-talking-about-revolution\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/riebeek-valley-talking-about-revolution&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20Riebeek.jpg&amp;description=Riebeek Valley - Talking About a Revolution\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/riebeek-valley-talking-about-revolution\" data-text=\"Riebeek Valley - Talking About a Revolution\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/riebeek-valley-talking-about-revolution\" data-title=\"Riebeek Valley - Talking About a Revolution\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Jade Cooke, pics &lt;a href=\"hsmimages.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Kendall-Leigh Nash&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another fertile valley full of wine, olives and history? Well, yes. But the Riebeek Valley is so much more than the sum of its cookie-cutter parts, home to maverick winemakers, a thriving restaurant scene and yes, an olive or two&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a 35\u00baC day in Riebeek-Kasteel, the only correct thing to do at the stroke of five o\u2019clock is to answer the siren call of a gin and tonic at The Royal Hotel.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be politically incorrect to say it, but I\u2019ve never felt so colonial as I do at this moment, stretched out in a wicker chair on this historical terrace, which the hotel proudly (and somewhat comically) claims to be the longest stoep south of the Limpopo. Potted palms wave in an occasional and treasured breeze, while overhead what are possibly the world\u2019s most ineffectual fans rotate lazily as though they, too, have had enough of the afternoon\u2019s heat. It all feels very Old Cataract Hotel circa &lt;em&gt;Death on the Nile&lt;\/em&gt; \u2013 which is just lovely an hour outside of Cape Town and in 2015.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so it should have a sense of history, the last structural change to the hotel having been the addition of its arched terrace in 1927. But even this grande dame is but a debutante compared to Riebeek-Kasteel itself, which numbers among South Africa\u2019s oldest towns. Named, of course, for Commander Van Riebeeck, upon whose instruction a hinterland expedition that led to its settlement was conducted, Riebeek-Kasteel today provides an excellent base from which to make your own discovery of the surrounding Riebeek Valley.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its wine and olives, the valley has a wonderful ability to make you feel far from the madding crowd while still being less than 90 minutes from the Mother City\u2019s various amusements and beaches. It\u2019s hemmed in by the Kasteelberg, Porseleinberg and Paardeberg mountains, and there\u2019s a rural, bucolic feeling to the landscape thanks largely to the wheatfields stretching from horizon to horizon as you approach from Malmesbury, golden in summer and a rich green come Cape Town\u2019s wet winter.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riebeek-Kasteel is perhaps the best known of the valley\u2019s three little villages, its sisters being Riebeek West, a stone\u2019s throw of but five kilometres away, and tiny, elevated Hermon.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wander around the three or so blocks that comprise its central business district doesn\u2019t take too long, but there\u2019s plenty to carry back home with you. While away some time with a tasting at The Wine Kollective, a homage to local winemakers with cellar-door prices. If garagiste olive oil hasn\u2019t featured in your life up until now, don\u2019t miss The Olive Boutique either, where a selection from this valley\u2019s other notable industry is available for tasting. Poke around the rest of the doorways and you\u2019ll find everything from fine art and vintage treasures to biltong, handmade chocolate, natural soap, homeopathic remedies and clothing a friend who lives in the village has aptly termed \u2018Swartland tannie chic\u2019.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market square is mostly used for parking day to day, but stop to snap a picture of the solemn red ox erected in 1938 to commemorate The Great Trek, and a VOC (Dutch East India Company) cannon as a tribute to Riebeek-Kasteel\u2019s founding fathers. You\u2019ll also find a large topiary elephant here, though its presence appears to be more whimsical than historical. For a more detailed record of the town\u2019s Voortrekker past, head to De Oude Kerk, a beautiful church completed in 1856 that now houses the Valley Museum.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riebeek-Kasteel may have all the hallmarks of a small, South African town, but the pervading spirit is far from small-town South African mentality. Beneath the heat, beneath the quaint charm, beneath the fiercely preserved history, there is the tremor of a beat from a drum that\u2019s anything but ordinary.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a start, there\u2019s Kobus, or at least I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the name of the man often spotted zooting around town in a golf cart with a licence plate bearing that legend. There\u2019s little to no chance that plate comes from a municipality office, but we\u2019ll let it slide, Kobie.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there\u2019s the secret garden, hidden just behind the Kasteelberg Country Inn &amp; Bistro on the square. An insider tells me to stop by that evening to hear a travelling musician who\u2019s just arrived in Riebeek-Kasteel on his bicycle to treat us to a guitar serenade.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we talk about Riebeek-Kasteel\u2019s cuisine for a second too? The catch-all \u2018traditional country fare\u2019 hardly does it justice. Bar Bar Black Sheep in Short Street still has Capetonians trotting up for lunch to enjoy the likes of kudu carpaccio, viskoekies, goat stew in Jamaican curry and pork loin in a thyme and rum gravy.Next door, Eve\u2019s Eatery and Bar offers rustic Italian dishes, while for pizza you\u2019re going to want to order a few to share at Mama Cucina. For brunch, tuck into the signature Egg Nest on the vine-shaded terrace of Beans About Coffee, or enjoy salmon scrambled eggs in the courtyard of Caf\u00e9 Felix beneath a 150-year-old oak tree.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps most representative of the Riebeek Valley\u2019s non-conformist spirit is Swartland Independent, a collective of maverick winemakers who have come together to revolutionise the area\u2019s wine industry. What these guys are all about is making wines that are a true expression of their origin. A number of criteria must be met before a bottle can bear the now coveted Swartland Independent logo. Chief among these is that grapes must be grown entirely in the Swartland, as well as vinified, matured and bottled here. Another biggie is holding to natural production methods, which means minimum manipulation in the vineyard and cellar, with no supplements, added tannins, or chemical or technological processes of any kind.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have limited time, plan your visit around the wine farms of Eben Sadie (Sequillo), Hein and Adi Badenhorst (AA Badenhorst Family Wines) and Callie Louw (Porseleinberg). Together with Chris and Andrea Mullineux (who recently \u2013 and sadly \u2013 moved their operation out of the valley) these guys are the original revolutionaries. And while they take Swartland wine seriously, to be sure, you won\u2019t find a more entertaining, light-hearted group of winemakers out there. One evening in the company of Adi \u2018The Personality\u2019 Badenhorst on his farm, Kalmoesfontein, was enough to convince me that you can taste the geniality and passion he\u2019s known for in his end product.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tastings at most SI farms are by appointment, which seems like a hassle until you realise that means you invariably get to taste the wines with the very person responsible for making them \u2013 infinitely more personal and detailed than a large-scale tasting room staffed by Elsenburg students.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But back to happy hour and that Royal Hotel gin and tonic. Let me tell you, a bow-tied barman hovered over it for some time. We may be at colonial central, but this creation is out of left field, traditional lemon, lime and cucumber being joined by strawberries, pomegranate seeds and passion fruit syrup. It\u2019s refreshing, it\u2019s delightful and it has that perfect Riebeek-Kasteel collision of old world and new ideas, history and reinvention.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a beat here that\u2019s anything but ordinary, and people are marching to it.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riebeek%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHERE TO STAY&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kloovenburg Pastorie&lt;\/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This impeccably restored Victorian manor house is the former residence of De Oude Kerk\u2019s pastor. Today it offers three luxury, air-conditioned, en-suite bedrooms, a dining room and lounge, plus enviable views over Riebeek-Kasteel and the valley. On a hot summer\u2019s day, it\u2019s not easy to drag yourself away from the lovely pool area.

A small island may be the only landmark punctuating vast stretches of water. Seafaring journeys to places such as St Helena, Antarctica and across the Pacific take you into waters sailors undertake with trepidation, yet you can visit them in luxury.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Antarctica\u2014Like No Other Place on Earth&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly 100 years ago, Shackleton undertook an expedition to one of the harshest places on the planet\u2014Antarctica. The fact that we can reach this once almost impossible destination with the likes of Silversea and Crystal Cruises\u2014and do so in utter luxury\u2014is in stark contrast to Shackleton\u2019s explorations of 1914-1916. Stuck firmly in ice, the &lt;em&gt;Endeavour&lt;\/em&gt;\u2019s crew abandoned ship and lived on floating ice while Shackleton set off to find help. Amazingly, not one member of the expedition died.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturalists and marine experts Chris and Monique Fallows of &lt;em&gt;Apex Shark Expeditions&lt;\/em&gt; in Cape Town, say Antarctica is their favourite place on earth. They\u2019ve returned from guest lecturing on the 18-day Amazing Antarctic Crystal Symphony positively glowing from the experience. \u201cThe enormity of the place is difficult to describe,\u201d says Monique, \u201cit\u2019s an out-of-this-world landscape where scenery and wildlife provide constant stimulation.\u201d Chris shares his in-depth knowledge of great white sharks and illustrates talks on Antarctic wildlife with his photographs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You must be prepared to travel through monstrous seas to get to Antarctica and notch up some formidable points on the map, such as Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands and Drake Passage. But once you get to the deep south, you are rewarded with the sight of massive icebergs and huge mountains up to 3 000 metres high. It ticks all the boxes for passionate wildlife enthusiasts, penguin lovers, intrepid travellers, adventure history buffs and those wanting to clock up a new continent on their record of world travels.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cruising%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-cruise reading has to include Endurance: &lt;em&gt;Shackleton's Incredible Voyage&lt;\/em&gt; by Alfred Lansing\u2014the definitive account of this audacious expedition. And &lt;em&gt;The Last Place on Earth&lt;\/em&gt; by Roland Huntford, examining the great South Pole race of 1912 between Britain\u2019s Robert Scott and Norway\u2019s Roald Amundsen. On the return trip Scott dies along with four of his men, and only 11 miles from his next cache of supplies, while Amundsen completes the race, returns alive and remains largely forgotten.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Britain\u2019s Last Colonial Outposts&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another distant journey attracting like-minded, but somewhat more frivolous passengers, is the 17-night return trip from Cape Town to St Helena and Ascension Island on &lt;em&gt;RMS St Helena&lt;\/em&gt;. This Royal Mail Ship, with room for just 150 passengers, visits these islands to deliver mail and cargo to what\u2019s left of Britain\u2019s colonial outposts. It also transports islanders and curious travellers seeking unusual stamps in their passports. Ascension has long been a strategic military base in the middle of the South Atlantic, reachable by air and en-route\u2014but not exactly anywhere near\u2014to the disputed Falkland Islands. The other dot far off the African west coast is St Helena, accessible only by sea, until now. This little volcanic island, that serves as the first stop for sailors from Cape Town en route to Brazil, is about to jump into the 21st century with an air strip and a 4-star hotel, both due to open in 2016. Tristan da Cunha\u2014the third island in this territorial grouping of British protectorates\u2014is no longer visited by RMS St Helena. But don\u2019t let that stop you from reaching the world\u2019s most isolated community and obtaining one of the rarest passport stamps on the globe. You can still take the six-day sea voyage from Cape Town on a cargo or fishing vessel with other eccentric travellers and some grungy fishermen.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flirting with the Tropic of Capricorn&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let\u2019s talk of warmer climes and tropical islands. Cruises out of Durban to Maputo, Inhaca and Portuguese Islands of Mozambique - flirting with the waters of the Tropic of Capricorn - account for most of MSC\u2019s 44 departures during the forthcoming South African summer season. MSC Cruises have cornered the South African market with their discounted prices and family specials, achieving an astounding 99.9 per cent average occupancy for MSC &lt;em&gt;Opera&lt;\/em&gt;\u2019s final season here.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cruising%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come November 2016, the &lt;em&gt;Sinfonia&lt;\/em&gt; will replace the &lt;em&gt;Opera&lt;\/em&gt; and cruise from Genoa down through the Panama Canal, along the Gulf into the Indian Ocean to Durban via Seychelles, Mauritius and Reunion. A sensational 25-night trip. But she won\u2019t be the same &lt;em&gt;Sinfonia&lt;\/em&gt; we\u2019ve known in the past. She\u2019s undergoing a most extraordinary re-design at a shipyard in Palermo, Italy. The 13-deck vessel is being split into two halves and a new 24-metre long entire mid-section is being added. It all seems quite impossible.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all because South Africans can\u2019t get enough of this previously inaccessible style of holiday and are queuing up to book the extra 193 cabins with more balconies, extended public areas, additional restaurants and new clubs and play areas for youngsters.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are You a Pollywog or a Shellback?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about starting your cruise mid-ocean among the atolls of the Maldives on Silversea\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Silver Discoverer&lt;\/em&gt;? You quickly sail south passing the invisible equator\u2014a significant event, which should be marked. Perhaps not quite in Navy style with King Neptune presiding over some messy rituals, like cracking a raw egg over your head. Such rites act as the precursor for Pollywogs (those who have yet to cross the equator at sea) to achieve the status of Shellback (those that have crossed the equator). Once across the equator, it\u2019s full steam ahead to several ports in the Seychelles, then hitting the coast of Africa at Mozambique and taking a northerly amble up to Zanzibar. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Paradise in the Pacific&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it\u2019s islands you love then Fiji has 333 of them, with only 110 inhabited. Fiji is paradise in the Pacific and visited by Princess Cruises on an 11-night round trip from Sydney or Brisbane. When Captain Cook first met the Fijians in the late-1700s, he described them as \u201cformidable warriors and ferocious cannibals, builders of the finest vessels in the Pacific, but not great sailors.\u201d Today, Fijians aren\u2019t known for eating their neighbours in Tonga or Samoa, but for big smiles and a rich culture infused with mythology and folklore. Their prowess at fire walking is no myth and you may get to see this extraordinary feat. Would you ever try it yourself?&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cruising%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While South Africans love cruising just for the sake of it, European and American clientele like to be occupied with port excursions and on-board entertainment. You may have thought cruising is about peace and quiet, but you can\u2019t help but watch every cabaret show, burn the midnight oil at blackjack tables and re-live your youth in the disco. Late night feasts expand the waistline, which grows ever bigger even though you visit the gym, dance with the hosts, sample Nordic walking and take lessons in yoga, pilates, salsa and golf. You\u2019ve put on a few kilos but don\u2019t make any excuses; you\u2019ve over-indulged and had a flipping good time doing it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Antarctica Photography Tips from Chris &amp; Monique Fallows&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Wake up early in the morning\u2014be first on deck&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Overexpose for the snow\/white conditions&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Use a polarizer&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Stay up late to get softer colours&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Protect your gear from sea spray&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;If you are going ashore, shorter lenses are more practical than big, long lenses: 16-35 mm, 70-200 mm, 100-400 mm&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Learn how to take star trail images because the night sky is incredible&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source - &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodtaste.co.za\/Subscribe-to-Good-Taste.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Good Taste&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.goodtaste.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/GT%20cover_0.jpg?itok=r9dSI9j8\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Good Taste&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9852\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/island-end-rainbow\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;The Island at the End of the Rainbow&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    The Island at the End of the Rainbow  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"The Island at the End of the Rainbow\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Likomo%20M.jpg?itok=jxcN8ZYA\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/island-end-rainbow\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/island-end-rainbow\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/island-end-rainbow&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Likomo%20M.jpg&amp;description=The Island at the End of the Rainbow\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/island-end-rainbow\" data-text=\"The Island at the End of the Rainbow\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/island-end-rainbow\" data-title=\"The Island at the End of the Rainbow\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Bridget Hilton Barber&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient rocks, creamy clouds, the sigh of the tide. There are only a handful of places to stay on Likoma Island and one of them is the very sexy Kaya Mawa.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were flying north east over Lake Malawi in a teeny-weeny little Cessna. Ahead of us was Tanzania, to the right, Mozambique, to the left, Zambia, and below and behind, Malawi. Not that we could really tell which was water, land or sky when suddenly, like magic, this rainbow stepped out and showed her gorgeous technicolour leg.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rainbow! I shouted, but the pilot just smiled.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the rainbow lay Likoma Island, a tiny, charming spot in the north east of Lake Malawi. We landed gently at the \u201caerodrome\u201d as they rather quaintly call it here, offloaded into the blazing heat and a 4x4 and went bumping off down a dirt track, past baobabs and palm trees, past goats and schools and slow-walking men with umbrellas \u2013 and ended up with the most incredible views of the lake.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient rocks, creamy clouds, the sigh of the tide. There are only a handful of places to stay on Likoma Island and one of them is the very sexy Kaya Mawa, a series of designer houses on the lakeshore. Kaya Mawa means \u2018maybe tomorrow\u2019 in the local Chichewe language, and was so named in the building of the lodge and the African-style logistics that came with getting building materials from a mainland to an island. For example, when will the bricks be arriving? Kaya mawa, maybe tomorrow. When will we get that last bag of cement? Kaya mawa, maybe tomorrow.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaya Mawa today is a fabulous place. So very fabulous it was voted one of the planet\u2019s 10 most romantic destinations by Cond\u00e9 Naste. The d\u00e9cor is amazing \u2013 driftwood, stone, local craft and fabrics. Each house overlooks the beach and lake, there\u2019s a gorgeous bar, lounge and restaurant with lake views, and a sensual little spa that is set on the edge of the beach, over the rocks.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby is Mango Drift, the beach side backpacker joint, named after the many, many mangoes trees of Likoma Island. Mango Drift has a simple reed-and-thatch bar-lounge that looks out across the lake of stars, and has a series of rustic stone chalets tucked into the hillside. A giant baobab guards the kitchen and is home to hundreds of very chatty yellow weavers.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango Drift is a cool hang out place, the kind you book for a couple of days and end up staying for a month. We met assorted people at Mango Drift \u2013 a teacher from Hillbrow, a retired journalist, a psychologist from Denmark, two young queens from Milan. We met a pilot called Jan Malan and a Dutch man called Bert who worked for a soft drink company called Squirt.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main activities on Likoma, wherever you stay, are water related. Snorkelling, scuba diving, kite surfing, swimming, sunset gazing\u2026. Both Kaya Mawa and Mango Drift organise all types of water action, and if you want to just kick back, relax with a book and a Carlsberg green (local beer, very good) that\u2019s also fine.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re after &lt;em&gt;la couleur locale&lt;\/em&gt;, there\u2019s a market in Likoma village during the week that sells fresh food and clothes and stuff; and there are plenty of bar lounges where you can hang out with the locals drinking ice cold beer and watch soccer on tiny television sets. The Malawian people are ridiculously friendly, polite and gentle. The country has long been branded \u201cthe warm heart of Africa\u201d and it\u2019s not just a tourism clich\u00e9.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visit a magic tree in the middle of the village, where a strangler fig has completely overtaken a baobab and its middle is hollowed out. And you can stroll to St Peters, which is the third largest cathedral in central Africa and was built in 1903. It\u2019s very well kept and still in use, and you can do a guided tour for a small fee. The cathedral was built by missionaries of course. &nbsp;Along with colonials, sailors, traders and war refugees, the history of this tiny little island off the coast of Mozambique is er, colourful to say the least.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;For more information visit:&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Malawian Tourism \u2013 &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.malawitourism.com\"&gt;www.malawitourism.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Kaya Mawa \u2013 &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.kayamawa.com\"&gt;www.kayamawa.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Mango Drift \u2013 &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.mangodrift.com\"&gt;www.mangodrift.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Ulendo Tours (for bookings, transfers and general info) \u2013 &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.ulendo.net\"&gt;www.ulendo.net&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Likomo%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

Then the car stops. On the right side, scattered amid the trees, lie dozens of livestock carcasses in various stages of decomposition. Some are bloated, which indicates a relative freshness, while others are nothing but a messy, dried out heap of leathery skin, hooves and bones.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the not so far distance, in between shrubbery so typical of this region, half a dozen white-backed vultures are ferociously feasting on the remains of a brown cow. As the birds bury their razor-sharp beaks into the decomposing flesh, pulling it out from underneath the hide, others are watching closely from the treetops. The vultures abruptly abort their luncheon when one of them spots the vehicle. One by one, they spread their enormous wings and join their mates in the trees.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWelcome to our vulture restaurant,\u201d says Hanri Ehlers, co-founder of Kanabo Conservation Link (KCL). Born and bred in South Africa, she heads the organisation\u2019s research camp at Thakadu. For the past few years, KCL has supported various conservation projects in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Other activities include finding ways to involve local communities in nature conservation initiatives, and raising awareness around the plight of various threatened and vulnerable species\u2014vultures included. The research camp at Thakadu and the vulture restaurant form part of that.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is not for everyone,\u201d says Ehlers with a smirk. \u201cIt looks a bit like a war zone at the moment. However, one must remember that vulture restaurants play a crucial role in vulture conservation.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past years, various studies have shown that African vulture populations have plummeted across the continent, particularly since the 1980s. While the figures vary, the overall message is clear: Vultures in Africa, like they are elsewhere, are under threat. According to a coalition of nature conservation organisations, including Raptors Botswana and the Endangered Wildlife Trust, the number of western African vulture species has dropped by as much as 97% over the past three decades. Their southern African counterparts have shown a decline of 50% to 60% in that very same period.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the culprits is diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory often used in the livestock sector to treat lameness and fever. The drug causes acute kidney failure in vultures, which they ingest after feeding on deceased cattle. Says Ehlers, \u201cWhile these birds are incredibly strong and are able to break down diseases, rabies and anthrax in their gut, they are also highly sensitive to, for instance, diclofenac.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prime example of the drug\u2019s destructive impact on the well-being of these carrion-loving raptors is India, which saw its vulture population drop from some 60 million to an estimated 40 000 within a decade. \u201cIn South Asia, the populations of the endemic Oriental white-backed, slender-billed and long-billed vultures have declined by more than 95% since the early 1990s,\u201d states a 2008 paper by the World Organisation for Animal Health.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Indian government and farmers were aware of the problem, no one realised what the reason was. In 2003, an international team of scientists came with a conclusive answer: diclofenac. Since then, India and various neighbouring countries including Nepal and Pakistan have banned the local manufacturing of the substance in livestock.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BirdLife International\u2019s African branch estimates that diclofenac is used in over a dozen African countries. It is, however, uncertain to which extent. This is where the KCL vulture restaurant comes in, Ehlers explains: \u201cThe carcasses we give them are donated by local farmers from the Ghanzi region and Kentrek Feedlot. These are free from diclofenac and other substances that are lethal to vultures.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds that the initiative has another benefit: \u201cIt enables scientists and nature conservationists to study vultures in their natural habitat. We need to know more about vultures in order to be able to protect them.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 270 kilometres southeast from Thakadu, near the dusty Kalahari town of Kang, Beckie Garbett from Raptors Botswana has her eyes firmly locked on a handful of circling vulture silhouettes. Using the thermals, the birds effortlessly hover through the sky, their wings outstretched and their heads aimed at the ground.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garbett has been studying Botswana\u2019s vultures for the past year, with a strong focus on the lappet-faced species. With a wingspan of up to 3m, it\u2019s one of the largest vultures in southern Africa. It is also one of the most vulnerable: BirdLife International estimates the population of the lappet-faced vulture at 5 700 mature adults. This is the lowest out of all southern African vulture species.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the birds\u2019 conservation status, flight patterns and nesting behaviours as well as threats and survival rates, Garbett hopes to get better insight into the animals\u2019 general ecology. This data is crucial to the development of much-needed protection strategies.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular vulture captures, aimed at any species, form a central part of Garbett\u2019s research. The birds are caught by using a net and bait. \u201cAfter drawing some blood, taking a feather and giving them a wing tag, we release them,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe procedure takes three minutes and is painless.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A select few birds are fitted with a GPS transmitter the size of a small mobile phone. \u201cThese devices enable us to monitor the vulture\u2019s movements,\u201d Garbett says. \u201cOver two hours or so, the transmitter gives us the location of the animal. We have, for instance, found out that lappets can cover 800km per day\u2014we didn\u2019t know that before.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While diclofenac is a key threat to vultures, poisoning is a much bigger concern, she notes. \u201cSome farmers revert to poisoning of deceased livestock to keep large predators, such as cheetah, at bay. In the process, they end up accidentally poisoning vultures because they feed off these carcasses,\u201d Garbett explains, nothing that Botswana\u2019s national parks are not hermetically fenced off as in South Africa. This results in incidental wildlife\u2013human conflict.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe upside is that farmers are approachable and willing to listen to us, as they tend to like the vultures. The birds, after all, clean up dead animals and prevent the spread of disease. Most farmers don\u2019t realise that what they are doing is hurting the birds.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poachers are a much bigger concern, Garbett says. \u201cThey poison because they deliberately want to kill vultures, to protect themselves and their illegal activity. Poachers are afraid that the birds\u2019 circling in the sky, after they have killed something, draws the attention of anti-poaching patrols. Sometimes there can be 200 vultures in the sky after something has died.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest poisoning episodes ever recorded dates back to July 2013, when elephant poachers deliberately poisoned some hundreds of vultures in the Namibia\u2013Botswana border region north of the Caprivi Strip. An estimated 700 birds died after feeding on one single elephant carcass laced with, most likely, carbofuran. Marketed as Furadan and Curater, this agricultural substance is considered one of the most toxic carbamate pesticides on the market.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garbett\u2019s own research has been affected by poisoning. \u201cThree of the 14 lappet-faced vultures we fitted with GPS transmitters have died as a result of it,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce a transmitter stops moving and gives us the same location day after day, we know we have a problem.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While poisoning by poachers is a huge problem, it\u2019s difficult to give an idea of the real scope, Garbett says: \u201cThe southern African region is so vast. There could be a hundred percent more poisoning episodes than we know about, simply because we can\u2019t get to them.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third important threat are the traditional healers. \u201cVulture bones allegedly give someone clairvoyant powers. In Botswana it is not such a big problem, but it is in South Africa and western Africa,\u201d Garbett says. She stresses that this doesn\u2019t mean Botswanan vultures are safe from sangomas. \u201cLappets can, after all, fly 800km per day. This makes them vulnerable elsewhere, even if they are safe in Botswana.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why save vultures?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting vultures is important\u2014for the birds, people and even the economy. Take the Indian vulture crisis: As the vulture population in India got wiped out, the prevalence of human and animal rabies and other diseases increased. Researcher Anil Markandya estimates the costs of the Indian vulture crisis at $34 billion (about R396 billion) as a result of up to 48 800 additional rabies deaths.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feathery facts&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Of the total 23 vulture species in the world, 11 are endemic to Africa and 14 are considered vulnerable, threatened or endangered.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Of the nine species in South Africa, seven are facing a certain degree of threat of extinction. The Egyptian vulture is one of two bird species in South Africa listed as \u2018regionally extinct\u2019.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 A group of vultures is called a \u2018kettle\u2019 when in flight; a \u2018wake\u2019 when feeding on a carcass; and \u2018committee\u2019, \u2018volt\u2019 or \u2018venue\u2019 when resting in trees.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Many vultures have bare necks and heads, preventing the bacteria of rotting flesh to stick to their feathers and cause infections. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The highest vulture flight recorded was by a R\u00fcppell\u2019s vulture in 1973. The bird was allegedly spotted from a plane at 37 000 feet (about 11 200m) above sea level\u2014higher than Mount Everest (8 848m).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The diet of bearded vultures (lammergeiers) consists of 70% to 90% bone and marrow. Stomach acid with a pH of 1 allows them to do so. (Human stomach acid has a pH of 1.5 to 3.)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/IE%20Cover.jpg?itok=zEES3iR9\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;The Intrepid explorer&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9929\" class=\"publisher-1340 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/5-star-luxury\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;5 Star Luxury &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    5 Star Luxury   &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"5 Star Luxury \" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/wild_magazine.htm' target='_blank' style='background-color: #b7cb35' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wild.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20Kruger.jpg?itok=J1Ayc5eM\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/5-star-luxury\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/5-star-luxury\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/5-star-luxury&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20Kruger.jpg&amp;description=5 Star Luxury \" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/5-star-luxury\" data-text=\"5 Star Luxury \" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/5-star-luxury\" data-title=\"5 Star Luxury \"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;By Wild editor Romi Boom&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was mid-afternoon and hot as a furnace. The elephant herd was slowly moving toward us, grazing amongst the reeds of the Sabie River. There were babies everywhere, unafraid of tumbling down the river bank. We couldn't hear them, way down below us, but we had a prime lookout. We could see perfectly how the little ones would get distracted, lag behind, then run on wobbly legs to catch up with their older siblings, moms and aunts.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wildlife spectacle, from the cool bliss of our private plunge pool. The best tickets in the house! We were at Narina Lodge, sheltered by century-old trees, in one of only nine suites, which are connected by wooden walkways. We might as well have been in a treehouse and could have been as Narina, one of the private concessions in Kruger National Park, and its sister establishment, Tinga Lodge, do in fact offer guests the option of a luxurious treehouse stay, unique in the Kruger gamut of experiences.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bush bedrooms go, it doesn't get any more romantic than Tinyeleti treehouse (meaning \u201cmany stars\u201d). A happy camper, I have slept countless nights under the Milky Way and shooting stars, but the securely constructed platform, with all the creature comforts you could wish for, simply blew my mind. Completely disconnected from other people, any wildlife enthusiast will be impressed by this way of immersing yourself in the bush as you sit high above the ground and watch the animals quenching their thirst from the river.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kruger%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 50m2 deck can accommodate four people, and children are welcome. Guests arrive at sunset, to spend the dusk hours enjoying a picnic dinner by the glow of lanterns. When night falls, you blend with the wild animals, armed only with a torch and a radio for communication with your field guide. Absolute peace, except for your own excited heartbeat, until you are collected the next morning.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safari luxury is synonymous with teak floorboards, dreamy mosquito nets, slipper baths, outdoor showers, raised timber walkways and ancient jackalberry trees. Kruger's private concessions, the \"Golden Kudus\", also offer the opportunity to venture off-road. This does not entail breaking the rules, but it allows rangers the leeway to improvise, for example to enjoy sightings from really close. If you have a particular tick on your wishlist, as I did, this is your best chance of success, as the rangers are in constant communication with each other and have intimate knowledge of animal movements on the concession.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when I explained to our guide at Lukimbi Safari Lodge that I had been looking for wild dogs for more than a decade, Chris was all ears. He hadn't seen them for weeks, he confessed, but would keep his ear to the ground. On our afternoon game drive, we hit the jackpot: a group of at least 10 dogs, resting right alongside the road, playing and posing for photographs in the golden twilight. My cup of contentment spilled over.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kruger%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lukimbi is situated in the very accessible southern section of Kruger, and about 50 per cent of the guests are South African. For me it proved a very lucky destination indeed. Earlier that day, a few hundred metres before we arrived at the lodge, a sexy leopard was sprawled in a marula tree, affording us a private sighting at close range overhead. Krrrrr went my camera\u2019s motor drive, and each image was worthy of a calendar. Thirty minutes later, at check in just before lunch, we shared our good luck with management and showed off the photos. \"That's Nula,\" we heard, and immediately a safari vehicle was commandeered for some overseas guests, in the hope that the precious Nula would not have left her perch, despite having two cubs nearby.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bounded by three major river systems, the extensive 15 000 hectare area offers a diverse array of habitats. On our morning game drive, there were rhino everywhere, both white and black, and three cheetah wannabe models. Imagine a scene in which two of the most endangered species on Earth stand cheek by jowl. Talk of good karma!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this class of accommodation, private decks with riverside views are par for the course. An unusual setting is Camp Shawu, which overlooks Mpanamana Dam. A satellite of Shishangeni Private Lodge, Camp Shawu was named after the famous tusker. It accommodates only 10 guests in five outsize tented suites, constructed around buffalo-dung walls. Hippo pods have colonised the dam and, believe me, they make an incessant and eventually exasperating racket as they claim their territory. The payoff is that from your ringside seat you'll shoot that iconic photo of a yawning hippo, while waiting for predators and prey to come to you.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kruger%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shishangeni's second intimate retreat is Camp Shonga in the foothills of the Lebombo Mountains, near the Mozambican border. The camp has minimal impact on the surrounding habitat and blends so well with the bushveld that you would not guess it was there until you stumbled upon it. This is how the wilderness must have seemed to the explorers of yesteryear.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's the spirit of ancient Africa that you're hoping to find, look no further than Imbali Safari Lodge, built on the site of a 400-year-old Tsonga settlement. The soil has yielded evidence of an ancient culture and artefacts such as clay pots, bone tools and grinding stones are on display. Imbali's 12 suites, with either a private spa or plunge pool in a riverine forest, cosy up to a canopy of jackalberry and tamboti trees overlooking the seasonal Nwaswitsontso River.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imbali is situated on Mluwati Concession, one of Kruger's first private concessions, and has been dedicated to the sustainability of this pristine wilderness from the start. Together with Hoyo Hoyo Safari Lodge, with its ethnic theme, and Hamiltons Tented Camp, which recreates the Out of Africa style, Imbali is all about indulgence amidst the sounds and smells of the bush. The lodges are located on an ancient elephant route, so imagine our double delight at breakfast when first we watched a relaxed rhino drinking at the waterhole on the far side of the river, followed by a breeding herd of ellies. Does a safari get any better?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Light Footprint&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger's luxury concessions have been hugely effective in generating revenue and support for conservation. In line with the objectives of sustainable ecotourism, the lodges touch the earth lightly and minimise their footprint through a philosophy of \u201cfewer beds in larger areas\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trip Planner&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drive from Johannesburg to Kruger's concessions takes about five hours.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tinga and Narina Lodges&lt;\/strong&gt; are accessed from Paul Kruger gate. Narina is 8km from the gate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lionsands.com\"&gt;www.lionsands.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lukimbi Safari Lodge&lt;\/strong&gt; is 26km from Malelane Gate, on the Crocodile River road. It accommodates 32 people, making it a popular wedding and function destination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lukimbi.com\"&gt;www.lukimbi.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shishangeni Private Lodge&lt;\/strong&gt; is about 15km from Crocodile Bridge gate. Guests are transferred from the lodge to Camp Shonga and Camp Shawu. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.shishangeni.com\"&gt;www.shishangeni.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imbali Safari Lodge&lt;\/strong&gt; is 42km from the Orpen Gate. &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.imbali.com\"&gt;www.imbali.com&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.hamiltonstentedcamp.co.za\"&gt;www.hamiltonstentedcamp.co.za&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.hoyohoyo.com\"&gt;www.hoyohoyo.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/blog.htm?action=view-post&amp;id=4662\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wild magazine&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3292\"&gt;Kruger National Park (South and Central)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/wild_magazine.htm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/wild3%20winter2015_med_300x2000q100.jpg?itok=AexQqRii\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Wild&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;Article provided from WILD - Wildlife, Environment and Travel Magazine.&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9606\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/opening-blue-door\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Opening the Blue Door\t&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Opening the Blue Door\t  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Opening the Blue Door\t\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Tunis%20MAIN%20Roman%20Baths.jpg?itok=t61BUTXu\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opening-blue-door\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opening-blue-door\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opening-blue-door&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Tunis%20MAIN%20Roman%20Baths.jpg&amp;description=Opening the Blue Door\t\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opening-blue-door\" data-text=\"Opening the Blue Door\t\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opening-blue-door\" data-title=\"Opening the Blue Door\t\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jun 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Lize de Kock&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history and scenery around Tunis is both exotic and exciting. Not only does it make for a break full of daydreams and gastronomic feasts, but there is also much to learn from the richness of culture that the city has absorbed through the ages.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a carefree blue, the blue of Tunis, Tunisia\u2019s capital city. The kind of blue that makes me draw lots of fresh sea air into my lungs and breathe out everyday worries onto the breeze.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After just a few hours in Sidi Bou Said I feel like I have been on holiday for weeks. Surely it must be those blue doors, set off against whitewashed walls with wrought iron balconies and mirrored in the African sky above and the Mediterranean Sea beyond.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tunis%202%20Old%20and%20new.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fellow travellers and I try to avoid the cruise ship masses that have descended on this little town outside Tunis today. Since it can become a bit of a tourist trap, it is worth seeking out the shops in the side streets where souvenir prices can be as much as three times less than right at the bus stop and around the main areas of interest.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A kaleidoscope of tiles and scenery&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ceramics are the order of the day at the souqs. It reminds me of what is on offer in Morocco, although the colours and designs are softer, rounder; more peaceful. The same is true of the people. They are gentle and kind, with more than an earful of travel advice and historical insights for those who are keen to listen.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tunis%203%20Carthage.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We walk along the cobbled streets and spot a yellow door in between all the blue ones. Our curiosity reveals a charming hotel, complete with Phoenician mosaics and a typical blue door leading into each room. The receptionist tells us that Hotel Sidi Boufares used to be a Sufi school, no wonder then that the serene atmosphere has us in relax mode.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In typical tourist style we click away on our cameras and keep walking until we find a sheesha bar with a view of the foothills of the Atlas Mountains on the other side of the bay. Here travellers and locals are lazing about on the cushions, enjoying their hubbly-bubbly pipes in the sunshine. The smell of flavoured tobacco lingers in the air. We order almond tea, which arrives in tiny glasses and tastes just like the sickly sweet Moroccan mint variety. The almonds are floating on top with a few fresh mint leaves. It is not my favourite but in the spirit of this day I enjoy it immensely.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tunis%204%20Tunisia%20074.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here we take a taxi to the ruins of Carthage. Before I get in the car a local lady lures me into her shop with some jasmine oil. I buy a hand made perfume bottle to save the oil in - for those days when I want to smell like the white flowers and open the blue door in my mind.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Walking in the footsteps of Hannibal&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our way we pass several ancient looking walls as well as the ruins of a palace. In between these remains stand luxurious modern villas, which confirm that the rich still dwell here. On top of this hill called Byrsa, once stood the beautiful city Carthage. The infamous war leader Hannibal called it home. I think of all the bloodshed that was staged here and the wind sends an extra chill down my spine.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to legend Carthage was founded in 8 BC by the Phoenicians under Queen Dido. It became a rich and enviable sea port that was eventually destroyed by the Romans because they saw it as a threat to their regional power.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tunis%205%20View.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view from here is exquisite: lush green, a wide sea and inky mountains beyond. Today the city of Tunis decorates the natural backdrop. I live a thousand lives as I take in this important historical site. All the legends become real to me now.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historians know little about the original city because most of the culture and records were destroyed during this time. No wonder most of the stories about Carthage and Hannibal are based on legends.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Romans eventually reconstructed the city, which became one of the largest and most influential cities around the Mediterranean. Even when Rome came to a fall in the 5th century, Carthage prospered.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We visit the Antoinine Thermal baths, a short drive from the ruins of the original city. It is situated right on the shore and from the ruins it is clear that it was a great and royal structure. I later read that these Roman baths were one of the largest built under the rule of the Roman Empire.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tunis%206%20Tunisia%20155.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many wars, Carthage was only completely destroyed when the Arabs arrived and beheaded all the Roman statues. What the vandals didn\u2019t destroy, says our guide, the Arabs did when they finally took control of the area.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An exotic city borne from history&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of building materials in the vicinity meant that the ruins were used to build new cities in the area such as Tunis. So although the foundations of the Phoenician as well as the Roman cities are still visible, most of the rest has been scavenged.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Carthage is a suburb of Tunis. During the Summer Festival, the reconstructed Roman theatre is still used for shows.

It seems that nothing and everything has changed here in Carthage.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the serenity of Sidi Bou Said and the richness of history and culture in Carthage, our stomachs are calling us back to reality. Our taxi driver suggests dinner in La Marsa or La Goulette. Do we feel like seafood or Italian?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We opt for a seafood restaurant just off the beach in the La Goulette area. The waiter brings a platter of fresh whole fish for us to choose from and we end up with a feast of mussels, prawns and fish on our table, served with thin fries, the way the French do it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night I sleep well for the first time in weeks and wake up refreshed, ready for a breakfast of fresh fruit and almond tea as my daydreams float away on the breeze.

Objective: make it possible again for elephants to walk from Addo to the Garden Route without any obstacle. In order to see this dream come true, the organisation puts efforts in the development of ecological corridors between different protected areas by finding private investors, getting in touch with local farmers and managing concerned lands.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Great%20Corridor%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eden to Addo Great Corridor Hike stretches all along the areas Eden to Addo has interest in, from the Garden of Eden to Addo Elephant National Park, and including Tsitsikamma National Park and the Baviaanskloof World Heritage Site. Between these protected areas, you will have the opportunity to hike through beautiful private landscapes, which are exclusive to Eden to Addo hikes.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Great%20Corridor%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a journey takes you on a more than 400km hike, achieved within 20 days of self-envelopment in nature. Going through five of South Africa\u2019s seven biomes (forest, fynbos, succulent karoo, nama karoo and thicket), thousands of floral species and following leopard, bush buck or red hartebeest\u2019s spoors, our hike invites you in the most bio-diverse area on the planet.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Great%20Corridor%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will share the hike with 20 other passionate hikers, with an average age of 55; our all-time dean was 70, and outran us all! The hike is demanding, but passion and training will make it easy to you. Our guides will show you the best paths and tell you about the work we do in the very areas you hike in. Some hikers enjoy the adventure so much they come back!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Great%20Corridor%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the daily hike, relax yourself in the already-mounted camp thanks to our logistics team. Take your shoes off, meet people and share delicious meals around a campfire or under the simple but magnificent sky without any light pollution.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Great%20Corridor%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of a hike is R24,000, directly funding Eden to Addo\u2019s heavy work on Eastern Cape\u2019s biodiversity. Tents and sleeping bags are carried for you so that you can pack only the essential during the day. Meals are provided. The Great Corridor Hike 2015 will take place from 3rd to 23rd of September, and is limited to 20 hikers.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hiking, slackpacking, 400 to 450km&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website:&lt;\/strong&gt; edentoaddo.co.za&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone:&lt;\/strong&gt; 044 533 1627&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"mailto:admin@edentoaddo.co.za\"&gt;admin@edentoaddo.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9926\" class=\"publisher-1785 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/rock-ages\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;The Rock of Ages&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    The Rock of Ages  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"The Rock of Ages\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.zigzag.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/zigzag_0.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20Cave%20Rock.jpg?itok=lTkdDxWI\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rock-ages\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rock-ages\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rock-ages&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20Cave%20Rock.jpg&amp;description=The Rock of Ages\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rock-ages\" data-text=\"The Rock of Ages\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rock-ages\" data-title=\"The Rock of Ages\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;May 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Will Bendix, pics Greg Ewing&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wall lies in a crumpled heap on the sand, a blanket of brick and cement folded over the crushed words that used to adorn its surface: \u201cIf you don\u2019t live here, don\u2019t surf here.\u201d A trail of rubble leaks down the beach on to the foot of the tidal pool that has framed the coveted waves of Cave Rock for decades.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know Cave Rock. The Rock. South Africa\u2019s answer to Backdoor Pipe. Its wide-open tubes and perfect backdrop made it the poster child for surfing magazines the world over. Lavish spreads were dedicated to its carnivorous barrels with the pro of the day stuffed deep inside its belly. But beyond the sheet of sandstone reef and lush green hill that has framed so many of those perfect photo opportunities lies a very different picture.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave Rock sits on the Bluff, a finger of land that juts out into the Indian Ocean before curving abruptly into the deep bay that makes up Durban. The British immediately recognized the strategic potential of this natural harbor when, it\u2019s claimed, they were given the land by Shaka in 1824. Today it is the largest port in southern Africa and the bustling harbour drives a wedge between the Bluff and the gentrified suburbs of Durban proper. On the leeward side are the \u201ctownies\u201d or \u201ctown clowns\u201d as Bluff surfers have long called locals from the stretch of piers that dot Durban\u2019s beaches. And on the other side, facing directly into the brunt of the southwesterly swells are the surfers who hail, as the saying goes, \u201cRough \u2018n tough and from the Bluff\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Bluff\u2019s always been the wrong side of the tracks,\u201d says lifelong local, Ross Solomon. \u201cThe guys grow up a bit harder here. A lot of the older guys were total nutcases back in the day. Localism was really heavy back then and they demanded respect. This has just been passed on from generation to generation. I think the waves we have, this place\u2026it breeds these extreme personalities.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;37-year-old Solomon lives in a modest cottage on the beach with his wife, child, a few surfboards and their dog. He works as a freelance building contractor, taking jobs mostly overseas where the money is good and the schedule allows him to be home for winter to surf Cave Rock without distraction. He never got shoved in \u2018the hole\u2019 when he was younger, an initiation rite where older locals would catch, strip and bury a grommet in the sand and then \u201cpiss and shit and do whatever vile things they could think of with your head\u201d. But he has paid his dues and nowadays enjoys his share of set waves out front.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kay or two inland from the honey-coloured beach where Solomon spent his youth is a sprawling artery of factories and railway lines, oil refineries and smokestacks that power the industrial heart of Durban. And the manpower to run this colossus has historically come from the Bluff.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThere are a lot of railway houses just over the hill and there was always a strong blue collar community on the Bluff,\u201d says Solomon. \u201cThere still is, and a lot of guys who surfed came from this background too.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Durban boomed in the middle of the 20th century, the Bluff evolved from a quiet residential outpost to include a railway village servicing the port and the whaling station located on its northern flank. Huge sperm whales were slaughtered and hoisted up the beach along the concrete slipways well into the 1970s. Around the same time, across the bloodstained channel, the legendary Bay of Plenty was laying the blueprint for professional surfing in South Africa. Future world champions like Shaun Tomson and later Martin Potter were bred in the shadow of the piers where competitiveness was encouraged and rewarded. But on the other side of the harbour, the Bluff was breeding the archetypal anti-hero. The isolation and raw power of the waves, along with its working class roots, nurtured a tight-knit crew where localism became the norm. Surfing contests or hanging out in town was deemed uncool at best, and a betrayal at worst.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey were town clowns, and you just did not want to be associated with them in any way,\u201d recalls Clyde Martin, who grew up surfing the Bluff\u2019s most notorious peak, Garvies, during the early 1980s.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Cave Rock has always taken centre stage, the Bluff is home to a series of formidable waves that sit shoulder-to-shoulder, much like the North Shore. The most well known of these is Cave Rock and then Garvies, with Ansteys \u2013 or \u2018Corner\u2019 \u2013 wedged in the middle.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;\u201cThe first locals at Garvies were a pretty core bunch of guys. And then there were the guys at Corner, we used to call them the \u2018Corner Skates\u2019,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThey used to hang out on the grass by the toilets and smoke joints and pop Mandrax tablets. They were just a mean fucking bunch of guys that used to hang out there. They wouldn\u2019t feel anything to get into a fight. At Garvies it was the same and that\u2019s just what we learnt from day one. There was a rivalry between Ansteys and Garvies as well, a huge rivalry, although if there was any ever problem from the outside, we\u2019d all stick together.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin is blunt when asked where the fierce territorialism came from. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea. It\u2019s just something we grew up with,\u201d he replies. \u201cBut I do know for a fact that my group of locals, we took the localism thing to another level completely. We pushed it way out of control.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recalls a few facebrick duplexes that still line the dunes at Garvies, the last one standing next to the carpark. \u201cOriginally there were going to be 21 of those houses going right down the beach towards Cave Rock,\u201d he says. \u201cThings started to get really gnarly when they started to build those houses. I was still in high school and we decided that we just couldn\u2019t have this at our beach and we literally stopped them building those houses. Every single night we\u2019d go in and rip all the stuff out. We\u2019d saw out the rafters and make bonfires with the wood. They\u2019d get security guards and we\u2019d beat the security guards up and when they got to the last house, the one in the carpark, the guy behind the development decided he just couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Martin finished school, his crew owned the beach, but South Africa was in a state of emergency. Everyone was soon called up for compulsory military service. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how heavy the situation in the country was,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I finished the army in 1986, a lot of my friends worked for private security companies and then we were all pretty much armed and dangerous. People would come to the beach with shotguns and 9 mils and baseball bats and just cause shit. That\u2019s when Garvies was just absolutely out of bounds.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this stage the Bluff\u2019s reputation preceded itself and anyone coming from the outside knew to tread very lightly. Yet, somehow, Cave Rock avoided the brunt of this vicious closed-door policy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe locals at Garvies were always pretty gnarly, and at Ansteys. But the Rock was different,\u201d says Martin. \u201cThe road goes right past the Rock and there were always town guys out, so it was never as localised as Corner and definitely not as localised as Garvies. They\u2019d come to the Rock, surf the Rock and they\u2019d go. It was kinda just accepted.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin and friends would even begrudgingly watch the \u2018townies\u2019 trade barrels with standout locals like Gavin Spowart and Rudy Palmboom at the end of the road. \u201cWe just sat there and bit our lips going, \u2018These guys are good\u2019. You learn from watching better surfers. And we learnt a lot.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This didn\u2019t stop them, however, from going out on \u201cbashes\u201d where they\u2019d load into a couple of VW kombis with baseball bats on the weekend and head into town and look for fights.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it was competitive surfing that changed the course of Martin\u2019s life.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI was in my twenties when I realised surfing was a way of getting out of the downward spiral I saw all my other friends in \u2013 the drugs and the violence and the fighting. Some of those people just never got out of that. I saw surfing as an excuse to get off the Bluff in a way, and at the time there was a nice, healthy competitive scene in South Africa.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin began competing on the ASP, did well, and later found himself in Europe where he was offered the job as Director of ASP Europe - a position he held for nearly 15 years after he relocated to Spain. Nowadays he is candidly trying to come to terms with his roots and \u201cthe stupid shit we did\u201d.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI never really took drugs, but if you didn\u2019t take drugs or drink or fight, you didn\u2019t fit in, so you were almost forced into that lifestyle on the Bluff,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it was.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudy Palmboom has different recollections. At 54 years of age Palmboom is built like a sailor, barrel chested with arms like two oars. To witness him surf Cave Rock is to watch an intimate dance that has been refined over decades of devotion to this stretch of reef. Like Lopez and Pipeline, he is synonymous with the wave and can still be found fading deep, snapping under the lip and getting more tube time than most pros half his age.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;\u201cI was oblivious to heavy violence, but there were definitely a few self-inflicted fatalities due to drugs and alcohol,\u201d he recalls of the time.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmboom\u2019s memory of localism is far more amicable. Policing the lineup was deemed necessary and transgressors were dealt with, preferably in a non-violent way, but if you minded your manners and paid your dues, you\u2019d be okay.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cCave Rock\u2019s similarity to Backdoor Pipe always attracted lots of visiting surfers and foreign pros,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially the pros, when they would escape the contest scene at the Gunston 500 to come sample the Rock. It was also a cool show for the Bluff locals.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palmboom revelled in the competitive rivalry that developed between the Cave Rock locals and visitors. Contests helped break the ice and laid the foundation for competitive friendships. His fondest memory remains a week in the early winter of 1978. \u201cIt was six to eight foot and on fire for a solid week, just barrel after barrel. It was cool surfing the whole swell with Shaun Tomson, who was training for Hawaii at the time.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the more localised corners of the Bluff, Palmboom says the heaviest threat at Cave Rock has always come from the waves. Swells generated by the Roaring Forties strike Cape Town with unimpeded force. As they scrape up the east coast of South Africa they decay in size but grow in power. The shallow reef that fringes the tidal pool sucks up these long period swells from deep water and folds them into concrete-lipped tubes.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust the paddle out through the impact zone on low tide is sketchy at best,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it\u2019s six foot plus, the wave is purely barrel and breaks below sea level.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any wave of this magnitude, there are consequences. There have been fatalities, severe injuries and countless near-death experiences. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIf you surf out here, it\u2019s just a matter of time. You\u2019re going to get beaten properly,\u201d says Ricky Basnett. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to Hawaii, the power behind it. When the Rock is on, it rivals anything in that league.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basnett grew up with a bird\u2019s eye view of the wave from his family home on the hill. He admits he had it easy compared to the generations before him but still took a lot of flak from both sides when he started to compete at an early age. \u201cIt was hard because town always had its own clique, so you were always an outcast,\u201d he says. \u201cIt made you surf a hell of a lot better though, competing against the town guys.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cave%20Rock%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before Basnett qualified for the World Tour in 2006 he had a constant procession of fellow pros coming to stay with him every winter during the Mr Price Pro. Since the contest moved to Ballito an hour north, however, the stream of celebs coming to surf Cave Rock has dried up, ending a decades-long tradition that started when the event was still the Gunston 500. Which suits Basnett just fine. \u201cI get to surf Cave Rock with fewer pros out now,\u201d he laughs. \u201cAnd the Rock will always be the Rock.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out the crumpled wall with its cautionary message that lies slumped on the sand. \u201cThe Bluff is not really what it used to be localism-wise. But it still garners that respect because of the people who surf here. It\u2019s a weird place. You drive through this shitty industrial area, past the matchbox houses, and then you\u2019re on Marine Drive and you see mansions the size of those in Orange County. Rich, poor, there\u2019s all kinds of people here. But it doesn\u2019t matter which side you\u2019re from, people here are proud to be from the Bluff.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.zigzag.co.za\/magazine\/subscribe\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Source: Zigzag Surfing Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.zigzag.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Cover_New.jpg?itok=k_AzF9BJ\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;ZigZag&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9944\" class=\"publisher-4123 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/winners-0\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;The Winners&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    The Winners  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"The Winners\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #09906f' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/A%202015%20logo%20s.jpg\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M_NJA2015%202.jpg?itok=v0JeiF-A\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/winners-0\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/winners-0\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/winners-0&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M_NJA2015%202.jpg&amp;description=The Winners\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/winners-0\" data-text=\"The Winners\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/winners-0\" data-title=\"The Winners\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;May 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;After another year of thrilling adventures, we are proud to announce that the title of Nightjar Adventurer 2015 was awarded to Bernie Theron for his solo unsupported trek across Iceland.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of future expeditions, Bernie received a MSR Superfly stove, a PowerMonkey Classic, a PowerMonkey Explorer, a PowerTraveller PowerChimp, and a R2 000 Adventure Voucher from Cape Union Mart.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/0%20BernieTheron.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"486\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of Readers\u2019 Choice went to Cameron Bellamy for his part in the Guinness World Record fastest row across the Indian Ocean.

They thrilled the audience with personal memories from their expeditions, while the setting at the Cape Union Mart Canal Walk Adventure Centre made the perfect adventurous backdrop.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, we are amazed by the achievements of South African adventurers, the miles they\u2019ve trekked and the heights they\u2019ve conquered. To say that this year was no exception would be an understatement. The determination and courage displayed has been beyond inspirational, and we wait with bated breath to see what our local adventurers will come up with next.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the year, we feel that there has been a beautiful expression of the spirit that we hope to embody as a nation. A spirit that looks forward with determination and perseveres through hardship to achieve our aspirations. Each of the expeditions nominated this year faced significant challenges, and rose to them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/0%20Cameron%20Bellamy.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"485\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you do when you spend a year planning an expedition to travel halfway around the world and trek across a continent, and your funding and your partner disappear with mere months to go?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/kai-fitchen-kape-atacama\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ask Kai Fitchen&lt;\/a&gt;.

The next time you are stuck in a rut, glance out a window and look to the horizon. Somewhere between here and there, resting on a ledge or riding a wave, diving in or climbing up, is a fellow South African - buckling down, moving forwards. As our adventurers have told us numerous times, the most important thing is believing in yourself, and if they can do it, so can you.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/0%20NJA2015%20Contenders.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"353\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/A%202015%20logo%20s_0.jpg?itok=QMKoQFTc\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Adventurer 2015&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9928\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/last-chance-visit-oranjezicht-city-farms-market-villa-zille\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Last chance to visit Oranjezicht City Farm&#039;s Market at Villa Zille&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Last chance to visit Oranjezicht City Farm&#039;s Market at Villa Zille  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Last chance to visit Oranjezicht City Farm&#039;s Market at Villa Zille\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20OZCF.jpg?itok=ezq4l7LV\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/last-chance-visit-oranjezicht-city-farms-market-villa-zille\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/last-chance-visit-oranjezicht-city-farms-market-villa-zille\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/last-chance-visit-oranjezicht-city-farms-market-villa-zille&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20OZCF.jpg&amp;description=Last chance to visit Oranjezicht City Farm's Market at Villa Zille\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/last-chance-visit-oranjezicht-city-farms-market-villa-zille\" data-text=\"Last chance to visit Oranjezicht City Farm's Market at Villa Zille\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/last-chance-visit-oranjezicht-city-farms-market-villa-zille\" data-title=\"Last chance to visit Oranjezicht City Farm's Market at Villa Zille\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;May 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Fiona McIntosh, pics Shaen Adey, Elsje Schoeman and supplied&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Saturday is the last chance to visit the Oranjezicht City Farm Market at Villa Zille before the market day relocates to its winter premises at Granger Bay in the V&amp;A Waterfront.

But the new location is also an opportunity to find additional partners and new infrastructure that will help increase the availability of fresh, healthy, locally-grown produce for City Bowl residents and to provide more support for the local small-scale organic farmers that supply the market.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Granger Bay site is near The Lookout event venue. A tented precinct for the market will be created for the winter, providing a cosy atmosphere, easy access, great views, protection from inclement weather and a safe, child-friendly set-up. There will be affordable parking for more than two hundred cars, with plenty of overflow parking in the area.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/OZCF%204_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 60 traders and approximately 2 500 visitors every Saturday, Market Day has a direct economic impact estimated in excess of R25 million per annum, supporting nearly 200 jobs and 75 entrepreneurial small businesses including local farms.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trading every Saturday from 9am \u2013 2pm, the market is a true farmer\u2019s market with a majority of the offering being fresh, locally-grown vegetables, fruit, herbs and other ingredients and pantry items such as bread, cheese, nuts, olive oil, spices, yoghurt, honey, ethically sourced meats, biltong, fish and even fresh oysters.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/OZCF%205_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is supplemented with artisanal food traders selling breakfast and lunch fare to eat at the market or for takeaway, as well as coffees, teas, juices and smoothies. Vegan, banting, gluten-free, sugar-free and other dietary preferences are catered for and you can also buy plants, compost and micro-green trays and bean sprout starter kits to create your own urban garden at home.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe Oranjezicht City Farm\u2019s Market Day is as much a connection for urban farmers to a local consumer as it is a great offering for Capetonians,\u201d says David Green, CEO of the V&amp;A Waterfront. \u201cBy supporting this initiative we are reaffirming our commitment to growing small business.

The star attraction of Prince Albert\u2019s new cultural tourism route, it is Ouma Maggie\u2019s job to help visitors bridge the gap between the town\u2019s better-known white settlement and the coloured community that in the 1960s was forcibly removed from Rooikamp in the centre of the town to North End, a purpose-built township.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ouma Maggie conducts business from her tiny bedroom, its teal-painted walls offering a backdrop as colourful as her stories. My concerns that she might feel exploited by the gawkers who crowd the room are brushed away.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018This is an important job,\u2019 she tells me earnestly. \u2018I tell them what the town used to look like, where the shops were and how people lived.\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually bedridden, she loves the company too.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018I enjoy the conversation. I ask the foreigners just as many questions as they ask me. We laugh a lot.\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she never learnt to read or write, Ouma Maggie is a talented herbalist (she offers to fix my childlessness with one of her special concoctions) and a gifted storyteller, though don\u2019t expect sugar coating: farm life was exceptionally tough on her sheep-shearer father and his children who were expected to plough and plant as four-year-olds.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Prince%20Albert%204%20Drum-Magazine-covers.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old Drum Magazine covers, taken by Jurgen Schadeberg, at the gallery. Photo by Jeanine Groenewald.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she tells stories about the farms, Prince Albert\u2019s now stilled water mills, the old tobacco factory where young women earned extra money rolling tobacco leaves and the butcher who also sold bread, her daughter, 71-year-old Bettie, bakes&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;roosterkoek&lt;\/em&gt;&nbsp;for visitors on a braai grid in the dusty yard.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next stop on the tour is a local tavern, then a nursery school, then back to \u2018white\u2019 Prince Albert to the few remaining buildings that were once part of Rooikamp. The cultural tour is the brainchild of local resident Anton Joubert, who has also developed the only integrated online booking system for a town in South Africa. At &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/paonline.biz\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paonline.biz&lt;\/a&gt; you can book and pay for accommodation, excursions and restaurants in the town before leaving home.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Prince Albert has a thriving tourist trade aided in part by its location at the foot of the magnificent Swartberg Pass and the preservation of its Victorian and Karoo-style architecture, residents like Anton and his wife Ellen are acutely aware of the need to keep the town\u2019s heart beating. The Karoo is littered with towns dead and dying, crippled by the decline in agriculture.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Part of the secret to our success,\u2019 says Ellen, \u2018is that we are still a working farming community; the town has a very rural feel.\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a town peopled with professors and experts in botany, anthropology, astronomy, gastronomy, art, filmmaking and photography who all contribute to the many enthralling tours and excursions the town has to offer. There are art, olive, book and film festivals; there is an R8 million theatre; there is a winter school for aspirant jewellers, artists, writers and chefs; and there are hundreds of acres of wide-open spaces to be explored by bike or on foot. Fresh produce is in abundance: export-quality figs, cheese, wine from four vineyards, extra virgin oil from three sizeable olive producers, and of course free-range Karoo lamb at prices so reasonable city folk have been known to ditch their luggage for an extra coolbox packed with chops.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Prince%20Albert%206%20Gays-Dairy-selection-of-cheeses.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gay\u2019s Dairy is renowned for its Guernsey milk and selection of cheeses. Photo by Jeanine Groenewald.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has managed to retain its rural charm, Prince Albert has a level of sophistication that puts urbanites at ease. There are more than half-a-dozen quality restaurants and caf\u00e9s, a wide range of accommodation options to suit all tastes and pockets and &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.showroomtheatre.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Showroom Theatre&lt;\/a&gt; attracts some of the country\u2019s best-known performing artists.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is partly because of the town\u2019s residential profile: large numbers of professionals from Cape Town, Johannesburg, the Eastern Cape and the UK have set up home here and they\u2019re not just retirees. The town\u2019s private school, Prince Albert College, follows the Cambridge international curriculum and is prized for its maths and science results.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no denying the town\u2019s natural attractions though, and it\u2019s these that draw the largest number of visitors: such as the ancient leiwater channels that carry water from the mountains to the town\u2019s gardens and orchards. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/gaysguernseydairy.yolasite.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Gay\u2019s Dairy &lt;\/a&gt;is a favourite; fill your own container with milk still warm from a Guernsey cow or get your children to help bottle-feed orphaned lambs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climbers, hikers and cyclists head for the russet-coloured mountains, wine lovers catch sunsets from rock perches above the valley floor, and for the more adventurous there is the descent into the valley of Die Hel, a 150-year-old farming settlement formally named Gamkaskloof, virtually cut off from the world until the 1960s when a steep switchback road was carved into the Swartberg.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source:&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.getaway.co.za\/travel-ideas\/destinations-travel-ideas\/guide-prince-albert\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;This article &lt;\/a&gt;originally appeared in the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.getaway.co.za\/magazine-issues\/october-2014\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;October 2014 issue of Getaway Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/6430\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Showroom Theatre&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3713\"&gt;Ou Tol Circuit Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3154\"&gt;Swartberg Pass MTB Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/776\"&gt;Swartberg Nature Reserve&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3975\"&gt;Swartberg Nature Reserve 4x4 Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2006\"&gt;Die Hel (Gamkaskloof)&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

It\u2019s this simple appeal that inspired Johannesburg resident, Mike Strauss, to undertake a solo journey on his faithful Vespa GTS 300 Super Sport all the way from SA to Milan, Italy.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strauss and \u2018Victoria\u2019 the Vespa set off on 1 May 2014 and rode straight into seven months of stunning encounters with nature, challenging roads and refreshing solitude. \u201cJust the idea of such a trip is astonishing to most, but Mike and his Vespa made it an epic reality,\u201d says Managing Director of Vespa SA, Andy Reid.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vespa spirit&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Strauss, one of the defining factors of the trip was the spirit of humanity as countless helping hands were selflessly extended to him throughout the journey. Starting with a send-off by the local Vespa community where about 60 riders turned up to accompany Strauss on the ride out of town. \u201cThis is where the spirit of Vespa really comes alive,\u201d says Reid. \u201cA Vespa gives the rider the opportunity to journey alone with only nature and the open road for company, but simultaneously brings the rider into the fold of a tight-knit community that shares a passion for riding.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the camaraderie with Vespa riders, Victoria gave Strauss the opportunity to meet interesting people across the continent. He was overwhelmed by the generosity of complete strangers who helped with repairs at no charge, offered him free lodging, or gave him and Victoria a hand in the middle of the night.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trusty steed&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to his departure, Strauss worked with engineers to modify Victoria to carry supplies and essentials for several months \u2013 weighing in at 50kg. Vespa SA Director, Louw du Toit, worked closely with Strauss to prepare his Vespa for the long journey and to give Strauss a working understanding of the mechanics involved in keeping Victoria going for the long haul \u2013 and she really held her own.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took Strauss 189 days to cover 23 530 kilometres and 13 border crossings \u2013 including some very rough terrain. Amazingly, he managed the whole trip without a single puncture and just one hiccup with a disintegrated ball bearing that was repaired in less than three hours. It took an impressive 15 030 kilometres for Victoria\u2019s rear tyre to lose its grip, and by the end of the journey the front tyre was still going strong. Strauss changed the oil filter three times on the journey, the engine oil four times, the transmission oil once, and the spark plugs twice.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Journey of a lifetime&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his incredible journey, Strauss discovered that Ethiopia has the best coffee of all, that Sudan has the cheapest fuel and that \u2018No Vespa No Life\u2019 is now a motto he lives by. His trusted Vespa gave him the experience of a lifetime \u2013 taking him to places he\u2019d never experienced before. He discovered the beauty of Vespa ownership, in both its freedom and solitude. His Vespa was not just a mode of transport, but his sole and trusted companion for the entire journey.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more about Strauss\u2019 epic journey, visit &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.soloscooterist.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.soloscooterist.com&lt;\/a&gt;.

A negative sentiment, true \u2013 but exactly what I felt as Jason and Signonne from New York plunge down 300m of steel cable off one narrow platform smack onto another on the opposite cliff face, 1000m up from sea level. I\u2019ve had the zipline experience, so am more than happy just to witness this time. Much easier to appreciate the drama of the surrounding mountain ranges and fynbos infinity without the distraction of rushing adrenalin. The Cape Canopy tour in Grabouw about an hour from Cape Town and in business since August last year, is in the heart of a pristine, previously inaccessible part of the Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve. It\u2019s also within the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so you want to be looking around you. But if you\u2019re ziplining, you also want to be concentrating \u2013 gloved hand above the pulley, watch for the safety block, breathe, enjoy. There are eleven slides, between thirteen precipitous platforms, a swaying suspension bridge crossing a double waterfall - all the rush you can handle. \u2018You sure get to confront your fear\u2019 says Ellen from London, white knuckling on the bumpy truck ride back down to base camp.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Green%20Spots%20Cape%20Canopy%20tour%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LINE &amp; SINKER \u2013 getting ready to fly on the Cape Canopy zipline.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hours later Jason and Signonne return &nbsp;as well exhilarated if exhausted. Over tea, conservationist in charge Ryan Larkman explains the low environmental impact of the zipline. \u2018We could dismantle the whole thing tomorrow and you wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s been there.\u2019 But if you\u2019d done it, you sure wouldn\u2019t forget.

Not quite leaning against his pitchfork but very relaxed, was John Jonkers, one of a handful of gardeners seeing to the area designed to evoke the Dutch East India Company\u2019s original 17th century \u2018VOC\u2019 vegetable garden. \u2018It\u2019s all about heritage,\u2019 he says, affectionately tweaking a leaf. &nbsp;It\u2019s been developed jointly by City Parks and the Heritage Resources Management Dept. But it\u2019s not just a nod to history. Manager and horticulturalist Rory Phelan says, \u2018it\u2019s to promote the idea of urban agriculture to a wider audience.\u2019 Under nets against &nbsp;squirrels and Egyptian geese, there are healthy Peter Rabbitesque rows of lettuce, chives, chillies etc as well as old timers like artichokes and beetroot, but long term the plan is to source \u2018heirloom\u2019 seed that pre-date the days of hybridisation and have \u2018inherent immunity to disease.\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Green%20Spots%20Company%27s%20Garden.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GOOD COMPANY \u2013 old methods of new growing.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layout is a miniaturised version of the original quadrilateral design and as in the past, watering is done with a leiwater irrigation system from a Table Mountain spring. There\u2019s a berry garden, orchards of good old fashioned quinces, apples, pears, peaches and plums grown espalier style as well as beds of indigenous medicinal plants. \u2018When the settlers came here they didn\u2019t have any medical supplies, so they had to take a leaf out of Khoisan tradition.\u2019 There are lots of green lessons to be learned here. In partnership with Woolworths, there are plans to run educational courses and if you fancy sampling the wares, there\u2019s also talk of a \u2018garden table\u2019 at the Company\u2019s Garden Restaurant so you can choose your own salad. In the meantime, refurbished by the Madame Zingara team who have a feel for Cape Town\u2019s pulse, the restaurant is pulling the crowds. Not just for their menu (a big improvement on the old Tea Room\u2019s toasted sarnies) but for the eco-playground toys in the yard \u2013 giant nests, basket swings and carved giant tortoises. What\u2019s not to love!&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE:&lt;\/strong&gt; The Company\u2019s Garden capetown.gov.za\/en\/park 021 436 1357&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Green%20Spots%20Company%27s%20Nest.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"323\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NESTING INSTINCT \u2013 playground toys at the Company\u2019s Garden Restaurant.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SPOTTING AND SHOPPING&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d steeled myself to do some shopping at Canal Walk in Century City. A throbbing temple of consumerism where I did what I had to do, quickly. This left time for an exploratory visit to Intaka Island, a 16ha nature reserve and wetland minutes away from the Babel of buying in the midst of a seriously commercial landscape. Although they pay for it in levies, it\u2019s a treasure for those who live and work in the area, but for most of us who haunt the malls or thunder past on the freeway it\u2019s a well kept secret. Accessed from a wooden bridge from the mainland, the island is a serene network of walk and waterways. Back in 1996 when Century City was a just a twinkle in the developer\u2019s eye, it was the result of an Environmental Impact Assessment recommendation and has been born out of the original pans and sandplains.But nearly twenty years on it feels like more than just a compliant tick box.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Green%20Spots%20Intaka%20Island%20ferry.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"323\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;FERRY COOL \u2013 take a ride on the waterways around Intaka Island.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the droves of birds who hang out there it\u2019s a five star destination with reed beds, endless nesting opportunity, two custom-built heronries for roosting and breeding and a playground of purified water \u2018polished\u2019 by a natural filtration system. It scores as a people pleaser too \u2013 resting benches, shady viewing spots, an educational centre, swathes of indigenous fynbos including 24 red data species and &nbsp;two bird hides trained on waders, kingfishers, darters and coots. In one a twitcher and his zoom lens were settled &nbsp;in for the long haul. You can walk all or some of the 45 minute nature trail by yourself or go with a guide, you can also get the best of both worlds by taking the hop-on hop-off ferry that plies the canals \u2013 and takes you back to the shops if you get withdrawals. &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE:&lt;\/strong&gt; Century City intaka.co.za 021 552 6889&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SUNSPOT&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s a running group that once a year organises a special trot down from Signal Hill and up to Tafelberg Road on Table Mountain. Bit of a killer, especially the return journey. But what it offered this year was the opportunity to see the SunStar up close. This angular artwork has been mired in controversy. \u2018Blight on the skyline\u2019, \u2019is it art if it\u2019s sponsored\u2019, \u2019is it art anyway', \u2019.....\u2019 You know how Capetonians like to whinge. But what is it?&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Green%20Spots%20Sunstar.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I circled it a number of times, took some pics, put my nose into the shipping container supporting the 21 solar panels and dozen or so batteries and read the inspiring message on the side: \u2018.... beacon of hope forged from the repurposed fence that used to surround Robben Island.\u2019 None the wiser, later I called designer Christopher Swift for the back story. \u2019The intention was to invite people to see challenges from a different point of view.\u2019 He quotes Einstein to the effect, \u2018We can\u2019t solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them...\u2019 His own thinking is that the day of the costly, solid granite monuments dominating precious space is over, that art can be a moveable, flexible feast and that it should be free and accessible to all. It can also be lighter on the earth if it\u2019s made out of reclaimed materials.&nbsp;Back in 2009 Swift took possession of some fencing from Robben Island that was on its way to the landfill. \u2018I wanted to use it to create something positive \u2013 jobs, art, hope. \u2018 Sunstar uses some of that fencing, it also uses geo-screws to pin it to the ground so that it can be dismantled without leaving an environmental footprint. It\u2019s lit by solar powered long-lasting LED lights. \u2018The original idea\u2019, says Swift, \u2018was that when its time was up, those lights could be donated to homes where they\u2019d be useful.\u2019 But since the artwork was adopted by Sun International, those decisions and its long term journey are out of his hands. Jacques de Bruin project manager of Sunstar picks up the message, \u2018It\u2019s all about having vision, looking \u2018beyond the fence.\u2019 SunStar will stay on Signal Hill till May, maybe longer \u2013 watch that space.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE:&lt;\/strong&gt; Signal Hill suninternational.com\/sunstar&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Green%20Spots%20Soil%20for%20Life.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GARDEN PATH \u2013 the abundant gardens at Soil for Life.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WELL SOILED&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s not every day you get an invitation to an annual general meeting of Home Gardeners, so I was honoured to attend the one at Soil for Life\u2019s headquarters in Constantia sandwiched between the Waldorf School and Peddler\u2019s the pub. It was a bright, sunny day and delegates squeezed into the boomklass, chalet style multipurpose centre up next to the greenhouses, for the speeches and awards ceremony. Proceedings are led by growth guru Pat Featherstone, founder of Soil for Life, an organisation that promotes and teaches the principle of healthy soil for healthy vegetables for healthy people . SFL\u2019s own gardens epitomise the success of the principle. Flourishing would be an understatement. Vegetables burst out of creative beds, climb and creep across soil that has been fed, built and nurtured to be the very best.nThe creativity doesn\u2019t stop at the growing, there are benches, gazebos, a sundial, sculptures carved and constructed out of reclaimed wood and innovative growth experiments in progress. At the shop you can buy compost, vegetables, plant boxes, literature and more \u2013 but the inspiration is absolutely free.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHERE:&lt;\/strong&gt; Stables Lane, Brounger way, Constantia soilforlife.co.za 021 794 4982&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3116\"&gt;The Company's Garden&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1354\"&gt;Century City&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9612\" class=\"publisher-1335 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/herd-act-follow\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;A Herd Act to Follow&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    A Herd Act to Follow  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"A Herd Act to Follow\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #222222' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/cl.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Wildlands%20M_0.jpg?itok=zR0F2wyV\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/herd-act-follow\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/herd-act-follow\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/herd-act-follow&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Wildlands%20M_0.jpg&amp;description=A Herd Act to Follow\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/herd-act-follow\" data-text=\"A Herd Act to Follow\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/herd-act-follow\" data-title=\"A Herd Act to Follow\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;May 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Andrea Abbott, pics Andrea Abbott and Supplied&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High on remote Dartmoor we find a pastoral scene: a herd of Nguni cattle, their coats of many patterns lending contrast to the green landscape. Bright-hued, newborn calves, secure in the 188-strong crowd, peep out uncertainly as we mingle with the bovine throng.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their midst, big daddy Stallone, a muscular, wide-horned fellow with not just a chip but a hell of a bump on his shoulder, holds us in his disconcerting gaze. \u201cHe won\u2019t charge, will he?\u201d I ask Donna Lay, manager of Dartmoor which, in case you\u2019re wondering, is not in England but is part of the 3 275ha Karkloof Nature Reserve in the KZN Midlands. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stallone, I\u2019m reassured, has a stare far worse than his charge. Still, Ngunis are known for extreme protectiveness of their young and for their herd loyalty. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to separate them,\u201d Donna says. This is evident when herdsmen and mounted rangers join forces and attempt to isolate a calf that requires an injection.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a trice, the one-for-all and all-for-one principle kicks in. Tightly packed, shoulder to shoulder, the herd morphs into an impenetrable wall of muscle that surges this way and that, all the while bellowing oaths at the perceived assailants. I feel as if I\u2019m caught up in a Wild West movie. Eventually, calf is caught, muti administered, and he\u2019s released to join the herd that, insulted, hotfoots it down the hill to other pastures.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wildlands%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Donna Lay, manager of Dartmoor Farm, with her all-important herd of cherished Ngunis.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngunis, South Africa\u2019s indigenous breed of cattle, are very much the in thing these days, their colour patterns making them a popular subject for artists, writers, interior decorators and photographers. But the Dartmoor herd is about more than pretty faces and eye-catching coats. They\u2019re a key part of the latest project by the Wildlands Conservation Trust, a KZN-based NGO that, in just a decade, has grown to become a major force in the national arena of biodiversity protection and community-based, poverty-alleviation programmes.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their projects are many and varied and range from fitting rhinos with tracking devices to providing a platform for \u2018tree-preneurs\u2019 in impoverished communities to grow indigenous trees and trade them for goods such as food, building materials, bicycles, solar panels, and rainwater tanks.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dartmoor Nguni project falls within the organisation\u2019s recently established Farming the Wild intervention, whose purpose is to develop viable businesses on conservation land in ways that help protect the ecological integrity of that land. In the case of the rich, biodiverse Dartmoor farm that Wildlands bought in 2010, to expand the Karkloof reserve.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAn important area of Midlands mistbelt grassland is protected there,\u201d says Kevin McCann, the organisation\u2019s deputy director of conservation SPACE (Species, People and Conservation of the Environment). \u201cThis grassland type has lost 80 per cent of its original extent in other areas of the province. Those irreplaceable grasslands aside, Dartmoor is also important as a water-catchment area. It lies in the upper catchments of two provincially strategic river systems, the uMngeni and uThukela. Both have a large number of downstream users, including the major urban centres of Hillcrest, Pinetown and Durban.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wildlands%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now that the veld at Dartmoor is improving, Wattled Cranes are returning to the area.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other significant environmental assets are extensive wetland areas and a variety of threatened species. These include the endangered oribi antelope and Wattled Crane, and some increasingly rare wild flowers, among them &lt;em&gt;Watsonia canaliculata&lt;\/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dierama luteoalbidum&lt;\/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cryptocarya myrtifolia&lt;\/em&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As happens in nature, all these various elements are interconnected, and without one another might vanish. This is where the Ngunis come in. Their role is not so much to generate income (although they do that too), but to perform the vital ecological function of keeping the grasslands intact. Cattle as conservation tools might seem a far-fetched idea, but it\u2019s not unheard of. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time Wildlands is using cattle in this way,\u201d Kevin says, \u201cbut the project is not unique to Dartmoor. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife and SANParks have in the past explored and used cattle in protected areas as a conservation-management tool. \u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea pivots on the fact that regular grazing keeps grasslands in good shape. At Dartmoor, a key grass species is the highly palatable (when young) red grass, &lt;em&gt;Themeda triandra&lt;\/em&gt;, which is one of the most important grazing grasses in Southern Africa. As a decreaser grass it\u2019s abundant in good veld but decreases when the veld is under- or overgrazed.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen we began managing Dartmoor three years ago,\u201d Donna says, \u201cour focus was on removing countless snares, including gin traps, and stamping out illegal dog hunting \u2013 factors that had virtually decimated the oribi population as well as other grazers.\u201d Too few oribi and other antelope meant the red grass was not being utilised properly. This created a vicious cycle: ungrazed, the grass continued to grow while decreasing in palatability, to ultimately become moribund and thus lost.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, because of the accrued mass of combustible material, the risk of hazardous runaway fires increased significantly. In fact, late in 2014, on the eve of the arrival of the Ngunis, a massive fire swept through Dartmoor and neighbouring farms, destroying about 1 500 hectares of veld.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019d heard of the intensive grazing, no-burn approach that claims to perform wonders such as prevent desertification, and capture carbon and store it in grassland soils for thousands of years. But I\u2019d also heard opposing views, for example that such claims are unfounded and also that the trampling impact of mobs of heavy-hoofed cattle is detrimental to soils, water storage and plant productivity. Controlled burning, the latter camp argues, is the way to go.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donna explains that managed burns will be done at Dartmoor, but that the Ngunis play a complementary role. A smaller breed than most other cattle, they\u2019re lighter on the land and, being indigenous, are well adapted to the conditions. \u201cThey\u2019re hardy, economical, resistant to tick-borne diseases, and easier to manage than other breeds,\u201d Donna points out.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another benefit is that regular grazing, in keeping the grass short, helps with controlled block burns, and therefore fire management. Essentially, then, the Ngunis are taking on the role of the oribi and other grazers that once occurred in healthy numbers on these mistbelt grasslands. And so, a link in the ecological chain has been more or less restored. Still, how tragic that the true connection has been severed, those dainty antelope almost wiped out, and other naturally occurring species also in decline.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the story promises a happy ending. The Ngunis may be standing in for the oribi for now but, as the veld improves, habitats will begin to recover, beckoning once more the cranes (all three species \u2013 blue, grey crowned, and wattle \u2013 occur in the area) and other grassland dwellers, including the special flora. The snaring problem, now also under control thanks to the efforts of Donna and her hand-picked team, means that the once hunted \u2013 the oribi, reedbuck and other gentle grazers \u2013 can also start to return (already, there are indications of an increase in numbers) and, when they do, they\u2019ll find abundant grazing and, along with the Ngunis, will play their rightful part in protecting the biodiversity of the Midlands mistbelt grasslands. One for all, and all for one.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\/a-herd-act-to-follow\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Country Life&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/CL%20Cover_7.jpg?itok=32bpdl5w\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Country Life&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9618\" class=\"publisher-1813 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/%C3%A0-bient%C3%B4t-avianto\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;\u00e0 bient\u00f4t, Avianto!&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    \u00e0 bient\u00f4t, Avianto!  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"\u00e0 bient\u00f4t, Avianto!\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.ride.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #E31933' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/ride-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Avianto%20LM.jpg?itok=DVvytiR-\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/\u00e0-bient\u00f4t-avianto\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/\u00e0-bient\u00f4t-avianto\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/\u00e0-bient\u00f4t-avianto&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Avianto%20LM.jpg&amp;description=\u00e0 bient\u00f4t, Avianto!\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/\u00e0-bient\u00f4t-avianto\" data-text=\"\u00e0 bient\u00f4t, Avianto!\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/\u00e0-bient\u00f4t-avianto\" data-title=\"\u00e0 bient\u00f4t, Avianto!\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;May 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Andrew \u201cAverage Andy\u201d Steer&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking for the perfect marriage of mountain biking and hospitality? And convenience? And safety? Try the Tracker RideFree Avianto Bike Park in Muldersdrift. We did.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avianto, in Muldersdrift in the Cradle of Humankind, is probably best known to the greater public as a world-class wedding and conference venue, but over the past few years it has rapidly risen to prominence as one of the best mountain-biking venues in Gauteng. The trails have been going for a couple of years now, but over the last year things have certainly kicked up a notch with the expansion of the park to add much-needed mileage by including sections in Phambili and the Syringa ruins.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with this, Avianto has partnered with Tracker since May 2014 in setting it up as a RideFree Bike park. Just like the Modderfontein RideFree Bike Park, that means exceptional route marking, good maintenance of the trails and lots of value-adds for the riders such as bike washes, Biogen hydration stations, standby medical emergency assistance (on Sundays) and even monthly skills clinics.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Avianto%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Riding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people will recognise the venue and trails at Avianto from the Eqstra Spring Classic and USN Cup races that are held there annually, along with the numerous trail runs that they host throughout the year. A large part of its popularity is the relatively easy access from both Johannesburg and Pretoria, and the superb facilities on offer. This, coupled with the recent expansion and upgrade of the trails, now leaves riders spoilt in terms of options and enjoyment.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Route&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 The red route, at 2.5km in length, is aimed mainly at the kiddies and offers a fun, safe little trip on the bike around the eastern side of Avianto. There is nothing technical and all the road crossings are avoided.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Route&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 Formerly the green route, this 6km route on the eastern side of the park is aimed at riders new to the sport and a bit short on fitness. The route again is very rider-friendly, featuring mainly jeep track and dirt roads, and with gradients that never get too severe. There is a little bit of climbing in parts, but the fun switchbacks and berms to be enjoyed on the way down will leave you smiling.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Route&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 Made up of two 12km sections on either side of the Crocodile River, this great little 24km route offers a nice option for fitter riders not too confident in the rougher stuff. There is still plenty of fun factor, with loads of singletrack, switchbacks, berms, climbs and descents littering the route. You also traverse a wide variety of terrains, passing dams, koppies, rivers, horse kraals and forests, all the while taking in some great views of the Cradle of Humankind.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Route&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 The main event is the Blue route, again divided into two 17km sections on either side of the Crocodile River. The 34km total will give even the fit guys a great workout, as there is very little in the way of flat terrain in the area. It\u2019s basically just an extension of the Green route, with the additional mileage coming in the form of slightly tougher terrain and often harsher gradients. While it definitely is a grade up from the Green in most parts, we found the sections very rideable for us weekend warriors.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Route -&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;The Black is made up of occasional small sections that branch off the Blue and Green routes and offers the more serious riders a proper technical challenge, in terms of both skill and endurance. It\u2019s aimed at advanced riders, and you need to be strong and technically competent to take on these little sections, as the steep gradients and rocky nature of most of them will certainly leave you a little worse for wear should you come a cropper.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overall Experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partnership with Tracker in making this a RideFree Bike Park certainly adds to the professionalism of the whole experience. The trails are really well marked and the routes a breeze to follow.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there isn\u2019t a map as yet, with so many options available, and the routes broken down into so many sections, the options are limitless and can easily be tailored to suit riders\u2019 or groups\u2019 physical and technical abilities. All the routes\u2019 branching off one another also allow families and friends of different levels to enjoy part of their day out together.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The riding on the Eastern Avianto side is pretty tight and compact, owing to the smallish area available, but apart from a little switchback sandwich at the start (having also run these may slightly distort my view), you seldom get the feeling of \u201cmaking up the distance\u201d.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The riding to the west over the Crocodile River is, however, a slightly different beast, and the terrain opens up a bit more, with some longer climbs, great singletrack and great vistas in and around Phambili and the old Syringa ruins.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when you\u2019re finished, grab a beer, cool down in the pool and enjoy a well-earned meal within the confines of one of Gauteng\u2019s most luxurious estates. Is there a better place to get the whole family on to their bikes and enjoying their Sundays together?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Avianto%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cycling hours&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trails are open every day of the week from 6am to 6pm. During the quieter week times, trail passes (bands) can be bought from the main Avianto Reception (500m away from the trail head, just across the river), or else during peak times (weekends and public holidays), they are available for purchase from the Avianto clubhouse, from which all the trails start.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weather&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail is pretty exposed in most parts, so protection from the sun is pretty much a necessity all year round. The course holds up fairly well to rain, so apart from the occasional slippery rocks in the technical sections and the odd muddy patch, our famed Highveld thunderstorms don\u2019t hinder the riding conditions too badly.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Riding Rates&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;R40 for a single entry&lt;br&gt;Multiple pass cards to be implemented in the near future.&lt;br&gt;R700 for a yearly pass&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get there&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avianto Estate Clubhouse, Villa Street, 2067 Muldersdrift, Gauteng, South Africa&lt;br&gt;GPS: S 26 01\u2019 35\u201d and E 27 50\u2019 40\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions to the Avianto Club House&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Johannesburg:&lt;\/strong&gt; Turn on to the M5 Beyers Naude (away from Northcliff towards Honeydew). Carry on straight for approximately 12km, passing Garden World on your right. Look out for a left turn onto the R114 Muldersdrift. Pass Carnivore restaurant on your right. Take the first road right (St Antonio\u2019s), then first left into Villa Street, and go under the bridge. Turn right at the circle, then turn left at the first gravel road.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Pretoria:&lt;\/strong&gt; Take the R28 towards Krugersdorp, pass the Lanseria\/Randburg &nbsp;and Zwartkop\/Randburg off-ramps, take the Muldersdrift\/Driefontein off-ramp at the bottom of a long hill. At the four-way stop, go straight. Then take the first left into St Antonio\u2019s, the next left into Villa Street, and go under the bridge. Turn right at the circle, then turn left at the first gravel road.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Roodepoort:&lt;\/strong&gt; Travel west down Hendrik Potgieter until Cradlestone mall. Turn right after the mall onto the N14. Take the first off-ramp, signboard Muldersdrift\/Driefontein. Turn right straight away to head back under the highway. Turn left at the four-way stop, then first left into St Antonio\u2019s, next left into Villa street and go under the bridge.

There is ample parking, a beautiful clubhouse with great views, a pool to cool down in, showers to clean up in, a fully licensed bar, the option to picnic by the river or strike up a braai and even a kiddies\u2019 play area. And if the trails have taken too much out of you, you can just order some scrumptious grub from Caf\u00e9 Cielo while sipping a beer and taking in the great view. Over weekends there is a bike wash and hydration station, and on Sundays there is even full medical support from ER24, courtesy of Tracker.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contacts&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avianto Tracker RideFree Bike Park&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cell: 083 600 1289&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:richard@ilumin8.co.za\"&gt;richard@ilumin8.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Website: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilumin8events.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.ilumin8events.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aviantotrails\"&gt;www.facebook.com\/aviantotrails&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TrackerRideFree\"&gt;www.facebook.com\/TrackerRideFree&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter: TrackerRideFree&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avianto&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Telephone: 011-668-3000&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:info@avianto.co.za\"&gt;info@avianto.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Website: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.avianto.co.za\"&gt;www.avianto.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.ride.co.za\/training\/where-to-ride-rides\/a-bientot-avianto\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ride Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

pics James Rushforth&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peaks of the Dolomites are characteristically steep, with huge faces and towering summits often breaching 3000m in altitude. These stunning spires of alpine limestone are located south of the Austrian \/ Italian border and the mountainous area extends for 80km east of the town of Bolzano.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst on first appearances the landscape may appear a little intimidating, the area is actually surprisingly accessible. Well-marked and clearly defined paths weave between the Dolomite monoliths, whilst iron cables or \u2018via ferrata\u2019 provide access to some of the world\u2019s most striking summits, allowing you to move quickly over technical ground that would normally require a rope.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venice airport provides the most common means of access to the Dolomites from outside Europe; this beautiful and unique city is a worthy destination in itself and definitely worth combining with a trip to the Dolomites. Once there, there are many possible accommodation options in the various towns and hamlets offering a unique mix of Italian and Austrian culture. Corvara in the Val Badia and Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo are two of many possible bases, offering a range of amenities, amazing scenery and superb access to some of the best walking and via ferrata in the area.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few route recommendations that can easily be accessed from either of the two towns:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hiking recommendations&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiking in the Dolomites is exceptionally accessible with well-marked and clearly defined paths, offering a nearly unlimited supply of possible routes. Here are a few of my favourites:&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinque Torri&lt;\/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestled between the Falzarego and Giau Passes the famous five towers of Cinque Torri are a worthy holiday destination in their own right, offering some of the best walking and scenery in the area. Walks usually start from Rifugio Bai de Dones and the Cinque Torri chairlift car park situated on the Falzarego pass. From here a beautiful walk up through woodland (or chairlift ride) leads to the towers themselves. You can then follow a series of First World War Trenches with much historic interest between the towers themselves before returning back down to the pass by one of a number of possible descents. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lago di Sorapiss&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sorapiss Group forms a horseshoe of steep rock walls that are only open to the north. At their base lies the beautiful Lago di Sorapiss, one of the most striking lakes in the Dolomites with its amazing turquoise colour. The walk up from the Giau pass to much-needed refreshments at Rifugio Vandelli is long and demanding but scenically stunning. For those keen to explore this area further it is possible to complete three consecutive via ferrata around the lake using Bivacco Slataper or Bivacco Comici for an overnight stay. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tre Cime&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The famous trinity of the Tre Cime is the iconic symbol of the Dolomites and much coveted by people from all over the world. By taking the toll road up from Misurina to Rifugio Auronzo you can remove much of the height gain. An anti-clockwise circuit of the towers via Rifugio Lavaredo provides stunning views of the north faces, the central of which, Cima Grande, forms one of the six classic north faces of the Alps. The circuit can then be completed by walking under Cima Ovest back to Rifugio Auronzo. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Padon Ridge and the \u2018Viel dal Pan\u2019&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Padon Ridge separates the Fedaia and Pordoi passes and is rich in history. The path running parallel to the ridge was once an ancient traders\u2019 route known as the 'Viel dal Pan', used to transport flour between the local valleys. Towards the end of the 19th century the route was rediscovered by the German Karl Bindel, thus giving rise to its second name, \u2018Bindelweg'. Today it is possible to follow the old trade route along the ridge starting from the top of the Pordoi Pass and traversing to Rifugio Luigi Gorza and the Arabba Portavescovo cablecar station, from where you can descend easily to the village. Throughout the walk you get spectacular views of the north face of the Marmolada, the highest peak in the Dolomites at 3343m.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lago di Lagacio \/ Fanis&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fanis Massif is a spectacular and rarely frequented group to the east of the Val Badia and west of Cortina. Departing from Rifugio Capanna Alpina just outside of Armentarola it is possible to ascend the dramatic Fanis Valley before descending a steep pass between Cima del Lago and Cima Scotoni down to the superbly situated Lago di Lagacio. The descent then continues down to Rifugio Scotoni (offering some of the best food in the area), before returning back to Capanna Alpina. &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Via Ferrata and route recommendations&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A via ferrata in its most basic form is a metal (originally iron - now more commonly steel) wire that runs up the mountain, allowing climbers to attach themselves to it for safety and also providing a means of artificial aid to assist with difficult sections. There are also ladders, unlikely suspension bridges, stemples (large staples in the rock), steps and walkways to further assist upwards progression. The term 'via ferrata' originates from 'via attrezzata', which means 'fully equipped road \/route\u2019 whilst common English translations cite 'iron way', 'iron road' or 'iron path\u2019. Whilst there are some via ferrata that predate 1914 the majority of the routes were established during the First World War providing a hugely historic significance to the routes enjoyed today.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dolomites are particularly famous for their via ferrata, boasting the highest concentration of routes in the world. There are simply too many to create a \u2018best of\u2019 list, however here are a few recommendations if you\u2019re in the area:&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piz da Cir V (VF2A)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short but interesting via ferrata that is ideal for those looking for a half day out or to try a via ferrata for the first time. Despite being relatively short in via ferrata terms, because it departs from the top of the Gardena Pass, it still reaches an impressive height of 2500m. This affords spectacular views into the Val de Chedul, across to the Sella and of the impressive nearby Sassolungo group. The rock quality is excellent and provides interesting climbing at a consistent level.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brigata Tridentina (VF3B)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fantastic via ferrata and the extremely popular classic of the Val Badia and Gardena area. During peak season it is worth getting on the wire very early or waiting until the afternoon if you want to avoid the crowds. The rock is good and the climbing varied. The hardest moves come towards the end, before the spectacular bridge crossing between Torre Exner and the Mur de Pisciad\u00f9.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sentiero Massimiliano \/ Laurenzi-Molignon (VF2B \/ VF4C)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This remote pair of via ferrata will appeal to those looking for a bit of solitude and can be combined with an overnight stay in the lovely Rifugio Alpe di Tires. Sentiero Massimiliano is an easy and fairly unprotected ridge scramble above the Alpi di Siusi plateau, whilst Laurenzi-Molignon follows the seldom frequented Molignon ridge just north of the Catinaccio group, with some difficult down climbing. &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marmolada West Ridge (VF3D)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This via ferrata is fairly unique in the area in that it crosses the Ghiacciaio della Marmolada, as such requiring a reasonable amount of alpine experience. The route is graded VF3D, indicating a moderate technical difficulty whilst being serious in nature. The cable ascends the superbly situated west ridge up to the summit of Punta Penia, the highest peak in the Dolomites at 3343m, offering tantalising glimpses down the huge south face as you progress.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Via delle Trincee\/La Mesola (VF4B)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This historic route (way of the trenches) is an unusual via ferrata, taking the form of a traverse along the Padon ridge and developing on conglomerate rock as opposed to the surrounding limestone and dolomite. The views down to the village of Arabba and across to the Marmolada North Face are superb; throw in some atmospheric tunnels and even an original canon dating back to the First World War and you have a superb itinerary.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punta Anna (VF5B)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favourite via ferrata and follows a ridge system north from Rifugio Pomedes, over the top of Punta Anna and to the summit of Tofana di Mezzo (3244m), the third highest peak in the Dolomites. The climbing is aesthetic on solid rock, whilst the situations and exposure are fantastic. The views are such that it feels like you can see the entire Dolomites on a clear day, not to mention a good amount of Austria. However given that much of it takes place above 3000m in a remote environment, the route should not be underestimated. The climbing is also fairly strenuous with some big exposure, particularly on the several traverse sections.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ski Club 18 (VF5B)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This via ferrata was equipped in 2009 and is one of the hardest in the area, being of comparable difficulty to Cesare Piazetta and Magnifici Quattro. The climbing is steep and sustained, requiring good fitness. Being such a new via ferrata there are still sections that need cleaning, but the flip side of this is a wonderful lack of polish. With the aid of the Faloria cable car the approach is relatively short and the descent non-existent, making it an ideal half-day out from Cortina.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Multi day trekking&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking a longer and more demanding experience there are eight \u2018Alta Via\u2019; the Haute Routes of the Dolomites weave their way through the range incorporating high walking trails, sections of protected paths and via ferrata. Combined with overnight stays in the region\u2019s beautiful rifugios they provide a unique way in which to experience the Dolomites, taking you on a traverse through this beautiful and unique mountain group.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Ruthforth is the author of &lt;em&gt;The Dolomites : Rock Climbs and Via Ferrata&lt;\/em&gt;, which can be purchased online at &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockfax.com\/climbing-guides\/all\/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-ferrata\"&gt;www.rockfax.com\/climbing-guides\/all\/the-dolomites-rock-climbs-and-via-fe...&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Dolomites%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"800\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9851\" class=\"publisher-4076 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/land-shipwrecks-and-farms\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Land of Shipwrecks and Farms&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Land of Shipwrecks and Farms  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Land of Shipwrecks and Farms\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.travelideas.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #f69220' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Travel%20Ideas%20s.jpg\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Strandveld%20M.jpg?itok=K4Gi0jmi\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/land-shipwrecks-and-farms\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/land-shipwrecks-and-farms\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/land-shipwrecks-and-farms&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Strandveld%20M.jpg&amp;description=Land of Shipwrecks and Farms\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/land-shipwrecks-and-farms\" data-text=\"Land of Shipwrecks and Farms\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/land-shipwrecks-and-farms\" data-title=\"Land of Shipwrecks and Farms\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;May 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Franki Black&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad Vlok, winemaker and manager of the Strandveld Winery, doesn\u2019t understand how it\u2019s possible for anyone not to know their neighbour. In the Strandveld, where he comes from, neighbours sample wine together, they fish together and they celebrate catch of the day by opening another bottle of top-notch wine. Dirk Human, Conrad\u2019s friend who lives five kilometres down the road, sums it up perfectly, \u201cWhen a newcomer moves to the area, we arrange a party so that he or she can meet everyone.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low-lying Strandveld is situated between Gansbaai, Cape Agulhas and Bredasdorp. Its soil is fertile, its koppies overflow with springs and it offers country living coupled with coastal wonder. Perhaps the most remarkable part of the Strandveld is its history. Since the 1400\u2019s ships have been wrecked along its treacherous coastline and legends about castaways, heroes, salvage missions and the odd ghost abound. Nearby towns like Struisbaai, Cape Agulhas and Hermanus have modernized (often undesirably) at an astonishing rate and over December it is hard to buy bread at the local shop. Venture a few kilometers inland to the Strandveld and you\u2019ll find quiet wine farms, walking trails, historic cottages and the Black Oystercatcher, a restaurant that prides itself on serving cuisine sourced within a 50-km radius. The Strandveld is so close to the sea that you can wake up on a farm, drive 20-minutes and spend the day on the beach.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Strandveld%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Strandveld Winery&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leave Cape Town on a Friday afternoon and two and a half hours later, we arrive at Africa\u2019s southern-most winery, Strandveld. It\u2019s pitch dark outside. Conrad emerges from a cottage dating back to the 1800\u2019s with a torch and a warm welcome. Good company and a traditional farm dinner await. \u201cFishing is big in these parts,\u201d says Conrad with a knowing smile. It\u2019s hard to imagine that we\u2019re so close to the sea, but freshly-caught mussel-cracker sizzles on the braai. Fishing is Conrad\u2019s third love. His first is his wife Suzan and their two children, and his second is winemaking. \u201cWe started making wine here in 2005. At the time it was a bit of a gamble, as no one had made wine in the Strandveld before,\u201d Conrad explains as he fills our glasses with delicious Shiraz Ros\u00e9. Local conditions proved perfect for winemaking - fertile soil, a cool climate and a hefty ocean breeze \u2013 and since humble beginnings, Conrad has gone on to win a Veritas Double Gold medal, as well as a Gold medal at the International Wine &amp; Spirit Competition for his 2010 Strandveld Sauvignon Blanc. Both his Sauvignon Blanc and his 2009 Strandveld Adamastor received 5-star ratings in Platter\u2019s South African Wine Guide.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evening turns merry, as Suzan presents a spread of traditional goodness: venison pie, freshly-baked bread, lamb chops, broccoli in white sauce, followed by flamb\u00e9ed pancakes. \u201cYou have to choose a fatty chop,\u201d recommends Conrad. \u201cHere in the Overberg we have the best lamb chops in South Africa.\u201d Conrad and Suzan have lived on the farm for ten years and they still think it is heaven. The conversation turns to shipwrecks. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll take you to the top of a koppie \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to see where the Atlantic and Indian oceans meet,\u201d Conrad says. He tells us about a three-day shipwreck trail that passes close to his farm. On this route hikers can see the remnants of ships like the Mishu Maru 38, a fishing trawler that sank near Cape Agulhas, and Africa\u2019s southernmost point.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Strandveld%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the fire flickers, Suzan urges Conrad to tell us about his award-winning Rh\u00f4ne blend, the Strandveld Navigator. \u201cWe named this wine after Prince Henry the Navigator \u2013 the Patron of early Portuguese exploration. Like the handful of winemakers in the Strandveld, he was one of the first to explore the secrets around Africa\u2019s southernmost tip,\u201d he notes. Conrad is a born host and next he ushers us to a vertical tasting of Syrah. He has six glasses lined up for each person. We taste our way from 2006 to 2011. I gulp down heavenly tones of mocha, red berry and pepper.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning we wake up to Overberg bliss: a lawn ideal for cricket, chickens cackling, morning light on a cellar and dirt roads waiting to be explored. Conrad leads the run to Pofadder Bos, his Sauvignon Blanc vineyard. He shows us the unique red colour of the soil. Trailed by three adoring dogs, we carefully jog past a herd of dubious cows and make our way through fields of fynbos. We\u2019re amazed by the generous display of proteas. They all look like they\u2019ve been to the hairdresser for a perm. From the top of the koppie, stretches of farmlands, marshlands and coastline lie before us. On the way back, Conrad points out his, and Africa\u2019s, southernmost vineyard. \u201cRemember the four S\u2019s,\u201d he says in reference to his best-selling First Sighting Sauvignon Blanc, \u201cSingle-vineyard, Southern-most, Strandveld and Sauvignon Blanc.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Black Oystercatcher&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Strandveld\u2019s food philosophy rivals culinary approaches in top foodie destinations like San Francisco and France. Every bite has a story attached to it: either the fish was caught on the same day in Struisbaai or the greens were grown on the land you\u2019re standing on. Dirk spotted the uniqueness of the Strandveld\u2019s culinary scene and decided to make it accessible to more people. In 2008 he opened the Black Oystercatcher, a family-run restaurant that celebrates homegrown food and local culture.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Strandveld%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We drive five minutes down the road to meet Dirk. Immediately it\u2019s apparent that he is the alpha-male of the Strandveld. If he\u2019s not making wine, he\u2019s introducing hippos to the area and building landing-strips for small airplanes. &nbsp;He also chairs the 25-farmer strong Nuwejaars Special Management Area project, aimed at conserving the Strandveld through social, agricultural and environmental initiatives. He loves the Strandveld and fondly recalls childhood memories of camping next to a close-by dam. Today, this very dam is where five hippos live that Dirk reintroduced to the area after 150 years. The Black Oystercatcher restaurant sits where the farm\u2019s stables used to be, but Dirk and his equally innovative wife, Sandra, managed to turn it into a space that radiates style and country luxury. Dirk presents us with a lineup of wines to taste. \u201cWinemaking is straightforward,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to follow a recipe.\u201d Dirk\u2019s \u201crecipes\u201d prove to be sensational. He recalls the weather conditions of every vintage, while we sip full-bodied Merlot, tropical Sauvignon Blanc and dry, crisp Ros\u00e9. For lunch, we snack on a platter of pastrami, local cheeses, figs and chicken liver, followed by black mussels and a homemade burger. I\u2019m ready to give up city living for the Strandveld.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated close to holiday hotspots like Hermanus, the Black Oystercatcher is the ideal spot for a casual lunch or a special occasion. During December, Dirk hosts a number of events like a Sauvignon Blanc Festival and an Oyster Festival. Their most popular event is the Traditional Food and Music Day hosted on the 29th of December. &nbsp;\u201cWe serve &lt;em&gt;boerekos&lt;\/em&gt; and Oom Manie and his band show up to entertain the crowd,\u201d Dirk explains. Oom Manie is apparently 82-years old and his choice of drink is vodka and water. Another favourite event in the area is the 1km braai that takes place on Dirk\u2019s landing strip every year on Heritage Day \u2013 the local farmers are hoping to turn it into a big event. Besides food and wine, the Strandveld is an outdoor enthusiast\u2019s paradise. It is home to an astonishing variety of birds and from the Black Oystercatcher, kilometres of hiking and biking trails start. Dirk tells us about the historic paraffin route that passes through his farm. During the 1800\u2019s, lighthouse keepers used to traverse this route with boxes of paraffin to keep lighthouse lamps burning.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shipwreck Territory&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m intrigued by the Strandveld and its lively history. That evening we huddle around a log fire crackling in our cottage and I start to read a Strandveld coffee-table book out loud. We\u2019re transported to the &lt;em&gt;Arniston&lt;\/em&gt;, a ship that was wrecked along the coast in 1815 while making its way to England. &nbsp;Due to outdated navigational tools, the captain was under the impression that they had passed Cape Point. As a result, they headed north prematurely and hit rocks 800 metres from the shore. Only 6 out of 378 people survived. I continue reading about hidden treasures, onboard slave revolts, murders fueled by jealousy, drunken sailors and missions gone wrong. As I fall asleep that night, I think about all the people who have perished along this coast known as the Graveyard of Ships.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before bidding Conrad farewell, I tell him that the Strandveld - with its wholesome foods, its shipwreck trails and its gorgeous wines - can really become a tourist hotspot. He knows it, but I get the sense that he wishes he could keep it as unspoiled as it is right now for a little while longer. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat and Sleep&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strandveld Guest Cottages:&lt;\/strong&gt;

They\u2019d be wrong. There is much more to the XV 4x4 than meets the eye, and if you add some minor upgrades to the deal\u2026 well, then it turns into something a little bit wild.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A little road trip to kick things off\u2026&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started in June, 2014. There we were, driving on a deserted dirt road, snaking its way towards Sodwana Bay, KwaZulu-Natal. We were in a stock standard Subaru XV, and on a mission to drive from Sodwana on the country's east coast, using back roads where possible, all the way to Kleinzee on the West Coast. The total distance would be around 4500km.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our adventure seemed doomed even before it had started. About 50km from Sodwana, the left rear tyre called it quits, the sidewall cut by a sharp rock. We changed the tyre in the dark, and thankfully the XV does come with a full-size spare wheel.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning the tyre was fixed with some strong &lt;em&gt;muti&lt;\/em&gt;, courtesy of a Sodwana-based repair shop. But with the standard low-profile tyres fitted to the beautiful 17-inch alloy rims, we were rather worried about picking up more punctures. On a 4500km trip, that seemed inevitable.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we'd been impressed by the XV\u2019s comfort and the \u201csporty\u201d feel that is virtually a Subaru patent. It's not that the XV is fast. The two-litre Boxer engine does not breathe through a turbocharger, and it develops a mild 110 kW and 197 Nm of torque (at a high 4200r\/min). Power is permanently sent to all four wheels via Subaru\u2019s Lineartronic continuously variable transmission.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVT gearbox technology seems to be all the rage these days, and partnered with Subaru\u2019s turbodiesel engine it really is awesome in application. In the XV it is OK, but maybe not great, mostly because there is not so much low-end torque to work with.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Subaru%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the days and kilometres on that trip flew past, we came to appreciate the Scooby\u2019s comfort, that sporty edge, its entertaining yet solid performance on most gravel roads and the frugal fuel consumption.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Lineartronic gearbox spinning the engine in its most efficient range for the conditions, the XV needed an average of 8,8 litres\/100km.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the final leg of our journey, on a dirt road nearing Kleinzee, another small issue became apparent: the low-profile tyres did not appreciate big corrugations. Instead of absorbing the continuous bumps, the jolts reverberated through the cabin, seemingly shaking everything to pieces.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end &lt;em&gt;That&lt;\/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;4x4 Show&lt;\/em&gt; presenter Tumelo Maketekete and I completed the journey without any further problems or incidents. And amazingly, those 235\/55 R17 tyres, with their very commendable grip in corners but a less absorbing performance on a heavily corrugated dirt road, managed to avoid any more punctures.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Time for a nip &amp; tuck!&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The desert khaki Subaru XV was due to stay with us for a year, and with that 4500km trip behind us, we had some ideas on how to improve this nifty little 4x4.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we get to those upgrades, just some numbers and information to demonstrate that this car is actually a lot more capable in the rough than you might think.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it has 220mm ground clearance, which is not just a thumb-suck number as is often the case with over-enthusiastic marketing department copy writers. And all the suspension components and other mechanical bits are neatly tucked away out of harm\u2019s way under the vehicle, so you can go places in the XV that you would not be able to tackle in other cross-breed hatches.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there is Subaru\u2019s famous symmetrical AWD system \u2013 comprising a longitudinally mounted, horizontally opposed Boxer engine (flat four layout) and a symmetrically designed 4WD drivetrain.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Subaru%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lineartronic model gets the Active Torque Split AWD system, which normally sends 60% of the horses to the front wheels, and 40% to the rear axle. Sensors constantly monitor all parameters, including vehicle speed and grip levels on all four wheels. An electronically controlled multi-plate transfer (MP-T) system then adjusts the torque split between the front and rear axles in real time to suit the grip levels and driving conditions, as well as transmission and driver inputs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the CVT gearbox, you can switch to manual mode and use the paddle shifters on either side of the steering wheel for up or down shifts. So in off-road situations you can drive it \u201cmanual\u201d if you like -- just don\u2019t expect engine braking on a steep downhill.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, so with some of the XV\u2019s credentials explained, let\u2019s look at those upgrades, done in conjunction with Gary Swemmer of the 4WD Truckin\u2019 Company.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-terrain tyres were at the top of our shopping list, but it proved a challenge to find the ideal set of takkies. Hankook provided a set of 17-inch Dynapro ATM all-terrain tyres, and we fitted these to the original17-inch rims. But with the higher profile all-terrains, the wheels no longer fitted in the wheel arches. So that idea went out the window.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to go one size smaller with the rims, and Subaru SA supplied four 16-inch steel rims from a Forester. On these more hardy rims we fitted Hankook Dynapro ATM all-terrains (235\/60 R16s).&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are the chunky Hankooks more resistant to punctures and offer better grip in off-road conditions, but the higher profile allows you to deflate the tyres so they can absorb the impact of, for instance, major corrugations, resulting in a much more pliant, comfortable and composed ride.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tyre and rim combination is only marginally larger in circumference, so ground clearance is also slightly improved. Good news is that the vehicle\u2019s standard warranty is not affected.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function without form is also no good, so to fit in with our black-and-desert khaki theme, the silver rims were sprayed in a coat of Plastidip \u2013 a vinyl spray-on wrap that not only protects the original surface but can be peeled off in a jiffy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Subaru%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add some extra space, Front Runner supplied an aluminium strap-on roof-rack. They also provided a 45-litre water tank with outlet, two 20-litre jerry cans and a spade that bolts onto the side of the rack. To add some packing space, a 4WD Truckin\u2019 Company Wolf Pack and transit bag were added, tied down with some good quality straps.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For increased safety when driving at night on those rutted dirt roads, we added a set of powerful Lightforce 170 Striker driving lights. And to round off the exterior package, some discreet decals were added.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interior remains standard apart from an aftermarket Caska entertainment system that replaced the original head unit in the centre console. This new system, with its big LCD screen, includes a GPS navigation system with TomTom maps.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we were at first not greatly impressed by some of the features, the GPS and some other functions have proved invaluable over the past 20 000km.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A little road trip to finish things off&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the beefed-up Subaru XV featured on the television programme, and for months it served as school taxi, camera crew vehicle that went where hatch-based crossovers should probably not venture, and general city runabout.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was only way to really judge whether the upgrades had been worth the trouble, and that was to compare the toughened up XV with a standard model \u2013 such as the Leisure Wheels XV.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we put together a road trip to the Witwater Safari Lodge, near Mookgophong in the Limpopo province. Besides a 30km dirt road leading to the lodge, there are some rough mountain tracks to contend with, making it the ideal rough-roader test ground.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Subaru%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So off we went, and on the smooth N1 highway there was a clear difference in the performance of the two Subarus. With all that gear on the roof, and the slightly taller tyres, the 4WD Truckin\u2019 Company XV required considerably more right-foot to maintain a steady 120km\/h. The roof load certainly compromised the XV\u2019s usual aerodynamic performance. It was like trying to launch a brick-shaped rocket into space. As you\u2019d expect, fuel consumption also suffered. (See the numbers elsewhere in this article.)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once we hit the dirt road outside Mookgophong, any aerodynamic inefficiencies were quickly forgotten. In the standard XV, the driver had to be more circumspect about rocks and ditches, and although the driving experience was still quite excellent and sporty, it did get slightly bouncy -- with rattles -- in the rougher sections, because of the low-profile tyres.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Hankook tyres, we hardly bothered about ruts and rocks as the all-terrain tyres absorbed the impacts more efficiently. The taller tyres did not compromise that inherent sporty feel, either \u2013 they actually enhanced it on the gravel.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached some of Witwater\u2019s rougher tracks, normally reserved for the 4x4 game drive vehicles. From his lofty Landy Defender, ranger Jacob Maponyane looked at our XVs with a certain level of pessimism.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the first rough section we crossed (in both XVs, without any hassles) Jacob was all smiles. In fact, he could hardly believe that the vehicles handled the conditions so easily, without leaving expensive plastic bits alongside the track.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you have to quit when you're ahead, and we did this at one particularly rocky climb that would have given some pukka off-roaders with a transfer case a work-out. We parked the standard XV -- and had a go in the 4WD Truckin\u2019 Company version.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, it managed to clamber about three-quarters of the way up the hill before we decided to retire, rather than carry some expensive Subaru body parts back home in the boot. With the Lineartronic gearbox in manual mode, and the AWD system and traction control doing their stuff, the XV got a lot farther than we'd thought it would.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Subaru%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake, this is no hardcore 4x4 ready to tackle major off-road obstacles. But if you have to negotiate some rougher dirt roads or mud, rest assured that this Scooby can handle them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was this upgrade worth the effort? We reckon so, yes. When you use the XV around town you can always store the roof rack and its accessories, and refit them for those longer trips. Offering more packing space, fuel capacity (a total of 100 litres), water storage and a shovel, the accessories are practical, too.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The all-terrain tyres handled very well on tar roads, but they really came into their own off the beaten track. And with pot hole dodging becoming a national sport, the tougher all-terrain tyres are more resistant to punctures and damage, even in town.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 16-inch steel rims also play their part here\u2026 in the middle of the bush, when a wheel is damaged, you can try to convince the buckled wheel to get better with a five-pound hammer. If an original aluminium alloy mag is damaged\u2026 well, that will be that.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upgrades also demonstrate that you don\u2019t have to spend a small fortune to change an already very good package for the better. In fact, we\u2019d recommend the wheel and tyre upgrade all day long, while the roof accessories would be a question of personal preference and requirement.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This road trip again highlighted what a good all-round package the XV really is, even in stock trim. Five-star EURO NCAP safety rating meets fuel economy meets cool mom\u2019s taxi meets sporty driving experience meets comfort meets luxury meets extremely capable rough-roader.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, in short, the rainbow wheels of the crossover segment.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The comparison&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard vehicle&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Great-looking 17-inch alloys with 225\/50 R17 low-profile tyres.

Includes wind deflector. Retails for R4 971 (excludes fitment).&lt;br&gt;* Front Runner double jerry can holder (R695) plus two matte black jerry cans (20 litres each) at R325 each.&lt;br&gt;* Front Runner 45-litre water tank to fit on Slimline II rack (R1285) plus mounting system (R295).&lt;br&gt;* Lightforce 170 Striker 100W driving lights, one of the Aussie company\u2019s most popular models worldwide that weighs only 560g per light. Retails for R4500.&lt;br&gt;* Two Front Runner Wolf Pack storage containers (R204 each), in a 4WD Truckin\u2019 Company canvas transit bag (R880) and two tie-down straps (R300).&lt;br&gt;* Caska multimedia and entertainment system with (unexpectedly) capable TomTom mapping, Subaru approved product (R11 999).&lt;br&gt;* Fuel consumption on trip: 12,3 litres\/100km.&lt;br&gt;* Range @ consumption (includes extra 40-litres of fuel): About 812km.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Witwater - Waterberg paradise&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set on the banks of the Phalala river, about 50km from Mookgophong in the Limpopo province, Witwater Safari Lodge and Spa offers a five-star experience in the beautiful Waterberg mountains.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the amazing game viewing opportunities, Witwater\u2019s main lodge offers an unforgettable holiday experience, with friendly staff that treat guests like royalty. Accommodation ranges from suites, tented suites and lodge suites to self-catering options. Prices start from R625 per person for the self-catering house, which can be hired at R5000 a night for up to eight people. At the other end of the scale, the full board option in the most luxurious of suites costs up to R3000 per person per night (single).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is a highlight, serving gourmet meals. The lodge also puts on outstanding braais in the lapa area.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another attraction is the luxurious spa, situated next to the main lodge. Here you can treat yourself to a long list of beauty and relaxation therapies.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.witwater.com;\"&gt;www.witwater.com;&lt;\/a&gt; e-mail &lt;a href=\"mailto:info@witwater.com\"&gt;info@witwater.com&lt;\/a&gt;; Tel. 011 675-2000.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pocket-sized contact list&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.subaru.co.za\"&gt;www.subaru.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.4wdtruckin.co.za\"&gt;www.4wdtruckin.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.frontrunner.co.za\"&gt;www.frontrunner.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.hankook.co.za\"&gt;www.hankook.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.planetworld.co.za\"&gt;www.planetworld.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.plastidipsa.co.za\"&gt;www.plastidipsa.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.oppositelock.co.za\"&gt;www.oppositelock.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.witwater.co.za\"&gt;www.witwater.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Did you know?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are approximately 180 species of chameleon.

It has the power to inspire. It has the power to unite people in a way that little else does. It speaks to youth in a language they understand. Sport can create hope, where once there was only despair.\u201d The speech has become the driving force for the Laureus Movement, of which Mandela was the first patron.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years on there is still South African interest among the award winners that were announced at the ceremony in Shanghai recently, with &lt;strong&gt;Schalk Burger&lt;\/strong&gt; winning \u2018&lt;strong&gt;Comeback Of The Year&lt;\/strong&gt;\u2019 after surviving life-threatening bacterial meningitis to return to international rugby. After a stint in intensive care he made a remarkable comeback to the South African team in 2014. He played against Australia and New Zealand in the Rugby Championship and was then named man of the match in the November victory over England, in which he scored the decisive third try.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/NJ%20Laureus%20schalk-burger-option-2-456215904.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other award winners include:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOVAK DJOKOVIC&lt;\/strong&gt; - SPORTSMAN OF THE YEAR&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djokovic (who was also Laureus Sportsman of the Year Award in 2012) won Wimbledon for the second time, defeating Roger Federer in the final in five sets.

Surely there\u2019s no other explanation for why a human being would push his body to such limits, in a faraway country\u2014battling politics, Delhi belly and harsh terrain.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Grier sets the record straight and explains the challenges and rewards of this 93-day journey and what he and his team found after nearly 4 000 kilometres.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was not your first expedition. How did it all start?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it\u2019s my sixth! It all started way back when I began looking for certain things in my personal life and trying to find out more about myself and the effect I was having on people. As a South African, I just stood back, reflected and thought: \u201cI\u2019m gonna shut up. I\u2019m not gonna moan and complain, I\u2019m gonna put up my hand and I\u2019m going to do something.\u201d It\u2019s not a question of saying and moaning; it\u2019s a question of showing and doing.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use adventure expeditions as a tool. People are suffering from donor fatigue: Everyone is knocking on doors and wanting this and that, but this is a way of engaging the broader public. Through doing this event, one captures the imagination of the people.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a bit about the charities you work with, and how running across India helps them.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work with Cipla\u2019s Miles for Smiles: We do the miles to create the smiles. Through these trips, we create awareness, which leads to fund raising. Through all these journeys we have done, and other adventurers who have also joined Miles for Smiles, we have helped facilitate close on 2 000 surgeries.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lost%20and%20Found%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What inspired the trip to India?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think, from a Westerner\u2019s perspective, we always go to a place like India to search for that deep entrenched spirituality, the ancient wisdom, and just to see how people who have nothing cope and how they accept what they have in life. With such a mass of people, they somehow deal with it. The different religions\u2014Muslim, Hindi, Christian\u2014all live in harmony and have this respect for one other. I think I was searching for that as well, that harmony. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why run?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love running; it is a form of mental calmness and meditation. From a physiological point of view, you get into a zone where the body just floats and it is perfecting the mind and body working in unison. To be calm mentally and physically and achieving that calm motion, just coming in sync and carrying on for however long you are challenged to. It is its own sort of harmony.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you choose your route?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On these journeys, you know where you are going to start and you know where you want to finish. On previous journeys, I have tried to plan what happens in the middle\u2014but you can\u2019t. You have control over the first step and the last step, but everything in between takes its own course and depends on conditions of weather, it depends on route, mountain ranges, lakes and rivers. With all these obstacles, you just have to track the shortest possible way through them. It\u2019s nice because you don\u2019t know what tomorrow holds.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lost%20and%20Found%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crew members who have been with me through most of these journeys understand how I work and are constantly tracking and re-tracking. When we map a day, there are different things we look at: water, terrain, altitude\u2014which we try and sync with roads. We have to try to bounce off water, go to villages for supplies, but also find the most direct route because on foot you have no obstacles\u2014you can run it, climb it or swim it. Sometimes, getting the car around the country is the hardest part and I won\u2019t see it for a week or two weeks at a time!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ninety-three days is a long time\u2014where do you find provisions and equipment? &nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We arrive in a country and we buy whatever we need, from cooking and camping equipment, food and the vehicle. We stock up the car when possible and live like locals.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my rucksack I never carry food, maybe just a tin of sardines. The longest I have been without food is three days, and I just push on. You are running about 50km a day and you just carry on, a bite of banana here and there. There was a stage when Nick [Heygate] and I had one tin of sardines between us per day for a week, and the one tin gave me food poisoning! It becomes as much a mental game as a physical one when you have to go without food for so long.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India has by far been my greatest mental challenge. I wanted to give up three times; I ended up in hospital after my bladder ruptured, then it happened again\u2014and I just wanted to give up. There were so many things that went wrong, that I really didn\u2019t think I was going to finish this expedition. But luckily, the crew got me through it.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the biggest challenge on a trip like this?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sickness. We worked out that we functioned at no more than 60-65% of our total potential throughout the trip. We had this handicap where 35% of our ability was taken out because of illness. There wasn\u2019t one day that one of us wasn\u2019t sick and vomiting or suffering from a tummy bug; not one day that someone in the crew wasn\u2019t sick. And it came in cycles; we would laugh, but then a few days later it would be someone else and you weren\u2019t laughing anymore. Even Nick, who claimed he was from Durban [and immune to tummy bugs], eventually fell prey!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter what, you have to keep moving; you cannot stop because then you lose that mental strength. Even if it\u2019s just 3km down the road, you have to keep moving and keep positive because, as soon as you give in, it\u2019s a massive chink in your armour, in your mental game.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lost%20and%20Found%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it about this trip that made it different from your previous journeys?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the demise of humanity around me and seeing how people cope and come to terms with it, no matter what it is. It had an adverse effect on me, seeing people who were dealing with their difficulties. I felt that, mentally, I wasn\u2019t able to cope with what was going on around me. The combination of this and illness gave rise to a mental fight within myself\u2014until I met people along the way who said certain things to me and gave me back that mental strength and a new self-belief.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had just come out of hospital and could hardly move, when a guy said to me: \u201cYou are suffering.\u201d I started crying and broke down right in front of this old Hindu priest, and he said: \u201cMy friend, if you have reason for why you are suffering and what you are going through, then you are no longer suffering because you have reason.\u201d And I remembered the cause and why I was there, and that I chose to be there. That was the difference out in India: There was mental fodder to feed me.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What logistics are involved in going around a country while running 45km a day?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You live, touch, eat, feel, smell the culture every day. You are immersed in the culture and the country. We sleep in the villages, in shacks, in tents along the road. We live like locals, we eat their food, and we learn all the tricks. That is the only way you survive on the road like this, and are able to move those distances like we do\u2014you become a local. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were the spiritual aspects of this trip?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no place in the world that has spirituality so deeply entrenched in every form of culture as India, so it touches you all the time. Every day and every hour you pass a mosque or a shrine. There are more than 1 000 gods, and every day you pass people carrying a little tree-god or rock-god; little groups of people and migrations of spirituality. And the cows! All dressed up. It\u2019s all around you, and you can\u2019t help but be spirituality affected by it all.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You lost 23 kilos! How do you prepare your body for that?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can\u2019t prepare yourself; you are basically eating your own muscles.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your favourite part of India?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"float-left\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lost%20and%20Found%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"297\" height=\"385\" style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t think I really have a favourite part because it is so different. You have Kashmir with the mountains, the snow and the rivers that are a crystal-clear glacial blue; into Rajasthan with the desert and its beautifully dressed people and the forts and castles\u2014so stark and contrasting; then you have Maharashtra and the mountains; and then Goa and the ocean opens up next to you. So it was an amazing, rewarding journey in that sense. I love the ocean and I love the mountains, but Rajasthan probably stuck with me the most, as it is in beautiful disrepair. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had quite a few run-ins with local authorities\u2014how did you handle those?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were picked up eight times by the local authorities\u2014on the first night and it just became worse. We were accused of everything from robbing an accident scene to gunrunning. The locals would report us and say they saw us stealing stuff or selling guns, because they would get rewards for tipping off the police. &nbsp;But you just have to deal with it.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One time the team told the authorities I was a famous South African cricketer and that I was running to join up with the Indian Premier League. The next day we were invited to a cricket tournament and I had to hand out the prizes at the end of the day! Andy [Stuart] and I even had to make a speech: He pulled out a speech about Gandhi and Madiba. From villain to hero we went!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your book &lt;em&gt;India: Lost and Found&lt;\/em&gt;, you write about a lady you met on the street, an \u201cuntouchable\u201d. How did she affect you and your journey?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She summed up so much about life for me. She was from a lower seventh caste and I wanted to give her money. She said she didn\u2019t want money or anything\u2014she just wanted my hand. So I gave her my hand and she pulled it against her chest and looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, \u201cAt the end of the day, all I want is love, appreciation and acceptance.\u201d These were all the things she had been denied as part of the seventh caste. That\u2019s what I left India with: this thought that all we need in life is love, acceptance and appreciation. As low down and humble as she was, she gave me the deepest insights. That\u2019s India. It\u2019s the people\u2014the incredible, loving, wise old people\u2014who have such ancient wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back to the beginning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grier is now training to run North Korea, South Korea and the Great Wall of China in reverse\u2014ending where he started 10 years ago.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More miles for more smiles&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;em&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/em&gt; contributor, Chris Bertish, is the newest Miles for Smiles ambassador. \u201cI am honoured to represent such a worthy cause\u2026 I like to try and inspire people into believing in what\u2019s possible, no matter the adversity or struggle, or obstacles you are up against. If you truly believe it and have the courage to try, anything is possible,\u201d he said as he geared up on 6 January to break the 24-hour stand-up paddleboard world record by attempting to paddle 170km in one day from Cape Point to between Saldanha and Paternoster on the Cape West Coast, in association with Miles for Smiles. (Unfortunately, Mother Nature didn\u2019t play along and the record attempt had to be postponed.)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/ipadedition92.jpg?itok=hjMONVw-\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;The Intrepid explorer&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9597\" class=\"publisher-1340 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/high\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;On High&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    On High  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"On High\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/wild_magazine.htm' target='_blank' style='background-color: #b7cb35' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wild.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Cape%20Canopy%20MAIN.jpg?itok=pSt42RPT\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/high\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/high\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/high&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Cape%20Canopy%20MAIN.jpg&amp;description=On High\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/high\" data-text=\"On High\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/high\" data-title=\"On High\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Fiona McIntosh pics Shaen Adey&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cape Canopy Tour leader Ricardo Juries beamed as he set the scene. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve done the briefing and kitted you up, we\u2019re going on a 4x4 journey into the heart of the Cape Floral Kingdom, a Unesco World Heritage Site. You\u2019ll be going to the upper reaches of the Riviersonderend Gorge, to a place few others have ever seen.\u201d &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His enthusiasm is infectious. As he explained how a series of ziplines would carry us safely from platform to platform high above the gorge, his sense of pride and wonder was palpable. He has every right to be proud. This newly opened canopy tour in the Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve, in partnership with CapeNature, offers a unique way to enjoy a previously inaccessible area without having an impact on the environment.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ride up, on a steep stony path to the top of the mountain, was fabulous. Wonderful pink erica clothed the slopes, little sugar birds flitted from protea to protea and, as we gained height, we could see right down the tannin-stained river and across the reserve to the Elgin Valley.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later we were disgorged from the vehicle and followed Ricardo to the first platform where he secured us to a safety rail. \u201cVicky will go first,\u201d he explained. \u201cOnce she\u2019s set up the safety braking system I\u2019ll clip you in and send you over one by one. It\u2019s easy, just sit in your harness, relax and enjoy the view. You can control your speed by pressing down on the cable with your gloved hand.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I volunteered to go next and stepped up onto the launchpad as Ricardo clipped in the safety lines and attached the pulley that would run along the cable. \u201cThis is a fairly slow slide. You shouldn\u2019t need to brake, but Vicky will signal whether she wants you to go faster or slower as you approach. If you don\u2019t make it all the way across you can always turn round and pull yourself &nbsp;to the platform.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The radio cackled. Ricardo gave me a thumbs up and I gingerly stepped into the void. \u201cWheeeeee!\u201d It was exhilarating stuff and I managed to control my speed so as to land gently on the platform. As I watched the others coming across I had time to take in the surroundings, the incredible weathered rock formations, the dripping moss, the tiny flowers in the crevices of the sheer cliff on which the wooden platform is secured and the little lizards sunning themselves on the rock.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDid you know that the Hottentots Holland mountains are home to the only known population of the endemic dwarf crag lizard?\u201d Ricardo asked. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you if I see one.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a slick operation. As soon as Vicky arrived at the platform she squeezed past us on an independent safety line and clipped in for the next slide. Confident after the first run, we quickly followed as soon as she radioed in.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cape%20Canopy%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cape Canopy Tour is the latest addition to the canopy tour brand, which already has operations in Tsitsikamma, Magaliesberg, Karkloof, Drakensberg, Magoebaskloof and Swaziland\u2019s Malolotja Reserve. In this case the term \u2018canopy tour\u2019 is a misnomer as the slides are all out in the open, but all seven canopy tours are designed to showcase the natural environment of their particular locations.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, in the indigenous forest of the Tsitsikamma, opened in 2001. It was the brainchild of Mark Brown, a civil engineer who had been involved in constructing similar cable slides in Costa Rica to allow scientists to go about their work in the otherwise inaccessible treetops.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe construction of the Cape Canopy Tour was a huge task that took about nine months,\u201d said co-owner Ryan Larkman. \u201cEvery cable was pulled across the valley by a team of local guys. Once each cable was secured, that line was used to transport the wood and other materials needed to construct the subsequent platforms and lines. We basically built as we went.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2014 all 11 slides and 13 platforms were in place and the first guests were treated to a bird\u2019s eye view of Hottentots Holland.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we reached the fourth slide Ricardo said, \u201cLook down to your left as you go. You\u2019ll see a lovely waterfall and pool.\u201d Ricardo has lived in Grabouw all his life, but until a few months ago had never been up here. \u201cI still can\u2019t get over how beautiful these mountains are. Before I was taken on as a guide I was working at a clothing store in Grabouw. Now every day I work in nature. I love it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAt the moment we employ 18 staff, all from the local area, five of whom are women. Each staff member was first trained and assessed on the safety operating procedures of the system, followed by first aid, and then field guide training to learn about the interpretive art of guiding in a nature reserve. We want each client to feel absolutely safe, but also learn something new about nature and this amazing place that we call home,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAs we grow, we will continue to hire locally and develop our guides as part of the company ethos.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get a better view of the waterfall 50 metres below from the suspension bridge between platforms seven and eight and there\u2019s a surprise in store at platform nine when Vicky serves up Elgin Ice Tea and biscuits. Then it\u2019s a few more fast slides to the final platform.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kilometre-long uphill walk out goes quickly, the guides stopping often to point out the major fynbos species that we encounter on the rocky path. By lunchtime we\u2019re back at the centre enjoying a cool drink and light meal. I felt privileged to have \u2018flown\u2019 across such an incredible part of the world and have a feeling tickets for this new tour will fly out too, so book ahead!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trip Planner&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get there&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;The Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve is about an hour\u2019s drive from Cape Town. Take the N2 over Sir Lowry\u2019s Pass and opposite the Peregrine Farm Stall turn left onto the R321 towards Grabouw. About 1km on, turn right to follow the R321 towards Villiersdorp. After about 11km you\u2019ll see the sign for the reserve on the left.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost&lt;\/strong&gt; R555 for WildCard holders, otherwise R595 a person.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookings&lt;\/strong&gt; 021-300-0501 &lt;a href=\"mailto:info@capecanopytour.co.za\"&gt;info@capecanopytour.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/capecanopytour.co.za\"&gt;http:\/\/capecanopytour.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;3 to 4 hours depending on the size of the group. There are 13 platforms and slides up to 320m long.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiking&lt;\/strong&gt; Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve has fabulous day and overnight hiking trails as well as kloofing for those with experience or a guide. For more information visit &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.capenature.co.za.\u00a0\"&gt;www.capenature.co.za.\u00a0&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mountain Biking&lt;\/strong&gt; The 22km Groenlandberg Trail starts at the reserve\u2019s Nuweberg gate. The Elgin Valley is mountainbiking paradise, so bring your bike if you enjoy exploring on two wheels.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;There are four huts for hikers in the reserve, but Wild recommends driving drive back to Stellenbosch to stay over in the manor house at CapeNature\u2019s Assegaaibosch Nature Reserve. It is a national monument and you\u2019ll be putting your Wild Card to good use twice in one day. Self-catering rates start at R1 130 a night for up to four people.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cape%20Canopy%20end.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"771\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/blog.htm?action=view-post&amp;id=4662\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wild Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/763\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hottentots Holland Reserve&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/750\"&gt;Assegaaibosch Nature Reserve&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2044\"&gt;Tsitsikamma Canopy Tours&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1269\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1556\"&gt;Magaliesberg Canopy Tours&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1269\"&gt;Karkloof Canopy Tours&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3726\"&gt;Drakensberg Canopy Tour&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

They then travelled to Heathrow, from where they flew to Nairobi aboard Kenya Airways\u2019 new Dreamliner, before connecting to Johannesburg and completing the journey to their new home at the Born Free Big Cat Rescue and Education Centre at Shamwari Game Reserve, just outside of Port Elizabeth.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lionesses%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in 2006, Maggie and Sonja spent the first eight years of their lives at a circus in Germany. Along with regular performances, they spent the rest of their time confined to a circus trailer in appalling conditions. When the animals were confiscated by the German authorities in 2013, the Natuurhulpcentrum (a Belgian Centre for the rescue and rehabilitation of wild animals) stepped in and offered them temporary accommodation. They were at the Centre for about a year undergoing rehabilitation and being treated for wounds sustained whilst living in the circus, before being declared fit to travel to a permanent new home in Africa.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lionesses%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at Kenya Airways was extremely proud to be involved with this relocation project of Africa\u2019s king of the jungle, and to be able to offer Maggie and Sonja passage to Africa as part of the launch of their new Dreamliner, operating between London and Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital city.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey King, Marketing Manager of the airline based in Johannesburg, said: \u201cWe are delighted to have our new Dreamliner operating out of London Heathrow but to have such special passengers on board made this is a truly memorable flight.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On arrival in Johannesburg, the lionesses were transported to their new home at the award winning Shamwari Game Reserve.

All three self-catering bush lodges are similar in design, made from pine, and feel light and airy inside despite not being very large. Lots of windows let in the light, and each has a deck overlooking a scenic section of the reserve. They all have an open-plan kitchen and living room, hot showers and two bedrooms.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest Lodge sleeps four and is encased in a grove of milkwoods that grow up through the deck and drape over the roof; staying here, you\u2019re truly hemmed in by nature. The five-sleeper Vlei Lodge sits on the edge of a picturesque pond, so it\u2019s the best choice for birders. River Lodge (which sleeps six) is perched high on a dune overlooking the river. It may have a smaller deck than the other two, but definitely has the best views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rates:&lt;\/strong&gt; Self-catering from R975 for a four-sleeper cabin off-peak; from R1 250 in peak season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;\/strong&gt; Tel 021 483 0190, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.capenature.co.za\"&gt;www.capenature.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.

The only exception are the turquoise swimming towels, bright white linen and comfortable cots.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four cottages sleep eight in total, with two others designated as kitchen (with a fridge, hot water basin and store brimming with pots, pans and cutlery) and cooking\/dining area (with two huge stone fireplaces, gas hobs and a long dining table). No matter how many people you are, your group will have exclusive use of the reserve, so you won\u2019t have to share facilities. There\u2019s no cellphone reception or electricity, but you won\u2019t mind about that when you see the views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rates:&lt;\/strong&gt; Self-catering from R655 a person a night (minimum two-night stay).&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;\/strong&gt; Tel 083 261 1934, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.redcederberg.co.za\"&gt;www.redcederberg.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8.

In the middle of Mokala, off the beaten track and far from the two main camps, lies a small wooden cabin with a double bed and tiny bathroom, perched halfway up a copse of camelthorn trees. Don\u2019t get a fright if a giraffe pokes its nose into the window while you\u2019re snoozing. It\u2019s basic and modestly equipped, but at sunset a waterhole in front of the treehouse lures thirsty gemsbok, buffalo, kudu and the occasional rhino. At night, it\u2019s just you, your partner, the stars, the flicker of flames and the howl of hyenas.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates: Self-catering from R550 per person sharing a night&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact: Tel 053 204 0158, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.sanparks.org\"&gt;www.sanparks.org&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.getaway.co.za\/travel-ideas\/places-to-stay\/cosy-cabins-for-a-winter-break\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Getaway Blog&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/759\"&gt;Goukamma Nature Reserve&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/799\"&gt;Mokala National Park&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.getaway.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/getaway-may-2015-320.jpg?itok=Ho0Jmu4R\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Getaway&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;Featured blog provided by Getaway Magazine&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9657\" class=\"publisher-1338 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/niseko-best-ski-destination-japan\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Niseko, the best ski destination in Japan&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Niseko, the best ski destination in Japan  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Niseko, the best ski destination in Japan\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.doitnow.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #d22127' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/din.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/L%20M%20Niseko.jpg?itok=4ZYokQIF\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/niseko-best-ski-destination-japan\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/niseko-best-ski-destination-japan\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/niseko-best-ski-destination-japan&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/L%20M%20Niseko.jpg&amp;description=Niseko, the best ski destination in Japan\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/niseko-best-ski-destination-japan\" data-text=\"Niseko, the best ski destination in Japan\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/niseko-best-ski-destination-japan\" data-title=\"Niseko, the best ski destination in Japan\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Rupert Orchard&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niseko\u2019s reputation as one of the best powder-skiing destinations in world and the only truly international ski resort in Japan were recognised last year when it was &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/htholidays.com\/blog\/view\/niseko-clean-sweep-in-the-world-ski-awards\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;awarded Japan\u2019s Best Ski Resort at the World Ski Awards&lt;\/a&gt;.

Michelin star chefs and wine and whisky sommeliers call Niseko home, lured by the natural beauty of the region, the quality of local produce and a diverse international clientele.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to world-class skiing and dining, the area is blessed with a bounty of mineral-rich hot spring water and an array of traditional &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/htholidays.com\/guest-services\/view\/onsen-information\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Japanese &lt;em&gt;onsen&lt;\/em&gt; &lt;\/a&gt;(public baths), which have become as much a part of the apr\u00e8s ski culture as a glass of Gl\u00fchwein on the Austrian ski slopes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niseko\u2019s growth in international popularity over the last ten years has given rise to the development of many premium hotels, condos and holiday services. New accommodations are frequently appearing in the area, however there are a few options that are truly a cut above the rest for quality and value.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Top 5 accommodations in Niseko&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sekka Kan&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-image-source: initial; border-image-slice: initial; border-image-width: initial; border-image-outset: initial; border-image-repeat: initial;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"float-right\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Niseko%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"270\" height=\"180\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/sekkakanniseko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sekka Kan&lt;\/a&gt; was judged to be &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/htholidays.com\/blog\/view\/niseko-clean-sweep-in-the-world-ski-awards\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Japan\u2019s best ski chalet at last year\u2019s World Ski Awards &lt;\/a&gt;and for good reason too. The beautifully designed boutique apartment block sits in the centre of Niseko\u2019s Hirafu village, a short walk to the Ace Family chairlift and just steps from some of Niseko\u2019s best restaurant and bars. Despite this, the location offers maximum privacy and comfort.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apartments combine the best of Western luxury living and contemporary Japanese design with high ceilings, the latest appliances and Nespresso machines. The real winner for us, however, is the top-floor balcony jacuzzi. Ski the deep Japanese powder all day and follow it up with a relaxing soak in the outdoor tub, a couple of drinks and stunning views of the nearby volcano Mt. Yotei.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ki Niseko&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/kiniseko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ki Niseko&lt;\/a&gt; is a stylish boutique ski-in ski-out resort hotel, with doorstep access to Niseko\u2019s world-class powder skiing. Only 50 metres from the Niseko Grand Hirafu high-speed gondola, it\u2019s the perfect location for the kind of skier who values convenience and time on the slopes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img class=\"float-left\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Niseko%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"270\" height=\"179\"&gt;&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better still, the private ski valet means you can step through the door after a big day of riding and pass your equipment straight to the friendly staff for overnight tuning and care. Add premium Japanese dining, a &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/kiniseko.com\/en\/nisekos-best-onsen\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;private onsen&lt;\/a&gt; and stunning mountain views to the mix and it\u2019s not hard to see why this new hotel has people talking.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yama Shizen&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a stay at &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/yamashizenniseko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Yama Shizen &lt;\/a&gt;is that you get the whole Niseko experience. A mere four-minute walk to the Hirafu high-speed gondola, its upper-village location also offers easy access to a range of restaurants and bars that sit in the vicinity of the 39-apartment complex.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guests can also make use of the on-snow ski valet service that\u2019s included when you stay, which enables you to drop off your gear right next to the gondola before taking a relaxed stroll back to the apartment. Yama Shizen rooms offer the best in quality, comfort and privacy, making it an excellent choice for a worry-free stay in one of the world\u2019s best powder destinations.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nozomi Views&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brand new for the 2014\/15 ski season, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/nozomiviewsniseko.com\/niseko\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Nozomi Views&lt;\/a&gt; sets the bar for modern luxury alpine accommodation.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"float-right\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Niseko%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"270\" height=\"180\" style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify; border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located on Niseko\u2019s main road (Hirafu Zaka), the apartment is as stylish as it is convenient, with the Ace Family Chairlift just a two-minute walk from the property. It\u2019s also perfectly located to take in one of the best views of Mt. Yotei, and sits adjacent to Niseko\u2019s premier ski rental and retail facility, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/htholidays.com\/guest-services\/view\/ski-and-snowboard-rental-rhythm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Rhythm Snowsports&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Youtei Tracks&lt;\/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/youteitracksniseko.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Youtei Tracks&lt;\/a&gt; is an iconic Niseko building in a premium, upper-village location. Completed in 2006, the units feature large windows allowing for maximum natural light, furnishings that have been hand selected by Australian interior designer Lynn Malone, plus premium appliances and facilities.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complex contains a ski room with a fully-equipped tuning bench, however guests may prefer to use the complimentary, on-snow ski valet service instead.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if you are a bit of a powder hound or just want to try out a new sport in this stunning part of the world, skiing in Niseko, Japan, should absolutely be up there on your bucket list.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More information&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information on booking premium accommodation in Niseko, visit the &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/htholidays.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;HT Holidays website&lt;\/a&gt;

Russia chair the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and therefore hold the key to granting Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in the Antarctic Ocean.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the need to appeal to Russia, Pugh said;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Russia has a distinguished history in Antarctica. There are five Antarctic seas named after Russians, and nine Russian scientific bases in operation there. If anyone understands the beauty and the fragility of Antarctica, they do.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%203_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The aim of the 5 swims campaign was to bring the beauty and fragility of Antarctica into the hearts and minds of people around the world. Over the next few months I will be shuttling between CCAMLR nations urging policy makers in those key nations to agree the MPA in the Ross Sea \u2013 and moreover to agree to a network of effective MPAs in Antarctica. My first port of call will be the Kremlin. Russia has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lead the world in preserving the waters around Antarctica. It would be a bold move, and it would send a positive, and peaceful, ripple around the globe.\"&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pugh has reason to feel optimistic ahead of his visit to The Kremlin as his efforts have captured the imagination of a nation \u2013 with constant media coverage in Russia following his expedition.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%204_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In scenes reminiscent of the 'ping pong diplomacy' of the 1970s, Pugh will be greeted in Russia by Slava Fetisov, one of Russia's greatest sporting heroes and former sports minister.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the appeal of Lewis Pugh to Russia, Fetisov commented;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our nation and people have a long-standing love and appreciation of Antarctica and Lewis' extreme display of human endurance demonstrates that this is a love shared around the world. Now more than ever we must find common ground on the major issues facing the world and I look forward to welcoming Lewis to Moscow to discuss the future.\"&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%205_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on completing his five swims challenge, Pugh added \"The last swim was tough, especially given the limited recovery time after the bruising encounter in the Bay of Whales. I am exhausted and sailing home, but this is just the beginning \u2013 we have to influence the decision makers and Russia is crucial.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are those who will say that the world is entering a 'new Cold War'. They will argue that Russia is distracted by pressing conflicts closer to home. I say that there is no more pressing issue right now than the protection of our global resources. If we get this right, it could have wider, positive ramifications \u2013 beyond the oceans \u2013 for international relations.\"&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Lewis\u2019s progress via his website, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lewispugh.com\"&gt;www.lewispugh.com&lt;\/a&gt; Twitter @LewisPugh #5Swims and Facebook \u2013 Lewis Pugh.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information visit - &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.lewispugh.com\u00a0\"&gt;www.lewispugh.com\u00a0&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%2012%20map.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Route&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swim 1 - &lt;strong&gt;Campbell Island&lt;\/strong&gt; | 13 Feb&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long distance swim along Perseverance Harbour, a fjord in Campbell Island. The island, situated at 52\u00ba South, is a UNESCO World Heritage site with a large colony of Southern Royal Albatrosses and three penguins species \u2013 Eastern Rockhoppers, Erect-Crested and Yellow-Eyed Penguins.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%205_0.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swim 2 - &lt;strong&gt;Cape Adare&lt;\/strong&gt; | 19 Feb&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first long distance swim around Cape Adare at 71\u00ba South. If successful, this swim will break the world record for the most southerly long distance swim ever undertaken. Cape Adare is the site of the first wintering by explorers on the Antarctic Continent. It's also home to the largest colony of Ad\u00e9lie penguins in the world. More than 250,000 pairs breed there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swim 3 - &lt;strong&gt;Cape Evans&lt;\/strong&gt; | 23 Feb (cancelled because of atrocious weather with gale force winds)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cape Evans is situated at 77.6\u00ba South and is where Captain Robert Falcon Scott, the British explorer, built a hut before racing the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen to the South Pole in 1911. Tragically, Scott died on the journey back with 4 colleagues. Lewis will have the privilege of preparing to swim around Cape Evans, in this historic building, which is still much the same as it was left over 100 years ago.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swim 4 - &lt;strong&gt;Bay of Whales&lt;\/strong&gt; | 28 Feb&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most southern swim possible (there is no open sea further south in the world) at the Bay of Whales at 78.5\u00ba South. This bay was named by explorer Sir Ernst Shackleton due to the large number of killer whales seen in the area.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swim 5 - &lt;strong&gt;Peter I Island&lt;\/strong&gt; | 6 Mar&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis' final swim will be at Peter I Island, which is in the Bellingshausen Sea at 69\u00ba South. This volcanic island is surrounded by pack ice for most of the year and is home to three seal species (Crab-eater, Southern-elephant, and the formidable Leopard Seal), is a breeding ground for southern fulmars, and is visited by Ad\u00e9lie and Chinstrap penguins.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9614\" class=\"publisher-1335 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/down-river-0\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Down by the River&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Down by the River  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Down by the River\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #222222' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/cl.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Port%20Alfred%20LM.jpg?itok=pEWAG7N_\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/down-river-0\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/down-river-0\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/down-river-0&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Port%20Alfred%20LM.jpg&amp;description=Down by the River\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/down-river-0\" data-text=\"Down by the River\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/down-river-0\" data-title=\"Down by the River\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words and pics Marion Whitehead&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This jolly bunch is always ready to party and the small Eastern Cape seaside town\u2019s 125th birthday last year was celebrated with a regatta, an anything-that-floats derby, a grub crawl and a grand parade along the riverbank, joined by a fleet of antique tractors from the Bathurst Agricultural Museum nearby.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular holiday destination was once an important river port, with tall-masted sailing ships mooring at the wharf. When dredging the Kowie River mouth became too expensive, smaller fishing vessels dominated the port \u2013 until local fishing quotas were awarded elsewhere. These days, boating for pleasure and sport on the 22 kilometres of navigable river is where the action is. Wharf Street has become a small waterfront attraction with its own microbrewery, restaurants, a tiny theatre, antiques and collectables shops and, of course, a fish and chip shop.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur boat is tiny,\u201d Maryna Shepherd, a teacher at the local high school for the last 16 years, told me over a tasty alfresco lunch at Zest Caf\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s just got a 2HP engine, but we like to putter up the river to fish on weekends.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kowie River rises in the hills around Grahamstown and meanders to the coast, eventually meeting the sea between a man-made breakwater and a pier frequented by anglers. A sunset river-cruise boat chugged along at a sedate pace past numerous private jetties, to game farms where tangled riverine vegetation tumbles down steep cliffs. I was admiring a magnificent Fish Eagle swooping down for its catch when we were overtaken by a sleek rowing boat. Powered by a team of fit young oarsmen, it sliced through the water at speed, leaving us in its wake. I had to laugh out loud.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Port%20Alfred%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mansfield Park manager Pierre Joubert and his staff, Francina Potgieter and rangers Edward de Kock and Gerhard Visagie, offer guided game drives.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth is, there\u2019s room for whatever floats your boat on the Kowie River, posh or humble. There are millionaires\u2019 yachts parked in the small craft harbour next to the Royal Alfred Marina, but no one minds if you launch your canoe from there. In the bar at the Ski Boat Club across the river, postmen rub shoulders with magistrates in this fishermen\u2019s lair.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYou can also launch your boat from the public slipway just here behind the tourist info office,\u201d said tourism director Sandy Birch. \u201cIn December, it\u2019s also the end point of the Kowie River Mile swim. And at Christmas, just watch out for a naked Father Christmas skiing down the river in his Christmas hat.\u201d The annual prank is supposed to be hush-hush, but Sandy laughed and admitted that everyone knew about it.This is a town of great contrasts existing side by side, Sandy said. Shacks in Nemato settlement have the same splendid views as the grand old settler mansions high on the riverbanks. Stenden University\u2019s Dutch and German students, together with trainee pilots from 43 Air School just up the road, have brought a new vibrancy to a town once dominated by retirees.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, water sports are big and, apart from surfing at East Beach and swimming on the Blue Flag Kelly\u2019s Beach, at Outdoor Focus Adventure Centre you can organise anything from diving to hydrobiking and adrenaline sea cruises on which wet suits&nbsp;are standard issue.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the delights for families is Kiddies Beach, a sheltered lagoon next door to Outdoor Focus. It\u2019s the kind of place where you can put up your umbrella for a lazy picnic and let little ones paddle, build sandcastles and swim safely while you relax with a good book.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the Eastern Cape\u2019s Sunshine Coast, Port Alfred claims to have one of the Cape\u2019s highest numbers of sunshine days beaming down on its spectacular beaches. However, when the weather doesn\u2019t play ball, Sandy sends visitors off to explore the plethora of junk shops and restaurants \u2013 many staffed by students and graduates of Stenden, the Dutch hospitality university that has its South African campus in Port Alfred.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Port%20Alfred%203.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It\u2019s paradise on water at the upmarket Royal Alfred Marina, where the homes have private jetties.&lt;\/em&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delroy Chipumuro, ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at the Wharf Street Brew Pub, is a Stenden graduate from Zimbabwe. \u201cOnce you\u2019re in Port Alfred, you don\u2019t want to leave. It\u2019s so relaxed here,\u201d he said with a grin, placing tasters of local beer in front of me: Kowie Gold Pilsener, Coin Ale and Squires Porter.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stone warehouse in which the pub is found is one of the oldest commercial buildings in town. \u201cIt used to be the customs house and later became the offices of the mayor and council offices. It was even the local movie house for a time,\u201d said chef-owner Bram Coetzee, pulling a pint made in the Little Brewery on the River next door where his dad is the consultant brew master.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kowie History Museum nearby has taken on a new life since it moved into the old railway station, and features pictures of the town before the bridges were built. \u201cThe two halves of town used to be linked only by&nbsp;a pont at the site of what is today Putt Bridge,\u201d said curator Yvonne Surtees. A historic riverside walking trail starts at the museum, where you purchase a pamphlet to guide you along Wharf and Van der Riet streets.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad weather never seems to deter enthusiasts at the Royal Port Alfred Golf Course, which has an unusual team of \u2018lawnmowers\u2019 \u2013 a small herd of impala that takes little notice of birdies and eagles. It\u2019s one of just four golf courses in South Africa to have the title \u2018royal\u2019 bestowed on it after British royalty enjoyed games there in the 1920s.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kowie, as Port Alfred is fondly referred to by locals, is a place that exerts the same kind of pull that the tides have on fishermen. Pierre Joubert worked across the world \u2013 Botswana, Namibia and the US \u2013 after completing his internship as a field guide at Port Alfred\u2019s Mansfield Private Game Reserve. But when the job of manager at the small private reserve on the Kowie River was advertised, he didn\u2019t hesitate to apply. \u201cI didn\u2019t think twice. I like the little town and, because it\u2019s a small reserve, we do everything and have personal contact with the guests,\u201d he explained.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianne and Rob Field, owners of Panorama B&amp;B on a hill high above the river, landed up here because of a small advert in COUNTRY LIFE. \u201cIt showed a jetty at sunset,\u201d said Rob, explaining that the couple were running a guest lodge in Namibia at the time and wanted to scale down. They visited and were hooked.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe looked at lots of little coastal towns, but Port Alfred has everything you need,\u201d added Marianne. \u201cThere are even game reserves around here, so we don\u2019t miss out on that either. There\u2019s lots to do, so I\u2019m never bored.\u201d Down by the riverside, life just couldn\u2019t get better.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source:&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\/subscribe\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Country Life&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1472\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Port Alfred Diving&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3727\"&gt;Duneboarding - Port Alfred&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3658\"&gt;Hydrobiking, Port Alfred&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;

Even with emergency beacons and flares, a rescue could take a few hours, depending on place, conditions and accuracy of information.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is important for paddlers to know that there are three phases to a rescue operation:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.initiation,&lt;br&gt;2.general search&lt;br&gt;3.and specific location of the paddler.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Surf%20Ski%20Safety%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Basic safety:&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very difficult to spot someone in the water \u2013 so please make sure that we can see you.

Internal floatation is often an issue.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Take appropriate thermal protection for the conditions that you are paddling in.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Keep an emergency bank bag in the back of your vest with an allan key, bung, cable ties and space blanket.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Make sure that you know what to do in an emergency, have practised it, and know that you can do it when hypothermic.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;If you use a bright hat make sure that it is tied to your PFD. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/mockepaddling.com\/product\/mocke-fly-dry-visor\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;See here: Fly-Dry Visor&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who to call for help:&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Call for help sooner rather than later.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Hypothermia will affect your ability to think faster than you realise.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Have the local NSRI number programmed in your phone&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; (find the number on &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.nsri.org.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.nsri.org.za&lt;\/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Call your friend or family member who is waiting for your return and ask them to call NSRI.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flares:&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hand held flares are brighter and easier to see than pencil flares. They are also easier to use when hypothermic. If you have one flare it is best to keep it until you can see a rescue boat. If two flares, fire one at once and keep the other for when you can see a rescue boat, and if six flares, always keep the last one for when a rescue boat is close.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Surf%20Ski%20Safety%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are three tracking systems, or combinations of systems to consider:&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use a cell phone app such as MySOS&lt;\/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will only work where there is cell coverage, the phone must be a smart phone that you can use in a bag, it must float and must have enough battery life. This can be tracked by family, friends or event organisers.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use an AIS MOB device&lt;\/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is waterproof, has long battery life and lasts for 24 hours after activation. It is expensive but simple to activate and can be seen by all vessels with AIS enabled GPS chart plotters (including NSRI vessels). It gives an exact position. If out of range \u2013 or out of direct line of sight, the signal will not be picked up. The transmitting range is about 4NM depending on conditions.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use a 406MHz PLB device&lt;\/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also expensive, waterproof and the signal is picked up by satellite which sends a message to the local Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre. This can take some time to activate rescue as the satellite must \u2018see it.\u2019 Then the message is sent to the MRCC which will only react if the beacon has been properly registered with the correct details. Because of the time delay it is not ideal for paddlers.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Surf%20Ski%20Safety%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Frequently asked Questions:&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.Stay or swim?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is generally better to stay with your craft as it makes you easier to find and float. Sometimes you may decide to swim \u2013 but if you do this you must know that it will be very hard to spot a head in the water \u2026 and that the distance that you swim will probably be double what you thought you would have to swim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. In or out of the water?&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Whichever keeps you warmest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. When do you call for help?&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Call at the first sign of trouble. NSRI would prefer to respond to someone who thinks that they are in trouble than someone in a bad situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. What info does NSRI need:&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Who you are and where you are. What the trouble is, how many people need help and how much battery life you have in your cell phone. A GPS position and local current and wind would be a great help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Use the buddy system?&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Stay together, help each other and check who has what rescue equipment that can be used.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PeteMarlinsurfski\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;PETE MARLIN SURFSKI RACE&lt;\/a&gt;, part of the World Surfski Series will take place in East London on 14 November 2015.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/mockepaddling.com\/ocean-surf-ski-paddler-safety-precautions\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Mocke Paddling&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/mockepaddling.com\/surfski-school\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/mocke_logo_cover_0.png?itok=AkX4C-BX\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Mocke Paddling&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9652\" class=\"publisher-4123 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/cameron-bellamy-and-his-magnificent-indian-ocean-crossing\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Cameron Bellamy and his magnificent Indian Ocean crossing&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Cameron Bellamy and his magnificent Indian Ocean crossing  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Cameron Bellamy and his magnificent Indian Ocean crossing\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #09906f' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/A%202015%20logo%20s.jpg\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%20Cameron%20Bellamy_0.jpg?itok=4yATc6sH\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/cameron-bellamy-and-his-magnificent-indian-ocean-crossing\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/cameron-bellamy-and-his-magnificent-indian-ocean-crossing\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/cameron-bellamy-and-his-magnificent-indian-ocean-crossing&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%20Cameron%20Bellamy_0.jpg&amp;description=Cameron Bellamy and his magnificent Indian Ocean crossing\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/cameron-bellamy-and-his-magnificent-indian-ocean-crossing\" data-text=\"Cameron Bellamy and his magnificent Indian Ocean crossing\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/cameron-bellamy-and-his-magnificent-indian-ocean-crossing\" data-title=\"Cameron Bellamy and his magnificent Indian Ocean crossing\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;h2&gt;Cameron Bellamy \u2013 part of a team that set the Guinness World Record for the fastest crossing of the Indian Ocean in a rowboat&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a nutshell&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 6720km unassisted row across the Indian Ocean from Geraldton, Australia to Mah\u00e9, Seychelles. The seven-person crew rowed in shifts of two hours on\/two hours off, day and night, for the entire duration of the two-month expedition, completing the crossing in a Guinness World Record-breaking time of 57 days.

When a 250m-long tanker attempted to make the rescue it almost collided with the minuscule rowboat, forcing the crew to fend the gigantic tanker away with their oars. It was the closest near death experience any of the crew had experienced.&lt;br&gt;Close to the east coast of Africa, pirates curious about the boat\u2019s activities and purpose intercepted it. It took some quick thinking by skipper Leven Brown. He told them over the radio that the rowing boat was actually a navy 'Q-boat' awaiting refuelling by the Royal Navy in 20 minutes. Fortunately, on hearing this, the pirates scooted off in a hurry.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012 a few friends and I started the Ubunye Challenge, a charity platform whereby we look to complete extreme endurance events and expeditions in order to raise funds for educational projects in southern Africa. Our goal was to complete a Lands End to John o' Groats cycle, a solo English Channel swim and an ocean row. The ocean row was to be the pinnacle and the toughest of the three events (although the previous two were by no means easy). I chose that event as I was a passionate flat-water rower at high school and university and represented South Africa at the World U23 Rowing Championships and World Student Games (in 2003 and 2004 respectively). My father was a successful ocean yachtsman and a huge inspiration to me. The Indian Ocean row was a chance for me to marry my rowing past with my father's passion for the ocean. My father passed away, after a two-year battle with cancer,&nbsp;a short time after I completed the ocean row.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date the Ubunye Challenge has raised R800,000 and assisted in installing five mobile classrooms in the Eastern Cape, and two classroom blocks in an overpopulated school in northern Zimbabwe.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals of Expedition\/Adventure&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our initial goal was to be the first crew to row across the Indian Ocean from mainland Australia to the African mainland, which had never been done. Our secondary goal was to break the speed record for the fastest crossing.&lt;br&gt;We were well on track to reach the African coast, but two vicious storms and a hurricane forced us further north than we intended. We were headed straight for the northern Kenyan\/Somalian coast, and after a terrifying encounter with pirates we decided to not risk the threat of piracy (and terrorism) any longer. We changed course and headed for the Seychelles, just off the coast of Africa.&lt;br&gt;We made the crossing in 57 days and 10 hours, breaking the Guinness World Record for the fastest Indian Ocean rowing crossing by over 10 days.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Originality&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been two previous attempts to cross the Indian Ocean from mainland to mainland.&nbsp; Both failed to reach the African coast. There have been 16 successful Indian Ocean rows to date, the most common end point being Mauritius.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%2012.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started planning this trip in late 2011. It took a very long time to come to fruition, mainly due to financial reasons. We were extremely lucky to have Leven Brown on board. He is an experienced skipper who has rowed numerous oceans before and provided most of the logistical support.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are myriad risks involved in ocean rowing including:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capsizing, and potential drowning in big seas. The highest swells we experienced were 60 foot in height.&lt;br&gt;Being washed overboard while not harnessed into the boat, especially during the night. It is extremely hard to stop a fast moving rowing boat and turn it around.&lt;br&gt;Burn injuries during cooking. This happened to one of the crew, Shane Usher, who needed an emergency evacuation in the middle of the Indian Ocean.&lt;br&gt;Encounters with ocean dwelling predators and poisonous jelly fish while off the boat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%204%20Ending%20in%20Seychelles.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up plan&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are very few options available should an emergency occur in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Small islands are at least three weeks row away and air support can only occur within 200km of the mainland. Rescue by ship is the only feasible option available. When Shane Usher sustained first-degree burn injuries, a huge tanker, which happened to be in the near vicinity, was alerted to the situation. They diverted their course to intersect with us and take Shane on board. The evacuation nearly ended the expedition as our boat was almost destroyed when it collided with the tanker!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-funded. The crew paid their own way after a major sponsor pulled out only weeks before the expedition was set to leave. It demonstrated their tenacity and determination to keep going and successfully complete the expedition despite the severe and unexpected financial burden.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%2013.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were numerous. We experienced huge storms and waves, a collision with a blue whale, and interaction with pirates. However my scariest moment was having to scrape the barnacles off the underside of the boat, knowing full well that there were sharks in the immediate vicinity. It was a Friday, about 35 days into the row and the hull was 90% covered in barnacles. Leven, the skipper, advised that I would be cleaning the boat the following Monday. We had had numerous visits by sharks leading up to this, but on the Saturday and early Sunday morning a lone tiger shark followed us. From then until Monday morning it disappeared from sight. I had been secretly praying that Leven had forgotten about the hull-cleaning job, but just after lunch he instructed us to stop rowing and told me to get ready to start cleaning.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll always remember that dreadful feeling of standing on the edge of the boat, barnacle scraper in hand, fearfully searching for any sign of the shark, while trying not to let my crew mates see my unease! I eventually decided to take the plunge. On entering the water I quickly skirted around looking for my hungry tormentor. Luckily there was no sign of him and I timidly started my cleaning duties, keeping a careful eye over my shoulder for the shark. Forty minutes later the hull was clean of barnacles and I was extremely happy to be back on deck!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%206%20Scraping%20off%20barnacles.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most unexpected experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one of the two-hour breaks I slipped into my bunk and fell soundly asleep. Suddenly, the boat came to jolting halt and I was flung forward and off the bunk. I immediately thought we'd hit a reef and started to worry about damage to the boat. But we\u2019d hit a huge blue whale, bigger, by far, than our 15m rowing boat. It moved a distance away and then came back straight towards us. We thought it was going to hit us again, but it managed to divert at the last moment. It did this a few more times before disappearing into the depths.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just seeing a blue whale was an amazing experience; it trying to use our boat as a back scratcher was truly unique.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best piece of gear&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had to row for 12 hours a day in all types of conditions on pretty uncomfortable seats. So my favourite gear was my merino wool Icebreaker underwear. All 15 pairs of them!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%207.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you eat on the trip&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freeze-dried meals (a variety of different types from bobotie to ice cream), two-minute noodles, protein shakes, energy bars and various snacks.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On various occasions we landed a fish or squid. I caught two dorados, a barracuda and two large Humboldt squid. We ate the fish raw or boiled, but the tastiest treat was the calamari, which we fried, with some chicken stock, in the Jetboil.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s next&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am currently training for 3 solo swims this year:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Spain to Morocco in mid April.&lt;br&gt;- 3 Anchor Bay to Robben Island and back in mid May.&lt;br&gt;- The Irish Channel (Ireland to Scotland) to late August. This is a very tough swim of 35km in extremely cold water and tough weather\/water conditions. The area is also known for its large swarms of the poisonous lion's mane jellyfish.&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/A%202015%20logo%20s_0.jpg?itok=QMKoQFTc\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Adventurer 2015&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9607\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/england-book\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;England by the Book&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    England by the Book  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"England by the Book\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/England%20MAIN.jpg?itok=5zc4v3fr\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/england-book\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/england-book\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/england-book&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/England%20MAIN.jpg&amp;description=England by the Book\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/england-book\" data-text=\"England by the Book\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/england-book\" data-title=\"England by the Book\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words and pics Nancy Richards, &lt;a href=\"mailto:nancyrichards@intekom.co.za\"&gt;nancyrichards@intekom.co.za&lt;\/a&gt; 083 431 9986&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made a point of not taking a book. There\u2019s always so much to read in England. Not least the glut of weighty newspapers. But the literary thread that wormed its way through the excursion began with an in-flight glossy. An article called &lt;em&gt;Book Shelfies&lt;\/em&gt;, reflected the current titles on the bedsides of some leading Brits. Knowing I\u2019d be overnighting at a number of different homes, I decided to take a leaf out of the concept and sleuth my hosts\u2019 shelves to see what was feeding their souls \u2013 maybe borrow a title or two for some late night speed reading. Good idea, but I didn\u2019t get much sleep.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WOMEN\u2019S LIB: The suffragette picture window at the entrance to LSE\u2019s Women\u2019s Library.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theme was further underlined by a visit to the Women\u2019s Library at the London School of Economics where a giant black and white blow-up pic of the early 19th-century suffragettes\u2019 protest filled an entire window. I got to do a guided tour with special collections librarian, Indy Bhullar who rolled back shelves in temperature controlled vaults loaded with tomes dating from centuries past. With reverence he picks out a 1792 copy of &lt;em&gt;The Vindication of the Rights of Women&lt;\/em&gt; by Mary Wollstonecraft before moving on to the more contemporary archives containing e-zines and the jump suits worn at the Greenham Common Women\u2019s Peace Camp in the 80s.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;READING ROUTE: Persephone bookshop on Lamb\u2019s Conduit St.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, Persephone, a publishing house that focused mainly on the \u2018neglected\u2019 writings of women between the world wars, was in Lamb\u2019s Conduit Street, not a million miles away from the LSE. Not to miss an opportunity, my co-pilot on this particular venture brazenly approached a young woman deep in her Kindle for directions, \"I always feel you can ask the way from someone who reads\". Gut feel paid off and sure enough The Reader was able to oblige and minutes later we were in the serene, low-lit surrounds of the publisher\u2019s office-cum-shop where every treasured title is discreetly jacketed in dove grey with period piece textile designs gracing the end pages and matching book marks. Persephone pilgrims come from all over the world to shop here.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;READING ROOM: Inside Persephone bookshop on Lamb\u2019s Conduit St.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luck or coincidence \u2013 but on at the National Portrait Gallery annexed to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square was an exhibition on the Art, Life and Vision of iconic writer Virginia Woolf (1882-1941). Needless to say, more of a literary than visual portrait \u2013 but it exposed the inner working of her troubled, finely tuned mind. Woolf was one of the key members of intellectual, artistic set, The Bloomsbury Group, and it was she who famously wrote: \u201cA woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\u201d. And write she did. But tragically, following several bouts of depression, she took her own life by throwing herself into the River Ouse with pockets full of stones to ensure she reached her goal. It\u2019s possible that many of the Persephone pilgrims also found their way to this exhibition.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PRIDE OF PLACE: Jane Austen\u2019s house museum in Chawton.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Woolf exhibit was a bonus, but on the agenda from the outset had been a visit to Charleston, Sussex home of painters Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell (Virginia Woolf\u2019s sister) who were also members of the rule-breaking Bloomsbury Group. A guided tour of Charleston and its blowsy garden is an experience of art as a way of life. Every hand painted wall and piece of furniture has a story and the inspired guide explained that it was here that this \u2018circle of friends who loved in triangles\u2019 would sit and share their alternative and visionary views into the night. Virginia herself lived not far away in Monk\u2019s House where she had a writing \u2018room of her own\u2019 in the garden. Though I didn\u2019t get there, this house too is open to the public.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMPIRE LINES: &nbsp;There\u2019s a lock of the writers hair amongst the exhibits at Jane Austen\u2019s house.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly the goddesses of the pen were with me on this trip, because next, at a stop somewhere between Petersfield and Guildford in Hampshire, I asked in passing what there might be of interest along the way. \"I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d be interested in Jane Austen, but her house is up the road.\" Minutes later, the car was headed for Chawton, home of the princess of the romantic novel. Well if the Persephone pilgrims had made it to the Woolf exhibition, their American cousins had all come to pay homage at Chawton. They revelled in the empire lines of her wardrobe, sighed at sight of the virgin calico-covered bed where she and her sister Cassandra shared their virgin nights and listened as a white haired lady tinkled ivories on a harpsichord in the drawing room. In the picture book rambling rose garden, watercolourists had set up their easels. Pride and not a little prejudice had prevailed for the companion on this trip who had whiled away a moment not at Cassandra\u2019s Cup the coffee shop across the road, but The Greyfriar pub next door. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DOING THE CHARLESTON: Literary charm of an artist\u2019s house and garden.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Booking Out&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For reasons of excess baggage, it was not my intention to actually buy any books \u2013 and regrettably, or perhaps luckily, I didn\u2019t get to the new home of the legendary Foyles. Having first opened in 1906 at no. 113-119 Charing Cross Road, in June last year, they moved their many hundreds of thousands of titles to no. 107 where they boast 4 miles (around 6.5km) of shelving to accommodate them. Chances are high that you\u2019d find a title you\u2019re looking for here. But where my resolve was seriously challenged was at The Fifteenth Century Bookshop in High Street Lewes. Owner Susan Mirabaud, peering from behind towering stacks, explained that she was a \u2018bit of a collector\u2019 until her late husband drew the line so she moved into this timbered old building which now bursts at the seams with around 10 000 books. Speciality areas? \"I specialise in children\u2019s books, but women writers are my passion \u2013 Virginia Woolf is favourite.\" Could have guessed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Postscript&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shouldn\u2019t have expected anything less, but it was a fitting final chapter on the return flight to find myself sitting next to an author and owner of a private library in Sea Point. Focused on Military and Political science, with the Balkan wars a speciality, it wasn\u2019t quite in keeping with the gender interests previously prevalent, but hey!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/England%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DOING THE CHARLESTON: Literary charm of an artist\u2019s house and garden.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Readers' Research&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women's Library&lt;\/strong&gt; at The London School of Economics, 10 Portugal St, London WC2.

I knew she always wanted to go to New York, so I said \u2018I\u2019ll take you, but we are going my way\u2019.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to do something exceptional, something that hasn\u2019t been done before. &nbsp;So we took ocean rowing to the next level. Nobody has ever rowed from mainland Africa to mainland North America; nor has anyone rowed up the east coast of North America. We realized that the Gulf Stream is an amazing phenomenon \u2013 one that not many people will get to experience in their lifetime.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing it together was what made the expedition special. But I have always chosen expeditions on which there\u2019s a real possibility of me losing my life. That aspect made this expedition very difficult for me as I didn\u2019t want anything to happen to Vasti.

There have been many Atlantic Ocean rowing crossings, but most take the \u2018trade winds\u2019 route from the Canaries to one of the Caribbean Islands - a distance of approximately 5000km. Since we were heading for New York we had to take a very different route. After reaching the US mainland at Miami we spent another month at sea to reach New York, our final destination. The total distance of our row (10 765km) was more than double a \u2018conventional\u2019 Atlantic crossing.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We dreamt up the idea in April 2014, left for Morocco on 3 December 2014 and started our expedition on 30 December 2014. &nbsp;So it took us about eight months of planning.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting separated from the boat. &nbsp;The total surface of the Atlantic is one fifth of the earth's. &nbsp;If you get separated from your boat, there is no way you\u2019ll be spotted in that vast amount of water. And even if you are able to send any type of emergency signal, it is unlikely the rescue team wouldn\u2019t reach you in time.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Capsizing in big waves during storms.&lt;br&gt;Being run over by ships, especially in the shipping lanes near land. (We were run over by a 250 metre-long Russian oil tanker at 2am in the morning, only 5 days from the end of the expidition.)&lt;br&gt;Shark attacks while swimming and cleaning underneath of the boat. &nbsp;We caught a lot of sharks and cut the line as close to the mouth as possible when releasing them. Sometimes this was at night and often the boat was rocking so one of us could easily have fallen in the water in the process.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Riaan got separated from the boat. Physically it would have been impossible for me to turn the boat around to pick him up. Fortunately he was able to grab hold of the fishing line that we trawled behind the boat, and I managed to reel him back in. Quite a catch!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being capsized by an eight-metre wave 2000km from the closest land was also pretty hairy. (VG)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up plan&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially we had a satellite phone, but it broke when a big wave hit us 19 days from leaving the Canary Islands. Our boat had an Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) through which we could send an emergency signal. We also had Personal Locator Beacons, which work in the same manner: when activated it a signal goes out to the nearest boat in the vicinity. But there were almost no boats in our vicinity on the Atlantic crossing leg of our journey, and even if there were it would have taken at least 48 hours for a ship to reach us.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%2013.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sponsors&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun International, DSTV, Zurich Insurance, Columbia Clothing, Imtech, Dion Wired, Seaport and Outward Ventures, the distributors of Back Country Cuisine. &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Verification&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition was tracked by a Yellowbrick GPS tracker, which sent out our GPS location at least every two hours. The whole route is visible by following the Yellowbrick link on riaanmanser.com.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unexpected experiences&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing our boat out of the swamps after it got stuck in the mangroves as we were rowing through Andros Island in the Bahamas.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching Miami and almost being detained by the police who thought we were Cuban refugees. They let us go after we persuaded them that Cuban refugees don\u2019t usually have sponsors\u2019 logos displayed on their boats!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%2011.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funniest moment&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, near the start of the crossing (ie when it was still cold) Riaan went outside to the toilet. &nbsp;Waves were crashing over the boat all the time and he got completely soaked. &nbsp;He was cold and miserable and just wanted to get back into the \u201cluxury\u201d of the cabin. &nbsp;He pleaded with me to open the cabin door before another wave hit him but I wouldn\u2019t in case he got his timing wrong and the cabin flooded. He was a sorry sight, but I had to laugh when yet another wave crashed over the boat. (VG)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best piece of gear&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yellowbrick tracker. It tracked our expedition, and when our satellite phone broke down as a result of water damage after the capsize, we used the Yellowbrick to send short text messages to the outside world.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%207.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you eat&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ate Back Country freeze-dried food. You boil water and add it to the packet and within 10 minutes you have Roast Chicken, Moroccan Lamb, Chana Masala, etc. From about half way we caught a lot of fish - dorado, tuna, gator fish, bonito and various fish that we couldn\u2019t identify. We even made biltong from the fish that we really enjoyed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the worst thing that bit you&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flies in the mangroves of Andros Island. &nbsp;There were thousands of them and the bites burnt and itched for days.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What hurt most&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our backs, bums, knees, wrists \u2013 actually everything. When we got up in the mornings, we felt like old people. We contracted a condition called rower\u2019s claw. When we got up at night, after a rowing day, we couldn\u2019t close our hands. We had to spend five minutes working to loosen our fingers enough for them to grip.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Riaan%20%26%20Vasti%2014.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/A%202015%20logo%20s_0.jpg?itok=QMKoQFTc\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Adventurer 2015&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9604\" class=\"publisher-1813 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/ride-wolwespruit-mtb-erasmuskloof-pretoria\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Ride Wolwespruit MTB in Erasmuskloof (Pretoria)&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Ride Wolwespruit MTB in Erasmuskloof (Pretoria)  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Ride Wolwespruit MTB in Erasmuskloof (Pretoria)\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.ride.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #E31933' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/ride-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Wolwespruit%20MAIN.jpg?itok=Kje_Z5hh\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/ride-wolwespruit-mtb-erasmuskloof-pretoria\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/ride-wolwespruit-mtb-erasmuskloof-pretoria\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/ride-wolwespruit-mtb-erasmuskloof-pretoria&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Wolwespruit%20MAIN.jpg&amp;description=Ride Wolwespruit MTB in Erasmuskloof (Pretoria)\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/ride-wolwespruit-mtb-erasmuskloof-pretoria\" data-text=\"Ride Wolwespruit MTB in Erasmuskloof (Pretoria)\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/ride-wolwespruit-mtb-erasmuskloof-pretoria\" data-title=\"Ride Wolwespruit MTB in Erasmuskloof (Pretoria)\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words and pics Andrew Steer&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to trails in inner city spaces, Pretoria has always been a little ahead of the pack. We tested out the capital\u2019s latest mountain-bike offering, Wolwespruit, in Erasmuskloof.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I headed to Wolwespruit on a pleasant Highveld Sunday afternoon to try out its heralded wares first hand. It was easy to find and access, even for a confused Joburger. I\u2019d read a few positive reviews online, and its website is neatly done (&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wolwespruit.co.za\"&gt;www.wolwespruit.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;), but you just never know what to expect until you\u2019ve actually been there and sampled it for yourself.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a quick park and unpack, I headed to the registration, paid my 30 bucks, and sorted out my indemnity. I got a quick idea of the lay of the land from the manager on duty and headed out into the sunshine to burn off a little winter excess, and soak up some much-needed rays in the most enjoyable way.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Riding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main (blue) trail through the park is 15km long, with around 300m of climbing. It is what would generally be considered an intermediate-level trail, while still being challenging enough to test even the hardiest riders. There are various options to shorten the loop, should you get tired, and \u2018chicken runs\u2019(green) to skip some of the more technical sections, if they aren\u2019t your cup of tea, so it caters for just about all levels of mountain bikers. Work is under way on a new beginner route and a pump track, so by the time you read this, there should be an option for everyone in the family.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail starts at the parking lot and you head into some singletrack that takes you alongside the highway, over several optional jumps and some north-shore-type bridges, and around a couple of sweet berms \u2013 all the while nipping in and out of small wooded sections. It\u2019s generally flat and fast until you hit a proper little leg-tester a couple of kilometres in, which quickly pops you atop a nice rocky koppie.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There you get a glorious view of the park to your left (and the intimidating-looking climb that looms later on in the lap), while just to your right you might notice the busiest freeway in Africa \u2013 how did that sneak in there? A quick downhill ensues, before more singletrack whips you around, taking you back in the direction of the start. There is a bail-out option here (ideal, probably, for kiddies), or just follow the signs that take you out on a separate singletrack loop. This leads you, via a wooden bridge, to the other side of the Wolwespruit, which neatly bisects the park.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolwespruit%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this side of the spruit, a challenge gets thrown into the mix \u2013 a mini-Alpe d\u2019Huez-style switchback climb that takes you off the linkage road, and up the formidable main slope. It is, however, at a reasonable gradient, so with a little determination it\u2019s possible to make it to the top in something resembling comfort. Once there, you can enjoy the panoramic views back over the park, the hospital and the motorway (which you sometimes need reminding is even there). The descent is challenging but great fun, and some tight turns mixed with fast, rocky sections will get the adrenalin going. There\u2019s something to be said for the experience of doing a white-knuckle descent with a hospital in full view\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once back on the linkage road, you can either use this to head home, or tackle the last little challenge: a deceptively long jeep-track climb up along the park perimeter, which takes you back up to the main slope. You\u2019re rewarded, though, with a long and fast descent that has fast, rocky sections, some tight, bermed switchbacks and even a couple of (black diamond) drop-off options. They\u2019re not as hectic as you might think; taken at a sensible speed, most people will be able to ride them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long descent again takes you back to the main linkage road, which, if you follow the signs, will take you back to the start via a bridge over the spruit, and along the bottom of the hospital grounds. If you\u2019re up for more action, the main climbs could easily be tackled again off the main linkage road. Another full loop will make sure you\u2019ve earned that post-ride boerie roll.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overall Experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trails on offer at Wolwespruit are great fun. The course is 95% singletrack and, although the length might be a bit short for fitter riders, the fun factor on offer means that doing two laps is a serious consideration. There are plans to add some distance to the route (there is 90ha of land to play with) and some easier options for less technically minded riders, and for children.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge amount of work and passion has gone into building the specific routes \u2013 Charl Fischer and his team from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/tool-upcycles.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tool-Up Cycles&lt;\/a&gt; have done a great job. Tons of singletrack have been cut, the whole area has been fenced and cleaned up, there are berms on many corners, bridges where needed, north-shore type obstacles, jumps \u2013 if you can\u2019t have fun here on your bike, then you are definitely doing something wrong!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolwespruit%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trails still need a bit of riding in, and they could do with some rain, but with summer approaching, the best of what the park has to offer is probably just around the corner. Apart from extra distance, technical challenges will also be added throughout, with specific jump lines and possibly even a full enduro line.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolwespruit\u2019s facilities are still basic, but long-term plans include a full restaurant and bike shop, and ultimately setting up the park as a full-time venue that can cater for more activities. Being fully fenced and patrolled, it also offers safety in riding. I\u2019d recommend the park to anyone: it\u2019s great fun, but challenging too. And it\u2019s just going to get better.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycling hours&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Saturday and Sunday from 7am to 6pm. There is a recently launched ticket to allows you to ride during the week. These can be bought from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/tool-upcycles.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Tool-Up Cycles&lt;\/a&gt; or at the park on weekends. No ticket, no weekday riding.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Pretoria is always pretty hot, but with only small sections of the trail heavily exposed, and riders never too far from the starting point, a bottle of water\/energy drink should keep you in decent shape.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riding Rates&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;R30 for a single-rider entry; seasonal passes are not yet available.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restaurant&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Someday Caf\u00e9 serves anything from condensed-milk coffee to a braaibroodjie or jaffle. There\u2019s no set menu, just the chef\u2019s daily whims on offer, but you\u2019ll go home fulfilled in more than one way.

He believed that memories are like treasures owned by the bearer forever and therefore, the older you are, the richer you become. What a wonderful way of looking at life! On the way back from a recent trip to R\u00e9union Island, it occurred to me that I had just added a marvellous treasure to my memory bank.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Indian Ocean Island - situated east of Madagascar and four hours by plane from Johannesburg - surprised me from all angles. As a French territory, R\u00e9union allows visitors to submerge themselves in easily accessible European culture. The island is 63 kilometres long and 45 kilometres wide, but despite being so small it boasts the highest GDP of all the Indian Ocean Islands. For decades it\u2019s been a favourite holiday (and studying) destination for French people hailing from the mainland and it offers the same medical, educational and infrastructural standards as France. Visitors can expect an island filled with remarkable natural wonders, fast-flowing rum and ridiculously good-looking people.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Reunion%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Cyprien, our guide, has blue eyes, a tanned skin and a Master\u2019s degree in anthropology. He welcomes us in Saint Denis - R\u00e9union\u2019s administrative capital -and we file onto a bus, west-coast bound. \u201cThere are hundreds of micro-worlds in R\u00e9union,\u201d says Nicolas. &nbsp;\u201cIf you take a road trip through the island, you\u2019ll find a completely different landscape and experience every half an hour.\u201d &nbsp;As we drive, I am struck by how developed the island is and how far removed it seems from Africa. Nicolas shares a few facts: 850 000 people inhabit the island, French and Creole are the local languages spoken and 40% of R\u00e9union is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Saint Denis is bustling and half-perched on a mountainside. We drive past 19th Century Creole mansions, chic French boutiques, pastry shops and a promenade filled with active locals. Nicolas points to a pair of humpback whales breaching just off the coast. R\u00e9union is one of the best places in the world for humpback-whale watching and up to 130 new whales arrive off its coast every year. We check into the LUX Resort &amp; Hotel and get ready for action.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Reunion%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"722\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hikes and Volcanoes&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;R\u00e9union can confidently claim first prize for being adventure capital of the Indian Ocean Islands. For starters, it is home to one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes and to three gigantic calderas (amphitheatre-like valleys). Over 1000 kilometres of hiking paths crisscross the island, allowing hikers to take on multi-day treks with stay-overs at traditional mountain guesthouses. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our adventure starts with a 4-hour hike through the Mafate Caldera, a vast terrain that is only accessible by foot or by helicopter. The landscape looks like the set of Jurassic Park \u2013 green mountains tower around us, a river lined with black stones flows past us and indigenous plants seem better proportioned to dinosaurs than humans. The path leads us to higher and more isolated territory. 20% of R\u00e9union\u2019s people live in the mountains and according to Nicolas, the only way to deliver post and remove rubbish in these mountain villages is by helicopter. We stop at the first mountain village for a traditional Creole lunch of homegrown chicken and rice. Bob Marley\u2019s voice softly wails from a loudspeaker, while curious children observe our every move. For a few fleeting moments, the serene mountain life turns into an action flick as six helicopters arrive in perfect succession to scoop us back to the beach. Our female pilot points out a few isolated villages as she whizzes past cliff faces, ravines and summits.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Reunion%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In R\u00e9union you can lie on a tropical beach, shop in a European city and hike through a misty forest all on the same day. Our next expedition takes us from the beach into higher and cooler terrain and entails a walk along Piton de la Fournaise, one of the most active, safest and best-monitored volcanoes in the world. \u201cClose your eyes for 30 seconds,\u201d advises our taxi driver. We follow his instructions and when we open our eyes the land looks like mars. Stretched out before us, lies a flat, orange-dusted plain intersected by a lonely road leading to the volcano. Spontaneously, we jump and moonwalk. My friend smiles at me and says, \u201cR\u00e9union has a way of making people feel freer \u2013 you do things that you never thought you\u2019d do.\u201d We reach the lookout point and regard the volcano. There are traces of hardened, black lava and a few big craters around the main mound. Far in the distance, I spot two hikers making their way to the top of the volcano.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Waterfalls and Vanilla&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;R\u00e9union\u2019s west coast is known for sandy beaches and dive-friendly tropical waters, while its east coast forms the bulk of the island\u2019s World Heritage site.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Reunion%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter is lush, it offers spectacular routes for river rafting and hiking and it is home to litchi, sugarcane and vanilla plantations. We head east and arrive at a balmy jungle. Our guide - clad in a wetsuit and helmet - gives us two options, \u201cYou can choose the six or two- metre jump,\u201d he says. &nbsp;I timidly go for two metres and wallow in the water as my petrified friends succumb to the plunge of a lifetime. &nbsp;We form a 24-person train and float down a crystal-clear river, before separating for jumps over waterfalls and gullies. Fuelled with adrenaline, our aquatic hike ends the R\u00e9union way, with pineapple-and-banana-flavored rum. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Madagascar, R\u00e9union is one of the world\u2019s top producers of vanilla and no visit to the island is complete without a stopover at a vanilla plantation. Bertrand Come, the director of the regional vanilla cooperative, welcomes us at a French-style villa. He leads the way to his crops and tells us that patience is the name of the vanilla-growing game. Vanilla plants grow fast and need to be wrapped around poles on a regular basis. They are mostly pollinated by hand and once harvested; pods are washed, wrapped in blankets like babies and dried in various shapes and forms over several months. While drying, the pods are regularly checked for fungus. Bertrand says that all this effort pays off, as 80 kilograms of vanilla can fetch up to 40 000 Euro!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Reunion%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"578\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Blend of R\u00e9union&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;R\u00e9union is a melting pot of European, African and Asian cultures, and according to Nicolas, everyone lives in harmony. \u201cIf you like the French lifestyle, but dislike its politics, come to R\u00e9union,\u201d he jokes. A visit to the Saint-Paul market will give you a delicious taste of the island\u2019s diverse spices, exotic fruits, and local dishes like samosas, dumplings and cari. A drive through Saint Denis will give you a glimpse into R\u00e9union\u2019s funky street art scene and if music is your thing, Maloya \u2013 the island\u2019s traditional music and dance \u2013 can be heard and seen at local beach bars and restaurants.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My island adventure ends with dinner at a family-owned creole eatery and a Maloya dance-off. First we watch as beautiful, amber-skinned women grace the stage in twirling floral skirts. Within a few minutes, I\u2019m feeling the sensual mood of Maloya and I\u2019m ready to slip on my skirt. The lead guitarist sets the tone for us and our hips casually start to roll. &nbsp;The beat speeds up and before long I\u2019m spinning around like a swirling dervish and laughing out loud.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just a few days, R\u00e9union turned me into an exotic dancer, a conqueror of volcanoes, a canyon adventurer, a co-pilot and, on occasion, a rum-sipping beach bum. Life is good in R\u00e9union.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Reunion%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"722\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.travelideas.co.za\/subscribe.php\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Travel Ideas&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

The privilege of being the first people to ever stand on the top of a virgin peak in Antarctica. We were climbing in freezing conditions (-25 degrees Celcius) and the adventure aspect was mind blowing as there was no designated route. We had to discover each section, make decisions, back track where necessary, and thrash out a route from nothing. This included scaling a 950m ice wall with a 40-degree slope on fixed ropes and each carrying 22kg.&nbsp;It was an amazing experience to summit both peaks, but the opportunity to do it as a family (with close friends) made it unforgettable.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made the decision to return to Antarctica during our first expedition on the frozen continent when we trekked the final 111km to the South Pole. Antarctica draws you back. For our second expedition, we decided to take on the challenge of climbing Mount Vinson \u2013 the highest peak on the continent and the coldest and most remote of the Seven Summits \u2013 arguably Antarctica\u2019s ultimate experience. (Iain Buchan)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To summit two peaks in Antarctica, Mount Vinson and an unclimbed peak in the Ellsworth Mountain range.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Twin%20Peaks%205.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Originality&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique part of The Unlimited Twin Peaks Expedition was the climb of the second peak. While the mountain range has been photographed, due to its remoteness there are still unclimbed peaks there. As the land lies under permanent ice it is impossible to read the terrain from aerial photographs. So we had to make the route ourselves, doubling back when necessary and taking precautions for travelling in areas that were crevassed and prone to avalanches \u2013 the two biggest dangers that face mountaineers in Antarctica.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took two years to plan the trip partly because of the short summer weather window in Antarctica. We also wanted to ensure we had the necessary preparation under our belts \u2013 which included summiting two 4000m plus peaks in Europe.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest dangers were falling into crevasses and avalanches, so climbers were roped at all times.&nbsp;The cold was also a major challenge as the temperature seldom climbed above -20 degrees Celsius.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Twin%20Peaks%206.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up plan&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was accompanied by two seasoned Antarctic guides at all times.&lt;br&gt;The team and the guides also had satellite phones with them so that in the case of an emergency they could make contact with the base camp at Union Glacier.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition was privately funded with additional sponsorship received from the naming sponsor, The Unlimited.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Verification&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as photographic proof, the two guides can independently verify that the team reached the summit of both peaks.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Twin%20Peaks%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 40m from the summit of the previously unclimbed peak that we we named Mount Peace, we had to walk out on to a large section of blue ice at a slope of 60 degrees. It was so steep that only one or two crampon spikes were holding our weight. The guides went out ahead and secured the ropes, but the last three climbers all slipped and fell. Thankfully it was okay because they were secured with taut ropes and the rest of the team were able to bring them back up to safety. (Iain Buchan)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the biggest lesson&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That you have to be purposeful and meticulous. Antarctica has claimed lives, but if you don\u2019t take risks, it is (relatively) safe.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any amazing person that you met on the trip&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We met the most remarkable people on our trip including a mother-daughter team who had climbed all Seven Summits and a man who went blind on Everest \u2013 along with the Sherpa who guided him down.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Twin%20Peaks%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/A%202015%20logo%20s_0.jpg?itok=QMKoQFTc\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Adventurer 2015&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9347\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/makhonjwa-magic\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Makhonjwa Magic &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Makhonjwa Magic   &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Makhonjwa Magic \" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/M%26L%20Makhonjwa.jpg?itok=gVhPkG5T\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/makhonjwa-magic\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/makhonjwa-magic\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/makhonjwa-magic&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/M%26L%20Makhonjwa.jpg&amp;description=Makhonjwa Magic \" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/makhonjwa-magic\" data-text=\"Makhonjwa Magic \" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/makhonjwa-magic\" data-title=\"Makhonjwa Magic \"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Bridget Hilton-Barber&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just south of Barberton in Mpumalanga, lies a mountain range whose ancient green rocks preserve a unique scientific record of the pre-history of the earth. Bridget Hilton-Barber headed out of town to discover the ancient magic of Makhonjwa.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my ancestors Fred, Henry and Graham Barber discovered gold in the De Kaap Valley in 1884, they broke a bottle of gin over the reef and named the place Barber\u2019s Camp. It later became Barberton; and while there are still those in our family who grumble about the terrible waste of gin, the celebratory note struck in Barberton\u2019s proclamation seems to strike every time I pass this way. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time it struck hard and fast as we left town and headed for the Songimvelo Nature Reserve, a hundred kilometres away. We crossed over the increasingly urgent Komati River heading for Swaziland and then the ocean - and were soon were climbing up into the most amazing mountain scenery. Endless, soft and green - welcome to the Barberton Mountain Lands, greenstone rocks dating from the dawn of time.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Makhonjwa%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centrepiece of Songimvelo is the Makhonjwa Mountain, some of the oldest rocks on earth, dating back 3.5 billion years. They were among the first rocks to solidify on the earth\u2019s crust, and contain remarkable evidence of the earliest life forms. Geologists, scientists and boffins from NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) have been coming here for years in search of scientific clues to early earth - but it\u2019s only now that the Makhonjwa mountains are earmarked for UNESCO World Heritage Site status, that the rest of us are starting to sit up and take note. You can\u2019t really help it out here\u2026 not only are these mountains old and incredible, they are drop dead gorgeous. So drop dead gorgeous in fact that we pulled over and had a long, slow DIY G&amp;T and drank in the views. You can take the Barber out of Barberton \u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Makhonjwa%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Songimvelo is part of the Songimvelo-Malalotja Transfrontier Conservation Area which also includes Malolotja in Swaziland, an equally wild mountain wilderness, characterised by mountains, valleys and floodplains. &nbsp;The accommodation is pretty rustic \u2013 either a campsite or self-catering wooden chalets (they sleep six) at Kromdraai in the eastern part of the reserve, with no electricity. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that\u2019s the magic of Makhonjwa. It\u2019s wild. There\u2019s a reason they call this part of Mpumalanga the Wild Frontier. It\u2019s so wild in fact that at Songimvelo only five percent of the reserve has 4x4 access and most of the rangers here patrol on horseback. It\u2019s the preferred mode and you can take guided rides \u2013 and also guided drives \u2013 into the dramatic reaches of the mountains.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Makhonjwa%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than 300 bird species \u2013 and we saw zebra, wildebeest and frisky giraffe who love the open grassy plains here, and elephant, crashing their way through the shadier wooded areas. &nbsp;You can also go on a guided walk to see some of the circular walls and ruins of small houses and religious structures that date back to 400BC.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold has been mined at Makhonjwa for more than a 120 years and some of the oldest gold on the planet is still mined here. (There\u2019s an interesting jewellery project next to the Barberton Museum which promotes local design and craftsmanship.) &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Makhonjwa%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the strongest Makhonjwa magic comes when you take time out to be still and breathe and admire: the forest, the bush, the caves and stream, the views, the last wild population of the delightfully unruly sounding Woolly Cycad. And of course the ancient rocks themselves. \u201cHere in Barberton is the Rosetta Stone for this period of time.\u201d wrote Professor Don Lowe of Stanford University in California. \u201cThese rock layers are like the pages of a book that we can read and translate in terms of early Earth\u2019s history\u201d.

Deep isolation in a country with mindboggling landscapes. Fixing my MSR stove after three days of cold food!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media:&lt;\/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RunoutsInAfricaPhotography\" target=\"_self\"&gt;facebook.com\/RunoutsInAfricaPhotography&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iceland is a magical country with great volcanoes, glaciers, lava fields and snowcapped peaks. Hiking though its interior, where there are no towns, few roads, and even fewer people was not an easy undertaking. To experience this beautiful country in isolation I had to carry everything that I need to survive for a month on my back, around 45kg of gear.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interior had a multitude of challenges. I knew I\u2019d have to endure icy cold glacial river crossings, jagged lava fields and extensive plains of mud sucking at my boots. But that was the reason I wanted to hike there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goal&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To cross Iceland and prove that solo \u201cold-school\u201d adventures are still possible for any age group.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Bernie%20Theron%204.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Originality&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Swiss crew successfully completed this journey in 2013, and I\u2019m sure that there have been other attempts in the past. &nbsp;But, to the best of my knowledge no South Africans have done it.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started my planning and training about 5 months before the start.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being washed away during glacial river crossings, hypothermia, dehydration and the chance of falling in the odd crevasse.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up plan&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My back-up was that if I failed to notify my contacts in South Africa within 30 days then they would start looking for me on my designated route. As it turned out my route changed on a daily basis so it wasn\u2019t a great emergency plan! &nbsp;My emergency phone to the outside world was my old Blackberry phone, which was not ideal, but was all that I could afford at the time.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Bernie%20Theron%205.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-funded but with the help of the Mountain Club of South Africa\u2019s Supertramp Award \u2013 a dedicated award for young adventurers between the ages of 18 and 25.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sponsorship&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCSA Supertramp Award.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Verification&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs and hours of video footage. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was always looking for an adventure. One day I watched a video about Iceland and was smitten by the hiking opportunities there. Months later I decided to motivate a traverse of Iceland as my proposal for the Supertramp award.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What technical skills were needed&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good navigational skills are essential on long cross-country treks. And it\u2019s important not to dwell too much on the fact that you are alone in the middle of nowhere, so you need a strong will.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Bernie%20Theron%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting lost late in the afternoon in blizzard conditions high up in the mountains - with a broken tent and in a bad mood.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lowest point on the adventure&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I got sick of my daily allowance of cookies!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funniest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being attacked by two \u2018wild\u2019 and extremely dangerous sheep.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the biggest lesson&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything is possible if you have the right attitude.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would you do\/have done differently&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not have followed the advice of the Icelandic mountain wardens, who advised against most of my plans and told me that various sections of my planned route were impassable. Fortunately for me, they weren\u2019t. And I would have taken better quality food and less clothing and gear such as ropes for river crossings, small gadgets and repair tools for my wagon (which broke early in the trek and was not repairable). All that unnecessary weight made my pack almost too much to bear.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Bernie%20Theron%207.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best piece of gear&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My La Sportiva Vajolet hiking boots and my Deuter backpack; solid gear.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Piece of gear you wish you\u2019d taken along&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better rain jacket that could have kept me dry through days of bad weather, as mine did not do its job at all.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any amazing person that you met on the trip&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met a Frenchman called Stephan while on my trek.

Then there\u2019s only thick green jungle punctured by rusty volcanic peaks. Finally a sea of turquoise opens up below us and disappears into the horizon.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Holmes and his wife Jeannie have their heads pressed to the window upfront. We bank right and little blobs of land appear then disappear beneath the wing of the Cessna. It\u2019s rumoured that an old matriarch with ties to the mafia started this airline of twin prop workhorses. She was a lobster farmer who used to live on the island we find ourselves heading towards.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When business started booming, the boss-lady needed a more reliable way of getting her wares to market. So she enlisted a fleet of second hand Cessnas and effectively opened the island up to outsiders. Previously the only transport was an erratic ferry that could take up to two days, or wouldn\u2019t arrive at all. Nobody sees the boss anymore. It\u2019s said she just sits in her office in the capital all day, tattooed from head to toe, chain-smoking ciggies while counting all her money.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s an audible shift in the drone of the engines as the plane starts to descend. Whitewash licks the reefs below and soon everyone\u2019s head is pressed to the window.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cYOU\u2019RE NOT GONNA BE DOING ANY BUNNY HOPS OUT THERE,\u201d Frankie says as he picks his way over the rocks. \u201cBut hell, it feels good to get some barrels.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 metres behind him a lump of swell hiccups over the ledge and detonates in a haze of spit. This is, after all, what we\u2019ve come for. The Indonesian dream. Barrels, warm water and swaying palms. Frankie can\u2019t really recall the first time he came to Indo. It\u2019s all smudged into one long, luminous memory when he used to trawl the archipelago with Tom Curren and an ensemble of legendary surfers, looking for virgin waves as part of The Search. But this is different. This island does not belong to the flat teardrops that make up the Mentawai chain or the Banyaks. It is a thousand miles away from the dry eastern expanse of Nusa Tenggara. The island is a land unto itself. Massive clouds swell from its mountainous centre, heated by the significant landmass that creates its own unique weather pattern. The winds shift on a whim, bringing with them a dark vortex of cloud or sunshine so intense it feels like your insides are broiling. The waves are different too. More Hawaii than the Mentawais. Thick chunks of reef broken by beachbreaks and rivermouths. A different kind of perfection.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s Koby\u2019s first trip abroad, their first trip together, and it\u2019s hard to tell who is more excited - father or son. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the lightie to feel some island power,\u201d Frankie says as he swigs his water. \u201cAnd for him to surf with someone like Holmesy. He\u2019s always been one of my favourite surfers.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later Sean drops into a hopeless suck-out, his rail barely connecting as he hits the trough. It looks like the lip\u2019s going to square him in the head but he miraculously squeaks under it and the wave shuts down. Or so we think. A few seconds elapse and he shoots out onto the shoulder, relaxed, standing tall.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slab is just one of a dozen waves littered across the island. Others, we\u2019re told, are still being discovered with each new season. A serviceable road runs around the perimeter of coastline, making discovery relatively easy. The trick is wetting your finger, weighing up all the variables and knowing where to go.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we drive and explore, Frankie talks. He talks about surfing and fishing and trips gone by. He talks about how cayenne pepper is good for you - just half a teaspoon in the morning and you\u2019re hundreds. He loves to cook and carries a fiery bottle of red curry powder around with him wherever he goes. He catches fish for a living and shapes boards for a bit of extra coin. He talks about rocker dimensions and the best way to braai a couta (wrapped in foil and marinated in chutney, marmite and coke). He still lives in Warner Beach, where he was \u2018discovered\u2019 decades ago and thrust into the limelight as Curren\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. He loves South Africa but hates the crime. He\u2019s still married to his high school sweetheart Lisa. He has a daughter now too. His life revolves around his family and the sea. Frankie is 41 and many days have gone by since he first started searching. Many, and none at all.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE KAK-KAK-KAK OF THE OUTBOARD MOTOR IS DEAFENING and Koby has his hands clamped firmly around his ears to try block out the sound. The nose of our small fishing skiff is aimed at an islet in the distance, one of many that lie sprinkled just offshore. Towering plumes of cloud erupt along the horizon. The heat is building steadily but the soft sea breeze keeps us cool. There are no roads to the wave we\u2019re chasing. It\u2019s said to be the best - and heaviest \u2013 in the area. I had asked a travelling Australian if he knew why it was called Teabags before we left. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cY\u2019know mate,\u201d he said, pointing a finger offshore \u201cWhen you eat it out there, it\u2019s worse than someone dropping their balls on your head. You get properly fucken\u2019 teabagged!\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The swell is an awkward size when we arrive - not quite big enough to break in deeper water allowing for a roll in, but instead it focusses all the energy onto the inside. It\u2019s a cruel, perfect wave. A thin sheet of water covers the live reef. If you don\u2019t make the take-off, you find yourself washed up on a dry coral ledge that runs the length of the point. There\u2019s nowhere to hide as the sets detonate on top of you.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re told how a famous Aussie pro scooped the cover of a big international magazine here on a recent visit. After getting the shot in the bag, he paddled further up the reef to where an even shallower, faster section beckons. Shortly thereafter he was taken to the airport in an ambulance and flown back home.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean and Frankie give it a sniff, paddling up the point, but return empty handed. \u201cYou could try up there,\u201d says Sean. \u201cBut you\u2019re just asking for trouble.\u201d They settle for the main section, Sean waiting patiently for the sets, Frankie locked behind the curtain or carving big arcs in the powerful bowl.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koby is tentative at first, but his courage builds wave by wave. Soon he is connecting double barrels as his fins barely clear the coral heads. Say what you want about nature versus nurture, but the similarity in style he shares with his father is uncanny. The same relaxed centre of gravity. The exact same dropped knee and compressed bottom turn. His calm under pressure belies his 13 years of age. Sean will later say that while subbing a wave Koby was taking off on, he was getting ready to turn around and \u201cgo pick pieces of the lightie off the reef\u201d. But Koby returns to the skiff in one piece, his eyes bulging with excitement, his world altered forever. The only person smiling more than him is his old man.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We pull anchor and motor to another small island in the distance. The leeward beach is flanked by a solitary outcrop of rock, sprouting jungle like a wild green afro. We jump off and swim to shore, rolling up the beach in the shorebreak.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cGilligan\u2019s Island!\u201d Frankie shouts, summing up the postcard we find ourselves washed up on.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean disappears around the corner and quickly trots back. \u201cThere\u2019s a wave there,\u201d he says, and swims back to the skiff for his board. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t make sense. The swell is coming from the same direction as the landmass in the distance, yet there is a turquoise A-frame bouncing off the other side of the outcrop. It\u2019s like God\u2019s private wavepool. Sean and Koby frolic in the wedges, sliding in next to the rock, throwing down one big turn or pulling in before the wave runs dry. Frankie rolls around in the shorebreak, filming on his GoPro, hooting as his son takes off and he in turn gets smashed into the sand by the lip. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everyone finally scrambles back onto the boat, hair caked with sand, eyes bloodshot, Frankie turns around and says, \u201cJa, we\u2019ll look back on this and won\u2019t believe we were here.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2011.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE RAIN DOESN\u2019T FALL ON THE ISLAND. It gushes from holes in the sky, like someone is emptying a giant, endless bucket. We sip coffee and watch the water as it cascades around us.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOus think you go to the islands and it\u2019s offshore and perfect every day,\u201d Frankie chuckles. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s jut.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He launches into a story from years ago.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2012.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe one time I was in Hawaii though, it was cooking for weeks on end! First day we\u2019re there getting barrelled, barrelled, and then I pull in and my board hits me in the groin. Tickets. 30 stitches. 20 on the outside, 10 on the inside, thanks for coming. I got back from the hospital and Jason Ribbink &nbsp;arrived. The next morning he goes for a surf and I\u2019m parking on the couch. You know with injuries like that, the pain only kicks in later and I\u2019m on the couch in pain cuzzie, goofed on painkillers, watching TV. The next thing the news comes on and the presenter, he tunes,\u201d at this Frankie switches effortlessly into a nasal American accent. \u201cHe tunes 'Jason Ribbink from South Africa almost died on the North Shore today when his board scalped him at Backdoor' Hawaii national news, bru! Jason had just walked out the door a couple of hours ago. I thought I was still asleep, dreaming. Same thing happened, his board hit the backwash in the barrel but it ended up taking half his head off. When Jason got out the water the Hawaiian guys reckoned this ou was going to fall in the sand and peg right there in front of them. Half his pineapple was hanging open. They stitched him back up but that was it for both of us, first day over, thanks for coming.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2013.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories continue to flow from Frankie as the rain falls. He talks about Europe and Oz and Indo, about the days of hustling on the \u2018QS when all the South Africans used to sleep on the beach or in the bushes - \u201cHotel Le Grasse\u201d, as they would tell the French customs officials. He talks about his first trip overseas with Mike Roscoe for a pro junior event in Sydney when they were 16 and how they were supposed to be gone for a few weeks and ended up staying for five months, working as \u201cgarbos\u201d, collecting trash to make enough money to get to Kirra. He remembers how they ended up sleeping in a shredded tent during a cyclone and had their boards stolen, but then their luck changed and they were taken in and ended up staying in an apartment above the point for weeks on end, fridge full, surfing the best waves of their life. He talks about Kirra \u2013 the old Kirra, the real Kirra, the best wave there ever was - and Burleigh and Supertubos and Supers, about Coxos and Macaronis and the South Coast. He talks about getting buzzed by sharks and contracting malaria and even typhoid - not from some tropical backwater, but from dodgy Makro boerewors. He talks about his friends and connections and the people who colour his memories, about the waves he\u2019s surfed and the waves he still wants to surf. A life made up of stories from the road and the sea.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2015.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE SWIRLING WIND CONTINUES TO PUSH US around the island each day. We drive, flanked by ocean on one side and houses on the other. Families live and work in the doorways, on rolled out mats and in concrete rooms visible from the road. Most of the houses are less than 10 years old, built after the Boxing Day tsunami that levelled villages across the island. Only one person died, however, in the aftermath. It\u2019s reported he suffered from a heart attack while heading for higher ground. Local folklore tells of a devastating tsunami in 1907 in which thousands of the islanders perished. They had rushed to the beach to collect fish after seeing the water recede, exposing the flapping bounty. They did not know the water would return. The story of the semong has since been passed down from generation to generation. Everyone on the island knows that if the ocean inhales, it will exhale again.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2016.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find evidence of these seismic shifts in the waves we surf. At one particular beach the entire shelf has been thrust up from deep below the surface. Petrified coral heads bake in the sun and break off like crystal in your hand. Not long after the Boxing Day tsunami, an 8.7 magnitude quake struck directly off the southern end of the island. Geologists estimate that the island rose at least six feet on the western coast, while on the east coast the land was submerged, seawater flooding fields and settlements. The island had been tipped like a saucer. Some of the waves we surf are less than a decade old. There are vague stories of other waves before the quake. A surf camp was perched in front of the best one, but after the earthquake it was gone. The devastated owner packed up and left shortly afterwards. While we are there, a volcano erupts on the mainland and smolders for days. Villages are evacuated and tense hours pass as the earth rumbles and shifts deep below us.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2017.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE\u2019S WAVES DAD, THERE\u2019S WAVES!\u201d Koby grabs his board and is bouncing around on the porch. The wind has dropped off as it does most afternoons and the peak out front is producing smooth lefts and rights. He jogs down to the channel, dodging the water buffalo on the beach. It\u2019s local custom that when one of the animals gives birth, the owner gets to keep the first calf, but the second belongs to the community. Large herds of these water buffalo roam the island, belonging to everyone and no one.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the water the jungle is drenched in the warm glow of late afternoon light, making it look deceptively inviting. But deeper inside it\u2019s writhing with leeches and animals and insects bigger than a human hand that crawl into your hut at night. The jungles are revered but mostly left alone.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2018.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankie leans into a left and effortlessly glides off the bottom before cracking his board under the lip. The move is standard but his positioning is so unique, only a few surfers in the world could capably draw those lines.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much later, thousands of kilometres away back home, I\u2019ll ask Frankie if he has any regrets. There are surfers with lesser talent but more marketing savvy who have capitalised on having style or being a personality. They\u2019ve built their careers off it. Made good money out of it. There are others who have used their sway to get big jobs inside the industry, or those who have just left surfing altogether to pursue more lucrative ventures.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2019.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankie thinks about it then smiles.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNah, I\u2019ve had a good life,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t complain. The only thing I would\u2019ve liked to have done is a couple more contests, to give it a proper crack, but we didn\u2019t really have the backup then. We could\u2019ve made it with a little more help. But I\u2019ve had the best days of my life freesurfing, surfing good waves. My sponsors have always been good to me. And I\u2019ve learnt a lot from travelling, from guys like Curren. I have good memories. Now I want to see if I can break into surfboard designing. I love it, I love shaping. And Koby\u2019s going to do well. He\u2019s got a really good style and he tries hard. It\u2019s nice to see your lightie ripping. I think he\u2019s got a good future ahead of him, that\u2019s the main thing. I\u2019m really stoked about that.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2020.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back on the island that night, after the sun has dipped below the horizon and the insects come out and fill the darkness, we get word that the volcano has erupted again. The last time it happened the sky was filled with ash and all flights were cancelled for a week. The earth is constantly changing, moving, but on the island, for now, time stands still. A silence falls over everyone before Koby Oberholzer asks his dad, hopefully, \u201cDoes this mean we don\u2019t have to go home yet?\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/The%20Island%2021.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.zigzag.co.za\/magazine\/subscribe\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Zigzag Surfing Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.zigzag.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Zigzag%20Cover21.jpg?itok=YX8NxpPG\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;ZigZag&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9193\" class=\"publisher-1944 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/hein%E2%80%99s-sight\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;In Hein\u2019s Sight&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    In Hein\u2019s Sight  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"In Hein\u2019s Sight\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/The-Intrepid-Explorer-logo2.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Hein%201.jpg?itok=zpBZpYDr\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hein\u2019s-sight\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hein\u2019s-sight\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hein\u2019s-sight&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Hein%201.jpg&amp;description=In Hein\u2019s Sight\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hein\u2019s-sight\" data-text=\"In Hein\u2019s Sight\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hein\u2019s-sight\" data-title=\"In Hein\u2019s Sight\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;By Jo Kromberg&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hein Wagner\u2019s favourite colour is black (he thinks). He was born blind and, dear reader, before you think me gormless enough to pose such a question to a blind person, he says so himself on his website.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI believe fear is the one thing that stands between disaster and us.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from being blind (and evidently having a slightly dark sense of humour about it all), Wagner is no ordinary person. He was born on 24 May 1972 with a condition known as Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis, or LCA \u2013 an inherited retinal degenerative disease characterised by severe loss of vision at birth. There is no known cure at present.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wagner had to learn to be resilient and tenacious from a very young age. \u201cAt the age of five, my parents sent me off to the Worcester School (now Institute) for the Blind. At the time, I could not believe they dropped me off at the school at such a young age, and for days I got totally lost on the school grounds and in the boarding house,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut, in retrospect, that is the best thing they could ever have done for me. Struggling to find my way at such a young age taught me such valuable lessons.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019m inspired by people who find their passion and live fulfilling lives and at the same time making a contribution to society. My parents, both mom and dad, played a huge role in helping me believe in myself and being kind and generous to others.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started his career as a switchboard operator, but the development of technology inspired him to enter the information technology industry, which saw him working for companies such as MWEB and Thawte Consulting. Here he quickly worked his way up to international sales manager, managing a team of 15 sighted individuals.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, Wagner still struggled with his disability psychologically, and decided to take up extreme sports events. Some of his adventures include sailing from Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro in the Cape to Rio Yacht Race, skydiving, participating in IRONMAN events and completing the Absa Cape Epic. In 2009 he set the World Blind Land Speed Record at 322.52 km\/h.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Hein%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also completed the 15th Antarctica Marathon in March this year (colloquially described as the harshest marathon on the planet), the first time ever that a blind person participated. Nick Kruiskamp, well-respected athlete and race champion, was Wagner\u2019s guide.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI always knew the Antarctica Marathon would be a test of endurance, mental strength and perseverance. However, I never thought that being on the seventh continent \u2013 surrounded by ice-capped mountains, glaciers, icebergs, snow, penguins, whales and other wildlife \u2013 would be so emotionally overwhelming,\u201d says Wagner.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treacherous race covered the most rugged terrain comprising mud, ice and sludge. He describes his perilous start of the race: \u201cWithin a few minutes, we tracked through the first bit of snow, followed by loads of mud. This quickly turned into a series of small water streams and, although we tried to jump over them, they pulled me in to the very centre of their icy cold. My mind was racing ahead to frostbite and amputations, when I told myself to snap out of it \u2013 motivating myself by realising it was just the beginning, so I forced myself to focus.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wagner continues: \u201cIn a brutally honest way, Antarctica reflects the ever dramatically changing world we live in, as no five minutes down there are the same. A beautiful, sunny morning at zero degrees Celsius can very quickly change into a snowy ice wind and rain, with a chill factor of minus 15 to minus 25 degrees. I\u2019ve never experienced anything colder than Antarctica. It had me shaking to my very core!\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He participated to promote the abilities of those living with disabilities, and to raise funds and create awareness of the Vision Trust \u2013 a non-profit organisation he founded in mid-2008, which strives to make the world as we know it a more accessible place for persons living with disabilities.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSince I can remember, I\u2019ve had a fascination with the North and South Poles, and when Mike Bailey (his running partner) came up with the idea to try and get an entry for the Antarctica Marathon, I jumped at the chance!\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does Wagner prepare for events such as the Antarctica Marathon? \u201cIt is tricky to simulate the conditions in sunny Cape Town. We spent some time in a cold room at minus 18 degrees to acclimatise. I decided not to do many off-road miles or trail runs, as being blind leaves me a lot more exposed to ankle injuries than the sighted.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cNothing I did back home could ever prepare me for what we went through in Antarctica. My approach on the day was one step at a time.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He does not consider himself an adrenalin junkie, however. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just hooked on great experiences and life has so many to offer.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Hein%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"428\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wagner says that accepting his blindness unconditionally has certainly been his most challenging expedition and achievement to date. \u201cJust when you think you get it, you\u2019ve got it, you have it \u2013 the mountain is just a little higher. Accepting the one thing I cannot do \u2013 see \u2013 allowed me to open my mind to so many other opportunities. The Absa Cape Epic also came close as my second biggest challenge, though.\u201d &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His unique experiences and outlook on life have afforded him numerous invitations to share his story and, in 2004, he decided to take up motivational speaking as a full-time career.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another of his initiatives is a concept known as &lt;em&gt;Dinner in the Dark&lt;\/em&gt;, and his website describes it thus: \u201cDinner in the Dark is the perfect dinner event to open the eyes of those who are simply too lazy to see.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve been working in the corporate entertainment industry for many years, but this event really moves people deeply. Many funny things happen in the dark, like highly educated guests arguing with me over the fact that I gave them white wine and they asked for red wine. When the lights come on, they avoid me like the plague!\u201d Wagner says with a laugh.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not all fun and games, though, and he has been faced with a few life-threatening situations in the course of his adventures. So how does he cope with fear? \u201cI made fear my friend a long time ago. I believe fear is the one thing that stands between disaster and us. Make fear your friend, acknowledge it for what it is, take from it what it is trying to point out to you, and get on with it.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says his team is the most important part of all his adventures. \u201cWithout my team\u2019s backup and support, I cannot do what I do. Somehow I manage to find amazing people on my journey who are willing to help, support and get involved, and I\u2019m most grateful to all of them.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are Wagner\u2019s plans for the next couple of years? Any exciting quests?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cAt this time, I\u2019m training very, very hard to try and qualify for the South African para-cycling team to represent South Africa in the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio. A long, hard road ahead \u2013 however, I\u2019m willing to give it all I have.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I ask him what message he most wants to impart to people through his life\u2019s quests, this remarkable man says the following: \u201cAnything you believe is not possible is actually possible; you just have to change the way you look at things. If you do that, the things you look at will change.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.heinwagner.co.za\u00a0\"&gt;www.heinwagner.co.za\u00a0&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Intrepid%20Cover%20Dec_0_0.jpg?itok=NeVmD1IL\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;The Intrepid explorer&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9616\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/sun-international%E2%80%99s-stunning-nkandla-deal\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Sun International\u2019s Stunning Nkandla Deal&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Sun International\u2019s Stunning Nkandla Deal  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Sun International\u2019s Stunning Nkandla Deal\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Nkandla%20LM.jpg?itok=5mVsg6xN\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sun-international\u2019s-stunning-nkandla-deal\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sun-international\u2019s-stunning-nkandla-deal\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sun-international\u2019s-stunning-nkandla-deal&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Nkandla%20LM.jpg&amp;description=Sun International\u2019s Stunning Nkandla Deal\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sun-international\u2019s-stunning-nkandla-deal\" data-text=\"Sun International\u2019s Stunning Nkandla Deal\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sun-international\u2019s-stunning-nkandla-deal\" data-title=\"Sun International\u2019s Stunning Nkandla Deal\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Apr 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Ken Quero&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun International has been on the prowl, and in March of this year announced the acquisition of casino resort group Peermont for a staggering R9.4 billion. The jewel in the crown is the iconic Emperor\u2019s Palace, one of the largest casino hotels in Africa. According to Sun International\u2019s chief executive Graeme Stephens, this will significantly expand its South African portfolio.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it seems that this is just the beginning. Sun International may be in the final throes of closing a second deal.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a confidential dossier that was recently left behind on the Gautrain, senior officials in the Department of Treasury have become increasingly concerned with the controversy surrounding the development of the presidential compound at Nkandla. South Africa has faced a number of headwinds in recent years. Internationally, the International Monetary Fund recently called for extensive reforms in the country, and both Fitch and Moody\u2019s have downgraded South African sovereign rating in the last six months.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Nkandla%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the domestic front, opposition parties have been in a state of frenzy over the matter, and even COSATU, ANC veterans, and party stalwarts like Ben Turok have been critical of the state of affairs. According to DA Parliamentary Leader, Mmusi Maimane, the amount of taxpayers\u2019 money spent on non-security upgrades to the Zuma compound is in excess of R52 million, and just about the only thing the DA, the Freedom Front and the EFF can agree on is that this amount \u2013 at least \u2013 must be repaid.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can only speculate that the presidency ultimately succumbed to this barrage of pressure, and have to admit that the solution is rather elegant. According to the dossier, which is now in the hands of the Train and Truck Drivers Union of South Africa (TT), final contracts are being drawn up for the sale of Nkandla to Sun International. Our source would not comment on the price, but hinted that it could be in the mid-9-figures, which would net a cool return of around 100%.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Nkandla%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun International CEO Graeme Stephens would not comment on plans for Nkandla but did say that \u2018While the Peermont portfolio of assets will initially increase the proportion of the combined business that arises in Southern Africa, it also opens the possibility of further restructuring of local assets, with a medium term objective of creating a portfolio of fewer assets of a higher quality.\u2019 It is clear that a significant KwaZulu-Natal acquisition would round off the group\u2019s African portfolio quite nicely, as the province has long been the one gaping hole in their portfolio.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate to the above, but clearly inspired by this development, we have learnt that the Department of Environmental Affairs is using the deal as a catalyst to clean up an issue that has been a thorn in its side for a considerable time. Sources close the department confirmed that as of the end of 2015, any and all hunting of predators that were bred in captivity will be outlawed. This calls to an end the abysmal practice of \u2018canned hunting\u2019, that has horrified conservationists both locally and abroad.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Nkandla%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to an early draft of the white paper that will be presented to parliament at its next sitting, all such animals that exist in captivity at the time of January 2016 will be confiscated and released in the Emakhosini Ophate Heritage Park. This park, which lies exactly midway between Nkandla, and its more famous sibling, the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Reserve, has been crying out for attention for years, and is finally getting the injection it so desperately needs.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising the importance of ethical hunting as a key pillar of growing the tourism industry in South Africa, Emakhosini Ophate will apparently be set aside exclusively for hunting. Says a source close to the department: \u2018While we object to the abuse of animals in captivity, the hunting of free roaming animals is the purest of sport, and will form a key pillar in our attempts to attract more foreign tourists to our beautiful country\u2019. In an interesting twist, anonymous sources claim that the first five years\u2019 worth of hunting quota of five lions has been allocated to Sun International as well\u2026 and the stay, spray and pray package will be called \u201cThis Poker Face ain\u2019t Lion to You\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9596\" class=\"publisher-1340 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/take-it-easy\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Take It Easy&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Take It Easy  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Take It Easy\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/wild_magazine.htm' target='_blank' style='background-color: #b7cb35' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wild.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Bontebok%20MAIN.jpg?itok=qH_h91vk\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/take-it-easy\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/take-it-easy\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/take-it-easy&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Bontebok%20MAIN.jpg&amp;description=Take It Easy\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/take-it-easy\" data-text=\"Take It Easy\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/take-it-easy\" data-title=\"Take It Easy\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Mar 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Bridgena Barnard&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why go away if all you want to do is read a book? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve often been asked, and the answer is obvious: I have a family to consider. So while I was looking for a relaxed weekend to recharge, my nearest and dearest, who had no interest in being transferred to a world of dragons, heroes and romance, had other priorities.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comfortably seated in a deck chair on the balcony of our log cabin at Lang Elsies Kraal cottage, I paid no attention to my family\u2019s pleas of \u201cI am hungry\u201d or \u201cWhat are we going to braai tonight?\u201d. Accompanied by bird song and the rippling sound of the Breede River, I finally got to wolf down the pages of my book, a Christmas gift of last year.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My imagination coloured the scenes from the book with the soft pinks of the Langeberg wrapped in loose blue clouds. The smell of the adjacent cottages\u2019 braai fires finally prompted me to put my book down and suggest our supper options.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kitchen, fully equipped with a stove, oven, microwave and tableware for six enabled me to prep a salad and some toasties in no time, while handy hubby took care of the braai. After supper the kids started playing cards and, apart from competitive shouts, the night was dead quiet.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Bontebok%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they fell asleep, tired from swimming and playing outdoors, I listened to a lonely nightjar in the tree outside the chalet and felt wonderfully content. Hubby had enjoyed the birding and his treasure for the weekend was the abundance of black harriers in the area. I had escaped to never-never land.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trip Planner&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest camp at Bontebok is on the banks of the Breede River, with wooden decks and braai areas perfectly situated to make the most of sunset. In addition to 10 one-room chalets ideal for two people (R900 base rate a night), there are now four family units that cost R1 500 a night and can sleep four people. The family units can accommodate an extra two people, R200 an adult, R100 a child. The camping facilities are outstanding, from R180 a night for one to two people.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe project cost around R3-million to complete and created work for 16 people and a contractor from the local communities.\u201d Roland January, Bontebok park manager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/blog.htm?action=view-post&amp;id=4662\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Wild Magazine&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/752\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bontebok National Park&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2100\"&gt;Bushbuck Trail, Bontebok NP&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

A six-week long expedition into the Sahara to climb the highest peaks in Chad (Emi Koussi) and Libya (Bikku Bitti); part of a lifelong ambition to summit the highest peak in each of the 54 African countries.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team:&lt;\/strong&gt; Eamon Fullen (UK), aka \u2018Ginge\u2019, the first person to climb the highest peaks in Africa; Misha Somerville (UK), a professional photographer and film maker; and seven local Toubou tribesmen.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adventurer:&lt;\/strong&gt;

Founding the environmental non-profit organisation SOAPkidz (Sunrise On Africa\u2019s Peaks kidz), which has introduced over 17 000 disadvantaged children to nature.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of expedition:&lt;\/strong&gt; 6 weeks (with 3 days to summit Emi Koussi and 5 days to summit Bikku Bitti).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completion date:&lt;\/strong&gt; December 2014.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing things what most people - particularly women - will never have the privilege to experience. The Toubou tribe do not allow women to mix with the men, and although I was allowed some interaction I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat with them.&lt;br&gt;Witnessing the locals praying in the desert with the sun setting behind them.&lt;br&gt;Waking up in the middle of the desert and watching the sunrise. The constant wind across the desert left a lasting impression and the millions of stars in the night sky made this a truly amazing place.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sponsors&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My family sponsored part of my trip, and they give me all the support I could ever wish for. My thanks also to Stuart Martin who kept everyone informed of my whereabouts and managed, through extremely difficult circumstances, to get money transferred to Chad.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The Kempinski Hotel in Chad gave us two free nights\u2019 accommodation.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To find out more&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/sunriseonafricaspeaks.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;sunriseonafricaspeaks.blogspot.com&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.soapkidz.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.soapkidz.org&nbsp;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration:&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;Climbing these peaks was part of a lifetime ambition to climb all 54 of Africa\u2019s highest peaks - Sunrise on Africa\u2019s Peaks (SOAP). Various coincidences brought Ginge, Misha and me together, presenting a once in a lifetime opportunity to plan a trip into an area of the African continent which very few people have ever seen.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;To climb the highest peaks in Chad (Emi Koussi) and Libya (Bikku Bitti) and to see the sunrise from the summit of each.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;To raise awareness about pollution on many of our mountains.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"322\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Originality&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two mountains we visited are some of the most inaccessible mountains in Africa. Bikku Bitti has only been summitted once (by Ginge - after three attempts), so ours was the second expedition to summit Libya\u2019s highest peak. I was the first woman to climb the mountain. I am aware of commercial expeditions to Emi Koussi but according to our guides, I was the first African woman to summit \u2013 and as a result they nicknamed me Madame Africa.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started planning in March 2014. There is very little infrastructure in Chad and communication is extremely difficult. Tourism is almost nonexistent and getting the necessary permits to travel to the north was really tricky.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These desolate and unforgiving desert regions meant that even a small oversight or mishap carried a real risk. Dangers included t&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;he history of civil unrest and war in the region, s&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;everal mine fields encountered on our way to the mountains, and s&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;corpions and snakes.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%2012.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;The extreme remoteness meant that any medical emergency beyond our general first aid knowledge would have resulted in a 2-week-long evacuation, and the&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;&nbsp;risk of mechanical breakdown could have left us stranded with limited rations of water and food.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest mountain in Libya, Bikku Bitti, is in one of the most remote, least accessible and least known part of the Sahara desert - during the Viking Lander projects, NASA identified the region as that which that most closely resembles the conditions on Mars.&nbsp;The area is unfit for human habitation and there are periods of 20 to 30 years with no rainfall. &nbsp;There is no permanent human habitation, no roads or tracks, just a great open void.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wars and conflicts have also played their part in keeping people away. &nbsp;Although Libya has recently started opening up, the southern part of the country is still off limits, as is the Tibesti in northern Chad, creating one of the biggest areas in Africa that foreigners are officially not allowed to visit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;I carried a satellite phone.&nbsp;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;We used two vehicles - a primary and a backup \u2013 which were robust enough to cope with the extreme terrain. We carried basic spares and repair items, and had a mechanically skilled driver.&nbsp;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"&gt;Because of the vast distances, we carried 600 litres of water with us, as well as extra food rations for at least two weeks.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If something went wrong, however, it would have taken up to 2 weeks for help from N\u2019djamena to reach us. &nbsp;Because we were in a vast ocean of rocks and sand, finding us could be compared to finding a rowing boat in the Atlantic.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally funded the whole expedition by taking out a second bond to the value of R380 000 on my house. &nbsp;The sensitive situation in south Libya meant that I was not able to advertise the trip, so was unable to find sponsors or self-funded people to join the trip and share the costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Verification&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos and photos - Misha Somerville is making a documentary on the expedition. I reported back after the Emi Koussi summit to the Chadian Minister of Tourism at the South African Embassy in Chad.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Necessary technical skills&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to survive in the desert and understand the dangers associated with snakes, scorpions, mine fields, unexploded ordnance and the lack of water was paramount to the success of the trip. The local Toubou people knew the area and navigated us through the desert.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moments&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security police at the airport in Chad detained me after they noticed that I was using a satellite phone \u2013 which is illegal in Chad. &nbsp;Eventually, the head of security, who could not speak a word of English, dropped me off at my hotel. &nbsp;While driving there, he swerved left and right while showing me pictures of himself with VIPs on his camera. &nbsp;I thought it would be really tragic dying in a car accident in Chad even before the dangerous bit of the adventure started!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahadi, one of my porters, has a heart condition but was very stubborn and insisted on going to the top of Emi Koussi with me. I was petrified that he would have a heart attack.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking down 150km from the nearest water and worrying that our driver, who went back to get vehicle parts, might have an accident or get lost and never make it back.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lowest point&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge personality clash within the team after climbing Emi Koussi in Chad, which nearly resulted in the trip to Libya being cancelled.&nbsp;I begged and begged, and eventually persuade the team to climb Bikku Bitti but it cost me another R60 000.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%209.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funniest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some serious vehicle trouble, we were stuck waiting for our backup vehicle to return with the required parts. &nbsp;We were all sitting in the shade when Mahadi jumped up, assembled a gold detector and just walked off in the sunset, detector in his hand!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most unexpected experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving 26 km along the Dohone Spur of the Tibesti Mountains in Southern Libya on the way to Bikku Bitti. The spur was like something out of the Avatar movie: absolutely breathtaking. No picture can ever capture the beauty of it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biggest lesson&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I learnt what Ubuntu is really about: I will always cherish is the way the locals looked after me and came to enjoy meeting the locals just as much as I enjoy the mountains. One incident stands out. I was in Ethiopia, travelling on the top of a beer truck, when a lady took my hand, looked me in the eyes and said something. &nbsp;When I asked the guy next to me what she said he replied \u201cshe said we are all one\u201d. &nbsp;Then an elderly lady who was lying with her back to me squeezed my hand. &nbsp;It was the most profound moment in my life. &nbsp;When the truck stopped, I was invited to her home - at 22:00 \u2013 and she cooked a chicken for me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would you have done differently&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact the South African embassy in the countries before my visit.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Carried huge wads of cash. Despite what I was told by a bank in South Africa, my credit cards were not accepted in Chad.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best piece of gear&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Columbia clothing.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most amazing people you met on the trip&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahadi, my porter\/guide and the other Toubou people I met were gentle souls with a great sense of humour. They really knew the area and the environment well, so I always felt safe even when they were leading us into \u2018the unknown\u2019.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%2013.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you eat&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m vegetarian so normally take my own mixture of soya and couscous, which only requires a cup of boiled water to prepare. &nbsp;The staple diet in Chad, however, is goat and very sweet pasta. &nbsp;The porters were quite shocked when I wanted salt on my pasta and I wouldn\u2019t eat goat meat.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the worst thing that bit you&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not bitten by anything major \u2013 but I got into serious trouble when I objected to a scorpion being killed. Apparently, in Chad, more people die from scorpion stings than malaria. &nbsp;With SOAPkidz, we teach the children and volunteers not to kill snakes\/spiders\/bats etc. But then we are close to medical help and our lives are not threatened.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s next&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably the four Southern African islands (Madagascar, Seychelles, Mauritius and the Comoros).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for other adventurers&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow your heart \u2013 even if your adventure does not make sense to anyone else.&nbsp;If you want to live your dream, you have to learn to let go of your own ego. I had to learn to contain my emotions and frustrations. People do things differently. &nbsp;Some people are very competitive and want to do everything on their own.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Karen%20Hauptfleisch%20replacement.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/A%202015%20logo%20s_0.jpg?itok=QMKoQFTc\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Adventurer 2015&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9595\" class=\"publisher-2376 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/reader%E2%80%99s-adventure-solo-wilderness\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Reader\u2019s Adventure - Solo, into the Wilderness&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Reader\u2019s Adventure - Solo, into the Wilderness  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Reader\u2019s Adventure - Solo, into the Wilderness\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wheels-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Canyon%20MAIN_0.jpg?itok=DUyGTVjj\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/reader\u2019s-adventure-solo-wilderness\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/reader\u2019s-adventure-solo-wilderness\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/reader\u2019s-adventure-solo-wilderness&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Canyon%20MAIN_0.jpg&amp;description=Reader\u2019s Adventure - Solo, into the Wilderness\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/reader\u2019s-adventure-solo-wilderness\" data-text=\"Reader\u2019s Adventure - Solo, into the Wilderness\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/reader\u2019s-adventure-solo-wilderness\" data-title=\"Reader\u2019s Adventure - Solo, into the Wilderness\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Mar 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics J\u00fcrgen H\u00f6ntsch&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revisiting some of southern Africa's most remote wilderness areas was long overdue for J\u00fcrgen H\u00f6ntsch, so he planned a solo journey to Namibia's \u201cCanyon Land\u201d, via the Richtersveld.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting my trip into the wilderness at The Growcery was an excellent idea. The camp is beautifully situated on the banks of the Orange (Gariep) River, about 22km west of Vioolsdrif. It offers, besides the wet and wild river tours, great 4x4 trails.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camp has 10 sites on grass, close to the water with a great view of the river. There are also chic shacks and en suite double rooms for the \u201csofter\u201d folk.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had acquired a brand new Malamoo \u201cinstant\u201d tent for better connection with Mother Nature and slept very well on my air mattress.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a hearty breakfast, breaking camp and deflating the Jeep\u2019s tyres, I was ready to tackle the western part (or second leg) of the Namaqua 4x4 Trail.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was new territory for me. Driving along in a harsh and hot mountain desert wilderness really sharpens the senses. No cell phone signal, no barking dogs and no radio, TV and politics for at least a week. Priceless! Admiring the landscape, reading the trail, listening to the sound of the engine and watching over the GPS and tyre pressure monitor were the tasks at hand.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Richtersveld is hauntingly beautiful. Seared by blistering sun, it is \u2013 to me -- the uncontested champion of SA\u2019s wilderness areas. It now forms part of the greater Ai Ais\/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park, which is divided by a vein of life, the Gariep River, in an almost surreal contrast to its surroundings.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Canyon%202.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer temperatures can reach the mid-50s and rain is as scarce as diamonds. Life sustaining moisture comes in the form of early morning fog that rolls in from the cold Atlantic. It is called malmokkies by the locals and sustains a remarkable range of small reptiles, birds, mammals and plant life, some species found nowhere else. Dramatic and beautiful, this is not a pampered paradise but rather an arid wilderness retreat for the nature lover. My love for it goes back to my first visit in 1965.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the Akkedis Pass, gnarled quiver trees, tall aloes and quaint &lt;em&gt;halfmens&lt;\/em&gt; keep vigil over this inscrutable landscape. I stopped more than once to absorb the beauty and solitude, and take pictures.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best camping spots at De Hoop were taken. It looked overcrowded, so I decided to continue south, towards Richtersberg, through thick river sand and with the temperature at 36\u00b0C. Louisa, the De Hoop receptionist, had warned me to avoid this section, but there was always deep sand in that area and what was wrong with a bit of sand driving? The tracks, however, differed from those I remembered and for some peace of mind I engaged the front airlockers whenever it seemed necessary. The trusty Jeep had no problems and my new set of A\/Ts performed really well in the sand.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Richtersberg camp, I was rewarded by being the only camper and the visit turned out to be the highlight of my trip. I pitched my tent on a section of grass overlooking the river and the rugged mountains on the Namibian side. After a not-so-cold shower, I settled in my camping chair with a cold one. A few vervet monkeys played in the riverine thicket and two goliath herons watched from an island nearby.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the sun vanished behind the mountains, I enjoyed a tasty rump steak with a chilled bottle of Durbanville\u2019s finest sauvignon blanc. In the fading daylight, the night spectacle started with hundreds of fireflies, in streaks of green light, dancing up and down and along the river.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Canyon%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my numerous travels (on four continents), I have met many remarkable people, and this trip turned out to be no exception. At the Kokerboomkloof camp, I met Braam from Nelspruit and his charming wife. They were there for six days in a 76 series Cruiser.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kokerboomkloof was said to boast a number of spectacular rock formations. When I asked Braam about them, he smiled and said that fellow travellers, as well as park officials, weren\u2019t exactly forthcoming on the matter, and it had taken him three days to find them. He showed me the places and I took great pictures of these marvels, including a pair of little klipspringer nearby. Thanks again, Braam!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roaming through the park, I compared today\u2019s situation with 10 years ago. It seemed to me that the ablution facilities provided at the various camps had had a positive effect on the environment. This was particularly noticeable at De Hoop, where visitors previously ignored the \u201cbush code\u201d, resulting in a disgusting situation and a health hazard, with plenty of flies.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A concern, however, was the making of new tracks, sometimes four running side by side, at places where road maintenance was neglected and corrugations had become a great nuisance.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also observed that quiver trees were dying at an alarming rate, and couldn\u2019t help wondering whether the &lt;em&gt;halfmens&lt;\/em&gt; was disappearing\u2026 just like the rhino.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another disturbing thing was the great number of goats foraging in the park, particularly in the Richtersberg area, as well as dogs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pontoon at Sendelingsdrift took us over the Gariep and into Namibia. Border crossing formalities were swiftly settled and soon I was heading north, on tar.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old wish was due to become reality. I was going to see the Fish River Canyon from \u201cthe other side\u201d, as I planned to drive around the canyon.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Canyon%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After refuelling at Rosh Pinah, I called in at Daisy Truck &amp; Auto to tighten my \u201ccosmetic\u201d Maxe runner boards. The corrugations had taken their toll and to diminish the rattles, I had squeezed empty plastic water bottles between the rails and the chassis. Johan would not accept payment and with a big smile handed back the plastic bottles. Well, he tried!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I headed east to the Namuskluft 4x4 base camp, at the end of a scenic valley in the harsh mountain desert, bordering the transfrontier park. It is well laid out with stands on a bit of lawn under shady trees. There are braai facilities, clean ablutions, Wendy houses, a pool and conference facilities. The camp offers self-drive and guided 4x4 trails, as well as hiking trails.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After setting up camp, I headed along the Bushman\u2019s Grave 4x4 trail into the mountains. The trail was not a great challenge. Game in the region includes gemsbok, kudu and mountain zebra, as well as smaller buck such as klipspringer and steenbok, but they remained invisible in the afternoon heat. Not finding the Bushman\u2019s Grave either, I returned to camp.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day, at the cattle post Witputs, 46km north of Rosh Pinah, I left the tar again and turned east onto the D463. The gravel road is in good condition and the geology is fascinating, but watch your travelling speed and look out for hidden obstacles. There was water in the Konkiep River and the vegetation attracts wildlife.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After about two-and-a-half hours of driving on gravel, with many photo stops and farm gate negotiations, I turned right into the Canyon National Park, and 30 minutes later I arrived at the Fish River Lodge. This is the only place on the \u201cother side\u201d from which you can see the canyon. It was a dream come true.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Canyon%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lodge, perched on the western rim of the canyon, is an up-market retreat in the middle of nowhere, with a view like no other. It lies within a privately owned reserve of 450km2 and offers plenty of game viewing and bird spotting, and photo opportunities to match. From here you can explore the canyon and its surrounds. It is a special place in a dramatic location. Although I was not a lodge resident, I was handed a welcome cocktail and shown around by the friendly staff anyway! &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located along the rim, less than 10m from the canyon\u2019s edge, are 20 chalets, each with its own terrace and outdoor shower, as well as roof-top windows for viewing the stars.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restaurant, with 10 chalets on each side, has a pool and there are indoor and outdoor bars and dining facilities from where the spectacular sunsets can be enjoyed. I would have loved to experience the sun setting and painting the canyon, but that had to wait for another time.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back on the D463, the Jeep rolled on north, eating up the kilometres in the dusty desert wilderness. The Drielingkop, or Inachakuppe, a landmark in that area, is visible from a great distance. Soon after it, I turned right against the GPS lady\u2019s order, and after some re-calculating, she finally agreed that I had made the correct decision.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a mere 28km on tar, I crossed the Fish River near Seeheim and then turned south and hit the gravel once again. The C12 was in much better condition than on my last trip in 2011.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Canyon%206.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long day, I finally arrived at the Canyon Roadhouse, where the self-catering accommodation was fully booked. A room at 1145 Namibian dollars a night was beyond my budget so I decided to carry on camping. I set up camp at site No 11, right at the end, which turned out to be a good choice. Besides the missing grass, there was power, an enormous shade tree, braai facilities and a well-designed ablution block with clean toilets and a hot shower -- all to myself. And, as I found out later, there was plenty of wildlife in the neighbourhood.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restaurant and bar have acquired a sort of cult status among visitors. The good old days of the automobile are celebrated in their theme \u2013 brilliant!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I planned the trip, one of my ambitions was to drive down into the canyon. I knew it could be done, and Canyon Adventures said on their website they could arrange it, but I received no reply to my e-mails. Unfortunately, I found that they were doing only mule trips at the time, but would soon be back in business with the 4x4 trail. My bad luck!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fish River Canyon is one of Namibia\u2019s most impressive natural wonders. I recently read that, contrary to popular belief, it wasn\u2019t \u201ccarved out by the power of the water over 1500 million years\u201d but rather was formed by plate movement and cracks in the earth's crust related to the break-up of Gondwanaland about 550 million years ago. It became the natural route of the river cutting its way along the floor. This also accounts for the sulphurous springs.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canyon radiates a captivating solitude and silence and exerts a magnetic force drawing you back again and again. It has relatively modest colours and contours. It seems flat and soft at noon, when the sun is directly overhead. The colours deepen and intensify at other times of the day. The shapes within the canyon, viewed at different times, seem to be moving. At midday they appear to withdraw to the sides, flattening themselves against the multi-layered walls as though they fear the sun.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Canyon%207.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an awesome place and should be approached with caution. I\u2019ve visited the canyon many times and have hiked down to the river in summer and in winter. We have pitched our tent next to the abyss and admired the sunset, stars and sunrise, back in the days when that was still allowed. But things have changed in the new Namibia, and the days of quiet and solitude at the canyon are long gone.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my arrival at the famous Hell\u2019s Bend, the main lookout point where an information centre has been built, busloads of tourists spoiled the ambience. After a few quick pictures, I took the road south, along the canyon\u2019s edge.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Sulphur Spring is the start of the hiking trail - the only place where you are still allowed to walk down in \u201corganised groups\u201d. Silence returned and I enjoyed the rest of the 20km trip along the rim.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road deteriorated into a 4x4 trail leading down two terraces, where I engaged low range. After many photo stops I reached the end of the road, and here I opened a cold one to celebrate my reunion with the canyon.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thoughts went way back to my first visit when the only attraction of Ai-Ais was a little pond, accommodating the thermal spring, surrounded by palm trees and thorny bush. A few visits later, over the Easter weekend in 1970, we were the first visitors to the new camp. It wasn't officially open yet, but they allowed us to stay in one of the new chalets, sleeping on brand new mattresses that were still wrapped in plastic, and they didn't charge us a cent. A few years later that holiday camp was washed away by a devastating flood \u2013 and not for the last time!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my way back I was signalled to stop by the driver of a blue Pajero with a GP registration number. \u201cWhere does the road go?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know, my navigator isn\u2019t so good,\u201d referring to his wife sitting next to him.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I laughed and answered: \u201cThis road goes nowhere \u2013 &lt;em&gt;pad loop dood&lt;\/em&gt; \u2013 and don\u2019t worry my navigator is hopeless!\u201d So we had a good laugh and a chat, and then he made a U-turn and followed me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my final leg, I stayed for two nights at the Norotshama River Resort, on the northern banks of the Gariep. Situated in the Aussenkehr Nature Park, it offers a variety of leisure activities.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shaded camping sites are on grass and there is electricity, clean ablutions and a good restaurant, overlooking the river. Here I met up again with Hennie and his crew from The Growcery camp, on their return from a trip far down the river.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first excursion was into the rugged and sweltering Gamkab River Canyon at a blistering 39\u00b0C (October). The trail follows the riverbed for about 10km and forms part of the old Ai-Ais 4x4 trail. Along a trickle of water, the riverbed is painted white by the crystallisation of soluble salts. Gigantic rock faces tower on the western side of the canyon. They are carved out at the bottom, and one can easily park a car underneath them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scenic Gamkab Canyon is another place of great silence, rarely frequented and deprived of life in that harsh desert wilderness, but it\u2019s a rewarding drive. The C13 gravel road through the transfrontier park is very scenic. I made an excursion up a mountain on a steep track from which there is a great view over the river, the Aussenkehr winelands and the Richtersveld.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it was time for my last trail, the canyon route in the Aussenkehr Nature Park. It is called the Canyon 4x4 Trail, but apart from two rocky obstacles it is relatively easy to drive. You have to pay 145 Namibian dollars to get a key that unlocks a gate.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail follows a dry riverbed through the canyon with dramatic dolerite rock formations, 100m high. This would make a great location for a Wild West movie.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Springbokvlakte and negotiating the rocky obstacles, the trail passes a kloof of quiver trees, followed by a plain, sparsely grown with silvery Aristida grass waving in the wind. Here I spotted a number of wild horses and, among them, a mountain zebra with an identity crisis.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been a journey into the past, but I also conquered new frontiers and experienced again that overwhelming feeling of relaxation in the solitude and tranquility of wild places \u2013 particularly the desolate and hauntingly beautiful \u201cCanyon Land\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More information&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driver&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;J\u00fcrgen H\u00f6ntsch, 73, learned about off-roading and sand driving in the old South West Africa, particularly during a Kalahari crossing in 1970 with a friend in his Toyota Corona 1200 bakkie.&nbsp;Geology played a role in his professional life, so it still interests him in his retirement.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle:&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Customised\/converted Jeep KJ Cherokee 2002 Ltd, 2.5l CRD with OME raised suspension, Rancho dampers, ARB bumper\/winch bar, ARB air-lockers front and rear, Centreforce competition clutch, large tyres, SAC chip and a number of other modifications.

They were joined by Sheelagh Antrobus (Project Rhino KZN), Micah van Schalkwyk (World Youth Rhino Summit coordinator), Bronwyn Laing (Rhino Art \u2018Let our Voices Be Heard\u2019 campaign leader) and Penny Parker (Cape Union Mart). &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rhino%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Player\u2019s lifelong work to conserve the southern white rhino and the iMfolozi Wilderness area, which forms part of the greater Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, was the inspiration for the group to give up their home comforts and leave school and rhino conservation work for a few days to personally experience life in the wild, surrounded by the Big 5. The 30 000ha area is home to a large population of endangered black and white rhino and is under constant threat from armed poaching syndicates. It is also threatened by Ibutho Coal\u2019s pending application to develop an open-cast mine close to the Wilderness boundary fence, which conservation groups are fighting to prevent, saying the continual noise, light and dust emanating from the mine will destroy the sensitive ecology of the Wilderness area, as well as intensify poaching threats.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rhino%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no communications or contact with the outside world, the group - led by Denis Zondi and Sipho Buthelezi, field guides from the Wilderness Leadership School - traversed the hills and valleys flanking the Black iMfolozi River, sleeping in the open and cooking evening meals using only two pots, one kettle and a large spoon. Tasty pasta dinners, oats porridge for breakfast, cheese and tuna sandwiches for lunch and dried fruit to snack on kept them fed. Water drawn from the river and purified provided their drinking water. The girls became quite fond of \u2018Mr Dug\u2019 \u2013 the yellow and green hand trowel, so necessary for digging that important little hole after early morning coffee.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rhino%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed toilet paper!\u201d exclaimed Bronwyn Laing. \u201cSo we became very good at identifying non-poisonous leaves and grass to use instead!\u201d Lion, rhino, hyena, elephant and buffalo were always in close proximity and on night three, two elephants visited their campsite, causing the group to beat a hasty retreat in the darkness. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in any real danger,\u201d said Micah van Schalkwyk from Pietermaritzburg, who spotted the looming pachyderms during her night watch. \u201cMoving away from them was more about showing respect: we were, after all, in their world.\u201d Experiencing the interconnectedness of wildlife, wilderness and humanity was a constant theme of the five-day trail and each woman took away a different experience. \u201cWilderness represents that quiet place we all have to go sometimes when we need to look at life through a wider lens. Wilderness teaches patience, rhythm and process, and gave me time to reflect,\u201d said Micah. \u201cBeing in the wilderness is not easy but it is simple. By un-complicating life, you leave room to learn about yourself and find peace.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rhino%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penny Parker agreed: \u201cFor me, the most important and memorable moments of the trail where those times in which nothing was said. \u2018Solo time\u2019 spent reflecting on how profoundly the wilderness impacted us, the Night Watch and the great sense of responsibility towards your fellow trailists. The sounds of the night, the distant roar of a lion, incessant chirping of cicadas, the lullaby of a fiery-necked nightjar and the eerie whoop of a hyena all combine to create a magical moment in which you literally feel more at home than ever. \u201cAnd of course, the camp life: collecting and purifying water, making the fire, preparing dinner, washing pots and ensuring no sign of our presence was left behind. \u2018Leave no trace\u2019 meant absolute respect for the land that supported us.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rhino%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was the personal heartache of being lead to a grassy slope on which the two-year old bones of a poached rhino still lie - a bleached, silent appeal to please do more,\u201d said Sheelagh Antrobus. \u201cOn the opposite bank of the river, a breeding herd of elephant wandered past and buffalo wallowed in the shallows. I fingered the long rib bones and perfectly pitted vertebrae of what was once a magnificent rhino in her prime as Zondi related the tale of how she was shot by poachers and her horns forcibly removed. I felt personally responsible: it happened during my watch. \u2018I\u2019m so, so sorry\u2026\u2019 was all I could whisper to the bones through which the wind blew a deeply sad memorial, and make a promise to do more to protect KZN\u2019s rhinos.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rhino%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail ended at the memorial iSivivane (stone cairn) at the iMfolozi Centenary Centre, built by the World Youth Rhino Summit participants last year, where each trial member laid a pebble from the Wilderness in memory of Dr Ian Player.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To show your support and contribute to the Save the iMfolozi Wilderness campaign, please visit: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/women-in-the-wilderness\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.indiegogo.com\/projects\/women-in-the-wilderness&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/831\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;iMfolozi Game Reserve&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/830\"&gt;Hluhluwe Game Reserve&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

and supplied &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kruger\u2019s Magnificent Seven elephants were so named for their giant tusks. Since the last of them died 30 years ago, 15 new princes to the throne have been chosen. They are the Emerging Tuskers.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are up early, ready to leave when the gate opens at Letaba Rest Camp in northern Kruger. The first light of day offers excellent game viewing and sightings of interesting animal behaviour, and we\u2019re not missing the action for anything. In the picnic basket, a flask of hot coffee and a week\u2019s supply of rusks is backup, should we encounter something extraordinary and stay out longer than usual.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spot the usual suspects \u2013 impala, baboons sunning themselves, and a large herd of buffalo in the distance, as we head in the direction of the Giriyondo Border Gate, which connects Kruger with Limpopo National Park in Mozambique. This effectively creates the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park that also includes Zimbabwe\u2019s Gonarezhou. The day is warm and still, hardly a leaf moves. Then a tree next to the road shakes and we stop and wait. The Mopani tree continues to shiver.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grey trunk appears, so close we can see the scars in its wrinkled skin. And then the tusks, the huge tusks. One drapes long and low to the ground, the other curves upwards. There\u2019s no mistaking that they belong to a giant elephant, and we know this is our lucky sighting for the day.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly the massive bull emerges. He looks back at us but shows no aggression. Still, his size is intimidating as we sit transfixed in what feels like a Lilliputian double cab. We watch and he watches and for a moment I wonder who is really watching whom, since we are the intruders today.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bull forces his way out of the Mopani thicket and we get to photograph him from all angles, and notice his perfectly shaped ears as he slowly eases out onto the roadside, before he ambles off ahead of us.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/High%20%26%20Mighty%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"385\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emerging tusker Mculu has noticeable curved tusks and was first spotted by Kirsty Redman in 2009. He lives around Letaba.&lt;\/em&gt; &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at camp, we head for the the Elephant Hall museum, where the Magnificent Seven \u2013 the seven biggest tuskers in Kruger \u2013 are honoured, and enquire about the identity of our big tusker that morning. A photo ID display of current big tuskers there makes this easy, and Kirsty Redman, interpretive officer for the Nxanatseni Region of Kruger, is around to confirm our excitement.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had in fact seen Masthulele, currently the biggest known and named elephant in Kruger. He\u2019s one of the current crop called the Emerging Tuskers and is named after Dr Ian Whyte, Kruger\u2019s retired large-mammal scientist, who formalised an Emerging Tuskers project in about 2001.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsty explains that Masthulele means \u2018the quiet one\u2019, which was Dr Whyte\u2019s local name, one he earned from his colleagues for his quiet temperament on research trips, a temperament he shares with Masthulele.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the early 1980s, when elephant poaching in Kruger was a big problem, Dr Uys deVillers Pienaar (known as U de V), chief warden at the time, had the idea of calling the seven elephants with the biggest tusks in Kruger the Magnificent Seven, to raise awareness of the poaching problem as well as honour any conservation success.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these elephants was named for where it lived or what it looked like \u2013 Dzombo, Kambaku, Jo\u00e3o, Mafunyane, Ndlulamithi, Shawu and Shingwedzi. Public response was overwhelming, awareness went global, and the Magnificent Seven \u2013 which were regularly spotted \u2013 became arguably the most renowned elephants on Earth.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/High%20%26%20Mighty%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ngonyama (on the right) means \u2018lion\u2019 in Tsonga and honours renowned Sanparks conservationist Dr U de V (Tol) Pienaar, who survived being bitten by a lioness in the mid 1950s. Ngonyama is docile and doesn\u2019t mind being photographed.&lt;\/em&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the mid-eighties, all The Magnificents were dead \u2013 two at the hands of poachers. Their glory days were short \u2013 only around five years \u2013 but most of their lives were long, many living into their fifties. Dzombo died in a hail of AK47 bullets fired by poachers from Mozambique, and Kambaku had to be euthanised after a bullet wound turned septic. The rest of the Magnificents died of natural causes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThese elephants were the biggest of that era,\u201d Kirsty tells us. \u201cAnd they roamed throughout the park. So the chances of the public seeing these big tuskers was high. Even now, decades after the last of The Magnificents died, people remain fascinated by them. It may be their sheer size \u2013 each had tusks weighingin at a combined minimum of 100kg \u2013 or maybe simply because they are elephants and embody grace and intelligence.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with the new generation of big tuskers in Kruger, the legend continues. Elephants are constantly being monitored as contenders for the title Emerging Tusker \u2013 their tusks need to protrude at least a metre from the lip line \u2013 and at the moment there are 15. All the present tuskers are named in honour of rangers or SANParks staff members, both living and deceased, who made a notable contribution to conservation. The 15 are Bidzane, Machachule, Masasana, Masthulele, Madolo, Mavalanga, Mbazo, Mculu, Ngunyupezi, Ngonyama, Ntombazana, Nwashinangana, Thandamamba, Timaka and Tsotsi.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kruger currently has about 17 000 elephants and a limited elephant-poaching concern, having lost just two to poachers in 2014. So for now the 15 Emerging Tuskers are safe in their various territories across the park. Masthulele \u2018The Quiet One\u2019 heads the list and continues to fascinate all who see him. He symbolises this new generation of greats, and has claimed his place as a living legend among elephants so impressive they simply have to be seen.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\/subscribe\/\"&gt;Country Life&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3285\"&gt;Kruger National Park (North and Far North)&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;

Getting permission to swim across international boundaries was especially time-consuming: getting permission for the Red Sea swim took 18 months!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides drowning and, on the Bering Strait swim, hypothermia, there was also the chance of being attacked by hostile sea animals.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Jean%20Craven%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We always had support boats though these were not always up to much. On the PNG crossing for example I was the only swimmer. A good friend of mine (I struggled to convince anyone to join me for the swim because of the remote location), together with a local boat driver supported me from a \u2018banana boat\u2019, a small wooden boat with a 40cc outboard so I kept close to the shore where I could.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On some trips we had spotters for crocodiles (Papua New Guinea and Panama), sharks (Papua New Guinea, Red Sea) and walruses (Bering Strait). On the Bering swim, we had lifeguards and hypothermia doctors on the boat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate sponsors helped cover our costs on the day of the swim but I paid my own accommodation and flights. What cash was left from the corporate sponsors went to charity. Donations from the public entirely went to our charities.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Verification&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs, video footage and the word of our fellow swimmers.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Jean%20Craven%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first leg, swimming the Strait of Gibraltar, was the result of a bet between friends \u2013 with the winnings donated to charity. Then came the familiar \u201cwhat next\u201d question: so, I decided to attempt to become the first person to complete the inter-continental swim challenge to raise funds for children\u2019s charities.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Necessary technical skills&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously being able to swim long distances in open water, but as with most extreme adventures the key thing is to have a strong, determined mind \u2013 particularly when organizing and training for the event.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing the meter reading a current of 7km\/hour and 3.2 degrees C water temperature in the Bering Strait&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lowest point&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of a general from the Papua New Guinea army at our shack at 10pm the evening before our planned swim telling us we wouldn\u2019t be permitted to do so.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Jean%20Craven%209.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funniest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few celebratory drinks at a bar following our final swim, the entire population of Nome, Alaska joined us for a tour of a luxury cruise liner that was only intended for the swimmers.

Amos Oxereuk, an ex Wall Street capitalist who\u2019d returned home to Wales, Alaska to join his fellow Inupiaq and assisted us in our Bering Strait swim. Steve Tekwei, PNG surf champ and head of the Sunset Surf Club &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.journeyman.tv\/?lid=57146&amp;tmpl=transcript\"&gt;http:\/\/www.journeyman.tv\/?lid=57146&amp;tmpl=transcript&lt;\/a&gt; who helped us in Papua New Guinea. I sent him a BlackBerry from South Africa when I got back so that we could message and keep contact.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you eat&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbs before swims, beer after.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Worst thing that bit you&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bug to do the next adventure.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What hurt most&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chafing on my neck \u2013 the result of wearing a wetsuit for so long in salt water.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Jean%20Craven%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s next&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming in the lake below the Ojos del Salado peak \u2013 the world\u2019s highest ever swim at 6400m.

A moment ago my wandering thoughts were of beautiful landscapes and worriless futures. Now thought is suspended for two seconds. Then I look up, sight as blurry as sound, with nothing but a desiccated windscreen on the bonnet, the glass still in one piece but with cracks all over it, like a dried out salt pan in the Kalahari. The severity of the situation quickly hits us; we have just rolled our car on a dirt road in remote southern Tanzania somewhere near the border of Mozambique. In a region known for man-eating lions.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks earlier I\u2019d taken a call from Paul, a friend of mine from school, \u201cEeerrrr\u2026 howzit Andy, I\u2019m going on a eight-month road trip with Zanne to Chad in two weeks, do you want to come?\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the most informative or formal of propositions, but he had hooked me with \u201croad trip\u201d and \u201cChad\u201d.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhere on route are we going? What must I bring?\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cJust bring matches, we must NEVER run out of matches,\u201d he shouted over the phone, \u201cI\u2019ve got a spare &lt;em&gt;gat&lt;\/em&gt; (revolver) for you!\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The well-known Kokerboom, or Quiver Tree, is prolific in Boesmanland in the Northern Cape.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After rambling through some vague coordinates to the north, south, east or west of a general area near a somewhat plausible village name, it became very obvious that this wasn\u2019t going to be a standard Lonely Planet page-turner. We were to go to the last wildernesses of Africa; remote areas with no reserve boundaries and no inhabitants \u2013 untouched, uncontrolled and brutally wild.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip would take three intrepid South Africans; Zanne Labuschagne, a recent conservation biology masters graduate, Paul Benecke, graduate in civil engineering, myself, Andrew Brukman, a professional photographer and producer, and a 1998 Land Rover 300TDI through the bushman lands of Northern Cape in South Africa into Namibia; across to Botswana to track wild elephants on unexplored islands in the Okavango Delta; to Zambia to see an ancient dance ritual of the Chechewa tribe; on to Malawi for a surf on the lake, into man-eating lion territory in remote southern Tanzania; then through Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Cameroon and eventually Zakouma National Park in south-eastern Chad.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view looking over a farm in the heart of the Karoo. The Karoo Koppies in the far distance lead onto dwarf shrub and rocky plains.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Paul, 90km\/hr is apparently the most fuel-efficient speed to travel in a Land Rover. He is like an old mechanic with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 seemingly experienced after years in the field but with massive gaps of knowledge. Still, you don\u2019t argue with him so we decided to call our trip \u201c90km\/hr\u201d. It started off as an essential money saving scheme for our lowly budget but ended up as the perfect metaphor for our trip.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip wasn\u2019t about racing to the finish. We wanted to find the most obscure dirt roads, far-out camping sites and fascinating people in the hope that we would discover places where no travel blog or guide had featured. Most importantly though we sought the feeling you get in places unspoiled by footprints and the interaction you have with strangers untainted by tourism.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In these hot and sunny areas of Karoo shade is a currency provided by sparsely positioned trees for cattle to rest under.&nbsp;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip began with a bang and a thud \u2013 the thud of our tent falling off our roof rack and into the tangle of vineyards somewhere between Robertson and Montagu. We were driving from a successful opening night at the Wacky Wine Festival, a popular event held just outside Cape Town in the well-known wine region of Kannaland.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started making sense when we sped, at 90km\/h, past Ronnie\u2019s Sex Shop, made a quick U-turn and joined some folk for a Windhoek. Ronnie\u2019s Sex Shop, a bush bar somewhere on the road to Barrydale at the start of the Klein Karoo region, is a famous landmark on the R62 landscape. The story goes that a bunch of mates decided to put \u201cSex\u201d in-between Ronnie\u2019s Shop, which at the time was just that. Well\u2026 Business started booming and Ronnie decided to open a bar, passing more beers over the counter than a German Brauhaus, and his establishment, decorated with bras, coasters and dildos, turned into a mish mash watering hole of local farmers and Israeli tourists.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Etton \"Da Mal Moer\" Wiggins, raconteur extraordinaire, in full swing on another hilarious story.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backtracking slightly, we took a dirt road through farmlands that led, eventually, to Riversdale. After a stopover in Still Bay we went guns blazing up the Outeniqua Pass near George towards Britstown. It\u2019s not the most direct or common route but has its hidden rewards. Forest passes and fertile farmlands level out into open Karoo veld, or grasslands. &nbsp;The landscape is epic, morphing into dwarf shrub and rocky plains balanced with Karoo Koppies \u2013 prehistoric flat-topped mountains of compacted lava \u2013 and slowly thinning out into the Kalahari Desert, a large semi-arid sandy savannah that takes you into Namibia.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s safe to camp anywhere so long as you\u2019re not too close to a town. But where ever you are do yourself a favour and stop on the side of the road, jump on the roof or grab a chair and open a beer as the sun is setting. Look at the dark mauve sky meeting the long golden shadows of the veld and listen to the vastness. &nbsp;In the distance you\u2019ll hear the victorious cry of the jackal echo through open country while the farmer wakes up in bed plotting his next move to get rid of the vermin.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul bumped into a friend when we stopped at the Kenhardt Hotel. What are the chances!&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waking up the in the morning (covered with dew and with slight hangovers) next to a farm boundary called Donkerhoek (\u201cdark corner\u201d in Afrikaans) near Britstown we started off towards Warmbad in Namibia. Through a series of bumpy dirt roads, we twisted and slid our way into what was supposed to be a hot tourist attraction of natural warm springs and a spa. It was all relative we realized very quickly.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving, we were greeted by one 200m strip of tar road and a scattering of dilapidated houses with a half-hearted \u201cTourism Office\u201d sign hanging on to its perch for dear life. No one was on site so we took a self-drive safari around the area eventually landing up at what would\u2019ve been quite a pleasant stone clad indoor hot spring had it not for the fact that it was now more like a vandalised shack with an algae-filled pool, floating plastic Coke bottles and smashed windows. It reeked of the all-too-familiar South African municipal mismanagement and coffer plundering. Despite this, it did have another outdoor lukewarm green pool, which we used as a bath to wash underarms and blurry travel eyes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our picnic spot on the Orange River in Kakamas.&nbsp;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of South Africa is not well known for its tourism but this was the reason we chose that route. The economy of the area is dominated by farming, mainly Dorper sheep, and hunting. The dorpie (small town) of Kenhardt is the centre for all this activity; essential to this is the Kenhardt Hotel. This by-gone era establishment sits at the junction of the main road like a rusty car relic, but despite this it is the hub of social activity.&nbsp;Sit at the bar and you are sure to strike up a conversation with the owner Etton \u201cDa Mal Moer\u201d Wiggins \u2013 a local raconteur par excellence. All our conversation was conducted in Afrikaans as he claimed he could only say two words in English, \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018goodbye\u2019, and those were reserved for self-defence. We sat in the thatched, bush-themed bar with a Castle beer in hand listening to stories of bikers and two-week beer binges. Two ales down, and getting comfortable, we realised how these stories all started so decided to cut our midday drinks stop short.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just outside Nous, on the way to Onseepkans near the Namibian border, we pitched camp on the side of the road, read books and slept next to a cosy fire under crazy constellations of stars.&lt;\/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bushmanland, or Boesmanland, was a bantustan in South-West Africa (present-day Namibia), intended by the apartheid government to be a self-governing homeland for the San people (the Bushmen). Despite this, a government was never established in the region. Our destination for the day was Kakamas, a big table grape farming town on the banks of the Orange River. It originated as a place where the Orange River could be relatively easily crossed, hence its former moniker Bassonsdrif. In 1898 a proper settlement was established and under the auspices of the Dutch Reformed Church the area was developed as an agricultural centre.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Boesmanland%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We were convinced that the green algae infested pool held some unknown spa treatment qualities.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a pleasant town to stop off for a night and there are some great walks along the Orange River. With the help of some local knowledge from a friend who we were staying with we found the perfect sundowner spot on a rocky hill overlooking the whole town and adjacent mountains. Vantage points like these are always great, giving you a wide perspective on the landscape. We could see clearly the contrast between the small, fertile, irrigated band along the river and the rocky outcrops of dry land beyond.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Kakamas we headed for Namibia. We took, as per our mission, the most obscure route past a spooky settlement called Nous to an obscure border post called Onseepkans. All of this took two days; with a breakdown and a spectacular camp spot on an open plain near Nous!

The answer is Hot Heels Africa.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Started in 2003, Hot Heels Africa, a World Cup Downhill Skateboarding race, is the longest continuously-running event in the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) World Cup Series and attracts challengers from near and far. This, along with the fact that it is the final leg of the domestic competition, means that local and international gravity racers are lured to battle it out for final points on the international league, as well as the South African Champion title.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organised by the South African Gravity Racing Association (SAGRA), in association with 78a Production and Management, this year's event kicked off on Thursday, 11 December and saw local and international challengers competing in the knockout tournament, which culminated in the finals on Sunday, 14 December.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riders and supporters alike descended on the coastal towns of Pringle Bay and Rooi Els in the fair Cape to play their part in this high-speed, action-packed experience.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tranquil and pristine Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, considered the heart of the Cape floral Kingdom, was given a slightly different focus as gravity riders sped down the track at break-neck speeds in search of the coveted title. With young and old gathered to watch the spectacle, the event also managed to attract the attention of several baboons that ventured down to investigate what the humans were up to, much to the annoyance of the organisers who needed to keep the track clear.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kings%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I was not unlike the baboons in my ignorance of skateboarding, but after the first race I had newfound respect for these athletes; and athletes they are! One does not need to be a skateboarder to appreciate what these competitors achieve as they hurtle down the tar track at speeds of between 75 and 80 km\/hour, with no protection save for a helmet and leather suit. What is more, falling is even somewhat expected, and several contestants found themselves sliding along the tar and slamming into hay bales in their endeavours to earn a podium finish. Miraculously, most riders were ok and able to pick themselves up and continue competing. How they do it, I have no idea!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The racing categories included Downhill Skateboarding, Street Luge and Classic Luge, and as the track warmed up under the afternoon sun the speeds increased, as riders pushed the limits for a podium finish.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were about 85 contestants taking part, of which a quarter were international competitors. Our hopes were firmly on our local boys and girls, and they left nothing on the line as they tried to hold off the international challengers. In a sport of such small margins there was very little to separate the competition, but the South African contingent did themselves proud.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Downhill Skateboarding final, the premier event of the day, Kyle Wester of the USA took top honours in the Open category, while Marie Bougourd of France took first place in the Ladies race.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details, see &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.sagra.co.za\/index.php\/hot-heels-home\"&gt;www.sagra.co.za\/index.php\/hot-heels-home&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kings%20end.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"723\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.doitnow.co.za\/content\/kings-board-grace-kogelberg\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/769\"&gt;Kogelberg Nature Reserve&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

The ride in aid of Africa\u2019s smallest finch will kick off from Cape Town on 15 March 2015.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Eelco cycled from Joburg to Cape Town \u2018for fun\u2019. He hopes to complete the ride from Cape Town to Victoria Falls within 40 days. We caught up with him and asked a few questions, before he heads off on this next adventure.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cape%20Town%20to%20Vic%20Falls%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of all the endangered and threatened species on Earth, why did you choose to raise funds for this little bird that you refer to as an avian jewel?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.rarefinch.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Rare Finch Conservation Group&lt;\/a&gt; is made up of a group of finch enthusiasts, from South Africa and Australia, wishing to make some kind of meaningful contribution to finch conservation work in the wild. For nine years we worked up in Uganda at the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, home to half of the world\u2019s remaining threatened Mountain Gorillas, trying to find one of Africa\u2019s rarest finches: the threatened and elusive Shelley\u2019s crimsonwing. To date there are still only two known photographs of the bird in the world. Sadly in 2014 , due to lack of funds and various logistical reasons we were forced to defer our work in Uganda. We then made the strategic decision to offer our services and enthusiasm to BirdLife South Africa.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.birdlife.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;BirdLife South Africa&lt;\/a&gt; informed us that the beautiful little Orange-breasted Waxbill, which is not yet listed as threatened, has unfortunately experienced unexpected significant declines in various parts of its natural habitat. This development has resulted in the urgent need for the species to be researched. So what we are doing now is launching the public awareness and fund raising campaign for Africa\u2019s smallest finch that now needs conservation help.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You clearly enjoy riding your bike, as you cycled from Joburg to Cape Town for fun, in 2013. &nbsp;Where did your love of cycling begin?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As 12-year-old kids we loved cycling and we often cycled to wherever we went. Some of us even learnt how to ride a bicycle backwards while sitting on the handlebars. Not a thing I can recommend.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cape%20Town%20to%20Vic%20Falls%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This trip will be more than double the distance of the Joburg to Cape Town trip and cross into two other countries. Do you have any concerns about this trip?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure. This is a massive ride and it requires a huge amount of planning and preparation. The number one priority with endurance cycling is safety and health, and not speed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other than accomplishing your goal of getting to Vic Falls and raising as much money as possible to help save the Orange-breasted Waxbill, what are you looking forward to most on the trip?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each day will have its own specific targets, challenges and highlights. I have had to add an extra 200km to the distance between Cape Town and Johannesburg in order to make the total distance to Vic Falls 3000km. Arriving in Johannesburg will be a big achievement for me. Not only will I then be well over the half way mark, but I will also be one of the very few people to have cycled both down as well as up, between these two major cities. The second next big target will be to cross the border into Botswana and reach Palapye which will be the first major town in that country. From there I cycle to Francistown and then up to Nata, where there is a beautiful bird sanctuary. From Nata up to Kusene is another major challenge. The distances in the northern part of Botswana are massive so managing my water supplies, potential heatstroke and keeping a good look out for the wild game will all be part of the adventure. Reaching Kasane on the Chobe river will certainly be another highlight for me. From there I prepare to do the final 90km by crossing the border into Zimbabwe and heading to Vic Falls.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cape%20Town%20to%20Vic%20Falls%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your bicycle weigh once it\u2019s all packed for a trip and ready to roll?&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bike weighs 16kg, my kit excluding water weighs 30kg. At the start in Cape Town my weight will be approximately 90kg, but I expect to have lost approximately 12 kg by the time I reach Vic Falls.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would your three top tips be for other cyclists that would want to do a solo cross country or cross border cycling trip?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Upfront planning is key. Research the entire route thoroughly and if possible try and drive the route at least once before riding it. Knowing where each water and safety point is, what the road conditions are, exact distance splits, B&amp;B\u2019s, emergency assistance, bicycle shops etc. all helps to reduce the guess work and improve safety.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Don\u2019t think you will ride yourself fit. You need to train for it and close to the start date you need to do full kit training so that you are comfortable with the additional weight.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Always try and have a plan A ,B, C and even possibly D for every situation.

For 2015, three events are planned, and one is already fully booked. 3 - 12 April, and 24 September - 3 October still have availability. So, how has this 250 km \/ 10 day hike through this desolate part of the country come about, and why is it becoming so popular?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tankwa%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danie Pieterse has always cherished a dream of walking from his grandfather Jan Pieterse\u2019 s grave in the Tankwa-Karoo to his other grandfather's grave in Rawsonville. He once shared this idea with one of his friends, Charl van der Merwe, and soon the planning for the first Tankwa Camino started. The main idea behind the Camino would be to introduce people to this beautiful part of the country.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tankwa%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charl and his wife (Mariete) started training for the hike straight away, with Danie and his wife (Rhina) delegated to coordinate the hike and the support team. All this planning and preparation bore fruit when a motley crew of 45 hikers and 10 support staff gathered in front of the big red postbox in Calvinia on Friday 9 August 2013 for the start of the 'great trek'.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tankwa%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tankwa%205.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter Thompson's 1971 odyssey &lt;em&gt;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&lt;\/em&gt; opens with the words: \"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take effect\". The Tankwa desert will became your drug for ten days, as you walk through one of the most extraordinary landscapes in Africa, a landscape that beggars belief, that makes you&nbsp;realise&nbsp;God is indeed in the details. This is a place where time and distance is stretched,&nbsp;where horizons dance and disappear, and where every corner brings a new startling vista.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Tankwa%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"462\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tankwa Camino costs R3 500 per person. Dinner, and coffee and fruit at other times of the day, is included in this fare, as is portage of your tent, sleeping bag and other surplus belongings. You also get 5 litres of hot water to wash in the evenings! Breakfast and lunch is your responsibility.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next Tankwa Camino will be from 3 - 12 April 2015.

You cannot ask for two better coaches, mentors and tour leaders; the Mocke brothers love their paddling and cherish their country. During this trip you will have an awesome paddling adventure and improve your paddling as you are coached by the best. All levels of paddler are tailored for; an intrepid spirit is the only requirement.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 1 -2 | 23 \u2013 24 Mar&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sojourn starts on the 23rd March in the Eastern Cape, well known for its down to earth and friendly locals. You will begin in the \u201cFriendly City\u201d Port Elizabeth, where the adventure starts by paddling around the Cape Recife, culminating in riding the longest surfski wave in the world, with rides sometimes in excess of 2 minutes!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5%20Capes%20cape-recife_web.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The haunting Cape Recife \u2013 home to the longest surfski wave in the world.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From P.E. it is a short drive to the small coastal town of Cape St Francis. This is one of South Africa\u2019s favourite ocean playgrounds and home to the highest mason structure in Southern Africa, the St Francis Lighthouse. St Francis is also near the world famous surfing break Jeffrey\u2019s Bay. After working on your wave skills at the friendly surf break of St Francis and some technique coaching on the nearby canals, you will paddle around the Cape St Francis.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5%20Capes%201%20Cape-St-Francis.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cape of St Francis \u2013 home to Southern Africa\u2019s largest mason structure.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 3 \u2013 4 | 25 \u2013 26 Mar&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 26 March you will then continue your journey down the coast. Your destination is the beautiful town of Knysna. After a training session on the Knysna Lagoon, home to the world\u2019s only estuarine seahorses, you will paddle through the Knysna Heads, an unforgettable experience since it is as if passing through a massive natural ocean gateway.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5%20Capes%202%20Knysna-Heads-The-Waves-Were-Large.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knysna Heads \u2013 The Heads was passable through the westerly channel.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the base in Knysna you will paddle around Cape Seal \u2013 the Robberg Peninsula - one of South Africa\u2019s most precious marine protected areas, and the headland leading to Bahia Formosa, Plettenberg Bay.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5%20Capes%203%20Robberg.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"323\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see why the Portuguese named it Bahia Formosa (Beautiful Bay).&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 5 \u2013 6 | Mar 27 \u2013 28&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After paddling around Cape Seal you will head further south. Your next destination? The tip of Africa! The small coastal town of Agulhas will be your base for 2 days as you explore the Overberg region, famous for its immense bio-diversity. During your stay you will visit the L\u2019Agulhas Lighthouse, which houses South Africa\u2019s lighthouse museum and enjoy a meal at a restaurant at the bottom of Africa. But before lunch you will do a landmark paddle. You will paddle around the southernmost tip of Africa \u2013 Cape Agulhas \u2013 and lay claim to having officially paddled from one ocean to another \u2013 the Atlantic to the Indian.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5%20Capes%204%20cape-agulhas-01.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bottom of Africa.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5-Capes%206%20Agulhas-Visiting-the-Lighthouse.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agulhas \u2013 Visiting the Lighthouse.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days 8 \u2013 10 | Mar 29 \u2013 31&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is then time to head for the most majestic cape of them all. You\u2019ll arrive in Cape Town, one the most beautiful cities in the world. You will spend 3 days paddling and exploring the area with Dawid and Jasper as they take you on the famous Millers Run and paddle their favourite training routes. You will climb Table Mountain, one of the 7 natural wonders of the world. Most importantly, you will be paddling around the spectacular and iconic Cape of Good Hope.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5-Capes%207%20Tablemountain.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Table Mountain, a lifetime landmark to see and visit.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can expect this trip to be filled with much more than just paddling. This part of the country offers not only amazing trails and spectacular mountains and gorges just begging to be explored, but is rich in history and cultural diversity. The short distances between the capes will allow ample time for exploration.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All Levels are catered for; an intrepid spirit is the only requirement.&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are an experienced ocean paddler, or have just started your paddling career, the 5 Capes adventure will satisfy every intrepid bone in your body. Dawid and Jasper are some of the most experienced ocean guides you could ask for; you can trust that they will use their experience to get you around each Cape.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All equipment is provided across a range of ability, from racing surfskis to the most stable \u2013 you may use whichever you feel comfortable depending on the day. Dawid and Jasper will also bring double skis that are a great way to learn skills and also paddle if conditions get tricky.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the shores of South Africa you will have had an adventure and an experience that very few can lay claim to \u2013 paddling the 5 Capes with Dawid and Jasper Mocke.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/5-Capes%209%20paddling%20round%20CapePoint.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paddling around the Cape of Good Hope is unforgettable.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TRIP ITINERARY&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrive in Port Elizabeth (P.E.) 22 March&lt;br&gt;23\/24 March \u2013 P.E. &amp; St Francis | Cape Recife &amp; Cape St Francis&lt;br&gt;25\/26 March \u2013 Knysna | Cape Seal Robberg Peninsula&lt;br&gt;27\/28 March \u2013 L\u2019Agulhas | Cape Agulhas&lt;br&gt;29 \u2013 31 March \u2013 Fish Hoek | Cape Point | Millers Runs&lt;br&gt;Depart Cape Town 1 April&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transfers, transport, accommodation, surfskis, coaching and meals included.

This northern Californian city was born thanks to the discovery of gold in 1848. Young men from around the world descended upon San Francisco (and surrounds) with high hopes of realizing the American dream. &nbsp;It quickly became a melting pot of cultures, food and attitudes and as you wander through its streets, it becomes clear that not much has changed in this regard. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried about not fitting in, move to San Francisco,\u201d says my friend as we walk down another street filled with eccentric characters. The San Francisco experience is a bit like unintended street theatre: musicians busk, graffiti artists paint, foodies embrace farmer\u2019s markets and gay men flaunt hot-pants. &nbsp;This is a city that bristles with delightful madness. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food Heaven&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kori Goff, our Trafalgar Travel Director warns us, \u201cDon\u2019t eat a big breakfast tomorrow; we have a full day of food ahead.\u201d After an irresistibly big breakfast, we walk to the Old Ferry Building for a Trafalgar Local Speciality. Constructed in 1898, the Ferry Building was once the focal point of San Francisco\u2019s transportation. Today it houses a lively farmer\u2019s market filled with artisans selling cheeses, breads, desserts, olives and more. We join our guide, Joshua Clever from Edible Excursions, for a tasting tour of the market\u2019s best. As a trained chef, it\u2019s obvious that Joshua loves to share local cuisine with visitors. &nbsp;He tells us about the six years he spent working in France and to him the ferry building market rivals top French food markets. We move through a crowd of trendy visitors and start with dessert at Farmer Al\u2019s Pastry Shop. Apple tartlets, certifiably-humane beef chili, salted caramel, triple-cream brie, sourdough bread and coconut macaroons are some of the delicacies we nibble on. To end, we nurse a steaming cup of Blue Bottle coffee, allegedly the best brew in the city, and my friend buys a T-shirt that says, &lt;em&gt;Praise the Lard&lt;\/em&gt;.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/San%20Fran%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Explorations&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco\u2019s neighbourhoods can be categorized by nationality (or sexual orientation). Among others, The Mission is the city\u2019s Spanish neighbourhood; North Beach is its Italian neighbourhood and Castro is its rainbow neighbourhood known for being the &lt;em&gt;gayest place on earth&lt;\/em&gt;. Perhaps above all, Chinatown is most notable, as it is the oldest and largest Chinese community located outside of Asia.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, Kori leads the way to the Mission to show us her personal favourite sight. This eclectic neighbourhood has been home to Latino residents for decades, but in recent years the so-called &lt;em&gt;dot-com&lt;\/em&gt; professionals have moved in. Today its quirky streets are filled with &lt;em&gt;taquerias&lt;\/em&gt;, Mexican cafes, hipsters and antique shops. What makes The Mission particularly special is its street art. &nbsp;Kori\u2019s hidden treasure turns out to be one of the most beautiful alleyways in the neighbourhood, Balmy Alley. From top to bottom, Balmy Alley is filled with painted depictions of Spanish guitar players, mamas carrying baskets and protestors from the sixties. Besides the odd stray dog, we have the alley all to ourselves.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/San%20Fran%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next neighbourhood we visit is a densely-populated and lively one, Chinatown. Kori points out an old pub en-route and shares her insider knowledge. &nbsp;\u201cHave you ever heard the phrase: 'you\u2019ve been shanghaied?'\u201d she asks. Responding to our blank stares, she continues. \u201cWell, it all started at this bar - Shanghai Kelly\u2019s - in the 1800s. New Chinese immigrants were pleased to be in America and the last thing on their minds was returning to China. The boat captains however, needed crew for their ships, but with a lack of sailors signing up for the arduous voyage, they were in a pickle. Captains quickly discovered that Shanghai Kelly\u2019s was a favoured watering hole for Chinese immigrants, so they struck a deal with the compliant bar owner. He spiked select drinks with opium in exchange for bribes, and the unsuspecting patriots would wake up on a ship Shanghai-bound!\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We enter through the Chinatown Gate. This grand entrance is flanked by two stone lions believed to bring wealth and prosperity to the district. We are instantly transported to Beijing. Red lanterns dangle across streets, pagoda roofs cover the skyline and dragon lamp-posts light the way. Kori explains that almost everything in San Francisco is somehow related to the 1906 earthquake. It wreaked havoc across the city and subsequent fires were even more devastating. An estimated 3000 people died and over 80% of San Francisco was destroyed. &nbsp;According to Kori, Chinatown had to be completely rebuilt.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/San%20Fran%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We duck into a narrow avenue (Rose Alley) and sniff out the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory for another Trafalgar Local Speciality. Inside, an old Chinese man puffs a cigar, while his workmate curls the edges of fresh cookies delivered from a machine. Carefully he fills each cookie with strips of fortunes, soon to be delivered to thousands of hopeful people around the world. Instead of tempting fate, we make our way to the Empress of China, Chinatown\u2019s most sought-after restaurant, to feast on platters of walnut prawns, sweet and sour pork and curry chicken Chow Mein.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next stop is Haight Ashbury, a quirky neighbourhood dotted with Victorian houses, buskers and wafts of marijuana. \u201cThe Haight\u201d was the hub of the 1960\u2019s hippie movement and few songs depict its 1967 Summer of Love better than Scott McKenzie\u2019s &lt;em&gt;San Francisco&lt;\/em&gt;. &nbsp;We make our way to the Haight, and McKenzie\u2019s lyrics, &lt;em&gt;be sure to wear flowers in your hair&lt;\/em&gt;, play from the loudspeaker. One of Trafalgar\u2019s most appealing offerings is its Insider Experiences where local people share local activities with travellers. Kori is beaming, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love her,\u201d she says as we step off the coach to meet Izu, our guide. She and her leashed sausage dog, Bennie, form a striking pair. Izu, about 70-years old, wears a tie-dyed coat, Converse shoes, a cross around her neck and John Lennon sunglasses. She arrived in Haight Ashbury during the summer of 1967 as an impressionable teenager and the flower power movement became such an important part of her life that she decided to relive it every day as a guide.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/San%20Fran%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a raspy New York accent, she describes the scene, \u201c70 000 backpackers from around the world descended upon Haight Ashbury. We lived in compounds, there was no homelessness, strangers invited you to stay, music filled the streets and weed was the drug of choice,\u201d she explains. &nbsp;\u201cPeople came here to be accepted.\u201d We follow Izu and Bennie to houses that once belonged to Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead and the Hell\u2019s Angels. As we bid Izu and Haight Ashbury farewell, I hear Izu praise Bennie, \u201cYou did good, boy, you did good.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Around the Bay&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like Cape Town, San Francisco centres on the ocean. Runners frequent its promenade, tourists flock to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf to shop and everyone finds delight in the screeches of seals gathered on Pier 39. The best view of the city is arguably from the deck of the Sausalito-bound ferry that transports tourists across the bay on a daily basis. Kori rounds us up in time for departure. On the one side is a view of Alcatraz - San Francisco\u2019s version of Robben Island - and on the other side, lies the city\u2019s most spectacular landmark, the Golden Gate Bridge.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/San%20Fran%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We approach Sausalito - the town that inspired Otis Redding\u2019s &lt;em&gt;Dock of the Bay&lt;\/em&gt; - and I\u2019m surprised to see that it resembles a high-end Italian island. Sail boats bob in marinas, mansions rise from the hillside and boutique shops abound. For lunch we go to Scoma\u2019s, a maritime-themed restaurant perched over water. I order my favourite American dish \u2013 Clam Chowder. According to Kori, there\u2019s a lot of old money in Sausalito and property prices are exceptionally high.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude our time in San Francisco with the most epic of crossings, a walk over the Golden Gate Bridge starting on the Sausalito end. Our coach driver drops us at the starting point. It\u2019s windy, but the bridge is the most spectacular manmade structure I\u2019ve ever seen. &nbsp;227 metres of orange steel tower into the sky, a wild Pacific Ocean lies far beneath my feet and cars whizz past at dizzying speeds. The views of sea and city are spectacular. Built between 1933 and 1937, the Golden Gate Bridge ticks all the boxes: engineering genius, foresight in design, an extraordinary construction feat and aesthetic consideration. On the other side of the bridge, we gather for a Trafalgar group photo and climb back onto the coach for a journey along California\u2019s coastline. I bid farewell to San Francisco, city of delightful madness, and it occurs to me that the world seems a little bit too ordinary beyond San Francisco. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/San%20Fran%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make it Happen&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;San Francisco &amp; Wine Country Delights&lt;\/strong&gt;: Priced from R30 225 per person twin share, enjoy 8 days on this At Leisure Trafalgar guided holiday.

Member of the Mike Horn Pangaea Expedition to the Himalayas 2010, on which the team made the first ascent of Pangaea Peak (6170m) in Northern Pakistan, carried out research for the MAYO clinic and observed how climate change is affecting the Baltoro Glacier.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Length of expedition:&lt;\/strong&gt; 21,000km&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of expedition:&lt;\/strong&gt; 6 months&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completion date:&lt;\/strong&gt; 7 August 2014&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous or a series of adventures:&lt;\/strong&gt; Continuous&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights:&lt;\/strong&gt;&nbsp;30 days at sea travelling by the power of the wind and viewing dolphin pods and extraordinary sunsets; wading through the swamplands of Pantanal; making it to the mountains in a sustainable and eco-friendly way; ascents of three 6000m peaks in Peru and Bolivia, Tocllaraju, Peru (6035m) being the most significant as he summited despite suffering from an intestinal parasite and being ditched by his partner at 5400m with no tent or fuel.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To find out more:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.mykape.com\"&gt;www.mykape.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first MY KAPE expedition KAPE 2 KENYA 2012 laid the foundations for a far more ambitious adventure. South America is home to some of the wildest peaks on the planet and I wanted to climb there. As with my previous adventure I wanted to get myself to the mountains with minimal environmental impact. Sailing, cycling, hitching and walking were my only means of transport.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Goals of the expedition&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"&gt;To bag as many 6000m peaks as possible&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"&gt;To visit Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"&gt;To cross the Atlantic Ocean by boat&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"&gt;To travel each and every kilometre by sustainable means&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\"color: #575757; font-size: 12px; line-height: 20px; text-align: justify;\"&gt;To raise awareness about environmental issues and epilepsy&nbsp;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Originality&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;MY KAPE 2 ATACAMA expedition was one of a kind. The big chilly climbs, the low impact means of travel and the causes I championed made for a unique combination.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Planning&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ha ha. The planning was more difficult than the expedition! I began planning a year and a half before I set sail. Initially, everything went swimmingly. I had a team partner, we\u2019d found a boat for the Cape to Rio yacht race and there was a title sponsor. Then 3 months before we were supposed to head off, I lost the title sponsor, my partner pulled out and everything came crashing down. I even blew my knee out during this turn of unfortunate events. It was crazy!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adventure that unfolded began in a dinghy, with me buzzing around different marinas in search of a ride to Latin America. I was lucky enough to come across a crew just 6 days before they pushed off to Brazil!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All my plans and preparation of the previous year and a half went out the window when I jumped on that boat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back-up plan&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No real back-up at all but there were other climbers on the peaks and the guides\/rescue facilities in the Cordillera Blanca are pretty good so if we had had a serious accident the chances of alerting rescue were reasonable.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Funding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all came out of my own pocket. I got some cash from friends and through a small crowd funding campaign, but I was travelling on the bones of my arse the whole way. I managed to get a job in Southern Peru for a few weeks during the trip, which topped up my funds a bit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Verification&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos and the friends I made on the journey and on the climbs. Oh yes, and I\u2019ve got some hospital bills that I picked up along the way!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scariest moment&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming down Illimani, Bolivia. The snow was far too soft, deep and unstable. We couldn\u2019t place any protection and everything became quite intense. An avalanche went off in the icefall below us. It was just luck that it didn\u2019t set off an avalanche on the slope we were on. Fortunately we managed to traverse to a safer area, which had harder snow. That got my heart going.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Most unexpected experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ascent of Tocllaraju. When I arrived in Huaraz (a Peruvian town at the base of the Cordillera Blanca) I started looking for climbing partners and within a few hours I\u2019d met a Brazilian named Cissar who was keen to take on Tocllaraju (6009m). It would be one of the most difficult peaks I\u2019d attempted and on the eve of departure I fell violently ill. I was meant to be leaving a few days before Cissar to acclimatise with Dani, a groovy bloke from Spain. However, I could barely get out of my sleeping bag and an 8-hour trek into base camp was out of the question.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following day I left alone thinking that it was just a bit of food poisoning. (As it turned out, I had a nasty parasite). I would have bailed but Cissar was out of contact and I couldn\u2019t leave her stranded.In my nauseous state I moved slowly to base camp despite logic telling me to turn back. By the time I found Dani the next day I was feeling better, yet I hadn\u2019t properly eaten for 3 days.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tocllaraju glared at us as we pushed up to high camp where both Dani and I waited for partners. Dani\u2019s arrived and Cissar didn\u2019t. Yes, I got stood up at 5000m. She was also meant to bring the tent and fuel! I couldn\u2019t believe it and neither could any of the other climbers at our camp. I was about to turn around and undertake the rather dangerous descent back to base camp but charity smiled at me. In 30 minutes I had two climbing partners and a tent to sleep in. &nbsp;The summit push that followed turned out to be one of the most trying and life-changing ascents I\u2019ve ever experienced.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the biggest lesson?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climbing out of season isn\u2019t the best idea.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best piece of gear&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Osprey backpacks. They were crammed full of everything I depended on; rope, climbing gear, high-altitude apparel, smelly foods from the smelliest Bolivian markets and sailing gear which was too expensive to dump. They dealt with salty sea spray, were dragged up mountains and down canyons and were thrown on and off dodgy buses more times than I can count.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Any amazing person that you met on the trip?&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many cool folks! The backpackers and climbers I met kept me psyched particularly since I was travelling alone for so long and was generally the youngest at any spot. Towards the end of the trip an amazing family in Chile looked after me. And I spent 3 weeks with a group of interesting Argentineans on the Peruvian coast\u2026they were musicians, artists, and some very talented cooks. Even though I barely understood a word they were saying, I felt very relieved and privileged to be in such a positive environment.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did you eat on the trip?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly rice and boiled eggs\u2026 yum! But, my favorite meal was ceviche, a fish dish where the fish is \u2018cooked\u2019 (ie pickled) in lemon juice. Simple, tasty and cheap. We ate a lot of it on the boat, because fresh fish was all we had. After we touched land in Brazil, I craved it. Luckily ceviche is a national dish in Peru.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%2011.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did, however, give me a damn stomach parasite, which put me in a dodgy Peruvian hospital for a few days. But it was worth it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What was the worst thing that bit you?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mozzies of Patanal, Brazil. These beautiful wetlands are home to toucans, capybaras, alligators, and some of most extraordinary creatures that Mother Nature has to offer, however I\u2019ve never been attacked by so many flippin\u2019 mosquitoes in my life. Our hikes involved being chased by swarming dark clouds of the blood suckers. Never again! &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What\u2019s next?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycling the Silk Road - with some big climbs along the way! Now, it\u2019s time to start scrounging around for some cash!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Kai%2012.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contenders for the Nightjar Adventurer 2015 competition were all interviewed by Nightjar.

The 11 hours of excruciating labour is forgotten and two years later, she may very well be eager to go through it all again. And then, she will likely be surprised at just how very painful and uncomfortable the whole ordeal is. &lt;em&gt;I\u2019d forgotten how absolutely horrific this is!&lt;\/em&gt; She thinks.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air travel is very much like childbirth in this way. No matter how many times (your knees aching and your feet swollen, your eyes dry and puffy from lack of sleep) you swear &lt;em&gt;never again&lt;\/em&gt;, the lure of that tropical beach or snow-covered mountain is too strong. And so you find yourself standing in that queue once again - boarding pass clutched in your hand, waiting to board the plane.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am excited&lt;\/em&gt;, I chant to myself. &lt;em&gt;No, really&lt;\/em&gt;. Even as the man behind me turns and thwacks me in the ribs with his carry-on bag. Even as my boarding pass refuses to scan and the stern lady at the desk narrows her eyes at me suspiciously. Even as I step into the plane and that musty, stale air-smell envelops me like an old blanket left in a dark cupboard for far too long.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am excited. I am going to Rome - my home away from home - and the fact that I just happen to have remembered that I loathe air travel is completely insignificant.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shuffle along towards my seat (27F). As a lowly economy class traveler, a swell of deep resentment crashes over me as I walk down through the business class section and watch as people settle into their cloud-like seats. They\u2019re offered champagne and chilled raspberries. I, too, am a fan of chilled raspberries. But I guess I\u2019ll settle for the stale, too-salty peanuts us mere mortals are graciously given. I resist the urge to throttle the VIPs with their oxygen mask straps.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Air%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise to me that I am seated next to a large, already-sweating elderly gentleman. Behind me is a small, smirking child and his irritated mother. It is always me that gets the obnoxious child who kicks the back of my seat like a malfunctioning, cheap massage chair. This child will also always have an overprotective, dragonesque parent (generally the mother; the father is too busy checking out the air hostesses) who, if you dare to cast an evil-eye back at the little monster, will stab said eye with her lip liner stick. I settle for sticking my tongue out at the tiny terror while his mother\u2019s nose is buried in her massive snakeskin handbag.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After what seems like an eternity, and after several calls for a Mr Wyatt-Jones who is holding up the entire flight, we\u2019re about to take off. The air hostesses are doing their usual robotic \u2018your exits are here, here and here\u2019 routine and, as usual, no one is paying them any mind whatsoever. The sweating man next to me boisterously shoves my elbow off of the armrest and simultaneously manages to waft a pungent breeze of armpit-sweat in my direction. I gag, and then I begin to plot. Gazing at his bulging beer belly a flash of inspiration hits me. I discover that if you offer the grumpy, sweating man next to you, say, 3\/4 of your bag of ridiculously scrumptious chocolate-covered toffees, it will come back to you in a good way. In the form of, if you're in luck, an offer of the much-desired armrest. Julia- 1, Air Travel- 0.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a few bumps and a couple of nervous squeals from my surrounding passengers, we\u2019re in the air at last. Skinny airhostesses wearing too much lipstick and well-spoken air stewards with hair slicked back with too much gel hand out the dreaded peanuts. Next come the earphones for our in-flight entertainment. Through extensive research, I have discovered that airplane headphones are capable of inducing chronic migraines due to their astonishing ability to jab into 32 different areas of your scull at the same time. Avoid them at all costs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after take-off, just as I am settling in to watch Harry Potter, the pilot crackles over the announcement system to inform us that we are entering into a 'brief' period of turbulence. Heed my warning, future travellers! &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;\/em&gt; assume that you are a skilled enough connoisseur of &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;\/em&gt; (drinking, nail painting, standing) to attempt it just after the pilot announces a period of turbulence. My moist neighbor discovered this the hard way when he decided that he needed to fetch down his hand luggage just as the plane began to bounce and swoop. Sadly, it was I and not he who actually suffered from his idiocy. As he stood, the plane dipped, and he sprawled, armpit first, directly into my horrified face.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the beginning of the end.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Air%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was onto my second Harry Potter movie when the announcement was made that dinner was about to be served. I dove into my handbag and managed to extract my eye mask. Then, caring not at all about the strange looks I was getting, I fastened the mask around and over my nose and mouth. I was prepared. Regardless of how nice airplane food may TASTE, it will never, not ever, SMELL nice. It will always remind you of dog vomit, old age homes and the antiseptic spray used in hospitals. Also, if it could be bottled in an aerosol can, no one would ever need pepper spray again.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I had predicted, my neighbour scoffed his entire meal with relish, and then he had the audacity to ask if, seeing as I wasn\u2019t eating mine, he could have it? The only other person in the vicinity who seemed to despise the stale bread and too-yellow custard as much as I did was the boy sitting behind me. He wailed and screamed and kicked until his mother pulled a packet of chips out of her bag for him. The enticing scent of salt and vinegar and oil made my mouth water.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many hours to go? Oh, ten. Just ten? Piece of cake.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the dinner trays have been cleared and I have managed to find momentary relief in the lemony-freshness of a wet wipe upon my dry, anxious face, the lights are dimmed in the cabin. If you ignore and forget everything else I have said in this article - remember this one tip and it may very well save your life (and keep your sanity intact):&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't try to evade the '&lt;strong&gt;seat-reclining cycle of suffering and pain&lt;\/strong&gt;'. Don't even waste your much-needed energy on getting riled up about it. It goes something like this:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The person in front of you reclines their seat slightly (it's usually the obnoxious child). You are watching a movie which you don't really like, but feel is vital to watch anyway considering you have 12 more hours of flight time left. The reclining of the seat sets your screen at an angle. You're not really bothered - you can simply tilt the screen up and continue watching.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The seat in front of you reclines further. Now, your movie looks like an experimental art nouveau film about polar bears and aliens. You die a little inside, and tilt the screen as far up as possible. You pray to whatever God you believe in that the cycle ends here. But your prayers are unanswered.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The lights in the cabin dim. People settle down to attempt to sleep, a feeling of dread builds up in your stomach. As if in horrific slow motion, the seat in front of you reclines at full-throttle, until the small screen is pressed against your face. Your angry puffs of breath cloud it up, and suddenly you're not watching a movie, but bacteria writhing around under an intensely focused microscope.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- You are forced to recline your seat. And you've started the cycle for the person behind you.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game. Over.&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Air%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have found that sleeping pills become more appealing than heroin to an addict on a 15-hour flight. Invest in some before you leave or steal a few from your insomniac relative (we all have one). Having brought my own and taken two with a swig of red wine, I am well on my way to a few blissful hours of rest when it happens. It pierces my eardrums and tears my fragile soul apart. It is 2am. Everyone else is asleep. And then there is Satan; that one person onboard who laughs like a demented, drunk hyena when everyone else is trying to sleep. Most of the time, that person will be you, or your embarrassing relative. This time, it is the mother of the brat behind me. A tear leaks out of the corner of my eye. All hope is lost.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve finished three Harry Potter movies. My portly neighbor is snoring softly beside me (his name is Bert, I\u2019ve discovered). The cackling mother and her cub are fast asleep. I\u2019ve never been more awake. I turn my attention to the little screen pressed up against my nose. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know nothing about the layout of the continents or where different countries are situated? Watch the 'track your journey' map for a few hours. You will be a geographic pro in no time. By the time the sun starts to leak under the partially closed shutters- I could give a guided tour of the entire continent of Asia.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours pass. I begin to wonder if this is all a bizarre nightmare and that I\u2019ll wake up in my cozy bed at home- snug and safe and alone. It\u2019s a comforting thought. The nauseating smell of breakfast approaching on the trolley awakens Bert from his peaceful slumber.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Air travel puts me right to sleep!\u2019 He says cheerfully, \u2018In fact, I sleep better on planes than I do in my own bed at home.\u2019 I bite my tongue and smile weakly.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hazel, our air hostess, glows down at me as she hands me my orange juice. It occurs to me that air hostesses only look so pretty because after traveling for however many hours in a cramped, sweaty, stuffy environment, they appear as goddesses of elegance, freshness and space. I drink three cups of coffee (black with six sugars; the airhostess watches each granule disappear into my cup with great disdain) and prepare for the final stretch- the last three hours.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Air%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flick through the glossy pages of the in-flight magazine to kill some time. It may be the sleeping pills, coffee and red wine affecting my brain but things that you DO NOT need or even vaguely like, such as gold-plated teaspoon sets engraved with baby meerkats, suddenly appear to be VERY appealing when they are on the colourful pages of the duty free shopping section.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I must have dozed off (thank the Lord!) because the next thing I know I am being jolted awake by a particularly nasty kick from the spawn of Satan behind me. The in-flight magazine lies open in my lap and Bert\u2019s head lolls on my aching shoulder. I can\u2019t bring myself to wake him so that I can go to the loo. The announcement system pings and the pilot, sounding tired and bored, says that we are about to begin our descent. Yes!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later, the hours of torture are over. The plane has landed and as usual, a few annoying individuals have applauded the qualified pilot's flying skills. I remind myself: DO NOT STAND UP STRAIGHT AWAY. In other words, do not be a sheep. I know that I will simply stand and cast awkward glances at those around me as I wait for a long period of time before I can leave the aircraft. Instead, I sit down comfortably, and plan how I\u2019m going to push in front of the impatient businessman hovering next to my seat.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the plane empties, I manage (by some miracle) to hoist my hand luggage down from the overhead baggage compartment without bashing someone on the head with it. I shuffle off of the aircraft and breathe in the fresh air of my much-anticipated holiday destination. Roma. Home.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all I have to do is collect my baggage from the \u2018&lt;strong&gt;carousel of false hope&lt;\/strong&gt;\u2019.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am strong. I can do this. And so can you. Good luck.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Air%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9131\" class=\"publisher-1944 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/rowing-wind\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Rowing with the Wind&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Rowing with the Wind  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Rowing with the Wind\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/The-Intrepid-Explorer-logo2.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Cameron%20Bellamy%201.jpg?itok=bjsl2y6f\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rowing-wind\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rowing-wind\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rowing-wind&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Cameron%20Bellamy%201.jpg&amp;description=Rowing with the Wind\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rowing-wind\" data-text=\"Rowing with the Wind\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/rowing-wind\" data-title=\"Rowing with the Wind\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Mar 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;By Roy Watts&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 11 August, a team of six rowers reached the Seychelles after setting out from the port of Geraldton in Australia on 11 June \u2013 57 days earlier. In doing so, they set two world records: At 6 720 kilometres, it was the greatest distance covered by any team in the Indian Ocean and it was also the fastest crossing in a rowing boat. One of the crew members was Cameron Bellamy \u2013 a Capetonian and Bishops Old Boy. This is his story.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it take to row two hours on and two hours off for 57 days? Interviewing Cameron Bellamy was a fascinating experience, which brought home the kind of determination necessary in an epic adventure such as this.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story starts in his final year at Diocesan College (Bishops) when he won the Rower of the Year award. At Rhodes University, he was chosen for the South African under-23 team, and a year later rowed for South African Universities at the world championships. After achieving a BCom honours degree, he furthered his academic career with a master\u2019s degree from The University of Queensland in Brisbane. He rowed for this institution as well.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellamy\u2019s adventurous wanderlust took root at the end of a three-year period of working in Beijing. He decided to embark on a 7 200km bike ride from there to Kanyakumari on the southern tip of India. He set out on a specially equipped bicycle fitted with a rack and side panniers housing sleeping bags, a tent, cooking equipment, blankets, pillow and a mattress.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was conversationally fluent in the Chinese language and describes himself as a gregarious loner. This sociability meant that he only spent half of his time sleeping and cooking in forests or open fields. For the rest, he was offered a bed and meals by well-wishers along the way.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his long ride, he started thinking about a concept where a group of like-minded adventurers may channel their energies into fund-raising exploits for charity. Four months later, he pedalled into Kanyakumari \u2013 having spent his budget, which was the equivalent of R50 per day.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bicycle ride from Beijing to India was Bellamy\u2019s Chinese swan song, and his next job was in Britain where he set up the Ubunye Challenge in 2011. Three separate ventures were planned. The first was to cycle 1 349km from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats in northernmost Scotland. This was to be followed by a solo swim across the English Channel, and finally an Atlantic crossing from the Canary Islands to Barbados in a six-man rowing boat.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beneficiaries were to be the Ubunye Foundation (formerly the Angus Gillis Foundation), a project that would instal containers fully kitted out as classrooms in the Eastern Cape; and Vimba, an outfit dedicated to fostering the development and education of underprivileged children in Zimbabwe.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparing for the Land\u2019s End\/John O\u2019Groats ride was easy enough, as it consisted of cycling in a nearby gym at lunch times. The really tough one was training for the Channel swim, scheduled for the end of June \u2013 two months after the bike ride. This involved early-morning lengths in the gym pool and two open-air swims a week in Hyde Park\u2019s Serpentine Lake at 8 degrees Celsius in mid-winter. From April onward, Bellamy attended weekend training courses run by the English Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation (CS and PF) at the Port of Dover, with occasional sessions at Bournemouth.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Land\u2019s End charity ride was split into two groups of five using country roads and was a lot of fun. The same could not be said of the Channel swim, however. Bellamy was the only one of the \u2018Challengers\u2019 to make it. Accompanied by supporters in a boat provided by the CS and PF, he got to the English shore in 16 hours 30 minutes. He was not one of the recognised competitive swimmers at school, so this says a lot about his determination and staying power.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final Atlantic challenge ran into trouble when he failed to find sponsors for the Atlantic rowing event. He then approached Scotsman Leven Brown, who had a 45-foot (13.5-metre) eight-man rowing boat and had already completed four successful Atlantic crossings. Long story short: he decided to join Brown\u2019s team in a rowing venture from Australia\u2019s west coast to Durban. This, then, was how he found himself \u2013 the only Ubunye Challenger \u2013 in the Ozzie port of Geraldton, setting out with a crew of six men and one woman for the ambitious crossing to Africa.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The going was tough in the first two weeks. There was much seasickness caused by the extremely rough conditions created by three low-pressure systems \u2013 the last of which was on the tail end of a hurricane. Adjusting to sleep deprivation was another difficulty as they embarked on the two hours on\/two hours off rowing routine. With the on\/off sleeping sessions seldom lasting for more than 90 minutes, there was a continual degree of tiredness for the duration of the trip. Conditions did improve, however, once they reached the tropics.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four days out, they experienced their first major mishap when the autopilot packed up. It became evident that it could not be fixed out at sea and thus the crew now had to steer manually for the duration of the trip.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For meals, the crew depended mainly of freeze-dried food that was prepared by pouring boiling water into the sachet containers. This led to the next setback, when two huge waves hit the boat four days later: Shane Usher was preparing a meal and boiling water splashed onto his leg, creating serious blisters. Despite ointment and bandaging, the wounds continued to deteriorate \u2013 and after four days, it became necessary to embark on a casualty evacuation. Global Rescue was contacted and a tanker was diverted to arrive a scant five hours later.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first attempt to winch him on board in a basket nearly ended in disaster, as their limited steering capacity proved to be too erratic when the tanker was nearly blown onto their boat. An oar was broken in fending it off. In the end, a lifeboat was lowered to complete the transfer. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of Shane meant that for the remaining 25 days, they could only have two oarsmen at a time \u2013 with one person steering!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cameron%20Bellamy%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fairly far out, it was decided to switch the destination to the Seychelles. Storms and unseasonal winds had blown them too far north to make Durban safely and, due to current unrest in Kenya and Somalia, this was the only viable option.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seychelles also has a pirate problem, and as they neared their destination, a 12m wooden skiff approached and radioed the demand that they stop. It was manned by a group of swarthy looking individuals claiming they were fishermen \u2013 but there was nary a rod in sight. Brown decided to brazen it out and they carried on rowing. When asked what they were up to, he replied that they were on a Royal Navy exercise, waiting to be refuelled. That did the trick and the suspicious boat scooted off.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interlude with the suspected pirates was the final drama in their marathon journey and they continued on to a welcome at the harbour in Victoria \u2013 the capital city of Mahe.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cameron Bellamy set out from Geraldton, he weighed 105 kilogrammes. On arriving back in Cape Town in high spirits after his arduous crossing, he weighed 87kg, his hands were calloused \u2013 and the Ubunye Foundation was R798 660 better off.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Intrepid%20Cover%20Dec_1.jpg?itok=ZP8OSTOh\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;The Intrepid explorer&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9289\" class=\"publisher-4090 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-better-tying-part-1\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Fly Tying - Tips and tricks for better tying  - Part 1 &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Fly Tying - Tips and tricks for better tying  - Part 1   &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Fly Tying - Tips and tricks for better tying  - Part 1 \" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.vagabondfly.com\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #000000' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Vagabond.jpg\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Tips%201.jpg?itok=BcephqGw\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-better-tying-part-1\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-better-tying-part-1\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-better-tying-part-1&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Tips%201.jpg&amp;description=Fly Tying - Tips and tricks for better tying  - Part 1 \" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-better-tying-part-1\" data-text=\"Fly Tying - Tips and tricks for better tying  - Part 1 \" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-better-tying-part-1\" data-title=\"Fly Tying - Tips and tricks for better tying  - Part 1 \"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Feb 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;By Gordon van der Spuy&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been very fortunate to have taught over 300 tyers locally in the last two years. I think I have learnt more from my pupils than they have from me, but don\u2019t go telling them that. It has been interesting to note how most tyers seem to battle with the same elements. These observations were in fact the impetus for me writing this. This article is basically just a summation of the trends I\u2019ve seen, a fly tying state of the nation address if you will. Hopefully it will be of help.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Know your mayflies from your midges&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I have students do at a workshop is draw a selection of aquatic insects that I randomly name. Most guys can\u2019t draw 20% of the bugs I name; they simply don\u2019t know what they are, and \u2018therein lies the rub\u2019 as old William would\u2019ve said.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you effectively imitate or suggest a creature if you have no insight regarding it in the first place.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you effectively imitate or suggest a creature if you have no insight regarding it in the first place. This might seems obvious but statistics don\u2019t lie. Most guys approach their tying like they would baking a cake. They are recipe orientated and tie by numbers as it were. This is very one dimensional, the tyer never really understands what he or she is doing and thus remains in the proverbial dark. Sure, you\u2019ll catch fish being a recipe tyer but you will definitely be more successful once the proverbial light goes on for you. One needs to tie beyond the book or the pattern and you can only do this once you know something about the creatures you wish to imitate.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One needs to tie beyond the book or the pattern and you can only do this once you know something about the creatures you wish to imitate.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tie an effective imitation you need to incorporate the important features of that natural in your fly. Take a bit of time looking for insects when next you find yourself on the water. Put the little guys in a tank and observe them, see what they do, sure, you might need to chase them around a bit to get them moving, some won\u2019t move that much, they simply don\u2019t have the ability to cover vast distances. These observations will not only stand you in good stead when you\u2019re at the vice but also when you\u2019re actually fishing the fly. That is a guarantee.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.vagabondfly.com\/fly-tying-tips-and-tricks-for-better-tying-part-gordon-van-der-spuy\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Vagabond Fly Mag&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.vagabondfly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Vagabond%20cover.jpg?itok=sQPODvfS\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Vagabond Fly Mag&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9130\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/place-heaven-swazi-style\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;The Place of Heaven, Swazi Style&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    The Place of Heaven, Swazi Style  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"The Place of Heaven, Swazi Style\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Swazi%201.jpg?itok=dlb21C-Z\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/place-heaven-swazi-style\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/place-heaven-swazi-style\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/place-heaven-swazi-style&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Swazi%201.jpg&amp;description=The Place of Heaven, Swazi Style\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/place-heaven-swazi-style\" data-text=\"The Place of Heaven, Swazi Style\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/place-heaven-swazi-style\" data-title=\"The Place of Heaven, Swazi Style\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Feb 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Bridget Hilton Barber&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swaziland has cool places to stay, great mountain scenery, friendly people, amazing arts and craft, and soulful spots \u2013 and much of it is centred round Ezulwini Valley.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny mountain kingdom with the big heart. That\u2019s what they call Swaziland. It is a small country indeed \u2013 you can drive through it in a day \u2013 but you could stay for a week and not get bored. There\u2019s plenty to do and see - Swaziland has cool places to stay, great mountain scenery, friendly people, amazing arts and craft, and soulful spots \u2013 and much of it is centred round Ezulwini Valley.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Mbabane the capital city, the King\u2019s Highway goes down a long steep pass called Malagwane Hill and at the bottom is the exit to Ezulwini Valley, which means place of heaven, and is the main tourism hub. Believe me, the place of heaven is where you want to be. It\u2019s a lush subtropical area with plenty of funky overnight spots, colourful local markets and craft centres, gorgeous nature reserves, and interesting restaurants and galleries. Ezulwini is also home to official stuff like the Swazi Royal palace, the houses of parliament, the national museum and archives and the national stadium.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main road through is called Swazi Spa Valley and along here you\u2019ll find the long-time touristy hotels like the Royal Swazi Spa, the Lugogo Sun and the Ezulwini Sun - as well as the upmarket Royal Villas. Ezulwini is also home to the infamous Happy Valley Casino, which was the favoured haunt of white South African men in the apartheid days, who came gambling and looking for black flesh. Now it\u2019s far more salubrious and kinda blingy, and draws an assortment of people in search of Lady Luck. The Gables Shopping Centre is also a welcome addition to Ezulwini Valley \u2013 for last minute shopping and dining out or having a quick drink. Actually it\u2019s more likely to be a slow drink since Ezulwini is not really a very fast moving area.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the distinctive peaks in the Ezulwini Valley is a mountain peak called Execution Rock, which is part of the legendary Mlilwane Wildlife Reserve, which has a &lt;em&gt;lekker&lt;\/em&gt; hotel and a backpackers. The name comes from a century back when criminals were made to walk to the summit and plunge to their death. Swazi warriors provided assistance with their spears of course; a quick prod to facilitate the downward journey. These days, thankfully things are much more laid back.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Round up the gang and head for the place of heaven. Here are some suggestions for what to do and where to stay in Ezulwini.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;See the funky House on Fire venue which is an amazing Gaudi-style place that hosts music events, art exhibitions, plays, theatres groups, dancing and other cultural stuff &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.house-on-fire.com\"&gt;www.house-on-fire.com&lt;\/a&gt;. It is home to the annual Bushfire festival of the arts (check out &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bushfire.com\"&gt;www.bushfire.com&lt;\/a&gt;) which is a wonderful reflection of contemporary Swazi and SADC culture, held each year in May. Next to House on Fire is Malandela\u2019s, another inspiring and creative venue with a wonderful restaurant. It\u2019s a cool sundowner spot because of its soft and sweeping views of the mountains. And next to Malandela\u2019s is the iconic Swazi shop called Gone Rural which has hand woven home accessories like mats, placemats, lamp stands, baskets and more. This is where traditional skill meets high end design with amazing results. You have been warned. Easy on that credit card.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Check out Mantenga Craft Centre and Nature Reserve, another long-time favourite spots for picnickers and ramblers, strollers and those in search of peace and quiet. One of the hikes here takes you up the mountain and rewards you with amazing views of Sheba\u2019s Breasts, twin mountain peaks named after the beautiful and mysterious Queen Sheba of Ethiopia. Take a picnic and a couple of Sibebe Beers, the local brew.&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Go for a chilled lunch and a bit of rural retail therapy at the Guava Gallery, a bistro and gallery with more beautiful views.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Visit the Swazi Candles centre, which is a short drive from the place of heaven, along a scenic road with markets and more pretty views. Swazi Candles is one of the oldest organizations in Swaziland and their place has a huge display room full of unusual candles and soaps. The centre also has Kwazi Swazi, a bookshop with music, t-shirts &amp; souvenirs; the Baobab Batik shop, and a charming mercado selling mainly Mozambican arts &amp; crafts. The Sambane Caf\u00e9 is good for a light lunch or strong espresso.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Take a drive to Mbabane, the capital city, which is positively tiny if you\u2019re used to Jozi, Durbs or Cape Town. There are two main malls, The Mall and the Swazi Plaza which are worth a quick visit; and then check out the famous old Mbabane market which sells fresh produce and has a good and cheap range of arts &amp; crafts, fabric and pots. And then round it off with a drink at Mountain Inn, a much loved old hotel on the outskirts of Mbabane which has wide and wonderful views of Ezulwini Valley. &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.mountaininn.sz\"&gt;www.mountaininn.sz&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Swazi%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Places to stay:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;For a self-catering stay in a gorgeous setting, go straight to the lovely Buhleni Farm Cottages which are just off the main road, and make you feel like you\u2019ve landed in an ancient garden in another world. Their chalets are simple and well kitted out, you can also go for walks and picnics on the farm. &nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.buhlenifarm.co.sz\"&gt;www.buhlenifarm.co.sz&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\u2022&nbsp;Lidwala Backpackers Lodge is a stylish spot with a swimming pool and Jacuzzi, a bar and a laid back restaurant serving traditional Swazi food &amp; good vibes.

Ignoring its protests, three men push and pull the reluctant creature as shoppers wander past with barely a glance.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s Saturday morning on the island of Rodrigues, and the weekly market in the capital Port Mathurin is in full swing. The air is soft and humid, teetering undecided on the edge between warm and bloody hot. A steady thwack-thwack-thwack sounds as young coconuts are shaped into takeaway drinks, while handwoven straw hats are sold for a song and the butcher is doing a roaring trade. Fresh pork will be on the menu a little later, no doubt.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a colourful, character-filled market, where the locals greet customers with a broad smile and a chat about the weather and, oh-so-gently, what\u2019s for sale. It\u2019s a perfect mirror of the island as a whole: a place where tourists are something woven into the fabric of life, not the reason for it. Here, life carries on with or without visitors, although the welcome in Creole-tinged French is always warm.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019ve not yet heard of Rodrigues. Lying around 600 km north-east of Mauritius, it has a degree of autonomy but is officially a constituency of its more famous neighbour. Unlike Mauritius, though, there\u2019s a dearth of sprawling resorts and manicured golf courses here... That lack is precisely why I fell in love with the island, but I discovered many reasons to stay enamoured.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rodriques%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, it\u2019s a gorgeous place. With the landmass just 18 km long and 8 km wide, it is the surrounding lagoon \u2013 300 km\u00b2 dotted with coral reefs \u2013 that takes your breath away as the Air Mauritius flight comes in to land at the small airport in the west of the island. There are no extinct volcanic cirques here, but also no acres of mono-cropped sugarcane. Rather, from the vantage point of Mont Limon, it\u2019s a patchwork of small-scale farms and valleys of indigenous forest that cover the hillsides tumbling down to the lagoon and its palette of blues.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, that lagoon. It is, to be honest, the reason many people come here. It\u2019s light and translucent over the sandy shallows, where kite-surfers play in the steady trade winds that waft in from the south-east. There are few better places in the Indian Ocean for the sport \u2013 the riot of colourful kites that weave and bob here in the summer are testament to this tiny island\u2019s status as a world-class destination without the world-class crowds.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slashing through the shallows are a handful of passes, where the water drops from waist-deep to 40m in a matter of steps. The scuba-diving is superb here, with game fish patrolling the depths and the pristine coral a welcome change from the dynamite- and sun-damaged reefs of other Indian Ocean islands.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the passes and the shallows, the waters give way to the fringing coral reef. There\u2019s great snorkelling to be found, while on calm days local fishermen circle shoals of carangue \u2013 a tasty fish not unlike yellowtail \u2013 with their hand-drawn seine nets. Further out, local women scour the reef for octopuses \u2013 a local speciality traditionally hung out to dry on racks, like cephalopod washing waving in the tropical breeze.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rodriques%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seafood looms large on Rodriguan tables, I discover at of Marie-Louise Roussety\u2019s comfortable auberge, Villa Mon Tr\u00e9sor. There\u2019s no shortage of cosy restaurants on the island, but \u2013 for a true taste of local cuisine \u2013 it\u2019s best to book a table at one of the many home-based table d\u2019h\u00f4te eateries. Usually attached to a guest house, this \u2018host\u2019s table\u2019 allows visitors to join the family and other guests for the meal of the day (whatever the proprietor happens to be preparing). \u2018Every Rodriguan will ask for their fish at dinnertime,\u2019 laughs Marie-Louise. \u2018Maybe a little roast pork too on special occasions, but every day there must be fish on the plate!\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hundred of kilometres of ocean dividing it from its western neighbour and a few thousand to Australia in the east, local ingredients dominate on the island. Fragrant curries of seafood, chicken or pork feature strongly; alongside rice, maize, kidney beans and tangy salads of green papaya, onion, chives and tomato. A taste of the island\u2019s culinary culture is a further highlight of any visit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is, without a doubt, a trip to the idyllic Ile aux Cocos to the west. It\u2019s one of a number of tiny protected islands surrounding Rodrigues that provide a refuge for thousands of migrating seabirds. As our boat hisses up on to the sand, the casuarina trees that line the beach are filled with elegant lesser noddies and snowy-hued white terns, while their darker sooty tern cousins fill the sky. In the distant blue, riding the thermals, are the remarkable frigate birds.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Rodriques%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This slender sliver of sand is cast away in the distant Indian Ocean, yet it provides a much-needed refuge for these wandering birds; allowing them to rest and recharge, readying for the journey home. As I settle down at the table laid by my guide in the shade of the trees \u2013 an octopus salad and bottle of local rum readying us for a languid afternoon \u2013 it strikes me that the same could be said for us human travellers. Rodrigues may be a little off the beaten track, but, for idyllic beaches, stunning scenery and a warm welcome, it is hard to beat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unlikely settler&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he set foot on Rodrigues on 1 May 1691, the French Huguenot Fran\u00e7ois Leguat (fleeing persecution in France) became the island\u2019s first settler. The problem was, he had been told he would be deposited on R\u00e9union. The captain of the Dutch ship, wishing to avoid conflict with a squadron of French ships, would hear none of it though, and so Leguat and seven others were left to fend for themselves on Rodrigues. They lasted two years \u2013 living off the plentiful giant tortoises, abundant fish and the fruits of the lush valleys \u2013 before fleeing by raft to Mauritius. Leguat finally made it back to Europe, via Jakarta, in 1698.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Back to the future&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fran\u00e7ois Leguat Giant Tortoise &amp; Cave Reserve in the south-west of the island is an attempt to recreate what the ecosystem was like when the first settlers arrived.

Over the past eight years, many of the park\u2019s cheetahs have become well known to visitors through the field research of Gus and Margie Mills. Particular favourites have been cheetah sisters Elena and Lisette, happily showing off and enthralling many guests with their litters of cubs in the Auob River, wearing radio collars for many years.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mills\u2019 study highlighted that cheetahs are perfectly adapted to their hunting style and their environment. The greatest contribution to their daily energy expenditure is not from the high speed hunt as you might assume, but from the many hours they spend walking and searching for prey.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cheetahs%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"384\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two sightings of Smith occurred in December 2011 and 2013 respectively. Using the inside spots on the front left leg it is relatively easy to make a positive match. (Unfortunately Smith has since died. - Ed.)&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheetahs all over Africa suffer from kleptoparasitism, theft of their prey by other carnivores. In the Kgalagadi around 9,3 per cent of cheetah kills are stolen in this manner. Only when kleptoparasitism levels reach 50 per cent do the cheetahs\u2019 method of hunting become unsustainable. Other factors that cause the cheetahs to change their behaviour and move greater distances, such as human interference, could push their daily energy requirements to critical levels.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue the long-term monitoring of the Kgalagadi\u2019s cheetahs after the conclusion of the field work, an identification guide has been created for the cheetahs, a companion guide to the Leopard ID Project. Over the past two years as many reports of the park\u2019s cheetahs as could be found were studied, individuals identified and the Cheetah Identification Guide for the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park compiled.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors can use the guide to identify individual cheetahs, then submit their sightings to contribute to the monitoring of these felines.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cheetahs%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"384\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How you can help&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Submit your pictures of the park\u2019s cheetahs so that their movements and breeding success can be monitored. Use the ID guide to identify your sighting. Here are some steps that will make your task easier.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Decide on the appropriate section of the guide to use, this is typically sex or group composition.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Make a note of where you had the sighting and use this information to reduce your initial comparison sample.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Start with the inside leg spots when making a comparison. There tend to be fewer spots and they are much easier to orientate to look for a match. See the photos of Smith (first two images above) as examples of Smith. If you cannot see these spots then use what you have.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email your sightings to Matthew Schurch of the Kgalagadi Leopard Project at &lt;a href=\"mailto:ktp.leopards@gmail.com\"&gt;ktp.leopards@gmail.com&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To read more about Kgalagadi Cheetah identification, go to &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\"&gt;www.wildcard.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;

It is possibly only the second recorded individual of this species ever recorded in the province.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt is an immature bird. The young birds tend to forage further afield than adult birds, but Lambert\u2019s Bay is still some way out of its normal distribution range.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red-footed Booby belongs to the same family as the Cape gannets which inhabit the island. It is the most abundant species and also the smallest species within the &lt;em&gt;Sulidae&lt;\/em&gt; family. Unlike other members of this family it has several different colour morphs. At least five different colour variants are known.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Booby.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird has now flown, but a visit to Lambert\u2019s Bay Bird Island is a great day out. The island lies about 100m off the shore of Lambert\u2019s Bay on the Cape\u2019s West Coast. It offers visitors a rare opportunity to see the blue-eyed Cape gannet up close. Bird Island is one of only six sites world-wide where Cape gannets breed, and it is the only breeding site easily accessible to the public.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island, which is almost 3 hectares in size, is connected to the mainland via a breakwater. It is an important breeding and roosting site for seabirds, particularly Cape gannets and cormorants. Cape fur seals can be seen sunning themselves on the island\u2019s rocks.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the island\u2019s well-situated gannet lookout, visitors can get close to the birds and witness their unique mating dances. The bird hide is signposted with interesting information about these seabirds and their habits.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.capenature.co.za\/reserves\/bird-island-nature-reserve\"&gt;www.capenature.co.za\/reserves\/bird-island-nature-reserve&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Office hours: 07h00 to 19h00; for more information phone 027 432 1672 or 082 336 5936&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/751\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bird Island Nature Reserve&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9191\" class=\"publisher-1338 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/hobbit-trail-run-king-trails\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Hobbit Trail Run - King of Trails&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Hobbit Trail Run - King of Trails  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Hobbit Trail Run - King of Trails\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.doitnow.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #d22127' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/din.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Hobbit%201.jpg?itok=Q5xeU33_\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hobbit-trail-run-king-trails\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hobbit-trail-run-king-trails\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hobbit-trail-run-king-trails&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Hobbit%201.jpg&amp;description=Hobbit Trail Run - King of Trails\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hobbit-trail-run-king-trails\" data-text=\"Hobbit Trail Run - King of Trails\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/hobbit-trail-run-king-trails\" data-title=\"Hobbit Trail Run - King of Trails\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Feb 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics: Mark Sampson, Thribe Media&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just the name \u2018Hobbit Trail Run\u2019 conjures up ideas of mystical creatures in a faraway place covered in mist-covered mountains and lush forests. When you then hear that it's in Hogsback, in the Eastern Cape, well, then the ideas just get an additional stoke of the coals.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towering mountains covered in forests, both indigenous and pine, rivers and streams, waterfalls and mushrooms, birds frolicking and unique inquisitive monkeys observing you as you make your way along the single track, and so the list continues. Run this event and you will find it hard to find another to compare it to; not necessarily because it's the best, longest, or hardest, but because of the combination of core ingredients that make for a genuine, pure trail run.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake though, it's as tough as they come, with numerous runners throwing the towel in along the 100 km adventure, which took place over 28 and 29 November 2014. Starting at Maiden Dam, just outside of King Williams town, the route follows the beautiful six-day Amatola hiking trail. Due to logistics, the race is limited to only 45 runners, who each have their own story to tell as to how they arrived at the starting line. From an American biologist to a lab technician from Tembisa, it was a field with variety and spice and a huge amount of heart.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each day the runners covered approximately 50 km and needed to be self-sufficient, as only one water table was available over the two days.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water in the mountains is plentiful due to all the streams, however with that comes technical terrain, something many runners underestimated and this resulted in longer-than-expected times out on the route.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Hobbit%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day 1, Jacque Mouton (Team Merrell) managed to squeeze into the halfway hut in first place, although he took a 30-minute detour due to losing his way. He was not the only one, with Suzette von Broembse, who was leading at the time, also getting lost en route and ending up in the local township. Although the locals kindly pointed her in the direction of the waterfalls she needed to reach, Race Director Graham Bird called her back to make sure she was on the correct path. Ultimately, she came in two hours after the leading lady.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the back of the field, organisers made sure any backmarkers were redirected onto a shorter route because of the fast-approaching inclement weather. Once all were safe and sound in the hut, the organisers put out an array of food for the weary field. From hot dogs to vegetarian pasta, marshmallows and Quality Street chocolates, and for those still feeling up to it, an ice-cold beer was also on offer.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2 dawned with near-perfect but slightly cool conditions, which changed to warm weather later in the day. Runners were sent off for an early morning ascent prior to making their way through more indigenous forest and pine until they reached the famed Hog, or to be specific, Hog One, as there are three Hogs. With just over 30 km on the legs, runners emerged from the forest to face a 700 metre zigzagging, scrambling ascent prior to summiting. Once at the top, their efforts were well rewarded with amazing views.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final stretches of the run saw runners mainly on forest roads that meandered through pines all the way to the famous Kettle Sprout Waterfall. Once here, many of the competitors stopped briefly to refill their water bottles with the crystal-clear liquid that would get them to the finish line, and where cold Aquelle water awaited them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Hobbit%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The encore came in the form of pure single track, with a gentle decline to the district road and home. The men\u2019s race saw a relatively unknown Izak van der Merwe emerge as the overall winner in a time of 14:50, ahead of Nick Mulder, who once again had a good showing with a time of 15:21. In the ladies, Suzzette von Broembse made up for her first day's mishap by coming in strong on day two. However, the overall title went to four-time finisher Shelley Hufner in a time of 19:23, with Harriot Cullinan in second place in a time of 19:49.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organisers of the Hobbit Trail Run cater for all levels of runner, with distances of 38 km, 16 km and 5 km for the beginners. In the 38 km discipline, Samel Luqongo had a good showing with a time of 5:22:52, while Jane Barnado took the ladies race in 6:10:48. In the 16 km race, Graeme van der Nest won in a time of 1:40:00 and Mariella Dierks showed the rest of the ladies up in a time of 1:52:20. The 5 km sprint race was a hotly contested affair, with the eventual winner De Waal van der Heever coming home in a cracking time of 0:29:51. The first female, and junior, was Neve Hayman in 0:31:55.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prize-giving took place at the host hotel, The Arminal, and the sponsors spoilt all the finishers with hampers packed with Nikwax and Isostar product, plus some Merrell vouchers for good measure.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To all the starters, regardless of the time you crossed the finish line, congratulations!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While racers return home and the forest becomes still once more, the organisation of next year's Merrell Hobbit Trail Run is already underway, with some exciting changes to be announced.

Their story stretches back to the 1800s to Moses\u2019 great-grandmother Susan Williams, a member of the Christian community who grew flowers and strawberries in the area for generations, a vanished tradition remembered in the name Strawberry Lane.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those days Susan and her eldest sons would rise before dawn to walk to Adderley Street, Cape Town to sell strawberries and violets. But under the Group Areas Act, the families in the valley were forcibly removed from their leased land in the late 1960s, and relocated to Parkwood Estate near Grassy Park. Luckily, 28 years ago now, Moses was offered land on lease in this valley when childhood mate Andr\u00e9 Badenhorst gave up his strawberry growing business in the area, and Moses was able to establish his flowers there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today a simple road sign that announces \u2018fresh cut flowers\u2019 entices customers from across the southern Peninsula, from Newlands to Simon\u2019s Town, to buy bunches from Moses and his sons Malcolm and Charles at the Brounger Road Flower Stall. \u201cCustomers like to see the flowers growing because they know they are fresh,\u201d says Moses.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps there is more to the attraction than that, for the Jaftha\u2019s flower farm is a patch of rural paradise surrounded by affluent suburbs and upmarket wine farms, protected by its wetland status. Cocks, hens and ducks root about under the fig and plums trees Moses grew from cuttings. Throughout the year, the12ha garden is magnificent, with rows of sweet peas, strelitzia, sweet William, watsonia, agapanthus, feverfew and poppies on either side of the Spaanschemat River, where tiny fish dart about in the clear water.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the cultivation is done by hand, with nesting sparrowhawks, plus caracal and porcupine among the visiting wildlife. Malcolm now manages the farm while Charles looks after sales, takes flowers to market in Cape Town and buys some varieties from suppliers for the stall.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to Malcolm talk about his flowers \u2013 which plants self-sow, how to get sweet peas to grow straight and tall or how to store dahlia tubers (dahlias are their biggest sellers), is like taking a crash course in gardening. \u201cI learnt it all from my father,\u201d says Malcolm, who gave up his job as manager at Chapman\u2019s Peak Hotel four years ago in preparation for carrying on the business with Charles when his father retires. Ask him which job he prefers and he doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThis one any day,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t low maintenance.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farming has been handed down from generation to generation in the Jaftha family. Moses learned from his mother Susan, a flower seller. \u201cWe used to cut grass for hens, feed the pigs, and we had to carry water in two pails on a stick,\u201d recalls Moses. \u201cIt was very hard after school.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moses has nine grandchildren and already three of the older boys, Seth, Samuel and James, arrive at the farm on Fridays to help. Will the family tradition continue? \u201dWe will have to see,\u201d says Malcolm, his eyes twinkling.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Elgin Valley&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=\"float-left\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Cut%20Above%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"216\" height=\"270\"&gt;If you\u2019ve ever wondered where your bouquet of chrysanthemums \u2013 long-lasting queens of the vase \u2013 comes from, the chances are, if you live in the Cape, it\u2019s Oak Valley Estate in Elgin, the biggest flower grower in the province.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flower farm in a valley beneath the Groenlandberg mountains is surrounded by Oak Valley\u2019s apple and pear orchards, vineyards for cool-climate wines and pastures where grass-fed cattle and acorn-fed pigs are raised. Flowers are either grown in shade houses or in climate-controlled greenhouses on five hectares, using methods developed by the Dutch \u2013 long-established masters of the flower trade.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flower farm was founded in 1978 by a Dutch horticulturist named Arend Doorduin, who worked closely with the current fourth-generation owner Anthony Rawbone-Viljoen. After a flirtation with tomato growing on the estate, Arend started with chrysanthemums for the cut-flower trade and launched what was to become the largest flower-production unit in the Western Cape. Today, the flower division employs 160 workers that produce more than 40 varieties of chrysanthemums alone, plus alstroemeria, lisianthus , three different types of lilies (Asiatic, Oriental and St Joseph\u2019s), gladiolus in summer, iris and freesia in winter and seasonal flowers like Queen Anne\u2019s lace, tulips, sweet William and snapdragon.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing large volumes of flowers to order requires expertise: harnessing technology combined with knowledge, not only of the requirements of each flower type but the lifecycle of pests like western flower thrips, where the female is capable of laying 150 eggs every day for 15 days. Those chrysanthemums, for example, are grown in a computer-controlled environment that manipulates the amount of light and heat to replicate autumn conditions, so that the plants are persuaded to flower year round.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cFor instance, if we want chrysanthemums to flower on 19 December for the Christmas period, we have to plant them in spring,\u201d explains production manager Carel Malherbe. \u201cAnd as soon as we harvest them we have to replant in order to get four cycles&nbsp;a year.\u201d Each section of plants has a chart, a bit like a hospital patient does, detailing progress. Timing is everything when it comes to picking the blooms too. \u201cThere is a half-day window of opportunity, otherwise we are in trouble,\u201d says Carel. The farm sells around 800 000 bunches of chrysanthemums a year, each bunch sold by weight, with five to eight stems per bunch. Peak times in the flower trade are the festive season and Valentine\u2019s and Mother\u2019s days.&nbsp;\u201cI just don\u2019t have Christmas and I can never take holidays until after Mother\u2019s Day in May,\u201d says Carel with a laugh.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Holland, many cut flowers are now farmed using robots, (forget those jolly images of ladies in national costume gathering tulips). But at Oak Valley there are specialised teams for planting, cultivation, picking and packaging, while good old-fashioned methods like composting and a fertiliser made from vermicasts are used. And The Man Above still ultimately takes a hand in decisions like which nights will be cold and which days warm, and what affects things like the colour of blooms. Computers don\u2019t always have the last word. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Knysna&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flowers are literally a way of life for Hannes Stander and his partner DP (Daniel) Ferreira. They are the foundation on which their business Ecozest is built. The flower garden that supplies their business surrounds Woodcutters Forest Cottages \u2013 their home and their guest cottages on the edge of the forest above Knysna, on the Garden Route. And Hannes and DP spend time in the workshop creating bouquets with flowers and natural material from their surroundings.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the heart of their four-acre smallholding near Jubilee Creek is a cutting garden where they harvest flowers both for arrangements and for the flower workshops they hold at their home, an original woodcutter\u2019s cottage dating back to 1827. The garden, filled with dozens of species of flowering plants and shrubs, from strelitzias to pelargoniums, roses to viburnum, is gradually being expanded. And the indigenous forest and vlei that border the garden provide decorative material and a playground for Hannes and DP\u2019s five dogs, two Dutch decoy spaniels, a peke and two lurchers.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannes and DP\u2019s former florist shop on Thesen Island, Kynsna has evolved into Ecozest, a home-based business where their imaginative creations range from pyramids of proteas plus a display of different protea species for a wedding, to branches hung with plants and lights for a golf tournament.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a way of life that keeps them in touch with nature and brings an appreciation of the changing seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s such a harmonious thing to do and so many people have lost that connection with nature,\u201d says DP. The self-catering guest cottages, with cosy fires for winter, are in the vernacular style, and anyone who joins the workshops can stay there, where a welcome bouquet of freshly picked flowers is guaranteed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\/subscribe-win-painted-wolf-wines\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Country Life&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/CL%20Cover_0.jpg?itok=5E7YRxuO\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Country Life&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9129\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/company-wolves\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;The Company of Wolves&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    The Company of Wolves  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"The Company of Wolves\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Wolves%201.jpg?itok=6oEQenwQ\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/company-wolves\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/company-wolves\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/company-wolves&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Wolves%201.jpg&amp;description=The Company of Wolves\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/company-wolves\" data-text=\"The Company of Wolves\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/company-wolves\" data-title=\"The Company of Wolves\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Feb 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Matthew Holt, pics Matthew Holt and Fiona McIntosh&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1897, the Irish novelist Bram Stoker wrote about \u2018one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe\u2019, for which no maps existed, where every meal contained paprika, the superstitious locals repeatedly crossed themselves and an elderly count inhabited a spooky castle, venturing out after sunset disguised as a wolf. Of course, nowadays you can purchase reliable maps of Transylvania from Stanfords in London. But as for the rest of it, who knows what\u2019s true?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving north from Bucharest, the drab factories and housing blocks gave way to grain fields and fruit orchards, and the Mercedes cars and trucks to bicycles and horse-drawn carts. After several hours we reached Transylvania, \u2018the land beyond the forest\u2019, famous for its bears, wolves, plum brandy and vampires. Fiona and I had come here to traverse the Fagaras Mountains, which run across Romania from east to west. We were accompanied by Razvan Radu, who divides his time between being a mountain guide and a major in the Romanian army.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stopped to buy provisions in Brasov, admiring its medieval walls, cobbled streets, Gothic church and haunted town hall. Having lunched on trout soup and grilled trout, it was late afternoon when we finally started hiking from Sambata, first negotiating a picket line of gypsies selling berries and lucky charms. As we wound through the pine forest, past signs warning of bears, a strange grunt from behind made me jump with alarm, though it was only Razvan practising some curious form of pressure breathing he\u2019d picked up in Nepal.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a couple of hours to reach the Sambetei Hut, where we spent our first night. As we approached, a giant hound came bounding up, tongue out and slavering. \u2018Beware the dog, it will bite,\u2019 shouted Razvan, arming himself with sharp stones. Dodging the barrage of missiles, the hairy beast charged right up to us and then rolled playfully onto its back. While Razvan eyed it distrustfully, Fiona tickled its tummy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the hut early the next morning, we hiked up to the ridge at 2200m. From here, we would follow the range for some 30km, taking in Romania\u2019s three highest peaks along the way. We were allowing five days for our journey which, while hardly a trailblazing pace, was still a reasonable challenge given the rollercoaster terrain and volatile weather, with thunderstorms most afternoons.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That afternoon we reached Moldoveanu, the country\u2019s high point at 2544m. A thin ar\u00eate led to the summit, with steel cables providing some comfort over an exposed notch. With the clouds thickening around us, we didn\u2019t stay long on top. Descending towards the Podragu Hut, we paused to watch purple-black storm clouds churn along the ridge, like computer-generated special effects in a disaster movie. Then it dawned on us that the clouds would envelop us before we reached the hut. Exchanging gormless glances, we started running pell-mell down the steep trail, skidding on scree and tripping over boulders. Lightning illuminated the sky like phosphorus bombs, thunder boomed like heavy artillery and even Razvan, who was an ordnance expert for the military, jumped with shock when a lightning fork fizzed past. Though it only took 10 minutes to reach the hut, we were drenched to the bone.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in a valley at 2100m, the Podragu Hut had the cosy charm of a medieval castle. But it served pork stew and beer, and was far more comfortable than camping outside. In order to lighten our packs, we hadn\u2019t bothered with a tent, but instead were relying on the huts and refuges that irregularly dotted our route. There was a marked difference between them. The refuges had the advantage of being up on the ridge, but were typically just dank, tin A-frame shelters. Conversely, the huts had guardians, mattresses and cooked meals, but were located down in the valleys, requiring us to descend off the ridge to reach them and then hike back up the following morning, invariably burdened with hangovers.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trail was well marked and even when we couldn\u2019t spot the red and white painted signs, plaques and crosses invariably signalled the way, with virtually every notch and gully hosting a memorial to some hapless climber. To be fair, there were some awkward sections, with the high level option sticking doggedly to the ridge, with metal cables and staples for protection in places.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most challenging stretch was between Negoui and Serbota, which we came to on our fifth day. We\u2019d spent the preceding night in the Caltun Refuge, crammed in like sardines, with seven of us sleeping there, plus seven campers sheltering from the storm. Leaving the refuge at dawn, we scrambled up chain ladders to the summit of Negoiu, the country\u2019s second highest peak at 2535m. From here, an airy traverse led across to Serbota Peak, a couple of kilometres away. As we clambered along metal staples, we tried to ignore pitiful howling coming from the cliffs above. An hour later we came upon a sheepdog that had somehow fallen off the cliff into a cleft, where it was now firmly stuck.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we made to climb past, the dog looked at us with such doleful eyes that Razvan was moved to suggest we put it out of its misery. Instead, Fiona volunteered me to climb down and rescue it, on the grounds I\u2019d recently been inoculated for rabies. The dog was uninjured but in a complete state of shock, able only to wag its tail and slobber, so we had to carry it along the ridge, passing it between us on the trickier sections. It was only when we reached flat ground that it recovered its confidence and legs, and went ungratefully bounding off. In fact, for all Transylvania\u2019s reputation for abundant bears and wolves, the only wildlife we encountered in the mountains was a herd of chamois, several flocks of sheep and some sheepdogs.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Serbota, we followed the trail up and down and over a couple more peaks, till we reached the summit of Vistea Scara. Although the Fagaras Mountains continued west for another 15km, the main peaks were behind us now. More importantly, we\u2019d arranged to be picked up from the road head at Poina Neamtului, some 10km to the north.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropping off the ridge, we descended through alpine heather and bushes thick with blueberries, which we plucked till our hands were stained crimson as if we\u2019d killed someone. We spent our last night in the mountains at Barcaciu Hut, a charmingly rustic, ramshackle place, like Doctor Doolittle\u2019s, with a large dog that slept in the doorway and wouldn\u2019t budge, cockerels and hens that clucked underfoot, and a donkey that tried to steal our dinner off the table, contenting itself with Fiona\u2019s notebook instead.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we hiked down through the forest to the road. The taxi ride to Sambata, where we\u2019d left our car, took barely an hour, partly because we hadn\u2019t covered much ground as the crow flies, but largely because Romanians drive so recklessly fast.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We headed back south on the Transfagarasan Highway, climbing over the mountains on tight hairpin bends. On the way down, we stopped off to visit the ruins of Poenari Castle, perched precariously on a rock outcrop. Panting up 1400 steep stone steps, we were greeted by a pair of morose-looking dummies impaled on wooden stakes. The castle belonged to a 15th century warlord, Vlad Tepes III, whose precise achievements are obscured by time, but possibly had as many as 100,000 victims impaled to death, with 20,000 Turkish prisoners skewered on one day. Portraits show a thin-faced man with crimson lips, shoulder-length jet black hair and a moustache like a piece of sailing rope. Also known as \u2018Sir Impaler\u2019 and \u2018Vlad Dracula (Dragon)\u2019, he\u2019s generally credited as being the inspiration for Bram Stoker\u2019s bloodsucking count.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening we stayed in Curtea de Arges, a historic rural town with haystacks, donkey carts and a medieval church. Celebrating our traverse with beer, wine and, rashly, plum brandy, we staggered back to our hotel under a full moon. But we felt safe now, for we were no longer within Transylvania.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wolves%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9190\" class=\"publisher-1333 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/8-convenient-camping-gear-updates\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;8 Convenient Camping Gear Updates&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    8 Convenient Camping Gear Updates  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"8 Convenient Camping Gear Updates\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.getaway.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #243741' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/getaway_0.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Camp%208.jpg?itok=_mpnWD1U\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/8-convenient-camping-gear-updates\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/8-convenient-camping-gear-updates\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/8-convenient-camping-gear-updates&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Camp%208.jpg&amp;description=8 Convenient Camping Gear Updates\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/8-convenient-camping-gear-updates\" data-text=\"8 Convenient Camping Gear Updates\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/8-convenient-camping-gear-updates\" data-title=\"8 Convenient Camping Gear Updates\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Feb 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.getaway.co.za\/author\/melanievanzyl\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Melanie van Zyl&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1.

I responded with one word: Fantastic! I left Cape Town in the morning and 45 minutes later I was in Wellington, a town that embodies artistic flair, Victorian and Cape Dutch architecture and country allure.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talk about Wellington&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first stop is Twist Some More, a quirky farm eatery situated a few minutes from Wellington\u2019s centre. Chef and owner, Johan Van Schalkwyk, welcomes us like long-lost friends and dives right into telling us about his love for Wellington. He believes that Wellington sets itself apart from nearby tourist hotspots like Franschhoek and Stellenbosch by preserving old-world charm. \u201cIn Wellington, winemakers and estate owners still shake your hand and welcome you in person,\u201d he explains.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johan\u2019s greatest passion is his restaurant. Eight years ago, he stumbled upon a barnyard covered in cobwebs and since then, he\u2019s transformed it into a space filled with chalkboard menus, handcrafted wooden tables and aromas of delectable food drifting from the kitchen. \u201cTwist Some More is like an extension of me,\u201d he says. All his food is prepared from locally-sourced ingredients. According to Johan, his Wild Boar Burger is a local favourite and thanks must go to the Europeans of yesteryear. In the 1920\u2019s a number of wild boars were sent from Europe to Wellington. They were brought in to control agricultural pests, but over the decades they\u2019ve multiplied, mixed with farm pigs and become something of a pest themselves. Johan is reaping the benefits and occasionally sends hunting parties into the surrounding mountains to source these prized beasts for their meat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feast on a \u201ctwisted\u201d poached egg and salmon Florentine and the conversation turns to town design. We conclude that Franschhoek\u2019s popularity can be traced to its central main road lined with shops and cafes, while Wellington\u2019s charm lies in the very fact that its attractions are more spread out. This has kept tourist numbers relatively low and as a result, those in the know have the town\u2019s artistic sanctuaries, world-class restaurants, wineries and breath-taking scenery all to themselves. It is here where travellers can find a tranquil country experience, coupled with welcoming locals and children who walk to school barefoot.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wine Time&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, we head down the road to Lelienfontein, an 8th generation wine farm that was applauded by Helen Zille for being a model of how land redistribution should be implemented in South Africa. Marketing Manager, Neil Buchner welcomes us at a 250-year-old cellar. We taste a creamy1952 Chenin Blanc (the fourth oldest in South Africa) and a hearty Adama red blend, while Neil tells us about the resident Bosman family. The Bosmans prove to be an exemplary clan - they\u2019re involved in everything from growing vines across South Africa to running holistic development programmes to hand-grafting vines. And, according to Neil, Lelienfontein\u2019s vine-growing nursery is the biggest of its kind in Africa.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We follow Neil to the grafting workshop. Like a well-oiled machine, dozens of dedicated employees sort, cut and graft various parts of the vine. It\u2019s an impressive system fuelled by drive and dedication. I\u2019m intrigued to see that a number of the more experienced workers have adopted a head-bopping dance to accompany their labour. Worker morale is stimulated by Lelienfontein\u2019s extensive social upliftment programmes that include: a day-care centre ; a karate club; a music school; a women\u2019s club; an old-age home; a sports club; a library; bursaries and agricultural training \u2013 all aimed at farm workers and their families.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Wellington Bazaar&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps above all, what stands out for me about Wellington is its artisanal character. During the 1800\u2019s, the Wellington and Paarl areas were world-renowned as a wagon-manufacturing centres, and acclaimed for robust, well-constructed vehicles. South Africa\u2019s first and only piano manufacturer (Dietmann Piano Company), &nbsp;was based in Wellington up until 1989 &nbsp;and besides a robust wine route (and brandy route), Wellington is home to the country\u2019s first indigenous grain whisky.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next on our itinerary is one of Wellington\u2019s artisanal treasures, the Redemption Leather factory and shop. En route, my travel companions point to a \u201cW\u201d etched out of rock at the top of the Hawequas Mountains \u2013 it\u2019s said to stand for Wellington. We pull into a lovely farmstead surrounded by guava orchards and fynbos and on it lies Redemption Leathers. Owner and artisan, Arnold Slabber, has been crafting the finest quality handmade products from his factory since the 1970\u2019s. He learnt the tricks of leather-making at age 11 from Oom Japie, a 70-odd-year-old man who hailed from the Karoo. Having grown up on a wagon during the depression, Oom Japie made leather goods for a living and eventually became something of a leather master. He luckily lived to pass on his talents to Arnold who, in turn, is passing them onto his own son.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pockets of lavender lead the way to the leather shop that is situated in a beautiful Cape Dutch house decorated with coppers and kilims. I get lost in a world of leather. &nbsp;Rich colours cover the walls and the smell of top quality leather drift through the air. &nbsp;Sandals, wallets, bags, belts and leather fly-swats fill every corner of the room - it resembles a Granada bazaar. A local in the shop urges me to try on their legendary sandals. I step into a pair of red sandals and immediately put in an order - the perfect excuse to return.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Hub of Creativity&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next stop \u2013 the Breytenbach Centre - seems to be the heart of modern-day Wellington\u2019s diverse creative spirit. The centre is the former family home of acclaimed South African poet, Breyten Breytenbach, and today it serves as a hub for community-orientated training in visual arts, music and writing. We walk through a ceramics studio, a theatre, a poetry garden, a drama room, a book-and-coffee shop and a gallery filled with local and international art. The house exudes classic style - wooden floors lead to wrap-around porches and mosaic sculptures rise from lush gardens filled with surprise poems etched on glass stands. In the theatre, I glance at posters of musicians like David Kramer who have performed here in recent years and from the coffee shop drifts the smell of cinnamon. &nbsp;It\u2019s almost too good to leave, but our next stop promises wine that tastes like chocolate\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chocolate Wine&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diemersfontein Wine and Country Estate is perhaps best known for its Pinotage on Tap Festival. Hosted in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, it has been dubbed the best wine event in the world by the Drinks International Wine Tourism Awards. The Cape Town festival alone attracts 2500 people who flock to the estate for free-flowing pinotage, local meals and live music. Diemersfontein Event Manager, Rene Reece, welcomes us to the estate. We\u2019re all eager to get stuck into the famed chocolate-flavoured &nbsp;pinotage, but first Rene presents us with Carpe Diem Chenin Blanc and a full-flavoured Cabernet Sauvignon. We sip and nibble on traditional Cape chicken curry and hearty beef burgers sent out from Seasons, the estate\u2019s restaurant. \u201cOur Diemersfontein Pinotage has a cult following,\u201d says Rene as she fills our glasses with the chocolate-inspired liquid. Heavenly flavours of dark chocolate, mint and plum tantalize my senses.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ceramics Matters&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We end our Wellington adventure at Ceramics Matters, a multi-award winning ceramics business owned and run by artists, Gerhard Swart and Anthony Harris. As former winners of the VISI Design Awards, this creative pair undertakes commissions from highflying clients based in places like New York and Hong Kong. They live in a house dating back 300 years and all of their delightful creations are born right here in the backyard. &nbsp;As we drive along their driveway, I see Gerhard flanked by a patterned Great Dane and Anthony standing with a parrot perched on his shoulder. Gerhard is the chattier of the two and leads the way through the studio. Ceramic skulls, limbs and hearts, vases, bowls and plates fill every corner of their sunlit workroom. From the studio, we walk to their home, through rooms filled with objects like ceramic chickens and stuffed owls. An elephant\u2019s skull rests on a wooden table and an avant-garde picture of the crucifix is displayed above a fireplace. &nbsp;It\u2019s the most unusual place I\u2019ve ever seen. Gerhard and Anthony renovated and restored the house to make it what it is today and like many an artist, Gerhard declares that their home is a work in progress, and once they\u2019ve completed it, they\u2019ll probably move on.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we leave, I tell Gerhard it\u2019s a blessing that important buildings like his home land in the hands of people with insight and style. They\u2019ve turned it into something utterly gemlike. &nbsp;Style, innovation and rejuvenation seem to be a trend among the handful of passionate locals I met during my trip. Keep your eyes on exciting Wellington: it might just be turning into a town that will give Franschhoek a run for its money.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Wellington%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Itinerary Add-On&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ouma Granny\u2019s House Museum: Take a journey through history in this old, Victorian cottage that was built in 1876.

These days you can do neighbourhood food markets, second hand bookshops, coffee and art, berry and kiwi festivals and more.&nbsp;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bridget Hilton-Barber discovers some of the new delights in and around this village in Limpopo\u2019s Magoebaskloof mountains.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caution pig crossing&lt;\/em&gt; says the sign outside the Pennefather outpost in Haenertsburg. The sign was put up to warn motorists of the presence of Matilda the pig, darling of Pennefather\u2019s owner, Linda Thom Changuion. She is a very well-read pig \u2013 with a penchant for historical non-fiction - and a symbol of the kind of weekend you can enjoy at the Pennefather, pigging out on books, food and beautiful mountain scenery.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Magoebaskloof%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building of the Pennefather complex a few years ago - a collection of cottages, a bistro, a bookshop and a collectibles shop - started a shift in the soul of Haenertsburg, by giving locals and visitors a new place to meet, greet, gather and chatter.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in the gold-rush style of early Haenertsburg, with wood and corrugated iron, the Pennefather has a bistro out front and a lounge inside the bookshop, with a fireplace and a basket for Matilde and the dogs. The shop has a good solid second hand collection, an excellent Africana and local history section, with books by local authors. &nbsp;There\u2019s a small Anglo Boer War Museum and all sorts of interesting memorabilia in the d\u00e9cor \u2013 from coco-pans to old stoves, typewriters, biscuit tins and Toby jugs.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Magoebaskloof%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole of the main street in Haenertsburg village has gotten trendier of late. There are nice gift shops and coffee shops, a decent grocery store \u2013 even the old age home seems livelier. For the best coffee in town head for Minky\u2019s Art &amp; Coffee Shop, which is a sexy new spot that does a mean line in pastries and breakfasts and also sells art supplies. Further down, the Iron Crown Pub, named after the highest peak in the district, has also changed from a rather dreary Alpine style bar to a contemporary restaurant serving local trout, Mozambican prawns and other fine fare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best foodie addition to Haenertsburg however, is Mina\u2019s Neighbourhood Food Market which happens at a farm called Zwakala, about 20 minutes out of the village. To the brassy sounds of a jazz band, Mina\u2019s gets rocking on regular Sundays and showcases local fare like trout, blueberries, kiwis, organic cheeses, sweet chillies, avocadoes, pomegranates, as well as pastas, tapas, curries, sushi and gourmet burgers.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Magoebaskloof%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mina\u2019s is an old farmhouse with massive wooden tables and benches, funky d\u00e9cor and a wraparound stoep looking onto greenery. There is seating outside under the oak and lovely rustic Medieval-style wooden tables - or inside alongside the fire on chilly days \u2013 and Mina\u2019s attracts hundreds of people from the area. Families, hippies, yuppies, oldies, the whole country mix who gather together to eat soul food, dance to the music, hang out and gaze at the beautiful mountain views.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further up the road is the Wegraakbosch Organic Farm, a Swiss-inspired organic farm dairy offering daily cheese tours, tastings and lunches. They are completely organic using no machinery, fertilisers or herbicides in their process from cow to curd to cheese. You can take a tour, wander about the farm saying hello to the happy chickens, ducks and pigs \u2013 and a cat that really did get the cream - and finish it off with a bottle of wine and a Ploughman\u2019s Platter of assorted Wegraakbosch cheeses and cold meat overlooking gorgeous blue green mountains. Blessed are the cheesemakers.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Magoebaskloof%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessed are the berry makers. Given any excuse, the people of Magoebaskloof will celebrate, and the Berry Festival has become an annual village highlight. The raspberry and blueberry farms in the area open their orchards for berry picking, berry tours, berry tasting and just about berry anything. The whole of the village does a harvest table and there are great bales of hay put out for seating under the oak trees. Try the signature local cocktail called Dark &amp; Stormy, made from mountain berries; and also some of the locally brewed ales and drafts.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visit farms \u2013 like the lovely Kuhestan an organic raspberry and avocado farm set high up in the mountains, with amazing gardens and fabulous views. Kuhestan does a range of delicious Persian cordials, preserves and pickles \u2013 produced on the farm, and they also sell kilims.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Magoebaskloof%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in autumn, there\u2019s the Kiwi Festival, another great foodie weekend, where visiting chefs cook up a storm using anything to do with kiwi fruit and fine wine and everyone eats, drinks and gets on down and merry.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;For more information about &lt;strong&gt;Haenertsburg&lt;\/strong&gt;

Provided you don\u2019t boast about it afterwards, it is to score one for humility. To head out there alone with a fly rod in hand is to put ones vanity in the back of the cupboard and close the door.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To head out there alone with a fly rod in hand is to put ones vanity in the back of the cupboard and close the door.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also an opportunity. An opportunity to re-set the compass in your life, to think deeply on things, and to decide afresh who you will be in this world. You will not return with pictures of yourself with large Trout. None of your friends from the pub will share the story about the fish you lost. Neither will that day become the subject of banter, admiration, or friendly competition. You will have ventured forth to find fish for yourself, and the venture will have done nothing to promote you, or make known your prowess. You will be alone under the sky of that day, and the memories of it will not be saved in the vault of human knowledge. If we assume that you returned all fish you caught, and may I suggest that you do so, the day will be without evidence. If you took photos, they will be timeless landscapes, not linked to you.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day with fishing friends is a rich and priceless thing. So is a day alone, but it is less inclined to advertise itself. It is the unmarked envelope in the Church collection. It is the artwork without a signature. It is also the invisible beacon of a person. A pointless thing of immeasurable value. It is in hours alone in the countryside that you are made.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Alone%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un-surrounded, and unmatched, a fly-fisherman must sustain his determination to hike further, and stalk more fish, even though no one will ever know.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un-surrounded, and unmatched, a fly-fisherman must sustain his determination to hike further, and stalk more fish, even though no one will ever know. He will reach into his inner self to determine if he will lie in the grass beside the pickup and watch clouds before driving home or if he will hike up the valley and stalk a small Trout with a tiny dry fly in the face of an approaching rainstorm.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are alone on a mountain stream. The weather looks doubtful. You have caught some fish already. The section ahead looks tricky to wade. No fish are rising. There is hot coffee to drink back at the pickup, or cold water swirling about your legs. If, around the next corner you lose a lunker, have a close call with a puff adder, or see a rare bird, it will be something to bank in your memory. It will not make you a hero. Think back on the days when you ventured on; and think back on the ones when you retreated.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will you explore an unknown stream, which may be devoid of fish, or will you seek the cover of a glossy magazine.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these days of freeways, airports, power lines and telephones, the world will value the photo of you with a big fish. Will you choose the time alone up that valley with your fly rod? Will you explore an unknown stream, which may be devoid of fish, or will you seek the cover of a glossy magazine.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who AM I?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This calls for a day on the stream. &nbsp;Alone.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Alone%20end.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"722\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.vagabondfly.com\/fishing-alone-by-andrew-fowler\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Vagabond Fly Mag&nbsp;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.vagabondfly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Vagabond%20cover.jpg?itok=sQPODvfS\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Vagabond Fly Mag&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9127\" class=\"publisher-2809 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/bay-plenty-0\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Bay of Plenty&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Bay of Plenty  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Bay of Plenty\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.hsm.co.za\/magazines\/details\/cape-etc' target='_blank' style='background-color: #ffffff' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/capeetclogo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/L%20Grootbos.jpg?itok=FIwsuPxN\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/bay-plenty-0\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/bay-plenty-0\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/bay-plenty-0&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/L%20Grootbos.jpg&amp;description=Bay of Plenty\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/bay-plenty-0\" data-text=\"Bay of Plenty\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/bay-plenty-0\" data-title=\"Bay of Plenty\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Feb 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Jade Cooke&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whales just off shore, endemic fynbos as far as the eye can see and a pick-and-mix itinerary of adventure activities make a visit to Grootbos Private Nature Reserve in Walker Bay, frankly, mandatory.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He (or she \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly easy to tell) surfaces not five metres from the boat, water streaming down the smooth skin of his (or, again, her) exposed back. Even the mild seasickness I\u2019m inexplicably experiencing for the first time in my life can\u2019t mar this astonishing moment: an adult southern right whale just popping over to say hi on a Saturday morning.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m clutching the metal railing of &lt;em&gt;Whale Whisperer&lt;\/em&gt;\u2019s upper viewing deck, the rolling swell of Walker Bay making this higher vantage point an exercise in holding on and staying upright. We launched from Gansbaai harbour not 20 minutes ago and already we\u2019re face to ... well ... back, with one of nature\u2019s most wonderful creatures \u2013 all 11 or so metres of him making tight circles around our boat as if to magnanimously give everyone the best possible view.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"385\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the top 10 land-based whale-watching sites in the world, the sheltered cove of Walker Bay is something of a nursery and speed-dating hub for the southern rights who return here annually between June and December to calve and to mate. Us fragile humans may need a wetsuit to dive its waters, but compared to their icy Antarctic feeding grounds, this is a tropical paradise for the whales, with perfect conditions for rearing their young before heading back to the freezer.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re going to set up base camp in Walker Bay for a spell of whale watching, there is no better place to do so than Grootbos Private Nature Reserve. Touted as a \u2018five-star eco paradise\u2019, this is one location that lives up to its marketing, and its name \u2013 \u2018groot bos\u2019 translates to \u2018big forest\u2019 in Afrikaans.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forest Lodge (our decadent home for the weekend and one of three accommodation options on the reserve) is situated in an ancient milkwood forest, the gnarled, mossy trunks and yearning, intertwined branches of these trees lending a kind of magic to the shaded walk between the main building and our freestanding suite. And then there you are, standing on your private balcony with a forest at your back, a sea of fynbos in front of you and Walker Bay gilded by the setting sun in the distance. Paradise indeed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can tear yourself away from that view, Grootbos has a large selection of activities that can be tailor-made into your perfect itinerary, whether you\u2019re enjoying a family vacation, honeymoon or adventure-focused getaway. Many form part of the all-inclusive package, a select few (such as boat-based whale-watching and scenic flights over Walker Bay) are at an additional cost, but all can be arranged at a moment\u2019s notice via the front desk.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or after a spontaneous decision at dinner the night before, which is how we\u2019ve ended up on &lt;em&gt;Whale Whisperer&lt;\/em&gt; this morning. It\u2019s more than worth the 6 am wake-up call. The expedition (exclusive to Grootbos guests at this time) is led by a marine biologist and whale-crazy team of guides, including a spotter who explains to us what he calls the \u2018footprint\u2019; a smoothening of the water that helps him pick out a whale close to the surface from a distance. The boat keeps a minimum distance of 50m from these leviathans at all times, but their naturally curious nature means they\u2019ll often swim up to it to investigate. And it doesn\u2019t get any better than that \u2013 unless you spot dolphins and great whites on the same trip of course, a trifecta some guests have been lucky enough to experience.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough considering all there is to do on the reserve, our next excursion also takes us out of its beautiful limits on a social responsibility tour to Masakhane. A neighbouring Gansbaai township, Masakhane was first built in the 1960s for men working in the fishing industry.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While marine creatures, relaxation and attentive service are all part of the Grootbos experience, its core focus is on conservation and social development. This it achieves through the non-profit Grootbos Foundation, which was established in 2003 to protect the biodiversity of the area and develop sustainable nature-based livelihoods for its people.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy percent of the reserve\u2019s staff complement of around 120 is from Masakhane, including our guide, Bongani Mjokweni. He paints a vivid picture of the area\u2019s past and present, pointing out local landmarks and some personal ones as well, like the sand bowl of a soccer field where he first played the beautiful game as a child. It\u2019s in stark contrast with the green, floodlit fields Masakhane\u2019s kids now have access to, thanks to a R15 million fund injection raised by Grootbos owner Michael Lutzeyer in collaboration with Fifa and Barclays.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Bongani takes us back on to the reserve to Green Futures, a horticultural school. Its aim is to help Masakhane\u2019s youth find employment, which 90% of its graduates do. In addition to horticulture, students are taught computer skills, given lunch and breakfast daily and paid a stipend, and each year the three top students are given the opportunity to visit the Eden Project in Cornwall to further their studies.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a tour that includes a somewhat surprise meeting with the resident baby boomslang, we purchase a gorgeous pincushion protea from the nursery attached to the school, happy in the knowledge that all proceeds are funnelled back into Grootbos Foundation projects.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time we see a pincushion, it\u2019s from the back of an open Land Rover, the sort usually reserved for viewing the big five. This time we\u2019re focusing our attention at grass-roots level \u2013 literally. Our flower safari guide, Jo de Villiers, is laying some serious knowledge on us about the 2 600ha paradise, the most alien-free reserve in the country. She stops the Landie every now and again to school us on the interesting flora, from the list of indicator species that classify something as a fynbos area (proteas, Ericas, restios and various bulbs, in case you were wondering) to the astounding endemism of the Cape Floral Kingdom (for example, of all the species of &lt;em&gt;Erica irregularis&lt;\/em&gt; worldwide, 98% are endemic to Grootbos). She\u2019s threatened a test before we drive back to the lodge, too.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short while later, the seven of us from the Landie are balancing on a rocky outcrop at Klipgat Cave, pretending to be a baobab in silhouette while Jo snaps away. We\u2019ve gone from seeing the bush to this historical sea cave inhabited by bushmen 2 000 years ago. It\u2019s the site of the earliest pottery unearthed in South Africa to date, and a goldmine of archeological discovery. But Jo\u2019s informative talk of shell middens and the Ice Age nonetheless plays second fiddle to the beauty of this massive rocky shelter, the crashing waves just a stone\u2019s throw away and, beyond that, presumably more whales.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our presumptions are right, because half an hour later, as we\u2019re sipping sparkling wine on the deck of Whale House, a Grootbos-owned property on the cliffs of De Kelders, the bay below us is full of flukes and flippers, waving lazily at the sky. Every now and again, there\u2019s a burst of deep, throbbing whale song, and it occurs to me that the southern rights may be on to something...&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I had the opportunity to return to this paradise year on year, I\u2019d be singing too.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HOW TO GET THERE&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grootbos is a scenic two-hour drive from Cape Town. Take the N2 over Sir Lowry\u2019s Pass, heading through Hermanus and Stanford. Note, the turn-off to Grootbos is marked four kilometres prior, with no signage at the turn. Take the coastal road through Gordon\u2019s Bay on your way home for a change of scenery.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;RESERVATIONS 028 384 8008, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grootbos.com\"&gt;www.grootbos.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CHOOSE YOUR ACCOMMODATION&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Garden Lodge\u2019s stone and thatch freestanding suites are warm and welcoming, with a modern African aesthetic. Perfect for families, the lodge has a children\u2019s entertainment room and outdoor play area with rabbits to pet, and is in close proximity to the well-kept stables so little ones can visit the ponies.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\u2022 The high ceilings and large windows of Forest Lodge offer unrivalled views of Walker Bay and the surrounding fynbos, with cosy fireplaces and an infinity pool in which to cool off come summer. Suites are embedded in the ancient milkwood forest, and you can\u2019t beat the private pool on the deck of the honeymoon cabin.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\u2022 Grootbos\u2019s private villa sleeps up to 12 adults, with a private guide, chef and butler allocated to you during your stay. It\u2019s 1 000m2 of ultimate luxury complete with a wine cellar, gym, pool and media room.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Grootbos%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;LINGER LONGER&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you\u2019ve ticked boat-based whale watching off your list, sign up for one of these adventurous activities, all offered by Grootbos&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. GO SHARK-CAGE DIVING&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;There are few thrills as intense as coming face to face with a great white shark in its natural habitat. Grootbos, in partnership with Marine Dynamics, will take you on a luxury boat tour of Shark Alley, the hunting ground of these fearsome marine predators. View them from the observation deck or get into the cage for a close encounter. All equipment (plus lunch!) is provided and a marine biologist accompanies the trips.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. RIDE THE RESERVE&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;A horse-riding trail through the fynbos is a wonderful way to get back in touch with nature, and the views over Walker Bay are hard to beat. The Grootbos stable caters to everyone from absolute beginners and children, to experienced riders who prefer a canter up the mountainside. A three-hour beach ride in the Walker Bay Nature Reserve is offered to proficient riders \u2013 a blissful opportunity to spot whales in the bay.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. TAKE TO THE SKIES&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;For a bird\u2019s-eye view of this beautiful area, book one of the scenic flights that leave from the reserve\u2019s private airstrip. Options include a flip over Grootbos and Walker Bay, a whale-watching flight, trips around Cape Point, Table Mountain and the Winelands, or a visit to Cape Agulhas, the southernmost tip of Africa.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. HOP ON A QUAD&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;Go full throttle with a quad-biking adventure through forest, valleys and mountains. This fun, two-hour ride through designated trails in the fynbos includes lookout points over the bay and Dyer Island, famous for its seals and circling great whites. No previous quad-biking experience necessary.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. RAISE A GLASS&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;If you need to steady your nerves after all that adventuring, a turn at a few Overberg tasting rooms should do the trick. The Standford, Elim and Hermanus wine routes are all within an easy drive of the reserve and can be explored on a Grootbos guided wine tour, so you can sample many of the bottles from your wine list the night before.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/apphau5.com\/e-editions\/e-reader\/954\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Cape Etc&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.hsm.co.za\/magazines\/details\/cape-etc\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/CET3_Oct_2014_web_317_379_0.jpg?itok=WezKV1bG\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Cape Etc&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9126\" class=\"publisher-2376 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/softroader-getaway-adventure-crater\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Softroader Getaway Adventure in a Crater&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Softroader Getaway Adventure in a Crater  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Softroader Getaway Adventure in a Crater\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wheels-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/L%20Peogeot.jpg?itok=BO5E_2wG\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/softroader-getaway-adventure-crater\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/softroader-getaway-adventure-crater\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/softroader-getaway-adventure-crater&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/L%20Peogeot.jpg&amp;description=Softroader Getaway Adventure in a Crater\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/softroader-getaway-adventure-crater\" data-text=\"Softroader Getaway Adventure in a Crater\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/softroader-getaway-adventure-crater\" data-title=\"Softroader Getaway Adventure in a Crater\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Gerhard Horn, pics GG van Rooyen&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Peugeot 3008 doesn\u2019t look like your average SUV or crossover, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t handle a drive through one of the world\u2019s largest asteroid craters.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a long hard look at the Peugeot 3008. It\u2019s not really an SUV or crossover, is it?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s much closer to an MPV\/station wagon than a sports utility vehicle, but who are we to argue with the French manufacturer? If it says its car is a crossover, we believe them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to where you want to cross over to. If you want to cross over a river, you\u2019d be better off in something with low-range and locking differentials. Some people simply don\u2019t want to cross over that far, so why bother with unwanted mechanicals that just push up the price?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s basically the thought process behind the 3008. It has the looks and high driving position associated with SUVs, but that\u2019s about it. Does that make it a bad car? Not in the least, in our opinion.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you buy a vehicle like this, you are basically making a statement. A car like the 3008 lets your neighbours know that you\u2019re adventurous and that you like spending time outdoors. You don\u2019t want to venture too far into the wild, but just far enough to remove yourself from the hustle and bustle of city life.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of you might frown at this concept, but it\u2019s a market that is set to grow in the coming years. From 2015 and onwards, we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of these compact crossovers with limited off-road ability, and it\u2019s not just the automotive world that\u2019s getting in on this new fad.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adventure farms are sprouting up all over SA. These places aren\u2019t hard to reach and they offer a host of activities that were previously available only to a brave few who dared to venture far off the beaten path. The Peugeot 3008 was thus the perfect vehicle to take to one of these farms, if only to see how much adventure one can have with a French front-wheel drive crossover.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Peogeot%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In the dome&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few adventure farms in Gauteng, but we wanted to get some proper time behind the wheel of the 3008. We settled on Parys in the Free State and pointed the new nose of the recently face-lifted French vehicle towards the N1.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few kilometres before the Grasmere Plaza, the road splits in two. You can take either the N1 and arrive in Parys within the hour, or the more scenic N12. As we are adventurous types, we chose the N12. This turned out to be a big mistake as the road is currently undergoing massive reconstruction. At one point we were down to 10km\/h.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In desperation, we made another detour, opting to drive to Parys via Carletonville and Potchefstroom. At the end of the day, this supposed 45-minute drive took us about three hours, but at least we were exposed to the best qualities of the 3008.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a car that\u2019s suited to long distances on tar. The unplanned changes to our route would normally have caused considerable irritation, but we were untroubled. The car did a fine job of keeping us cool and comfortable, even though the thermometer was climbing steadily towards 40\u00baC.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were also surprised at how easy it was to get to grips with the infotainment system. The Bluetooth connection was set up within minutes and we had a huge playlist of Empire podcasts at our disposal. We were only too happy to enjoy the scenery while listening to film critics discussing the difficulties of making a movie based on an obscure novel.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time slipped by and we soon found ourselves on a gravel road heading towards our final &nbsp;destination, Thabela Thabeng. This is an adventure farm nestled in the Vredefort Dome \u2013 our main reason for visiting the region. We had recently read a book on the subject, and decided to check out the impact site of the asteroid for ourselves.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine our disappointment when we were told that we had been driving around in the crater for the last hour or so! The impact zone is so large that it can\u2019t be identified at ground level. To get a full appreciation of the crater, you must view it from the air.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least the asteroid had a massive impact on the landscape, so we could at least enjoy the diverse plant, animal and rock formations that formed as a result of a 10km-wide rock colliding with planet Earth.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the modern-day adventure activities, some history on the Vredefort Dome. The asteroid is thought to have been one of the largest to hit the planet. The resulting crater would originally have been about 300km wide, but since it has eroded away over time, there\u2019s no way of knowing how large it actually was.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dome, as it exists today, is a half-ring of hills created by the force of the impact. The visible part is more or less 70km in diameter, but the effects of the impact can be seen much farther away. It is believed that the impact played a part in elevating the gold found in region closer to the surface. The asteroid may have destroyed everything in its path when it smashed into the earth around 2023 million years ago, but at least it provided easier access for man to that most precious of metals.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Peogeot%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not on target&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thabela Thabeng manager Albie de Villiers was kind enough to take a full day out of his busy schedule to show us around, and organise a few activities, including archery. This was something different for us, but how difficult could it be to hit a target a mere 20m away? As it turned out \u2013 very difficult!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albie gave us a quick lesson, which resulted in us shooting more or less near the target, but the experience left us thankful that we live in a modern world where meat is readily available on supermarket shelves. If we had lived hundreds of years ago, our families definitely would have been vegetarians, and not by choice. We feel duty bound to advise the burly men out there not to attempt archery as a means of impressing your partner. Albie said the fairer sex had a natural aptitude for archery, and many men left the range with an undamaged target and a severely dented ego.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thabela Thabeng is a perfect location for rock climbing and abseiling. There are various tours on offer, but since we were rock-climbing novices, we decided instead to scale a man-made object Albie and his crew have erected on the grounds. It\u2019s a mere 10m high, but objects seem much taller once you\u2019re on them. From up there, the ground felt more like 100m away.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least you\u2019re in control of your own ascent up the structure\u2026 Abseiling down is another matter altogether. You stand on the edge while another person slowly lowers you into the traditional abseiling position. Leaving your fate in the hands of someone you don\u2019t know is not easy, but once you get the hang of abseiling, it's fun. We took some comfort from the knowledge that Albie and his crew are fully qualified and take every precaution to safeguard those who want to climb to the top of their tower.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that scary experience, Albie took us on a leisurely drive on the property, which includes self-catering accommodation and a beautiful section of land where pecan nuts are farmed.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Peogeot%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Farther than expected&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was just one slight hitch. We visited Thabela Thabeng\u2019s website a few days earlier in preparation for the trip and on the home page it mentioned that the gravel road on the property was best suited to vehicles with a reasonably high ground clearance. The Peugeot\u2019s ground clearance of 160mm is hardly impressive, but we weren\u2019t willing to accept defeat that easily. Driving on those roads was a nerve-racking experience, but only because of the seating position. We crept down the narrow road in anticipation of the low nose grinding onto something, but that awful noise never came. It turned out the 3008 was far better at soft-roading than we'd expected.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During our venture into the Dome wilderness, we met up with Albie\u2019s children and their horses. Our red 3008 grabbed the attention of the horses and they followed us for a short distance. It would have been only too easy to outrun them, having 170 horsepower (120kW) from our 2,0-litre turbocharged diesel engine, but it seemed slightly unfair to the teenagers, who had only one bhp each. So we parked the car and enjoyed the scenery. The horses were friendly and curious, and it took some effort to keep one of them from nibbling on the side mirror.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albie chose this moment to share one of his favourite quotes: \u201cThere is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man.\u201d We\u2019re fairly certain that most horse owners will know who said that, but for those who don't it was Winston Churchill.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ended the day with a leisurely row on the Vaal River. There are a few places that can offer visitors an action packed adventure in the rapids, but our abseiling had stirred more than enough adrenaline for one day.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again we'd driven the 3008 into the kind of place it was never intended to go. To get that perfect photograph, it was necessary to park the car on a slippery slope next to the river. It was easy enough to get the car into the spot, but we had some nagging doubts about getting it out. If we couldn't spin it out of there, we could call on Albie\u2019s 4x4 double-cab to tow us out. We decided not to worry about it for a while and drifted serenely on the river.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shot worked perfectly, and soon we could no longer ignore the fact that we had to negotiate a front-wheel drive car over a wet and slippery incline. The worst-case scenario was too awful to contemplate \u2013 the 3008 at the bottom of the Vaal River! Since insurance forms don\u2019t allow much space to explain an accident of this nature, we were hoping it wouldn't happen.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we drove the 3008 out of there at the very first try. It struggled to find grip for a few seconds, but then flew out with no problem whatsoever. Who said we were worried?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Peogeot%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peugeot 3008 turned out to be a surprising companion. We have driven it before and it left us impressed with its levels of comfort, space and sophistication. It has a lovely diesel engine, which averaged around 7,0 l\/km on this trip, and it is lavishly equipped with standard features that tend to be optional extras in its competitors. The recent facelift has also done its part in turning the 3008 into a rather handsome vehicle.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re not suggesting you attempt crossing the Kalahari in the 3008, but it\u2019s nice to know that it can cope on the odd occasion when you want to venture a little way off road.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the adventure farms, the 3008 offers entry into an adventurous lifestyle without you having to go the whole nine yards.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to do the same?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I get there and when should I go?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get to Parys is via the N1. On the N1 the journey takes around 45 minutes to an hour from Johannesburg, but the N12 via Potchefstroom is more scenic. It takes two hours, but it\u2019s worth the trip. Potchefstroom is also worth a visit as there are some interesting places to see, including the historic Snowflake building and the North West University campus.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An all-wheel drive vehicle is not necessary and a compact crossover should do just fine on the gravel roads surrounding Parys.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the winter it\u2019s extremely cold out there, with temperatures regularly dipping below zero. The best time to go is right now, during the summer months. The yellow hue of the hills has been replaced with a lush green, but take care not to spend too much time in the sun.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I stay?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few places to stay between Parys and Potchefstroom. You can also choose to stay in either one of the towns, where accommodation ranges from basic to ultra luxurious.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thabela Thabeng has 12 three-star self-catering chalets built on the edge of a cliff. These units are popular, so it\u2019s best to book. (tel 056-818-1116 or e-mail to &lt;a href=\"mailto:info@thabelathabeng.co.za\"&gt;info@thabelathabeng.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do while I\u2019m there?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more than enough activities to keep the family busy over a weekend. At Thabela Thabeng you can hike or ride your mountain bike through the Dome. Those who prefer something more relaxing can go fishing in the Vaal River, or do some bird watching. There are more than 400 bird species in the Vredefort Dome, so it\u2019s a bird watcher\u2019s paradise.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several adventure companies in the immediate vicinity that offer activities such as hot air ballooning, white river rafting and guided 4x4 trips through the Dome.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.mysubs.co.za\/magazine\/leisure-wheels\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leisure Wheels&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/LW%20Jan_0.jpg?itok=QuEWZK-v\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Leisure wheels&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9135\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/tracking-turtles-place-miracles\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Tracking Turtles in the Place of Miracles&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Tracking Turtles in the Place of Miracles  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Tracking Turtles in the Place of Miracles\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Turtles%20M.jpg?itok=0RX4gj67\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/tracking-turtles-place-miracles\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/tracking-turtles-place-miracles\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/tracking-turtles-place-miracles&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Turtles%20M.jpg&amp;description=Tracking Turtles in the Place of Miracles\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/tracking-turtles-place-miracles\" data-text=\"Tracking Turtles in the Place of Miracles\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/tracking-turtles-place-miracles\" data-title=\"Tracking Turtles in the Place of Miracles\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Debbie Cooper, pics iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silent beach is shrouded by a fine sea mist, the gloaming punctuated only by hundreds of ghost crabs scuttling out of the way of our vehicle\u2019s headlights.

The sign we seek is tracks leading from the water\u2019s edge to the base of the dunes. Two turtle species nest here - the loggerhead and the far larger and less common leatherback. The tracks of the latter are truly impressive \u2013 as wide as a tractor tyre, made by an animal weighing up to 800kg.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Turtles%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After endless miles, our guide, Jacques Breedt from Shoreline Turtle Tours (one of iSimangaliso\u2019s two St Lucia-based concessionaires) exclaims in excitement that he\u2019s spotted the telltale prints of a loggerhead.

Time passes as we wait in anticipation \u2013 after an age, he returns to call us to gather around as she is finally in her trance-like stage where laying can begin.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Turtles%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With lights kept dim and avoiding flashlight in her eyes, we watch in awe this ancient ritual of life. The spectators are visibly moved, transfixed by the privilege of witnessing this most intimate act. Our turtle\u2019s eyes are weeping \u2013 is it sadness? Joy? Or just sheer exertion? Her body shudders and heaves with each expulsion of the white ping pong ball-sized eggs. She lays around 100 eggs each time, more or less every 15 days for several weeks. But this doesn\u2019t mean there will be many future turtles. Those eggs that evade discovery by honey badgers and other beach scavengers will hatch in approximately 60-70 days. That\u2019s when the real danger begins. Hatchlings must run the gauntlet of ghost crabs, birds and sea creatures in their mad scramble to reach the deeper sea. Only one in each thousand may make it to adulthood, and even those are unsafe from the perils of fishing nets and ingested plastic.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Turtles%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"368\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leatherback turtle is rarer than a black rhino. The odds are not at all in their favour \u2013 but if they are going to make it anywhere, then the vigorously protected iSimangaliso Wetland Park world heritage site is the safest bet they have.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You want to see a turtle too?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;iSimangaliso Wetland Park includes the marine protected area and marine sanctuary, where five of the world\u2019s seven species of turtles are to be found. The Park\u2019s 220km of untouched shoreline provides nesting grounds for two of these species, the loggerhead and leatherback, which return to lay eggs at the same beach where they themselves hatched. Monitoring and protection has taken place for over 60 years by conservation agencies. Tours are offered under concession license to operators in the St Lucia \/ Cape Vidal areas, Sodwana Bay, Coastal Forest and Kosi Bay sections. There are still a few weeks left to experience this highly moving and rare event, which occurs from November to February each year.

South African endurance swimmer and the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s Patron of the Oceans, Lewis Pugh, is determined to help ward off an irreversible crisis \u2013 not for our children, but for the current generation.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI spent the better part of the past four weeks with my head in the sea \u2026 and I am able to say that our oceans and coastlines are on the line. The biggest fish I came across during my swims was 30 centimetres long. I didn\u2019t see any sharks, nor dolphins or whales,\u201d says Pugh, barely a week after returning from his latest expedition. The campaign, during which he swam the seven seas of the ancient world, took place between 7 and 29 August 2014 and stretched some 200 kilometres.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI knew these seas had been overfished, but never did I anticipate them to be this empty. I never, ever thought it was this bad,\u201d he says.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the swimmer did see was an insurmountable pollution crisis that exceeded his imagination. \u201cEspecially in the Aegean and Red Seas we saw huge amounts of pollution in the form of litter on the seabed,\u201d Pugh recalls. \u201cWe saw heaps of stuff you wouldn\u2019t expect on the ocean floor: tyres, shopping trolleys, bottles, cans and loads of plastic \u2013 from chips packets to carrier bags.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that his Seven Swims in the Seven Seas campaign strengthened his worries with regard to the health of the world\u2019s maritime resources, with oceans in particular. \u201cThe destruction has happened in my lifetime. I am 44 years old, and I am halfway through the average lifespan of a male of my socio-economic status,\u201d Pugh says. \u201cIf we carry on doing what we are doing to the oceans in the second half of my lifetime, then we will have an irreversible crisis on our hands. &nbsp;We are using oceans as our dumping ground, and we do so at our own peril.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cMy message to world leaders and policy makers is therefore that our oceans should be protected \u2013 not for our children and their children, but for us. Protecting the oceans is not about them. It should be about our generation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to protect the oceans for us because this crisis is unfolding now, in our lifetime.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expedition wasn\u2019t all doom and gloom, Pugh says. The Red Sea leg stands out on that regard. \u201cThe swim started in Aqaba, Jordan and took me along the coast and into the Aqaba Marine Reserve. Once we entered this reserve, things changed below me. There were all sorts of corals \u2013 red, orange, yellow and even some beautiful dark blue varieties,\u201d Pugh recalls. \u201cMulticoloured fish darted in and out of the coral as we came past. It was truly magnificent.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cIt was great to see what a marine protected area can look like,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, just two kilometres away, outside the marine protected area, the tyres, bottles, cans and plastic returned. It was startling to see the contrast.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, this contrast was a highlight, says Pugh: \u201cIt was proof that marine protected areas do work and that we need more of them.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another memorable aspect of his Seven Seas campaign was the support he received from people from all walks of life. \u201cFarmers, fishermen, shipowners, housewives and school children came out to support us, as well as royalty,\u201d he says. \u201cFor our Red Sea swim, the King of Jordan decided to lend us his boat and a naval escort. During this swim, people from local villages \u2013 school kids included \u2013 came down to swim with me. The fact that so many different people supported what we did, from kings to ordinary folk, was wonderful.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toughest stretch was by far the North Sea swim, which measured 100km and guided Pugh via the River Thames from South End to Parliament in London. \u201cThere was a very strong tide moving into one direction, with winds blowing the other way,\u201d he says. \u201cThe water was very choppy and I was swimming at night. The water temperature was 14 degrees Celsius. It was very tough physically.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Sea swim was completely different from his Red Sea leg the week before, Pugh says: \u201cIn the Red Sea, the air temperature was 44 degrees while seawater temperatures hovered around 30 degrees.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe thing is that you can\u2019t really prepare your body for such extremes,\u201d he continues, adding that every swim was different. \u201cThere was no time to prepare for things like that. We would arrive in a country, travel to harbour, find somebody who was willing and able to escort us, and then do the swim. We would also do photo shoots, interviews with the media, and one or two speeches. Finally, we would get on a bus back to the airport, en route to our next destination.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pugh says that his latest expedition has been different from previous campaigns and, in a way, more exhausting: \u201cThe world of campaigning has changed over the past years when I started what I do now. The overall package of 21st century campaigning is tough. Today, apart from the above activities, everyone expects you to be on Twitter and Facebook, and to communicate every few hours about what is going on. Media were phoning me all the time. Between 7 and 29 August, our team got an average four hours of sleep per night. The only way you can pull through is when you have a deep sense of purpose.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was still recovering from his Seven Seas expedition at the time of this interview, Pugh was already thinking about his next trip. On the agenda: the pristine and remote Ross Sea, situated on the New Zealand side of Antarctica.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is an extraordinary region, with whales, seals, orcas and other species,\u201d Pugh says, adding that he wants to swim there to raise awareness around the necessity of preserving the Ross Sea as a marine protected reserve. \u201cThis region is truly the Garden of Eden. We need to protect it at all cost.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/Lewis%20Pugh%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"416\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seven Seas of the Ancient World&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term \u2018Seven Seas\u2019 has been making the rounds in various cultures for millennia, and therefore its definition varies from region to region. In Greek literature, the Seven Seas comprise:&lt;br&gt;* The Mediterranean Sea (stretching from the Atlantic Ocean, separating Europe from Africa)&lt;br&gt;* The Aegean Sea (an arm of the Mediterranean Sea, located between the Greek Peninsula and Turkey)&lt;br&gt;* The Adriatic Sea (part of the Mediterranean Sea, situated between Italy\u2019s eastern coastline and the shoreline of the Balkan Peninsula, which comprises Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Albania)&lt;br&gt;* The Black Sea (situated in eastern Europe, surrounded by Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Turkey)&lt;br&gt;* The Red Sea (an extension of the Indian Ocean, located between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, with the entrance being the Gulf of Aden)&lt;br&gt;* The Caspian Sea (landlocked between Asia and European Russia \u2013 this sea is the world\u2019s largest inland body of water, with a surface area of 371 000 km\u00b2)&lt;br&gt;* The Persian Gulf (situated between Iran and the Arabian Peninsula)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Past expeditions&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis Pugh has undertaken over a dozen swimming expeditions, of which quite a few served as tools to raise environmental awareness:&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;* 2007 \u2013 Pugh was the first person to swim along the Maldives (140km in 10 days) to draw attention to the impact of rising water levels on low-lying islands. The Maldives archipelago is so low that it is directly threatened if seawater levels start to rise.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;* 2007 \u2013 He swam 1km across an open patch of sea at the North Pole to draw attention to the melting of the Arctic sea ice.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;* 2008 \u2013 Pugh paddled 140km in a surf ski from the island of Spitsbergen in Norway into the Arctic ice packs. The objective was to show the world that this trip was only possible as a result of melting Arctic sea ice, which is a direct consequence of climate change.&lt;br&gt;* 2010 \u2013 Dressed in a Speedo costume and a swimming cap, he embarked on a one-kilometre swim across Lake Pumori, situated at 5 300m on Mount Everest. He wanted to draw attention to the fact that glaciers are a water lifeline for more than 2 billion people living in the Himalaya region. If the Himalayas continue to melt away, Pugh said, they are to become the Earth\u2019s next big battleground.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Intrepid%20Cover%20Dec_0.jpg?itok=OLUHNndW\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;The Intrepid explorer&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9025\" class=\"publisher-1813 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/heia-you-doing\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Heia you doing&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Heia you doing  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Heia you doing\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.ride.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #E31933' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/ride-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Heia%201.jpg?itok=7_0cKe42\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/heia-you-doing\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/heia-you-doing\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/heia-you-doing&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Heia%201.jpg&amp;description=Heia you doing\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/heia-you-doing\" data-text=\"Heia you doing\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/heia-you-doing\" data-title=\"Heia you doing\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words and pics Andrew Steer&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It\u2019s simply a fantastic mountain-biking and trail-running facility, and we had a great time testing it out&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heia has the best lake in Johannesburg for open-water swimming (Lake Heritage), and I even accompanied some friends on an unsuccessful fishing expedition there once upon a time. There is some fairly tame wildlife roaming around \u2013 not petting-zoo tame, please, you will get kicked \u2013 but tame enough to linger around and not head for the hills at the first sign of human life. You will encounter giraffe, impala, zebra, wildebeest, blesbok and springbok on almost every visit to the park, and you may even be lucky enough to spot one of its three black springboks. The whole place has a nice African game reserve feel to it, from the rondawels and curio shop to the friendly zebras that frequent the poolside of the ranch\u2019s restaurant.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest addition to Heia is the Hero Adventure Park, which was built up in the last year and a half and opened officially in March this year. It\u2019s simply a fantastic mountain-biking and trail-running facility, and we had a great time testing it out.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Heia%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The riding&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four routes available at Heia: three routes (12,5km, 15km and 18,5 km) for adults and the 3km Little Heroes route. Between these routes, riders of pretty much every level are covered, from those riding the 3km to those riding the pretty tough 49km (if riders choose to tackle all the routes of offer).&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue route (easy\u2013intermediate)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12,5km Blue route is an absolute blast and the ideal ride for anyone looking to have some fun on their bikes. There are some slightly more challenging sections, but in general there isn\u2019t too much in the way of serious grunt work required. Most importantly, the fun factor is set to the max most of the time: there are plenty of fun bermed descents, switchbacks on most corners, great flowing singletrack and, optional jumps and even a floating bridge (momentum is your friend, just stick to the middle).&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow (intermediate)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 18,5km yellow route is accessed via the Blue route through an access swing gate on the left end of the lake, taking you to the south-western side of the farm. You hit plenty of fun, tight, forestry sections (eight in total), with lots of quick, sharp rises and steepish drops to navigate. It\u2019s hugely entertaining fun but also pretty tiring work at the same time \u2013 your quads will feel it after a while. After those initial forest sections, you head out towards more open terrain, with some long drags up rocky exposed outcrops that offer some nice, wide views of the surrounding area. The descents from there are fast and furious, taking you back to more switchback forest sections and, ultimately, to the Blue route and home base.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red (intermediate\u2013advanced)&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15km Red route is the toughest on the property and is accessed off the Blue route, this time via a wooden bridge just before the dam wall towards the end of the Blue route. This takes you to the northern side of the farm (the other side of the dam). After an initial quick XC-type assault that really gets the heart racing, the route becomes a lot more forgiving: 90% of it will be rideable for a cyclist with decent fitness and a basic MTB skill set. You climb along the banks on the northern side of the lake before eventually popping over the ridge onto some concrete tracks and returning a bit later for a last few challenges and a gnarly final descent back down to the dam wall. There is plenty of great singletrack (some of it even runs through abandoned houses), many switchback sections and great views of the lake\/dam wall as well as a lookout point\/lunch-stop bench \u2013 well worth the sweat you\u2019ll spill.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overall experience&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, a lot of time and effort has gone into all the trails on the route: probably 90% of it is purpose-cut singletrack, and the number of bermed corners is already really impressive; yet it still seems to be expanding every time I return. The variety of terrain and challenges is fantastic \u2013 forest singletrack, bermed corners, long climbs, switchbacks for Africa, rocky koppies, a floating bridge, great lake views and free- roaming wildlife \u2013all this within just 30 minutes\u2019 drive of Johannesburg and Pretoria. It\u2019s an experience that\u2019s hard to topple. And yes, what better way to cap any ride than with a great meal.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several more riding and running routes are in the pipeline, as are two more floating bridges that will have been opened by the time you read this. It\u2019s pretty clear to see why Heia is rapidly becoming one of the most popular event venues in Gauteng. There is just so much for everyone to enjoy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycling hours&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cycling hours are from &nbsp;sunrise to sunset. Night rides are offered only on specific event evenings.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of the riding, you are pretty exposed to the elements \u2013 sunblock is a must for riders pretty much all year round. It can get very hot on the far ends of the Yellow and Red routes, so always make sure you have enough water before heading out there.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riding rates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It costs R30 to ride and there is a R20 deposit for your number board. Pay at reception, where you can also pick up a map of all the trails. There are no year permits, but the option is likely to be introduced soon.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restaurant&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restaurant is open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Heia%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the East Rand:&lt;\/strong&gt; when coming from the OR Tambo\/ Eastgate direction, take the N1 Pretoria off-ramp at the Gillooly\u2019s interchange.

Some 3,500 spectators in the packed Porsche-Arena are going wild, because the superfinal of the fourth adidas ROCKSTARS bouldering invitational they have just witnessed was exactly what the name indicates: super. Super thrilling, super tight and super spectacular. Canada\u2019s 27-year old Sean McColl wins the duel on the final boulder and beats 18-year old Jongwon Chon from Korea by a nose. The two athletes almost climb synchronously, jump simultaneously, and swing parallel. At the rim to the topout they are abreast. Sean McColl slips and lunges at the buzzer while falling down. Not knowing whether he hit the button properly, he stays on his back. Jongwon Chon, who also stumbled to the top, is confident of victory and jubilantly throws his arms in the air.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a photo finish like this, the adidas ROCKSTARS organisers have set up two buzzers on the super boulder, to clearly determine a winner. A yellow light goes on at the buzzer that was hit first. The other buzzer is blocked automatically. And today the yellow light shines for Sean McColl. The two-time World Champion Overall (L\/S\/B), who is known for his climbing speed, claims his second adidas ROCKSTAR title after 2012. Jongwon Chon is happy, too. The young Korean has won the local adidas ROCKSTARS Korea competition in Seoul for the second time this year and was invited to Stuttgart. It is his first podium ever at a top-class international competition. Reaching the final of the top 6 and beating world cup stars like Dmitrii Sharafutdinov (RUS), Sachi Amma (JPN) or Jakob Schubert (AUT) in the semis has already been a huge success for Chon. Last year he placed 22nd.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chon is also the first who can top a boulder in the tough final. While all problems of the route setters were solved in the qualification and the semi-final rounds, the top 6 men and women literally wear themselves out on the first final boulder. After two exertive days, their fingers are trashed and they are hurting. One can feel the pressure. First the finalist don\u2019t want to disappoint the 3,500 spectators who have come to the Porsche-Arena to cheer them on; second they have to make the cut-off as after the first two boulders three athletes are eliminated. None of the finalists can solve the first problem.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jongwon Chon and the defending champion Jernej Kruder (SLO) grab the bonus hold. It all comes down to the second boulder. Rustam Gelmanov (RUS) and Mathilde Becerra (FRA), who placed 6th in the semis, start first. Mathilde reaches the bonus in her fifth attempt. Next Jongwon Chon and M&#233;lissa Le Nev&#233; (FRA) take to the 44m wide stage. The two-time French Bouldering Champion and first woman who repeated Wolfgang G&#252;llich\u2019s legendary Wallstreet (8c) in May this year, reaches the bonus hold in her second try. On the opposite side the audience sees a very flexible Chon fighting. He\u2019s got one minute left. In his fourth and last attempt he finally makes it to the top. A wave of excitement spreads through the arena. Chon revels in the attention. The Korean has broken the spell.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After him, Petra Klingler (SUI), Mina Marcovi&#269; (SLO) and Akiyo Noguchi (JPN) successfully complete the second boulder. Marcovi&#269;, silver medallist at the 2014 Lead World Championship in Gij&#243;n, even manages a flash. The adidas ROCKSTAR 2013, Jernej Kruder, reaches the bonus hold in his first try. Rei Sugimoto (JPN) secures a bonus point in his third attempt. As Sean \"The Machine\u201c McColl is about to top the second boulder in his fourth try, the spectators hold their breath, because the Canadian suddenly stops at the rim to the topout, clenches his fist and is about to jump down, believing that he completed the problem.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the nick of time he hears the referee shouting that he must carry on. On top of the boulder the adidas ROCKSTARS 2012 realises that he almost squandered his chance for victory. After a brief moment of shock, Sean has to laugh at himself and flirts like a born entertainer with the crowd.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two boulders, the result is clear. Jongwon Chon, Sean McColl and Jernej Kruder advance to the next round; so do Mina Marcovi&#269;, Petra Klingler and Akiyo Noguchi. With only one bonus under her belt, last year\u2019s runner-up Shauna Coxsey (GBR) is out. But the British boulder badass is happy to have competed at all after spraining her ankle on Thursday. When the event\u2019s sport physicians gave her the green light, she made her way to the final with an aching, heavily strapped-up foot.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third boulder, the athletes start in reverse order to the intermediate standings. Akiyo needed three attempts for her top and has to go first. A bit short of breath the graceful Japanese lets the first 40 seconds pass, before she tackles the third dynamic problem of the route setters. She reaches the bonus hold without difficulty, but is wrestling with the mantle on the top. Akiyo sticks to her guns, she wants this flash that would be her ticket to the superfinal. And she nails it. The crowd goes wild. Swiss powerhouse Petra Klinger cannot top this boulder. Mina Marcovi&#269; however, successfully completes it in her fifth try. Hence the superfinal pairing of women is set: Japan vs. Slovenia, Overall Bouldering World Cup Champion against Overall Lead World Cup Champion.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jongwon Chon and Sean McColl have scored one top in four tries, respectively. Jernej Kruder hasn't reached a top yet, but he has a better bonus balance. Last year's winner is getting the crowd behind him. If he can complete the third boulder in his fourth attempt, he will enter the superfinal. But he doesn\u2019t succeed. Today the silver medallist of the 2014 Bouldering World Championship has to settle for third place.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10:12 pm. The superfinal is set. Stuttgart\u2019s punkrock band Badasstics performs the adidas ROCKSTARS song \u201cNo Borders\u201d live. Akiyo Noguchi climbs on the left side of the super boulder, Mina Marcovi&#269; is on the right. They can\u2019t see each other. They can only imagine what\u2019s happening on the other side based on the reactions of the crowd. The Japanese takes the lead. 3,500 spectators in the arena go mad. Akiyo Noguchi wins the duel. After a second place in 2012 and a third place in 2013, she finally claims the title.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porsche-Arena is on fire. Can this atmosphere be topped? It can. While the route setters change the boulder for the superfinal of the men, European Beatbox Champion Robeat pumps up the crowd. The 25-year-old vocal acrobat is stepping on it: funny sound effects, hard techno beats, fast drum-and-base rhythms. The spectators are thrilled by his performance. Finally, Sean McColl and Jongwon Chon line up for the final duel of the evening. The rest is history.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;36 hours later the Porsche-Arena is empty. Apart from a few golden confetti shavings, there is no allusion that a few hours ago the world\u2019s best bouldering athletes have fought for victory on a giant 30m wide wall. The mobile climbing wall that has been specifically developed for adidas ROCKSTARS has been dismantled. Eight tractor trucks have transported many tons of material to the warehouse where it is stored \u2013 until next year.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;adidas-rockstars.com&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Rockstars%2012.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9016\" class=\"publisher-2376 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/how-dusty-can-you-get-duster\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;How Dusty Can You Get a Duster?&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    How Dusty Can You Get a Duster?  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"How Dusty Can You Get a Duster?\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wheels-logo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Duster%201.jpg?itok=IvK3KB0U\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/how-dusty-can-you-get-duster\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/how-dusty-can-you-get-duster\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/how-dusty-can-you-get-duster&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Duster%201.jpg&amp;description=How Dusty Can You Get a Duster?\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/how-dusty-can-you-get-duster\" data-text=\"How Dusty Can You Get a Duster?\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/how-dusty-can-you-get-duster\" data-title=\"How Dusty Can You Get a Duster?\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Gerhard Horn pics Rob Till&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Renault Duster is regarded as a soft-roader, which means it\u2019s quite good in a shopping mall's parking lot but not much use when the going gets tough. So what happens when you drive it through some really harsh terrain?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term \u201csoft-roader\u201d is widely recognised as the description of a car that has bigger tyres than usual, added ground clearance and some suspension tweaks, but not to the point that it\u2019s as capable off-road as a proper 4x4.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is, how far removed from a real off-roader is the average soft-roader? Is the gap between the two really that big, or would a soft-roader get you to some of the places seen as the preserve of the hardcore 4x4s?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity to find out a few months ago, on an epic adventure in Namibia. Renault invited us to drive a Duster through some remote parts of this beautiful country \u2013 to a secret location where a film crew was busy shooting a new season of Ultimate Braai Master.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had previously driven the Duster on our own soft-roader adventure, but on that occasion it had faced little more than a badly corrugated dirt road in the Komatiland Forest. A bad road in Mpumalanga and five days through Namibia\u2019s most hostile terrain are two completely different things, and to be honest, we thought the Namibia trip could do some serious damage to the Duster's reputation.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our arrival in Windhoek, the Renault dealership wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring. We were told over a cup of coffee that the Dusters we\u2019d be driving were brand new and that the modifications made for the trip had been completed that very morning. So not only were we heading out in vehicles with delivery mileage on them, but we were using untested equipment. The odometer had barely reached double digits, and we faced a five-day drive covering 3000km. At least we could look forward to a 600km section of tar on the final day!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first leg of our trip was a gravel route from Windhoek to Sossusvlei Desert Camp. These roads are notorious for shredding tyres, so we were surprised to see that the modifications made to our cars did not include a new set of shard rock resistant rubber. In fact, the modifications were limited to a sturdy roof rack and a set of jerry cans in case we couldn\u2019t find 50ppm diesel.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Namibian version of the Duster includes a stainless steel bull bar as standard, but other than that it was the same Duster we know in SA.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Duster%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first 300km turned out to be mostly uneventful. The Duster has a rather rudimentary all-wheel drive system that kicks in automatically when it detects a loss in grip. This made the Duster fairly entertaining on the first leg of the journey, simply because it lets you get the tiniest bit sideways before it intervenes and saves the day. It was loads of fun, but too much of a good thing can lead to a brand new Duster landing on its roof in the middle of nowhere, so we turned off the road to check the tyre pressures. In our hurry to get going, we had forgotten to check this vital element. The car was still set up for city driving and as anyone in the know will tell you, an overinflated tyre and a gravel road really don\u2019t mix. After we had let out some of the air the Duster fell back in line again.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were missing the sideways action, but had some time to reflect on the Duster\u2019s 1,5-litre turbocharged diesel engine. We have praised this engine before, and it is certainly one of the best currently in production. For its size it delivers a powerful punch, and this allowed us to cruise kilometre after kilometre, without ever having to gear down from fifth.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hours flew by uneventfully and eventually we pulled up at the Tropic of Capricorn to watch the sun setting over the magnificent Namibian horizon. Our tour guide started getting uncomfortable with our constant picture-taking and loitering, but we regarded this as a wonderful moment that needed to be savoured.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the guide's scurrying became apparent an hour or so later when we still had 100km or so to drive, without sunlight illuminating the way. The Duster\u2019s headlamps were in working condition, but a moon-free evening in the middle of nowhere is just about as dark as it gets. Couple that with wildlife running around freely and you have a recipe for disaster.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suppose it was inevitable that one of us would hit something, and we just happened to be in the car when Lady Luck decided to go home for the night. We were in a hurry to get to Sossusvlei and, while driving at 100km\/h or so, crossed paths with a frightened young buck. It had simply stared at the first car in convoy, but decided to run across the road a split second before we arrived. There was no time to brake or swerve. The buck died instantly, as did our stupid determination to get to our destination quicker rather than safer.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Duster%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the Duster suffered little damage, mostly thanks to the standard Namibian bull bar. The fog light was broken and the bumper was a bit scuffed, but other than that the car was fine.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We eventually arrived at Sossusvlei late at night, thankful for the harsh lesson in mortality. Let\u2019s just say that, in our experience, it\u2019s best not to drive in Namibia after dark.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning we headed for Death Valley. We had seen our itinerary a few weeks earlier and knew that this would be the true test of the Duster\u2019s off-road prowess. You can drive yourself into the desert up to a certain point, but then there\u2019s a large sign stating that only real 4x4s may enter here.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were in a car with four driven wheels and we weren\u2019t about to give up just because some sign advised us to. It seemed that the previous night\u2019s lesson had been quickly forgotten.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We drove past the sign and got stuck about 300m later! It wasn\u2019t the car\u2019s fault, but rather our own for thinking that we could drive a soft-roader over soft sand in its default auto mode. In sand, momentum is king and the traction control was making anything resembling momentum nigh impossible.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We switched it off immediately, locked the car in all-wheel drive with power distributed 50\/50 to the front and rear axles, and set off again. This time we not only kept up our momentum but found ourselves choosing the most difficult path through the soft sand, time and time again.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made it through, much to the amusement of a large crowd gathered in the 4x4-only parking lot. We explored the area and came back to an entirely new crowd that had gathered around our little 4x4. As it was decorated in \u201cUltimate Braai Master\u201d livery, most people thought it was a publicity stunt. They wouldn\u2019t believe we had got the car there under its own steam. One guy suggested that Renault had used a helicopter to drop it there. Another wondered aloud whether he had made a mistake in renting an expensive Hilux overlander at the airport. After all, there was a perfectly good Ford Kuga standing at home, but he'd thought a soft-roader wouldn't make it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Duster%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the second day we had proved that you could push a soft-roader much further than you\u2019d expect, but that deduction may be limited to the Duster. After we had driven it for the first time, we expected as much because it is a relatively straightforward, lightweight all-wheel drive crossover.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed we kept on driving the Duster into places it really shouldn\u2019t have been. We went to the edge of the Fish River Canyon, through dried riverbanks and over the occasional rocky stretch. On the last day, we even did a 50km off-road track in the hopes of seeing some wild horses.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duster got us to the set of &lt;em&gt;Ultimate Braai Master&lt;\/em&gt;, where we enjoyed plenty of meat and &lt;em&gt;melktert&lt;\/em&gt; and revelled in the atmosphere of a reality TV show set. (In case you were wondering, the cooking time and elimination process really is as intense as it seems on the screen.)&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip left us with renewed respect for Renault\u2019s humble little Duster. It started with almost zero kilometres on the clock and by the end we had added 3000 more.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way we lost a fog light and one tyre. That\u2019s the grand total of the damage Namibia could inflict on our French car. It did not develop a rattle, squeak or niggle. The dust did work its way into our luggage in the boot, but this was a small annoyance and something that would probably happen to a hardened 4x4.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namibia is basically a torture chamber for cars. We often heard stories of how people had rolled their cars, or ruined tyres and been left stranded for days.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the fourth day, we saw an example of what can happen. We came across a Prado claimed by the desert. It had rolled and burned out \u2013 just beyond one of those sneaky corners after a rise in the road.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namibia is as harsh as it is beautiful, but it turned out to be no match for the Duster.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.mysubs.co.za\/magazine\/leisure-wheels\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leisure Wheels&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/LW%20Jan.jpg?itok=RftV_hUR\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Leisure wheels&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-8702\" class=\"publisher-1335 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/opting-out-salt-rock\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Opting out in Salt Rock&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Opting out in Salt Rock  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Opting out in Salt Rock\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #222222' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/cl.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Salt%20Rock%201.jpg?itok=Lt2ESyQY\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opting-out-salt-rock\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opting-out-salt-rock\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opting-out-salt-rock&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Salt%20Rock%201.jpg&amp;description=Opting out in Salt Rock\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opting-out-salt-rock\" data-text=\"Opting out in Salt Rock\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/opting-out-salt-rock\" data-title=\"Opting out in Salt Rock\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Andrea Abbott, Pics Andrea Abbott &amp; supplied&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the Salt Rock area of the Natal North Coast when it was far from everywhere, especially school. Getting to and from school consumed so much time that the only thing to do was bunk. Often. Spending idle hours on the beach eyeing the talent, I never really got the hang of things like maths and science. But what the heck \u2013 as the song goes, we had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Times have changed. Development along the North Coast has brought Salt Rock closer to everywhere, including schools. No valid excuse now to bunk. But although the population has boomed, as is evident from the housing estates occupying former sugar-cane fields, Salt Rock has retained its small-town character. The village centre is much as it\u2019s been for decades. No high-rise buildings block the view or shade the beach, and amenities are few but sufficient. They include the Country Club, an unassuming cluster of shops, a couple of restaurants, and the famous Salt Rock Hotel that Basil Hulett built in the late 1930s and which has been passed down to his grandchildren, Craig Hulett and Linda Labidi. Except for the multi-storey wing tacked on in the 1960s, the hotel is still imbued with old-world tropical charm.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch on the rustic patio or drinks on the sundeck perched high above the tidal pool, which Basil also built, is about as good as things get. Metres from the pool, the caravan park is probably closer to the sea than any other accommodation in the area.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A caravanning retiree from Cape Town told us he escapes the Cape winter every year, spending three months on the eastern side of the country, a month of that at Salt Rock. With the North Coast\u2019s climate balmy practically all year round, \u2018Retired from Cape Town\u2019 enjoys an almost endless summer. As another song goes \u2013 summertime and the living is easy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s easy indeed to enjoy all the area offers. Stroll along pristine beaches, brave the exhilarating surf or cool off in the tidal pools at Salt Rock, Shaka\u2019s Rock and Thompson\u2019s Bay that, like the legions of rock pools exposed at low tide, teem with marine life.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Salt%20Rock%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhen I first saw the creatures in Shaka\u2019s Pool, I knew I had to share that beauty,\u201d surfer and qualified nature guide, Michelle (Michy) Morris says. A year ago, Michy started Tidal Tao Snorkel Safaris. \u201cNot everyone wants to go scuba diving. Snorkelling is much the same but in miniature.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Tao\u2019, Michy explains, is Chinese for \u2018telling a story\u2019. And what stories she tells as she guides snorkellers on unforgettable expeditions \u2013 some at night \u2013 in the tidal pools and hidden gulleys. Stories, for examples of the nudibranch. \u201cThe what?\u201d \u201cA sea slug,\u201d says Michy. \u201cThe name means naked gills. There are more than 3 000 species, all of them fabulously coloured.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another story is of the coral in Shaka\u2019s Pool. \u201cThe most southerly occurrence in the world of shallow-water coral,\u201d she says. In telling the ocean\u2019s stories, Michy\u2019s primary goal is to conserve marine life.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cI want to stop the cruelty along the coast.\u201d It\u2019s not mere talk. Twenty percent of her income goes to marine conservation projects.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another who cares deeply for animals, in this case domestic animals, is Genevieve Chisholm. \u201cIn ten years we\u2019ve rescued 10 000 animals,\u201d she says. Gen and her parents, Odile and Julian Foster-Greenwood, own Flag Animal Farm, situated a few kilometres inland from Salt Rock. \u201cIt was badly run down when we bought it,\u201d Gen says. \u201cToday it\u2019s rated as top of its kind.\u201d It\u2019s also one of the busiest destinations on the North Coast. Families stream in and schoolchildren arrive by the busload to picnic, party, play in the Jabula Playground and learn to love animals.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Flag Farm is no zoo. It\u2019s a facility genuinely devoted to giving a loving home to abused or abandoned domestic animals. \u201cMany get dumped here,\u201dshe adds, hugging a kid goat whose mother escaped slaughter by jumping a fence and running away. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have space for an animal, we\u2019ll find it another home. But every one we accept lives its full life here and receives proper care.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further inland is a venue devoted to wild animals. Rain Farm wildlife sanctuary and lodge is the only place of its kind on the North Coast, until the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park. \u201cThe owner, Douglas Nidd, is passionate about wildlife and conservation,\u201d marketing manager Tasmyn-Jain van Niekerk tells me as we sit on the restaurant deck watching zebras graze on coastal grasslands across the valley. \u201cHe dreamed of his own game reserve where his children could lead an outdoor lifestyle.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years ago Douglas began a remarkable labour of love \u2013 the re-wilding of 300 hectares of sugar-cane fields. As Rain Farm evolved, the Nidd family decided to share it, and opened it to the public five years ago. It has become a sought-after destination that offers a range of facilities including accommodation, a wedding venue, day-visitor amenities, game drives and various adventure activities.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Salt%20Rock%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back toward the coast, two other enterprises provide muscle-straining, bum-bruising adventure \u2013 more specifically \u2018the new golf\u2019, as some refer to mountain bike trail riding. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the fastest-growing sports,\u201d Nic Jordan tells us. A farmer and accomplished mountain-bike rider who has, among other challenges, ridden halfway around Rwanda, Nic started Holla Trails (named after \u2018holler\u2019 \u2013 what riders do when they\u2019re hurtling along a thrilling route) five years ago.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cOur 340km trail network is possibly the most extensive organised trail venue in the country,\u201d says Nic, adding that Holla\u2019s furthest point is high on an escarpment, a 70-minute drive from the clubhouse. That surely translates into a many-hour ride. (I\u2019ll take the drive, thanks).&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next door, Sugar Rush Park offers mountain-bike trails ranging from a 5km course to a demanding 40km route. More than that, the park is a unique agritourism hub. \u201cOur initial plan was for a cut flower growing and distribution centre,\u201d says Rose Juby, one of four partners who developed the park. \u201cWe only needed two hectares, but ten is the required minimum for agricultural zoning.\u201d To make use of the surplus, Rose and her partners brought on board the Ballito Dolphins Rugby Club, which needed a home of its own, and iLembe Winery, a co-op with vineyards in the KZN hinterland. They also opened a caf\u00e9, decor shop and the Sugar Rush Adventure Centre, which incorporates the trails and a children\u2019s play park. And so, from its beginnings as a flower-packing facility, Sugar Rush has blossomed into a place where you can ride or shop until you drop.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at Salt Rock, shopaholics can feed their habit at two fine markets. On the north side of the N2, Burnedale Farmers Market concentrates on local fresh produce and home-made products. The Saturday morning market is part of the Burnedale Centre, which houses a caf\u00e9 and a range of small shops including a pottery gallery where you can buy hand-painted crockery, or do your own painting.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the N2, the Litchi Orchard \u2013 set, as one would expect, on a working litchi farm \u2013 also promotes local and sustainable food production. A day market is held on the second Saturday of each month, and the night market that includes live music is on the last Friday of the month. Facilities open daily include the dinky Coffee Roastery, a caf\u00e9, garden centre and pub.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to my (misspent) childhood on the North Coast, I recall people commenting to my parents, \u201cWhy do you want to live all the way out there?\u201d Nowadays though, the Salt Rock area has so much going for it that anyone not living \u2018all the way out there\u2019 might be sorely tempted to bunk work or school and escape to this vibrant coastal paradise&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\/subscribe-win-painted-wolf-wines\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Country Life&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3185\"&gt;Holla MTB Trails&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2456\"&gt;Ballito to Salt Rock Trail&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.countrylife.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/CL%20Jan%2015.jpg?itok=47gQ6iK9\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Country Life&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9024\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/soul-food-downtown-jozi\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Soul Food in Downtown Jozi&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Soul Food in Downtown Jozi  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Soul Food in Downtown Jozi\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Jozi%20Food%201%20beauty%20of%20urban%20renewal.jpg?itok=ti4W530o\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/soul-food-downtown-jozi\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/soul-food-downtown-jozi\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/soul-food-downtown-jozi&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Jozi%20Food%201%20beauty%20of%20urban%20renewal.jpg&amp;description=Soul Food in Downtown Jozi\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/soul-food-downtown-jozi\" data-text=\"Soul Food in Downtown Jozi\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/soul-food-downtown-jozi\" data-title=\"Soul Food in Downtown Jozi\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words and pics Bridget Hilton-Barber&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundays are food market days in downtown Jozi. You can either go east to Maboneng, a funky urban renewal district centred around Arts on Main - or you can go west, and discover the latest food market called The Sheds@1Fox, set in one of Jozi\u2019s oldest industrial warehouses.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Africa to Asia and the Middle East - there\u2019s a whole of soul food going down at Market on Main in the Maboneng Precinct on Sundays. This weekly food and design market draws hipsters and foodies from all across town with its Afro New York charm and easy urban vibe.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Jozi%20Food%202%20prettiest%20woman%20on%20sunday.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set inside a funky warehouse on the eastern edge of the CBD, the food market features a hundred or so traders \u2013 and you can do Mexican mama hot bowls, soul souvlakis, Indian paneers, Durban bunnychow, Mediterranean flatbreads, pap &amp; wors and fresh delicate pastries. The setting is designer industrial and the stall names have a fabulously South African flavour - the Jozi Smokehouse, Sharp Braais, Durban Deli, Cherrybomb Funky Foods. The design component of the market has retail and vintage \u2013 music, furniture, clothing, accessories and craft.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Jozi%20Food%203%20freshly%20baked%20ciabatta.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From rollerblading teens to people sitting quietly reading the Sunday papers, the whole of Maboneng comes alive on a Sunday. There are families, young crowds, couples and cool people hanging out, brunching, lunching and drinking. \u201cSundays is when Jozi is at peace with itself\u201d, a food seller told me and it certainly feels that way.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are interesting urban spaces within Maboneng \u2013 from coffee shops in container and enormous murals that adorn entire buildings to rooftop gardens and green courtyards. The name Maboneng means place of light and it\u2019s a privately developed urban neighbourhood with shops, galleries, restaurants (over 20) loft apartments, factory spaces, contemporary connected office spaces, a hip hotel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Jozi%20Food%204%20sunday%20papers%20maboneng.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on the other side of town \u2013 head straight down Commissioner Street \u2013 on the western edge as it\u2019s become known, you\u2019ll find the hippest new addition to the urban-renewal-meets-food scene \u2013 the Sheds@1 Fox. It\u2019s in Ferreirastown where Joburg\u2019s first miners pitched their tents during the gold rush and neighbours historic Marshalltown, whose landmarks are the Stock Exchange and Diagonal Street.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sheds@1Fox is a seriously sexy place. The food market is set in a vast warehouse whose main shed is one of the oldest industrial spaces in Jozi city. And from a culinary point of view, this market takes it up a level \u2013 offering things like sushi, champagne and oysters, organic vegetables, designer waffles, fair trade coffee, Mexcian street food and American style pork belly BBQ .&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Jozi%20Food%205%20soul%20souvlaki.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a fresh flower market as you walk in \u2013 yay! - and plenty of space and seating, although no electricity on the day I visited \u2013 prompting someone to joke that it should be called the Loadshed@1Fox. But the vibe is great and it\u2019s inspiring to see hip urban renewal. The Good Luck Bar inside the food market is named after one of the city\u2019s original bars which got its license all the way back in 1895.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sheds@1Fox is in on the western edge of town - on the edge of First China Town, Fordsburg and Newtown, and home to historic buildings, like the old Chinese Club and the city\u2019s first Indian cinema. The district has many historic buildings and warehouses dating mainly back to 1920s and 1940s \u2013 and the good news is that there are plans to develop some of the surrounding spaces here.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Jozi%20Food%206%20urban%20jungle.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022&nbsp;For more information about the Arts on Main Food &amp; Design Sundays check out &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketonmain.co.za\"&gt;www.marketonmain.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;.

It has the tropical climes of the Amazon, Caribbean and Pacific coasts, as well as the breathtaking Andes Mountains and super cities. However, if you were to delve deeper into the areas surrounding the Andes, you would find Zona Cafeteria. A region famous for its coffee.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited Colombia for the first time many years ago, arriving via a five-day sailboat crossing from Panama. While on this boat trip, the Colombian couple whom were in charge introduced me to their local coffee. Now, I have had Panamanian, Indonesian, Bolivian, and Brazilian coffee, to name only a few, but it is the Colombian coffee that sweeps them all off their feet. It is rich with a thick coffee flavour, but also smooth enough so that you don't need to add cream or sugar to enjoy it. The region I visited on that first trip is close to the sleepy village of Salento, a paradise suspended in time and place I have since returned to for a third time.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Salento is quite stunning in its own beautiful and own right, most who venture to this small town are here to visit the justifiably famous Valle de Cocora. This nature reserve is home to Colombia's national tree, the beautiful wax palm (&lt;em&gt;palma de cera&lt;\/em&gt;), which just happens to be the tallest palm in the world, at heights of up to 60 metres, and looks like it should have featured in the film Jurassic Park.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What many tourists don\u2019t know about Salento is that it is a coffee hot spot and one of the country\u2019s top export regions. Not only is the coffee that\u2019s produced here excellent, there are some really cool tours to go on and getting to the plantations and surrounding areas is half the fun.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Coffee%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salento is about 15 miles from Armenia, a bigger city, but it takes 45 minutes to get there. With that being said, the only way to get to Salento's coffee plantations are via dirt roads. Some of which are impossible to drive on. Therefore, you can walk, ride a horse or grab a couple mountain bikes - the later being the travel mode we chose, and what turned out to be a fantastic way to explore the plantations.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumping on our rented bikes, we cruised along the dirt roads, roller coasting up and down the terrain of the Andes, all the while taking in the scenery that had a prehistoric look to it. In fact, we wouldn't have batted an eye if a dinosaur had come sauntering out of the vegetation and crossed the road. While trying to breath at 6,000 feet, we momentarily forgot what the purpose of our trip was because we were so completely mesmerized by the sheer bizarreness yet beauty of this place. A place God clearly intended to remain lost forever. Yet, this was one of the country's top export regions, it was all quite mind blowing.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing along the bumpy dirt road, we passed beautiful farms and plantations that you wouldn\u2019t mind calling your own. After about 45 minutes of the most jaw-dropping and breathtaking scenery, we arrived at the plantation and were immediately taken to the &lt;em&gt;finca&lt;\/em&gt;, where we were shown and educated about coffee. Educated on how it comes from a plant and is then transformed into an aromatic liquid that people from the world over have come to love.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All about coffee&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the tour, we learnt a lot of interesting facts and information about coffee, such as that it is grown between altitudes of 1,800 and 6,000 feet on the side of a mountain. It's planted with plantain and banana trees because they help each other grow and are thus beneficial to each other. We also learnt that Colombia is a special place to grow coffee. It turns out that other coffee-growing regions around the world only have one real growing and harvesting season due to their location. Since Colombia sits almost on the equator, it is not affected by the seasonal changes that other the other countries have to go through. Therefore, it has two growing seasons and not just one and coffee is produced all year round.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guide explained to us how to pick the coffee beans and how the colour determines if it is ready or not to be picked, as well as what taste you would get from a particular colour. He then demonstrated how to peel the bean from the casing it is grown in. Keen to try this ourselves, we picked a coffee bean from the plant and tried our best to peel back the skin to get to the bean, which was no easy task, quite finicky and time consuming. A task, the guide told us, we would have been paid about 10 cents an hour. Once we finally got to the bean it was a light brownish color, ready to go into the cauldron for cooking.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Coffee%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The process&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coffee we drink and beans we buy at the store are black because they are first cooked so that they are ready to be ground and brewed to our desire. But they don\u2019t look like that when they are first picked from the plant. To make a single cup of coffee, a picker has to pick around 40 to 100 beans. If I was a picker, it would have taken me about an hour to pick and peel the beans; a lot of effort for a cuppa. The beans are then put out in the sun to dry, to help speed up the cooking process. The drying can take up to a couple days, depending on the weather. Once dried, the beans are then placed in what is known as a popper.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A popper is a device that not only heats up to an incredible temperature but also stirs the beans every two to three seconds until they turn a dark brownish, black colour. At this point, they are taken out of the popper and cooled for approximately 12 hours. Then after the many hours it has taken to pick, peel, dry and cook them, you are finally ready to have your first cup of coffee. Oh, and after grinding them, of course.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Countryside cruising&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a delicious cup of coffee, we got back on our bikes feeling energized and happily continued to cruise around the Andes Mountains and this amazing region, the Zona Cafeteria.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, two of my most favorite things in the world are coffee and cycling. To be able to enjoy both of them in a setting as spectacular as anything you may have seen in &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;\/em&gt;, I\u2019m not sure my afternoon cycle could have been any better.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Coffee%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TRAVEL TIPS&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to go&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said above, the weather and climate in Colombia don\u2019t change too much, if at all. It sits not far from the equator and really only has two seasons; the wet season and dry season. The wet season is roughly from April to November, with a weird dry month in July. And the dry season is from December to March. I was there in September and did get rained on, but it wasn\u2019t anything to keep me from going outside and enjoying nature. But given your own limitations and what you want to do, you can choose when you would like to go.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting there&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fly from Bogota, the capital of Colombia, to Armenia, and then go by road to the magic village of Salento. If you travel by road from Bogota, it is 278 kilometres to Armenia (about 7 hours), also using the Coffee Highway, which connects Quindio and Risaralda to Manizales. The remaining 25km to Salento takes about 45 minutes. There are also buses that run from 5:30am to 8pm and come about every 20 to 30 minutes from &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/wikitravel.org\/en\/Armenia_(Colombia)\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Armenia&lt;\/a&gt; and one every hour to Pereira.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best way to get around&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways of transport in and around the city. The best way I found was to simply walk. The town is not flat by any means and renting a bike and going around the city could be exhausting. But we obviously rented bikes one day and it turned out to be wonderful. Many people go by horseback with a guide and they take you around the city and surrounding areas. And finally there are also Willy\u2019s (a type of Jeep) and Land Rovers with the roofs chopped off and people cruise around in those for a fare of about 3,500 Pesos. But Ultimately, the preferred methods for me were to ride a bike or simply enjoy a stroll walking around.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salento cuisine&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salento has many different restaurants from local eateries to western accommodations. But if there was one dish that everyone has to try, it is the &lt;em&gt;trucha con platanos&lt;\/em&gt;. It is a dish of trout (the local fish in the rivers of the region) with deep fried plantain chips and rice or beans. Absolutely fabulous. But as I said, if you wish, you could always find a place that has pizza or other western delicacies.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Visit one of the many organic coffee &lt;em&gt;fincas&lt;\/em&gt; in the area.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Check out the Mirador, the lookout point, as it is supposed to offer one of the best views in Colombia.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Hire a mountain bike and go for a full day or an hour's ride. There are a whole range of trails around the area that provide something for everyone, from relative beginners to those who want something a bit more technical. Some of the trails afford some spectacular views across the area and coffee plantations.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Take a trip to Kasaguadua Natural Reserve, consisting of 12 hectares of lush tropical rain forest and a mountainous landscape that protects a natural creek. There is a network of well-maintained looping trails (4km), achievable in 1.5 hours up to 6 hours. Its altitude makes it quite different from Cocora Valley's and allows you to find another kind of vegetation and climate.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Hire a guide, saddle up a horse and cruise around the city in style while also going through some areas outside of town.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;Ask around town, and depending on the season, you may be able to go fishing for the elusive trucha and make your own trout dish.&lt;br&gt;\u2022 &nbsp;And sometimes the best thing to do is just sit back in a hammock and enjoy the view of the valley from whichever hostel or living arrangement you decide on, while sipping some coffee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.doitnow.co.za\/content\/coffee-tour-keeps-you-pedalling-more?utm_source=TotalSend&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_content=Subscriber%2323367&amp;utm_campaign=DO%20IT%20NOW%20Weekly%207%20Nov%202014\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;

But the Friendly City at the eastern end of the Garden Route has much to offer lovers of the outdoors. If you\u2019re heading there for a summer holiday add some of these adventures to your bucket list.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20PE%20beachfront.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summertime or wintertime I think I\u2019d find livin\u2019 easy in the heart of Nelson Mandela Bay. Located on one of the most beautiful stretches of the South African coastline, backed by stunning mountains and gorges and with plenty of green lungs to hike, bike and run in, Port Elizabeth is the perfect playground for water babes and landlubbers alike.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often billed as the Watersport Capital of Africa, the city is Mecca for sailors, windsurfers and kiteboarders and has a full calendar of local and international events.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20PE%20boat%20cruise.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algoa Bay Yacht Club has hosted numerous continental and international sailing events including the J22 Worlds, Hobie 16 Worlds, Optimist Africans and Mirror Worlds. The 2007 Mirror Worlds were unique in that the same team won the Pre-Worlds regatta AND the World Championships; and it was an all-women team - Brits Anna Mackenzie and Holly Scott in Simply Gorgeous - to boot. (In sailing, men and women compete on an equal footing in most races.)&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 60th 505 World Championships which will be held at Algoa Bay Yacht Club in March and South Africa's oldest offshore sailing race - the Vasco Da Gama - will finish off of the Shark Rock Pier at Hobie Beach (a great spot to watch the colourful sails year round) for the next three years.&nbsp;The 2015 race will start in Durban on 25 April and yachts to are expected to finish in Algoa Bay between 27 and 30 April.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20Andrew_Fourie_Chad_Bilsbury.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobie Beach also plays host to various sailing and beach volleyball events as well as the annual Splash Festival and the swimming leg of the Standard Bank Ironman \u2013 both held in April.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beachfront promenade makes access to the beaches easy. One of the most popular is the Blue Flag King's Beach, a fabulous stretch of golden sand that extends from the harbour wall to Humewood. Since it offers safe swimming it\u2019s popular with swimmers and bodysurfers while \u2018The Pipe\u2019 at Pollock Beach is a magnet for surfers. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20PE%20Promenade.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A catamaran cruise out with Raggy Charters is an absolute must-do to appreciate PE\u2019s magnificent coastal location and marine life. Three types of dolphin (bottlenose, common and humpback), Cape fur seals, Cape gannets, sharks, Bryde\u2019s and minke whales are seen year round, while during the whale watching season between early June and early January migratory humpback and southern right whales are found in the bay, often with calves. Trips out to see the African penguins on St Croix Island - the largest breeding colony of these endangered birds in the world \u2013 pelagic bird trips and cruises to Bird Island are among the cruise options.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20Diving%20PE%20HAERLEM%20Sakkie%20du%20Preez.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little publicised fact is that Port Elizabeth offer some of the best, and most reliable scuba diving in the country thanks to a top-notch dive school, Pro-Dive and two very different dive destinations - the more sheltered Algoa Bay and the aptly named Wildside to the west of Cape Recife. Nutrient-rich cold water coming up from the Cape meets the warm waters brought down the east coast by the Agulhas Current in the making for a diverse marine life. There\u2019s plenty for both novice and advanced divers including pretty coral and sponge-encrusted reefs, deep pinnacles, shipwrecks, shark encounters and wonderful little critters. A bonus of diving the Wildside is that the boat ride out offers spectacular views of the bay and a good chance of spotting dolphins and whales.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20Diving%20Thunderbolt-%20Michelle%20v%20Aardt.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hikers and trail runners are spoilt for choice. With its dramatic surrounding mountains, magnificent coastline and green urban spaces PE has a wealth of hiking trails from easy strolls along the promenade to stiff walks in the nearby nature reserves; and most of them are free!&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top trails include the magnificent Sacramento trail through the Schoenmakerskop-Sardinia Bay Nature Reserve. A large cannon salvaged from the wreck of the Sacramento, a Portuguese galleon that ran onto the rocks in 1647, marks the trailhead, then the easy 8km trail follows the coast to the lovely sandy beach of Cannon Bay and on to Sardinia Bay - another great swimming spot so pack your bathers. From there the path climbs to the ridgeline and completes the circle through dune vegetation and fynbos back to the start. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20PE%20Hiking%202%20copy.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another stunner, the easy 9km Roseate Tern Hiking Trail, winds its way through the beautiful Cape Recife Nature Reserve on the southern tip of Algoa Bay. With its attractive black and white lighthouse, diverse birdlife, pristine fynbos, rock pools and unspoilt beaches the circular hike is a fantastic family outing that is very popular with birders.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best short trails is the Humpback Dolphin Trail (an extension of the beachfront promenade) from Flat Rocks to Pollock Beach. Open to walkers, runners and cyclists it is lit up at night, so is great for an evening stroll. Most of the trail is along a raised boardwalk and the high vantage on the dunes means that there are superb views over the rocky coastline from the walkway. Keep your eyes peeled for dolphins, including the trail\u2019s namesake, and a host of sea birds including African black oystercatchers and both Caspian and common terns.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20NJ%20PE%20Hiking1.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the hiking trails can also be explored on two wheels while the purpose-built Norm Hudlin Mountain-Bike Trails in the Kragga Kamma area offer trails to suit all levels of ability. And then there\u2019s fishing, 4x4, game viewing and a host of other adventures in the city and its environs. But these should do you for starters.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/9140\"&gt;Raggy Charters&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2230\"&gt;Big Blue Ocean Tour&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1470\"&gt;Port Elizabeth Diving&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3068\"&gt;Sacramento Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3067\"&gt;Roseate Tern Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/3709\"&gt;Humpback Dolphin Trail&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/2128\"&gt;Norm-Hudlin MTB Trail&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-1\/PE%20PE%20Roseate%20tern%20Pic%20Lloyd%20Edwards.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9003\" class=\"publisher-2809 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/road-nowhere\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Road to Nowhere  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Road to Nowhere\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.hsm.co.za\/magazines\/details\/cape-etc' target='_blank' style='background-color: #ffffff' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/capeetclogo.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/McGregor%201.jpg?itok=eKg45VVh\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/road-nowhere\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/road-nowhere\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/road-nowhere&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/McGregor%201.jpg&amp;description=Road to Nowhere\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/road-nowhere\" data-text=\"Road to Nowhere\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/road-nowhere\" data-title=\"Road to Nowhere\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Jan 2015&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Jade Cooke, Pics Kendall-Leigh Nash\/HSMimages&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the ducks\u2019 fault. A snowy-feathered, orange-beaked congregation of them was gathered far too picturesquely around the pond at Lord\u2019s Guest Lodge for us to simply pass by after finishing breakfast. Many snaps of the smartphone camera later, we were running quite behind schedule for the blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it McGregor Saturday morning market.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Don\u2019t be silly!\u2019 admonishes Heidi Muller, our impromptu welcome wagon from the McGregor Tourism office, as we rush on to the village green spilling apologies. \u2018You\u2019re on McGregor time now \u2013 there\u2019s no such thing as late.\u2019 She\u2019s right, of course. All of South Africa\u2019s small towns offer a much-needed return to the slow lane, but McGregor has it down to a fine art.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we\u2019d arrived the previous evening just before sunset, not a soul was about. Laid out in a neat grid just five streets wide, the town itself took all of 30 minutes to meander around, including stopping to admire all the beautifully preserved Victorian cottages and iceberg roses in every second garden. A tumbleweed floating down Voortrekker Street, the main drag, made me wonder if this wasn\u2019t some elaborate village-wide practical joke. Then, on the next corner, three teenage boys who wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place at a nightclub were racing home-made go-karts down the hill, the anachronism so much more convincing than any marketing spiel about slow living ever could be.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/McGregor%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison to the previous night\u2019s desolation, this morning\u2019s market is practically bustling. In the shadow of the town\u2019s church steeple we load up with home-made lemon cordial, Jerusalem artichokes, tree tomatoes and fresh greens, labneh, p\u00e2t\u00e9, huge bags of pecans, a jar of honeyed almonds and freshly brewed ginger beer. The latter we can\u2019t help but pop open and sip as Heidi tells us how the town, originally called Lady Grey after the Cape governor\u2019s wife, was renamed in 1906 thanks to parishioners of the church we\u2019re standing beside, who wanted to honour their retiring pastor, one Reverend Andrew McGregor.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 10 am seems a little indiscreet to be visiting wineries, we do the next best thing: an organic, pressed grape juice tasting at Villagers, a bright, quirky little shop on Voortrekker that also functions as an outlet for Rhebokskraal Olive Estate, which is just outside of town. Pinotage, Cabernet and Hanepoot juice all feature, and you can while away a goodly amount of time with the array of tapenades and olive products available for tasting.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the road, Edna Fourie is opening up shop. McGregor is home to its fair share of artists, and its sweet 10-stop art route includes Edna\u2019s gallery. A successful and prolific oil painter, Edna made the decision some years ago to cease exhibiting all over the country, which she felt was diluting the message of her work, and instead launch her exclusive gallery in McGregor. The light-filled space is now home to a permanent display of her work as well as revolving sale pieces, including installation and sculpture.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/McGregor%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little off the beaten Voortrekker track is Millstone Pottery, where Paul de Jongh can be found at the wheel every day of the week, surrounded by hundreds of his creations. One of few potters in South Africa who wood-fire their work, Paul will happily chat to you about his love for the medium, the beautiful unpredictability of working with fire, and the perfection of a flaw.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half an hour later, we\u2019ve given up on appearances and are bumping along the dirt road to Lord\u2019s Wines. One of five estates on the relatively small McGregor wine route (the others being Buffalo Creek, Kingsriver, McGregor Winery and Tanagra), Lord\u2019s enjoys a cool climate thanks to its position 500m above sea level, &nbsp;and produces some award-winning pinot noir as a result. We\u2019re lucky enough to be met by owner Jacie Oosthuizen, who treats us to a barrel tasting \u2013 the only downside being that we can\u2019t take any of his delicious oak-aged Shiraz home with us.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were you to follow the road further, past Lord\u2019s, you\u2019d get ... nowhere. Between 1865 and 1880, work was begun on a road to connect McGregor to Greyton, on the other side of the Boesmanskloof Pass. They didn\u2019t get very far (to put it mildly) before running out of money, and though an attempt was made in the \u201920s to revive the project, it has never been completed. To leave McGregor, you need to do an about-face and head back the way you came, down Voortrekker and along the mountain-flanked road to Robertson. It\u2019s a delightful notion, really, that road to nowhere, and one so fitting with this shy yet bountiful town. McGregor is the end of the road \u2013 at one and the same time a welcoming hearth and an invitation to wander off the beaten path in search of something a little different. If you\u2019re feeling energetic, there is a footpath leading from the unfinished road to a lovely little waterfall, or you can hike the Boesmanskloof Pass over into Greyton.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/McGregor%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a wine tasting behind us and rain on the horizon, we opt not to hike today. Heading back into town, one of the busiest and most central attractions is, somewhat incongruously, a spiritual haven. A lovely accommodation option from which to explore the area, Temenos is probably best known for its silent retreats and wellness options, from massage and yoga to the more esoteric jin shin jyutsu and rune reading. The estate occupies an entire block, most of which is dedicated to beautiful gardens of the meandering path variety. Interspersed in the lush foliage are benches for contemplation and \u2013 in typically open-minded Temenos fashion \u2013 places of worship for a variety of religions, including a tiny chapel with blue windows and purple walls called Temore, the inner temple of the heart. After a long soul-restoring wander in the gardens and an hour\u2019s deep tissue massage under the healing hands of Deidre Scott-Rogerson, my own heart\u2019s temple must surely be filled with song.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much art and culture can be thirsty work, but if there\u2019s one thing a small town does well, it\u2019s a cosy pub, and McGregor\u2019s Old Post Office doesn\u2019t disappoint. There\u2019s an impressive selection of whiskies (likely a nod to the town\u2019s tenuous Scottish connections) but we opt instead for Saggy Stone, a fruity local craft brew.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018It\u2019s my birthday, you know,\u2019 John, the grey-haired Manchurian proprietor, tells us as we settle on stools, pints in hand. \u2018Let\u2019s drink to that.\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A swallow.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Only joking, no it\u2019s not. But maybe we can drink to it not being my birthday. We drink to everythin\u2019 aroun\u2019 here: birthdays, funerals, weddings, divorces, Tuesday...\u2019&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/McGregor%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking may be a fond hobby, but food is taken quite seriously in McGregor. If you\u2019re here for but a weekend, phone ahead to book dinner at Tebaldi\u2019s (attached to Temenos) and Karoux, because in true small-town style, both have extremely limited seating.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The philosophy at the latter is a return to the time when the family table always had space for one more, and the cosy dining room couldn\u2019t be more in keeping with it. Then there\u2019s ex-Capetonian couple Aim\u00e9e van Hecke and Ryan Josten, who run the operation almost single-handedly \u2013 think of them as Karoux\u2019s mom and dad.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u2018Luckily we have a lady in the kitchen who washes the dishes at the end of the night!\u2019 says Aimee, who manages front of house (including waiting on the handful of tables) while Ryan makes the magic happen in the kitchen \u2013 small-town feel, big-city flavour. They have a weekly changing menu, and not just because blackboards are in vogue: every Wednesday, the couple visits the surrounding farms to source the best possible local produce for dinner service Thursday to Monday, which is almost always fully booked.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A generous portion of mussels and a superb duck confit later, I can\u2019t help but compare the lively buzz of Karoux to the deserted streets and shut-up doors of our arrival. As it turns out, most of McGregor had been tucked up at Wahnfried, a private house on the edge of town that functions as a cultural centre, for the Friday night film screening.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the thing about McGregor. There are no bright lights, no aggressive marketing campaigns, no in-your-face tourism infrastructure. Half the time you can\u2019t even find the town\u2019s denizens. But as you scratch the surface, its layers \u2013 and its people \u2013 start to reveal themselves to you.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the road to nowhere, then nowhere\u2019s where I want to be.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/McGregor%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"771\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;LINGER LONGER&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STAY&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by rolling fynbos as far as the eye can see, with McGregor twinkling in the distance, &lt;strong&gt;Lord\u2019s Guest Lodge&lt;\/strong&gt; still somehow feels like an escape to the Scottish highlands. Choose between the four executive free-standing cottages or book a luxury room in the main house, all of which come standard with fireplaces to keep the winter chill out. If you\u2019d prefer to be in the village proper, the self-catering 26B Van Reenan (the clue is in the name) sleeps five and offers a modern interior, beautiful gardens and a lap pool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;023 625 1881, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/lordsguestlodge.co.za\"&gt;http:\/\/lordsguestlodge.co.za&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;\/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(All accommodation in the area can be booked free of charge through &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.tourismmcgregor.co.za\"&gt;www.tourismmcgregor.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;.) &lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TASTE&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A boutique wine farm just outside the village,&lt;strong&gt; Tanagra&lt;\/strong&gt;\u2019s real appeal is its \u2018marc\u2019 \u2013 what would be called grappa, if the Italians hadn\u2019t claimed sole rights to the name.

Good for you, but not exactly Christmas pudding!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, we have decided to make it a little easier on ourselves. We have chosen a resolution that should not only by be easy to uphold, but fun to boot. Our resolution is to be kind to our best friends. Although, it is perhaps closer to the truth to say: kinder than usual.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have had these two little mutts for nine years, and over that time they have become an inseparable part of the Nightjar household.

pics courtesy &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/theunlimited.co.za\/twinpeaks\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Unlimited&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conquer a mountain that has never been climbed in conditions that are brutally cold \u2013 is it sheer madness or is it inspirational? Whatever your view, in January 2015 it will become a reality for a group of five South Africans when they set out for Antarctica to make history by climbing both Mount Vinson \u2013 the highest peak on the frozen continent \u2013 as well as an unnamed peak that has never been climbed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Peaks Expedition is the brainchild of the founders of the financial services company The Unlimited; Iain, Zack and Barney Buchan. The father and sons team will be joined by veteran arctic explorer Dr Peter Berning and Ken Watt. The five adventurers will first tackle Mount Vinson, the coldest and most remote of the world-renowned Seven Summits, then take on a virgin peak in Antarctica\u2019s Ellsworth Mountains.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daunting quest to tackle two Antarctica summits was born during the team\u2019s successful journey to the South Pole two years ago. &nbsp;Iain Buchan explains: \u201cDuring our trek, we knew that we had to return to Antarctica. It is a cruel and harsh environment but within that sits a pristine beauty unlike anywhere on Earth. Trekking to the South Pole is a trial that pushes your mind and body to its limits, but Mount Vinson is the ultimate test. So we have taken up the challenge and decided that whilst we are there, we will really push ourselves by adding an unclimbed peak into the mix too!\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Antarctic%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is this mindset of pushing boundaries that became the foundation on which The Unlimited has been built. Twenty years later, it is a highly successful direct marketing business that is invested in developing leaders. \u201cWe have always been a \u2018show and not tell\u2019 business and hence, we will be forging new pathways on the most extreme continent on Earth. On our trek to the South Pole we learnt that leadership really comes to the fore in such extreme circumstances. When you take yourself out of your comfort zone, that\u2019s when you really stretch and grow. That\u2019s why we are going back \u2013 to force our own personal growth to the next level,\u201d Buchan explains.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an icy wilderness such as Antarctica, people underestimate the mental strength that is required \u2013 there are no trees, no animals, just endless white ice, average temperatures of -30\u00b0C and 24 hours of daylight. Your physical preparation is the only thing you can control.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unlimited Twin Peaks Expedition team have therefore taken their fitness very seriously. Through a tough training regime, they are all stronger than ever before. Buchan says: &nbsp;\u201cThis is not a trip where you can build fitness as you climb so the whole team has been training 4 to 5 times a week, pulling 20kg tyres, kettle bell training in the gym and climbing mountains whenever possible. Peter and myself have not been as fit are we are now since we played rugby for UCT in the 1970s! Even with this level of preparation though, we still expect both summits to be a huge challenge for everyone in the team.\u201d &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 4 892m, Mount Vinson should not be a difficult peak to climb; but the combination of its remoteness, high winds and extremely low temperatures make the peak an incredibly tough climb. Even colder than Mount Everest, the average temperature for Mount Vinson can plummet to around -50\u00b0C and these biting wind-chill temperatures are the greatest threat to climbers.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cDepending on conditions, the Mount Vinson climb can take anywhere from four days to two weeks. Climbing is slow as the terrain is pocketed with lethal crevasses, so we will have to be roped together all the time. Frequent breaks are essential as we will also be dragging 20kg sledges with our equipment and sufficient provisions for the 14 days,\u201d says Buchan. \u201cThe second peak is expected to take around four days but it will be a very different climb as the terrain is completely unknown, virgin territory.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Steph Bester, CEO of The Unlimited, the company has put its weight behind the expedition as it dovetails with the business ethos. &nbsp;\u201cThis amazing attempt is extreme enough for us to put our name to \u2013 we believe in doing the extraordinary and these adventurers will achieve just that as The Unlimited Twin Peaks Expedition will push the limits of ordinary human endurance,\u201d stated Bester.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Unlimited Twin Peaks Expedition will start on Friday, 26 December 2014 when the team will travel from South Africa to Puntas Arenas in southern Chile. After a compulsory briefing on Antarctica, they will take a six-hour flight to the frozen continent followed by an immediate transfer to the Vinson Base Camp. After a couple of days acclimatising, weather permitting, they will start their ascent on 5 January 2015.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To follow the amazing journey of The Unlimited Twin Peaks Expedition and the regular updates from the team, visit &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.theunlimited.co.za\/twinpeaks\"&gt;www.theunlimited.co.za\/twinpeaks&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9022\" class=\"publisher-1944 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/straight-horse%E2%80%99s-mouth\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Straight from the Horse\u2019s Mouth&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Straight from the Horse\u2019s Mouth  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Straight from the Horse\u2019s Mouth\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/The-Intrepid-Explorer-logo2.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Anna%201.jpg?itok=NLxybrEI\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/straight-horse\u2019s-mouth\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/straight-horse\u2019s-mouth\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/straight-horse\u2019s-mouth&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Anna%201.jpg&amp;description=Straight from the Horse\u2019s Mouth\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/straight-horse\u2019s-mouth\" data-text=\"Straight from the Horse\u2019s Mouth\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/straight-horse\u2019s-mouth\" data-title=\"Straight from the Horse\u2019s Mouth\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Dec 2014&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;By Shan Routledge&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us, as children, would\u2019ve wished we could speak to animals: hear the whispers of owls in the night, the frantic chattering of monkeys at play, the solemn wisdom of majestic elephants or just the (hopefully) adoring love of our dog. Slowly we lost this yearning to communicate with our environment and allowed the sounds to fade into the background \u2013 but Anna Breytenbach can hear them loud and clear, and she\u2019s going to deliver their message.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\u201cThe animals often appeal to me for help, but I have to tell them that help isn\u2019t coming.\u201d&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I saw Anna\u2019s documentary, &lt;em&gt;The Animal Communicator&lt;\/em&gt;, I was sceptical of the idea. How could she have this ability? But as I watched the film, I was slowly won over to the idea that we have simply forgotten our innate connection with the world around us.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I shed a tear or three as sanctuary owner Jurg Olsen, who had asked Anna for help with his black leopard named \u201cDiablo\u201d (\u201cDevil\u201d in Spanish), broke down in sobs when the animal emerged from his shelter to greet him. There was no way Anna could have known beforehand the information she got from Diablo (who was renamed \u201cSpirit\u201d) about his abusive past, and Olsen was astounded by the difference she was able to make.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professional animal communicator, Anna has dedicated her life to bridging the gap between human and non-human communication. Whether it be through communication, guidance or mentoring, her goal is to create increased awareness, empathy, compassion and mutual understanding. The animals have something to say, and Anna is listening.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Anna%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Did you always have this connection with animals?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent my high school holidays volunteering at the local vet or animal shelter, so I always had a care and compassion for animals \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t aware of any information passing between us at all. In animal care situations, there was always emotion passing between us, but nothing that would stand out to me as actual data or actual communication.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only later in life when I was on a tracking course in America and - because I grew up in South Africa and not in North America - I had no idea what had made the footprints I was looking at. No matter how clear the print in the mud was, I couldn\u2019t identify to which animal it belonged.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the tracking guide said: \u201cJust close your eyes and hold your hand over the print.\u201d I didn\u2019t have any better ideas, so that is what I did \u2013 and as I did, I got this distinct image of quite a pointy sort of dog face and greyer than our jackal at home, but not as red as a fox. I described this to the guide and he said: \u201cYes, that is a coyote.\u201d I promptly asked, \u201cWhat is a coyote?\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What\u2019s more, this happened at about eight in the morning when I saw this face against the backdrop of a hollowed-out hole in a sandbank; after about two hours of actually physically trailing the tracks, we found the exact spot I had seen in this mental image. The expert trackers were able to determine that the tracks were about two hours old, which meant I had been getting real-time information at eight in the morning. I was actually connecting with that coyote where it was at that present moment. That is when I realised it was a real-life connection.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It must have been quite a shock to receive such an image?&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very much so. I had no placing for it in my mind or in my upbringing or in my belief system. If it wasn\u2019t so provable by the actual tracks I was seeing, I might not have had to accept it was real. I honestly would have thought I was going mad and seeing things, but some research proved I wasn\u2019t the only one.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was then pushed to follow it further and to research telepathic interspecies communication, which led me to study through the Assisi International Animal Institute and follow my intuition and passion.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Anna%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do you think you have developed this ability when the rest of humanity has been left so unaware of the connection?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone can do this. Everyone does do this, normally, in respect to other humans. The anomaly telepathy, or intuition, works between people who are very close \u2013 best friends or sibling \u2013 so we can all do it.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If 10 people had all tried to sense that track, they might not all have gotten the same image or received the information in the same way or strength, but they all would have connected with the coyote in some way.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the weekend workshops I run around the world, 100% of participants have success in receiving information from an animal telepathically.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So anyone can learn to engage in this manner?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, anyone can do it because it is more about remembering than learning; it is part of the blueprint of our minds; it is how our brains were designed. And it is how all the ancient cultures, from which all modern humans derive, have connected with their animals, landscapes and surrounds. It is part of our brain; we just have to place our attention there again and remember to use our skills \u2013 or our sixth sense, so to speak. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You are very involved in conservation \u2013 this must be a very rewarding use of your talent. With which organisations do you work?&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is both very rewarding and very challenging. There are no organisations with which I work because conservation managers, wildlife managers and park officials don\u2019t believe in telepathic communication. Because they come from the very biological and scientific study of animals, they do not embrace an energetic communication.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centres that are beginning to contact me to assist them, but mostly my &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;\/em&gt; work with conservation is with individuals who, when everything else more ordinary has failed, reach out to the telepathic community to try and solve a very serious issue or better understand an animal\u2019s behaviour.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Anna%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m currently working with a couple of elephants that are trying to break out of various reserves in South Africa \u2013 trying to understand what their traumas are and trying to have the humans hear what they need in order to persuade them to stay. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work with some re-wilding projects where big cats are rescued from the canned breeding and canned hunting industry, and in some cases are given the opportunity to live wild or semi-wild again. It is a long, dedicated effort on the part of their carers to re-wild them, and there we use telecommunication to try and help educate the lions about how to be safe out in the wild and to manage the process \u2013 check in with them about how they are feeling. It is very difficult work. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also work with baboons that are under serious threat throughout southern Africa. The authorities on the Cape Peninsula are basically exterminating them, with more than 50 having been killed this year alone. It can be very frustrating and challenging when I\u2019m constantly receiving \u2013 directly from the baboons \u2013 their real feelings of distress and panic and lack of space; that can be challenging because I know nothing is going to change politically or management-wise.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals often appeal to me for help, but I have to tell them that help isn\u2019t coming. Quite often it is a bit of a stalemate situation when I hear how animals are feeling and what they need, but the humans to whom I give the feedback don\u2019t care what the animals need. I then have to go back to the animals and say, \u201cSorry, it\u2019s not going to happen\u201d. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the journey of being an animal communicator is having to be very clear within myself about what the animals\u2019 emotions are versus what my emotions may be or my reactions to what they are going through. I have to be very clear that I don\u2019t project onto them or anthropomorphise, and to relay only what they are thinking or feeling, without clouding the picture with my own opinions on the matter.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the training requires you to do a lot of work on yourself \u2013 and always keep working on yourself. I always have to clear the channel I\u2019m in, so that I can be true to the animals\u2019 authentic message \u2013 not even unwittingly clouding it with my judgments and preconceptions. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Anna%205.jpg\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you get much resistance from other professionals such as conservationists?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot of resistance from park managers and wildlife reserves, mainly because they objectify animals and see them only as resources on an asset register. Most of southern Africa is an industry of breeding and trading wildlife, so they are not really interested in the emotional wellbeing of the animals or their environmental enrichment. They don\u2019t care that when you have to move adult giraffe off of a reserve, there are no trucks big enough to take the males, so they just shoot them and take only the females and the youngsters.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn\u2019t suit wildlife reserves to truly know an animal\u2019s thoughts and feelings, preferences and needs. This would make it more difficult to trade them and treat them purely as resources. It\u2019s what suits the industry, the safaris, sports hunting, human ideas of what would be pleasing to stock a reserve with; it\u2019s what pleases human ideas of rarity such as black springbok and white lions \u2013 all based on human aesthetics and human need, with little regard for the animals.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is sometimes very difficult to express what animals are thinking or feeling to authorities and people, but I have a moral obligation. If I have heard something from an animal, it is my duty to pass it on unedited. If I\u2019m worried about how I\u2019m going to come across, then it\u2019s me getting in the way of expressing the animal\u2019s authentic truth. If I say less than the full truth to people, then I\u2019m denying the people the opportunity to consider another perspective. Often I\u2019m the \u2018messenger who gets shot\u2019, but that is just the fine print of what comes with my job.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do you deal with critics and naysayers?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking, so I don\u2019t have to deal with criticism; the science of how this works speaks for itself, and I refer people to that if they question it.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try and invite people to have their own experience, but I\u2019m not out to try and force anyone into it \u2013 they either want to connect or they don\u2019t. People are scared because it\u2019s not happening in the realm of their five senses, and people fear what they cannot see.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the most interesting thing you have ever been told by an animal?&nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quite recently, I was communicating with baboons that frequently raid a vegetable garden on a farm, and the humans called me in to ask them please to stop. The baboons conveyed they were confused about the fact that they saw humans coming into the vegetable garden, picking the best and the ripest vegetables when they were not hungry, and then leaving with the produce \u2013 which they wouldn\u2019t even eat. The baboons said they followed the humans and saw them taking the produce indoors and putting this wonderful bounty in strange cupboards, leaving it lying around inside. Often, some of that food would go bad before the humans would even eat it, which the baboons thought was very wasteful. I found it very interesting and refreshing to see the baboon perspective on human behaviour. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cook on the farm admitted to being mildly freaked out by two male baboons watching him as he prepared food for the staff. He would even close the blinds because he was so disturbed, and this sort of corroborated what the baboons had been saying about how they were interested in what was happening to the food. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal communication is about finding out what the animals\u2019 needs and desires are, what motivates their behaviour \u2013 and then coming up with a compromise so that there can be a peaceful co-existence between animals and humans.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Intrepid Explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.intrepidexplorer.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Intrepid%20Cover%20Dec.jpg?itok=fZr7i7kn\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;The Intrepid explorer&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-8704\" class=\"publisher-2745 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/sliver-simplicity\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;A Sliver of Simplicity&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    A Sliver of Simplicity  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"A Sliver of Simplicity\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.aa.co.za\/shop\/aa-traveller' target='_blank' style='background-color: #000000' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/AA-traveller1.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Wild%20Coast%201.jpg?itok=l0AtSptB\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sliver-simplicity\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sliver-simplicity\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sliver-simplicity&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Wild%20Coast%201.jpg&amp;description=A Sliver of Simplicity\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sliver-simplicity\" data-text=\"A Sliver of Simplicity\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/sliver-simplicity\" data-title=\"A Sliver of Simplicity\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Dec 2014&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words &amp; pics Mark Samuel&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more than 20 years, nothing had changed. Okay, perhaps this time around there were some locals with cellphones here and there hunting for that elusive one bar of signal (mobile phones, thankfully, didn\u2019t exist in the \u201990s). But, besides that, I\u2019d stepped back into one of my barefoot&nbsp;childhood holidays on the Wild Coast.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two decades had passed and the place was still the same: remote, electricity-less (or Eskom-less, at least), gravel-roaded, thatch-hutted and graced with endless unspoilt golden beaches \u2026 All so simple, and yet breathtakingly beautiful. And, like my dad always did, I was&nbsp;sporting a ragged beard that was to become even shaggier during my stay. Not shaving was an unspoken pact my father shared with his mates during our annual Transkei winter holidays back in the day. Now it was my turn to continue the tradition.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exquisite sliver of Eastern Cape coastline is a region of contrasts. Geographically, it is pure secluded splendour; socio-economically, it is strikingly poor. So, when I heard a small group of locals were involved in a community-run lodge in the heart of the Wild Coast, I had to check it out&nbsp;for myself.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulungula eco-lodge serves two roles. It\u2019s a rustic, unpretentious spot where South Africans and foreigners alike can immerse themselves in the natural beauty and laidback lifestyle of the region; and it\u2019s a small business that provides opportunities for members of the surrounding community to involve themselves in tourism, earning an income and providing for their families. I certainly didn\u2019t need any more reasons to visit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if materialising from my memory bank right before my eyes, the roads down to the Wild Coast \u2013 at least once you turn off the tar road that heads to Coffee Bay \u2013 are, well, wild. They form a convoluted network of gravel routes that meander past vast tracts of open land, traditional Xhosa huts and kraals, groups of adults and children, goats, dogs, cattle and stout little roaming black pigs. The scenes outside the car window represent a way of life that\u2019s changed little over the years.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Wild%20Coast%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling Bulungula a \u2018lodge\u2019 really stretches the definition of the word. Don\u2019t go there expecting chocolates on your pillow at night \u2013 it\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s more of a backpackers, blended with a healthy dollop of local-style hospitality. Accommodation takes the form of permanent tents on timber platforms in the coastal forest (just about overlooking the ocean) or traditional dung-floored and thatch-roofed Xhosa huts (each with a single solar-powered electric light), or you can set up your own tent. Ablutions are rudimentary \u2013 indoor compost toilets (which, admittedly, take a degree of getting used to) basins for tooth brushing, hand washing and face splashing, and one of the highlights of my stay \u2013 rocket showers. Your eyebrows are raised, I\u2019m sure. Let\u2019s just say the&nbsp;components include paraffin, matches and toilet paper for ignition, and around seven minutes of hot-water bliss.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your choice of lodgings, be sure to keep your luggage light, as this place is so idyllically remote the road doesn\u2019t quite reach it. Upon summiting the last of many, many hills on your journey to the coast, you descend into a valley, from where the smudge of a cluster of buildings in the distance is almost out of sight. A fenced-off parking area awaits, where a security guard keeps watch for the duration of your stay. Everything here is perfectly safe, I\u2019m told. It\u2019s then a roughly 700m walk along a grassy track to Bulungula, which is tucked away behind the&nbsp;coastal forest and just up the bank from and overlooking a small tidal estuary. The entire set-up looks northwards along a stretch of golden beach which culminates in towering, grassy hills in the distance, glazed with dark, jagged rocks, against which the fierce ocean swells crash day and night, and have done so for millennia. The scene is classic Wild Coast \u2013 and probably the most fundamental reason anyone should visit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can self-cater, provided your cooler box co-operates. The communal kitchen is open to all guests and you can stow a few perishables in the fridges. Alternatively, buy your meals from the lodge; you tick off which ones you\u2019d like and, come breakfast, lunch or dinnertime, you\u2019ll certainly&nbsp;not go hungry. Drinks can be purchased in the same manner \u2013 it\u2019s effectively an honesty system, with you settling your tab just before you leave. Isn\u2019t that refreshing?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Wild%20Coast%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Bulungula, you can keep yourself busy in two ways. Either sign up for one of a multitude of guided activities or head off on your own mission. Our five days were a blend of relaxed (read: lazy) mornings spent watching the waves crash, with coffee and rusks in hand; long beach&nbsp;hikes (with daypacks filled with bananas, peanuts and a few refreshments of the hops variety); swimming in the estuary; and a brave bid to surf the enticing waves in the bay. Day hikes are mesmerising \u2013 the views of remote landscape and wild ocean really are like nowhere else in South Africa (in this case, a promise, not just a turn of phrase).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, letting someone else plan your day for your can also be fun. While the people of Nqileni village have 40% ownership in the lodge itself, the small businesses that offer various activities to the guests are 100% community owned. You can go horse riding, canoeing or fishing, or even try your hand at wood-carving, baking, sewing and cooking traditional dishes. Or, if you\u2019d like some pampering, two of the local women have been trained as masseuses \u2013 the knots in my&nbsp;shoulders really appreciated the treatment! (There\u2019s a small cost involved for each activity you sign up for. I found it was important to ask, as all of the options and arrangement weren\u2019t clear.)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulungula is a clich\u00e9d backpackers in many ways \u2013 murals on the walls, djembe drumming in the evenings and a cosmopolitan mix of accents from guests come dinnertime \u2013 but that\u2019s an observation rather than a criticism, as it all fits in so seamlessly in this tucked-away spot and definitely doesn\u2019t feel contrived. The \u2018eco\u2019 in the name is also authentic. Here, it means using less, impacting less, harnessing what\u2019s naturally supplied to us and re-using \u2013 perhaps a notion we all&nbsp;need a little more of in our daily lives.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wild Coast is a region every South African should visit (well, more than just visit \u2013 explore, adventure in, fall in love with!) But arrive without your ego, without preconceived expectations and get ready to be nudged out of your comfort zone and into a different, simpler way of living.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;GOOD TO KNOW&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to go&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wild Coast is an all-year-round destination, however, it can receive a lot of rain during the middle of summer (December and January). Winter is chilly at night, but the days can be picture perfect. Autumn is probably the best time to visit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting there&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the Coffee Bay turnoff from the N2, 15km south (on the East London side) of Mthatha. It\u2019s then 50 km on tar, before taking a right turn. Another 16.5km on tar will lead you to a right turn, where about 35km of gravel road begins. From there, it\u2019s best to follow the detailed directions on the Bulungula website. If you drive slowly, you can make the trip in an ordinary 2WD vehicle.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to take&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pack relaxed clothing \u2013 a few T-shirts, shorts, a pair of old jeans, flip-flops, trainers and a swimming costume. No one will really care how you dress. And don\u2019t forget some warm clothes for the evenings and early mornings. Add in a towel and a torch. Also take all medication you might&nbsp;need \u2013 there aren\u2019t any shops close by. You can bring your own food and self-cater or enjoy three meals a day supplied by the lodge (prices are very reasonable).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accommodation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Bulungula you can stay in the permanent safari tents (which have double beds), the Xhosa huts&nbsp;(with a mix of single and\/or double beds) or you can camp (in your own three-person or smaller&nbsp;tent, no camper vehicles permitted).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make contact&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enquire about bookings, or for detailed driving directions, get hold of Bulungula directly. Call 047 577 8900 or 083 391 5525, email &lt;a href=\"mailto:paradise@bulungula.com\"&gt;paradise@bulungula.com&lt;\/a&gt; or check out their website at &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.bulungula.com\"&gt;www.bulungula.com&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Holiday wheels&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if designed with this trip in mind, the new Peugeot 2008 is a blend of sizeable hatch-cum- SUV, with just the right amount of off-road ability. On loan from Peugeot, this spritely petrol derivative got us from Cape Town, down through the rough gravel routes of the Wild Coast, and back, with ease.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn\u2019t complain once, and in fact seemed to come into its own when the tar ended. I flicked the dial on the centre console to \u2018all-terrain\u2019 and let the feisty little crossover do the rest. The 1.6L engine is economical (we averaged 7.3 L\/100km over nearly 3 000km), often covering vast distances at 120 km\/h on cruise control.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our surfboards sat comfortably on the roof on a set of Thule roof racks that quickly and conveniently attached to the 2008\u2019s steadfast roof rails. There are a selection of racks in the Thule range, so you\u2019re sure to find the ones perfectly designed for your vehicle.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re lucky enough to lead a lifestyle of city driving interspersed with regular adventure, this is the car-roof-rack combo for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.peugeot.co.za\"&gt;www.peugeot.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.thule.co.za\"&gt;www.thule.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.aa.co.za\/shop\/aa-traveller\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;AA Traveller&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.aa.co.za\/shop\/aa-traveller\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Autumn%202014~3_0.jpg?itok=JN9a24Xy\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;AA Traveller&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-9015\" class=\"publisher-1337 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/slackline-over-victoria-falls\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Slackline Over Victoria Falls &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Slackline Over Victoria Falls   &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Slackline Over Victoria Falls \" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='' target='_blank' style='background-color: #439bae' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/Magazine%20Strip%20Nightjar%202_0.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%201_0.jpg?itok=_KsvCQvM\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/slackline-over-victoria-falls\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/slackline-over-victoria-falls\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/slackline-over-victoria-falls&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%201_0.jpg&amp;description=Slackline Over Victoria Falls \" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/slackline-over-victoria-falls\" data-text=\"Slackline Over Victoria Falls \" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/slackline-over-victoria-falls\" data-title=\"Slackline Over Victoria Falls \"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Dec 2014&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Reinhard Kleindl, pics Jacques Marais - adidas.com\/outdoor&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roar is deafening. Chilly clouds of fog waft around me, water is running down my face, collecting on my chin, soaking my T-shirt. Behind me is a wall of people, all full of anticipation. In front of me is a fence of interwoven brushwood. Beyond it, the landscape falls steeply away, into a hazy, black void. The other side is so far away that I can barely make it out.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carefully, I climb over the fence, walk towards the cliff edge: suddenly, I am face to face with one of the largest waterfalls in the world.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am in Zimbabwe, a country which is completely alien to me as a resident of the Alps: dry, sandy, vast. Ramrod-straight roads run for endless kilometres through lightly wooded areas, past termite mounds, dried-up riverbeds, small settlements of thatched mud huts and dirt football pitches whose goalposts have no nets. A lot of land for not many people.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the heart of this dry landscape flows the Zambezi, Africa\u2019s fourth-longest river, a blue artery.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, there\u2019s an abyss which seems to appear from nowhere. Over time, Zambezi has formed a broad delta, more like a lake than a river, with countless green islands, before plunging suddenly downwards, over a width of just over a mile. A hundred metres below the water regroups and continues on its way through a vast canyon. The lazy flow has become a raging torrent. And the place where this unceremonious change takes place is considered one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the world: Victoria Falls, Mosi Oa Tunya in the national language, \u201cthe smoke that thunders\u201d.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be careful what you wish for, as the saying goes. We are two friends who had a dream we couldn\u2019t let go of. A dream that excited and scared us at the same time, because it felt presumptuous; too big; destined to fail. We are Lukas Irmler from Freising and me, Reinhard Kleindl from Graz. Two friends who share the same passion: slacklining, a modern form of tightrope walking. Our dream: to cross the Victoria Falls on an inch-wide webbing of synthetic fibre.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been chasing this dream for more than two years. During this time, we have not just studied the Falls, observed watercourses, collected pictures and analysed diagrams of the water levels, but we have also got to know Africa. Lukas had already been here, but this continent was completely new territory for me. I had seen the pictures, knew the facts and figures, but none of that means very much. It was not until I came here and visited the Falls that I started to understand. The kind of people who live here, what makes them tick; different, yet strangely familiar at the same time.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learned more about the history of the Falls, which had been known to the natives since time immemorial. The explorer David Livingstone became the first European to lay eyes on them, almost 159 years to the day before our quest, describing them as the most beautiful place in Africa. We get all of that. What we can\u2019t understand is why no tightrope walker has ever crossed them before. The Niagara Falls were crossed by high wire artistes as long ago as the 19th century, but the Victoria Falls - never. If we succeeded, we would be the first. The great tightrope walkers of the world have always inspired us; we follow in their footsteps, but in our own unique style.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, our dream seems to be within reach: I\u2019m standing on the edge of the canyon, with the Zambezi thundering into the depths in front of me. Next to me hangs our slackline, a rope bridge to the other side. I\u2019m connected to it by a safety rope, the leash my lifeline: if I lose control, it is this rope, the thickness of my finger, that will stop me from falling. Soon I will be crawling out and trying to stand up, so that I can balance across to the other side. The first person ever to do so if I can overcome my fears, my doubts.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this feeling. This is not my first highline, as slacklines over canyons are known, and it isn\u2019t even my first project with Lukas Irmler. We have both been involved in this sport for about eight years, helped to make it what it is today, grown up with it. When slacklining came over to Europe, we were both hooked on it to the point of obsession. Since then, we have done highlines in many different countries: Malaysia, Peru, Iran, Russia, South Africa, but in the Alps too: South Tyrol, southern France, even on skyscrapers. But we have never been involved in a project of this order of magnitude. The highline we have stretched across Victoria Falls, after many problems and a great deal of uncertainty, is 91m long and about a hundred metres above the ground. An inch-wide, a thread stretching away into nothingness. Gusts of wind and spray whip into it, setting the line swinging. Do I really want to go out there?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite my experience, I always have to fight down these fears and doubts, which are part of the sport, part of what attracts me to it. Whilst my brain is still looking for an exit clause, something in me takes over, calmly prepares me for the task at hand. Fasten the belts. Attach the leash. Steady my breathing. Check the knots, then, sitting down, head out onto the line and peer into the abyss for the first time. The roar of the water mass is breathtaking, my mind is overcome, overwhelmed, gives up all resistance. It\u2019s just sheer determination driving me forward. I shake the slackline, feel the weight of the soaking wet webbing, then I get into my starting position, stand up and begin to walk.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the earlier difficulties are now forgotten: the fact that we weren\u2019t sure whether we were even up to the project, from a technical point of view. The canyon is about a hundred metres wide, almost the length of a football field, but when we fell in love with the project and started planning, only very few people in the world had ever crossed highlines this long. Compared to tightropes, highlines are looser and free to move to the sides, so the level of difficulty increases rapidly in proportion to their length. We didn\u2019t know how we were going to lay the connection across the canyon. All of the methods we had tested out had a range of no more than 60 metres \u2013 nowhere near enough. And ultimately, we had no idea where we were going to fix our slackline. Good anchor points are a matter of life and death in highlining, but would we find a decent rock to set a bolt into? And this was all assuming that we would get permission: the Victoria Falls are in a national park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and are under specific protection. Would we manage to convince the authorities that we wouldn\u2019t do any damage? The bolts were a particular worry. The fact that we ultimately decided against hooks and were able to fix the line cleanly between two trees was also extremely satisfactory from an aesthetic point of view. This is what outdoor sports should be: they should leave no traces.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" style=\"border: 0;\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I am standing, shakily, above the canyon. Spray gusts at me from the Falls, hitting me in waves. The vision keeps blurring before my eyes. I am well prepared, but not for this. I have done highlines in snow, wind and rain, but I have never experienced anything like this. The visibility is incredibly poor, the line is wet, hard to control. Two steps, three, then I slip. I can\u2019t hold onto the line any longer and the safety leash breaks my fall. Adrenaline is coursing through me, my doubts grow stronger. I have to overcome them! Keep going, once more. I fall several more times before I can cover enough metres to be out of the fog of spray. Suddenly, my vision clears and I am standing right over the middle of the canyon. The void, the boiling masses of water, the abyss beneath my feet \u2013 I am overwhelmed. Then suddenly it all just falls into place. I manage to calm myself down, keep putting one foot in front of the other and an incredible feeling of freedom comes over me. It\u2019s not an adrenaline rush, but an adrenaline flow lasting several minutes, which is like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. I manage to reach the other side. The first crossing is in the bag! But I have fallen several times, which is not what we intended. In highlining, you have to get across the line without falling.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%207.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I get back, I unfasten my harness and hand the safety leash to Lukas. I tell him it feels great, that the cloud of spray isn\u2019t that bad. A little white lie to help him, the kind of thing we often do. He sets off on his first attempt. He falls too. When he reaches the other side and turns back, he falls again, but I can see that he is starting to get into it. It\u2019s my turn again, and now I can feel it too. I almost manage the crossing; just a few tumbles. But the conditions seem to be getting a bit better now. Lukas\u2019s turn again. When he stands up, I can see from his body language that he is extremely nervous. As he fights his way along, metre by metre, all at once I can feel his fighting spirit. He\u2019s going to do it, I really believe it, I\u2019m almost certain. Almost living the thrill with him, I turn out to be right: Lukas is the first to send this incredible highline. When he gets back, he looks almost like he\u2019s having fun. I congratulate him, am a bit jealous but, at the same time, I\u2019m absolutely delighted, as is so often the case. It\u2019s quite clear to me that the project has been a success, now that the unthinkable has been achieved. But for it to be perfect, I have to send the line too. I would be so disappointed if I didn\u2019t. The pressure on me is even greater. Am I going to be able to do it?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%208.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"326\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I get on the line, my movements are a bit wobbly and uncertain. I fight my way out into the middle and suddenly I\u2019m in serious difficulties, I\u2019m standing at such an angle that mentally, I\u2019m already preparing to fall. But something in me won\u2019t give up, putting off the inevitable for a bit longer. And then the hardest part is behind me: I\u2019m standing upright again, but I\u2019m so churned up and shaking so much, my self-confidence has taken such a knock that I just want to throw in the towel. Once again I manage to take control, try to find inner calm, take the next step. I can hardly believe it as I slowly near the end - if I can just avoid making any more mistakes. If I fall in these last few metres, it will all have been for nothing. The next few steps feel to me like an eternity, and then I\u2019m touching the tree. I\u2019ve done it. Only now is it all perfect, only now are we free. We don\u2019t spend a lot of time celebrating, we get back out on the line, but this time there\u2019s no pressure. We do a few tricks, try to make the most of these precious moments with the waterfall. This kind of opportunity only comes once in a lifetime.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%209.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don\u2019t actually realise how lucky we\u2019ve been until the next few days, when the weather really starts to close in. The spray cloud is so dense that there\u2019s simply no point in any further attempts. We take the line down and now the project is definitely over. But we don\u2019t get straight on the boat to come back, we stay at the side of the waterfall for a while, sitting on a rock right next to the main fall and there, above its roar, we suddenly feel a deep calm.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decide to call the line \"Nyami Nyami\", after the Zambezi river god. We always felt it should be an African name and we love the carved pendants we found on a market in Victoria Falls, which we have worn around our necks the whole time we were on the line.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%2010.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, as we make our way into Hwange National Park, we start to realise that TV channels and newspapers throughout the world have picked up on our story. We spend a few more days in the bush, in the stunningly beautiful, unfenced Bomani Lodge, and head out into the wilderness a few times with our ranger, Sibs. It does us good to have a bit of down time before we have to throw ourselves back into the whirlwind of interviews and emails. We have encounters with an elephant bull, buffaloes and an enormous cobra \u2013 on foot, not in a jeep \u2013 and later we see a hippopotamus, a cheetah and two lions mating. A visit to a nearby elementary school, where we put up a slackline for the children to try out, is the perfect end to our adventure. They are so enthusiastic about it \u2013 slacklining is addictive! Nobody knows that better than we do.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evenings, around the campfire, we are drunk on the impressions and all the events of the last few days start to fade, leaving just a hazy feeling in the back of our minds. When the time comes to leave, we find it hard. I could lose myself in this state - stay this way forever.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.outdoorsportsteam.com\"&gt;www.outdoorsportsteam.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Vic%20Falls%20Highline%2011.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"866\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n              &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/Nightjar%20Cover.jpg?itok=ztFK0obu\" \/&gt;\n            &lt;h2&gt;Nightjar Travel&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-8948\" class=\"publisher-1968 node node-article node-promoted clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/11-maxims-improve-your-fitness\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;11 Maxims to Improve Your Fitness&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    11 Maxims to Improve Your Fitness  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"11 Maxims to Improve Your Fitness\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.gomulti.co.za' target='_blank' style='background-color: #FFFFFF' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/gomulti_logo.png\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Maxims.jpg?itok=AAMAMfN-\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/11-maxims-improve-your-fitness\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/11-maxims-improve-your-fitness\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/11-maxims-improve-your-fitness&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Maxims.jpg&amp;description=11 Maxims to Improve Your Fitness\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/11-maxims-improve-your-fitness\" data-text=\"11 Maxims to Improve Your Fitness\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/11-maxims-improve-your-fitness\" data-title=\"11 Maxims to Improve Your Fitness\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Dec 2014&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words Lisa de Speville&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love fortune cookies. It\u2019s the frivolous words of wisdom and positive prophesies that I enjoy more than the cookie itself.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While preparing a special treat for a night-time, orienteering event that I organise, I went in search of pearls; those wise words that motivate and inspire and say it like it is.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These 11 are my favourites.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Ask yourself: \u2018Can I give more?\u2019.&lt;\/strong&gt; The answer is usually: Yes. I\u2019m not much in favour of running \u2018til I puke, but there\u2019s something to be said for finishing a race having given it everything.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Relish bad training runs.&lt;\/strong&gt; Without them it\u2019s difficult to appreciate the good ones. I dread those chest-heaving and legs-dragging runs. They make an appearance when I spend too many hours for days on end at my computer; when I\u2019m not eating right and not hydrating sufficiently and when I\u2019m not running at least four times a week. Eliminating the causal factors is an easy solution to making more sessions good. Right?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Believe that you can run farther or faster because you can.&lt;\/strong&gt; I have a rule for ultras. If it is up, walk. If it is flat or down, run. At the 2005 Coastal Challenge in Costa Rica I hit the 52 kilometre stage running \u2013 literally. As the route ran north to south along the beach, it was all flat. I had to run it all \u2013 according to my rules. And I did. The whole way. Bar maybe one kilometre of slight climb on a dirt road. In doing so, I reached a new personal best for distance in one chunk. In adventure racing I see this over and over again \u2013 racers achieving personal records for distance across the disciplines. Yes, you can. And this leads me on to the next gem\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Running won\u2019t kill you, you\u2019ll pass out first!&lt;\/strong&gt; Sports scientist Ross Tucker wrote a series of articles on fatigue on The Sports Scientists blog (sportsscientists.com) some years ago. According to Tucker, fatigue (or the slowing down of pace) results from the regulation of performance to balance all the body\u2019s physiological systems, which happens BEFORE any physiological failure can occur. So in theory, I\u2019d conclude that what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Every day is a good day when you run 30 minutes.&lt;\/strong&gt; That\u2019s all you need. When you\u2019re cranky, tired, irritable or down-in-the-dumps, a run tints the World rosy again.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Run often and run long, but never outrun your joy of running.&lt;\/strong&gt; Event after event, packing and unpacking, weekends that are anything but restful and recuperative and week days of squeezed-in training to prepare for these weekend activities\u2026 This cycle, although fun, can demolish that love for your sport, regardless of discipline. Back off to find and keep that joy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. To be the best runner you can be, start now.&lt;\/strong&gt; Don\u2019t spend the rest of your life wondering. Substitute runner for biker, paddler, adventure racer, orienteer, paddler, mountaineer\u2026 You may not have tomorrow.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. We are all runners, some just run faster than others.&lt;\/strong&gt; Regarding adventure racing I often hear, \u201cI\u2019m not fit enough\u201d. I usually answer, \u201cSome run Comrades in 5:30 and others in 10 hours. There\u2019s fit and there\u2019s fast. You don\u2019t need to be fast to reach the finish.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up.&lt;\/strong&gt; There are only two reasons for pulling out of a race. One: when you\u2019re badly injured or severely ill. Just being ill is not a good enough reason. Remember that over a multi-day adventure race you can easily rest in the shade of a tree for a few hours or even overnight. It\u2019s amazing what a few hours of rest, food and hydration can do to improve your situation. You will regret it later if you pull out, let your team down and then wake up in the morning feeling like a million bucks. Two: when you\u2019re so far behind the field that the race director ends your race and gives you a lift to the finish. These are the only times. Everything else is an excuse, not a reason.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Everything you need is already inside.&lt;\/strong&gt; Forget fancy-pants, top-of-the-range gear and apparel. These don\u2019t get you up hills or through tough kilometres. You do.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. And finally, a lesson I have to re-learn all too often:&lt;\/strong&gt; \u201cAny day that you are too busy to run is a day that you are too busy\u201d. \u2018Nuff said.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Lisa de Speville&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventure racing author, athlete and founder of FEAT (Fascinating Expedition ad Adventure Talks) and ar.co.za, Lisa is keenly interested in anything related to outdoor adventure, especially orienteering and trail running.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gomulti.co.za\/2014\/10\/01\/11-maxims-improve-running-fitness\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Go Multi&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back issues available in&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gomulti.co.za\/single-back-issues\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;digital and print&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;Go Multi Magazine&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gomulti.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.gomulti.co.za&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/gomulti\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.twitter.com\/gomulti&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gomulti\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;www.facebook.com\/gomulti&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gomulti.co.za\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/go%20multi%20cover%20logo_0_0_1_1_0_0.png?itok=-BXxLV5Q\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;GO Multi&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n","\n\n&lt;div id=\"node-8949\" class=\"publisher-1340 node node-article clearfix content\" about=\"\/magazine\/karoo-back-roads\" typeof=\"sioc:Item foaf:Document\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"title-shim\"&gt;Karoo Back Roads&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;img class=\"section-txt\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;h1&gt;\n    Karoo Back Roads  &lt;\/h1&gt;\n  &lt;span property=\"dc:title\" content=\"Karoo Back Roads\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span property=\"sioc:num_replies\" content=\"0\" datatype=\"xsd:integer\" class=\"rdf-meta element-hidden\"&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;  \n          \n          &lt;a href='http:\/\/www.wildcard.co.za\/wild_magazine.htm' target='_blank' style='background-color: #b7cb35' class='article-strip'&gt;\n        &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/wild.gif\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"content clearfix\"&gt;\n              &lt;div class=\"zest-gallery\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"stage\"&gt;&lt;img \/&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"imgs\"&gt;\n                          &lt;img src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/article_gallery\/public\/images-article\/Back%20roads%201_0.jpg?itok=dC43g3ze\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" \/&gt;\n                      &lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class='paging'&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-shares\"&gt;\n          \n          &lt;div class=\"g-plusone\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/karoo-back-roads\" data-size=\"medium\" data-annotation=\"none\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;div class=\"fb-like\" data-href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/karoo-back-roads\" data-send=\"false\" data-height=\"20\" data-show-faces=\"false\" data-layout=\"button_count\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&nbsp;\n          &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/pinterest.com\/pin\/create\/button\/?url=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/karoo-back-roads&amp;media=http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/images-article\/Back%20roads%201_0.jpg&amp;description=Karoo Back Roads\" class=\"pin-it-button\" count-layout=\"horizontal\"&gt;&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"\/\/assets.pinterest.com\/images\/PinExt.png\" title=\"Pin It\" \/&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&nbsp;\n\n          &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/karoo-back-roads\" data-text=\"Karoo Back Roads\" data-via=\"nightjartravel\" data-count=\"none\"&gt;Tweet&lt;\/a&gt;\n          &nbsp;\n\n          &lt;div class=\"email-button nightjar-email-button\" data-url=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/magazine\/karoo-back-roads\" data-title=\"Karoo Back Roads\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n        &lt;div class=\"mag-date\"&gt;Dec 2014&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        &lt;p&gt;Words and pics Romi Boom&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a three-night breakaway to Karoo National Park, you\u2019ll be able to explore its furthest reaches. Game is plentiful and birding is rewarding, but it\u2019s the vastness that will leave you giddy on atmosphere and beauty.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the stoep of Embizweni cottage, at sunset, the flat-topped Nuweveld Mountains gradually turned pink, then lilac, then violet. A universe away from city life, the Karoo National Park had been a non-stop visual feast since I\u2019d arrived in the early afternoon. Within minutes I\u2019d spotted Verreaux\u2019s eagles gliding on the thermals, one of the 17 active breeding pairs in the front section of the park.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venturing deeper into the park towards the Nuweveld 4x4 route, the landscape becomes surprisingly rocky. Ideal terrain for the nimble klipspringers who watched from up close in the pass, but what about the large herds of plains game? How do the red hartebeest, gemsbok, kudu, eland, springbok and zebra manage to tread as carefully as ostriches among the boulders and rocks? The 90km can be driven in a day, but do overnight halfway at Embizwen to relished the isolation, the 180\u00ba views across deserted countryside, the grandeur of the mountain cliffs and crags.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do the eco trail in an anti-clockwise direction, the roughest section is negotiated on the first day. It\u2019s relatively gentle, grade two, the only real challenge is embedded and shattered stone under your tyres. Although there are a few steep inclines, dips and rock shelves at water crossings, the scenery is more rugged than the track. On day two there\u2019s plenty of time to descend the steep gradients of the mountain and cross the flat plains covered in grassy shrubland. I stopped a lot, enjoyed the spectacle of Karoo korhaan and South African shelduck, and tried, unsuccessfully, to photograph a pale chanting goshawk in flight with a snake dangling from its beak.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Back%20roads%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Nuweveld Loop, the trail diverts into Afsaal Loop and eventually joins up with the Potlekkertjie Loop, a popular drive from the main rest camp. To get in synch with the relaxed pace at Afsaal cottage, I recommend a stay of at least two nights. The waterhole is barely 30 metres from the cottage and the viewing deck is the perfect spot to read, quench your thirst, and wait. First to appear was an ancient leopard tortoise, next two kudus, then four gemsbok. Landing at arm\u2019s length, then flitting to and fro, the cottage\u2019s resident mountain wheatear. Sunsets at Afsaal were quite unlike those at Embizweni. On the open plains, twilight lasted forever, the sky aglow in burnt copper, picking up the flickers of the braai flames.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For serious and amateur birders alike, a few hours with Japie and Ralie Claassen, the gurus from Karoo Birding Safaris who have been birding for 35 years, will enrich your visit to the park. September to November is a good time to enlist their help to identify the seven or eight types of larks then very active in the veld. &nbsp;\u201cThe Karoo long-billed lark, when it is displaying, has to be one of my favourites,\u201d Ralie confessed. \u201cWhen you whistle, the male, who flies along close to the ground, rises up near-vertically 20 metres into the sky, with closed wings, then stalls and dive-bombs downwards, the wings still closed until just before it reaches the ground and continues its horizontal flight. There\u2019s no mistake, it\u2019s saying, \u2018In this part of the world, I am king\u2019.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other LBJs on your wish list might include short-toed rock-thrush, black-eared sparrowlark, southern tchagra and Karoo eremomela. Japie recounted how the rock pipits call for four days immediately after the rains, then they go all silent until after the next downpour. \u201cAnd a Namaqua warbler, if you don\u2019t know where to look, you may hear for a month without finding it.\u201d&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you thought one night at Karoo National Park suffices, you\u2019re in for a wonderful surprise.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-1\/Back%20roads%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trip planner&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karoo National Park is conveniently located off the N1, near Beaufort West.

We often forget how beautiful our country is and just how much it has to offer in terms of tourist destinations.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously we\u2019re all aware of the firm favourites such as the KwaZulu-Natal coast, the Western Cape, Mpumalanga and the nature reserves in the North West, but we tend to overlook the KZN Midlands. We have just returned from a short visit to this region, and we\u2019re tempted to call it SA\u2019s best kept secret.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years we thought of the Midlands as a place you had to drive through to get to Durban. It seemed like nothing more than a few turn-offs from the N3 into the pretty countryside, leading to nowhere in particular, and certainly not places that anyone in search of adventure would go. We decided to go check this out, and obviously we needed a chariot to take us there.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kia Sportage was an obvious choice, as we have felt for some time that it belongs near the top of a large pile of similar sized SUVs. We rate it very highly, because it ticks all the boxes. It\u2019s spacious, well equipped, comfortable, nice to look at, frugal, powerful and nice to look at. We know we said \u201cnice to look at\u201d twice, but take a moment to check it out... Isn\u2019t it the handsomest SUV you\u2019ve ever seen? It\u2019s not just good looking for an SUV -- it\u2019s a great piece of automotive design within the industry as a whole.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wanted to drive the Sportage again as it received a minor facelift a few months ago. A few subtle changes were made to both the exterior and interior, but nothing too drastic. It was probably a case of not much change being needed in the first place, as it was already a class-leading product.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's only one problem about the Sportage. Thanks to it's award-winning design and a raft of Car of the Year awards, demand far exceeds supply, and in SA the waiting list was measured in months. The arrival of a boatload of Kias has sorted out the issue, but if you\u2019ve always fancied a Sportage, it\u2019s probably a good idea to get to your nearest dealership sooner rather than later.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to take the top-of-the-line 2,0-litre turbodiesel automatic with all-wheel drive on our 1000km soft-roader adventure. We reckoned that its punchy engine and smooth self-shifter would serve us well on the open road.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Kia%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turn off at Tweedie&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Johannesburg we drove around 420km to an unimpressive turn-off to a place called Tweedie. It looks like the kind of road you\u2019d find in a horror movie, and the view doesn\u2019t improve much when you get to the top of the bridge that crosses the highway. We decide to hang right and see where it leads us.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kilometre or so later we stumble across the famous Nottingham Road. Once again we have to choose between right and left, and we go with right again. The road leads us to the spot where the young Nelson Mandela was captured in 1962, in the days before the Treason Trial.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start the tour, which is called the Long Walk to Freedom, by wandering through a makeshift museum dedicated to Mandela. It\u2019s a stark reminder of apartheid\u2019s effects on SA.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focal point of the visit is a remarkable sculpture of the man himself. Arrive at the right time of day and you might have the place to yourself, as we did. This allows you to sit there in silence for a while, absorbing the significance of Mandela's pivotal role in his country's road to democracy.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual sculpture was made by Marco Cianfanelli and Jeremy Rose. It is basically 50 steel spears planted upright in the ground. From most angles it looks like a huge mechanical bush, but at one specific angle, 35m from the sculpture, you are suddenly aware of Mandela\u2019s face, looking west.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela was arrested here on 5 August 1962. He was on his way back to Johannesburg after attending a meeting at ANC leader Albert Luthuli\u2019s home and was driving on the R103 disguised as a chauffeur. The police pulled the car over and arrested him. His detention eventually led to the Rivonia Treason Trial, in which Mandela and his colleagues were convicted of treason, marking the beginning of his 27 years in prison.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We drive back on the R103 towards the Midmar Dam, venue for the annual Midmar Mile swimming race. Between the beautifully kept lawns on the shore and the boats in the dam, the Sportage looks right at home.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Midmar Mile doesn\u2019t sound that tough, but standing on the shores of this impressive dam, you realise why completing the race is such an impressive achievement. Just walking a mile is tough enough when you\u2019ve become accustomed to the comfort of a Kia Sportage!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Kia%203.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sportage had been a splendid companion on the tar, but we had yet to find a decent gravel road to drive on. Just outside the gates of Midmar Dam we are once again faced with a choice of routes. Straight on would take us on the recently tarred R103 to a few interesting destinations, but we decide on a gravel road with no specific objective in mind. It was time to test the Sportage\u2019s off-road ability.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the Midlands is littered with gravel roads that don\u2019t really go anywhere, but it\u2019s worth taking a few hours just to explore the countryside. It tends to be beautiful all year round and it\u2019s a great way to escape \u201ccivilisation\u201d, albeit only for a few hours.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On these corrugated roads the Sportage feels surprisingly agile, which indicates why the word \u201cSport\u201d makes up part of its name. The suspension copes very well with the washboard surface and we only feel the all-wheel drive system kick in a few times when we drive into an unexpected corner a bit too enthusiastically.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a trip like this one doesn\u2019t really need AWD, but it's nice to know it is there. Think of it as a safety net for those odd occasions when extra grip comes in handy. Even if you\u2019re not the kind of person who likes driving on gravel, the AWD could come in handy when the rainy season arrives in a few short weeks.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We eventually find our way back to the R103 and decide to head for the Howick Falls. The sun is setting and the falls will be the perfect way to end the day.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we stand there looking down at the falls, we hear a man singing, along with an acoustic guitar. It turns out that this budding muso\u2019s name is Mr Love and his occupation is singing for donations.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His son is seated next to him and it is obvious that whatever he's singing holds a special significance to the young child. We make a donation and in return get a huge smile and another enthusiastic chorus. The only word we can make out is \u201cawe\u201d, but it sounds like a happy song.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we walk away, we notice that the boy is wearing a shirt with the slogan, \u201cAlways look on the bright side of life\u201d. It really is good being South African. Even when times are hard, most of us find time to sing a happy song.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Kia%204.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way to our accommodation for the night, we make a quick stop at the Nottingham Road Breweries to pick up a few well-deserved beers for the evening. The brew master, a friendly man named Thokozani, talks us through the process of making craft beer and it's clear that he takes it very seriously. He shows us computer graphs of the beer\u2019s sugar levels and explains why he needs to monitor these levels each and every day.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of what he says goes over our heads, but we can confirm that whatever Thokozani does, works.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four beers made on site are delicious in their own right, but it\u2019s the Whistling Weasel Pale Ale that deserves special mention. After all that driving, it went down exceptionally well on the stoep of our suite at Granny Mouse\u2019s Country House.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mouse house&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While planning this trip we soon realised that the accommodation would be as much of an attraction as any of the sight-seeing. There are loads of places available and most of them tend to be the kind of place where you\u2019d like to spend some time rather than just stay overnight.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granny Mouse\u2019s Country House immediately grabbed our attention, mostly because of the catchy name. It sounded extremely cosy, so imagine our surprise when we arrived and found that they had been kind enough to book us one of their suites. It was a nice change from the four- and five-star hotels you normally get to sleep in on motor car launches. Hotel rooms tend to be cold and clinical, but the Mouse House was decorated to feel like home.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food is exceptional, as is the long list of activities one can take part in, but we decide to spend our evening in the cigar bar, which has an impressive selection of single malt whiskies on the shelves.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to blend in with the local patrons, we order a Glenmorangie and do our credit cards some serious damage. &nbsp;One only lives once, after all!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Put your brave face on&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our first stop next morning is at Piggly Wiggly. Those who have been to the US will know that there's a chain of cheap and cheerful Piggly Wiggly supermarkets, but the venue we visit could not be more different. It is a fancy coffee shop surrounded by a few other bohemian shops selling everything from imported French frocks to homemade wax candles. It\u2019s a romantic and rustic shopping centre in the middle of nowhere, and a must if you\u2019re on an adventure with your beloved.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Kia%205.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"324\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nice spot for those in search of romance is the Karkloof &nbsp;Falls. The view from the top is beautiful, and so is the road that takes you there.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This detour on our way to our final destination gives us time to relax and admire the amount of space in the Kia. On this trip it had swallowed enough luggage for two people for two days, a family-sized cooler box, loads of photographic equipment and a ladder for those tricky landscape shots. Suffice to say that the Sportage has more than enough space for a family of four, and certainly for two people on a romantic getaway.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No trip to the Midlands is complete without a visit to the Karkloof Canopy Tours. For anyone unfamiliar with canopy tours, allow us to explain: Basically, you strap yourself into a body harness, which is then attached to a sort of foefie slide, and off you go.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few canopy tours scattered all over SA, but the one at Karkloof should be attempted only by the truly brave at heart.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tour takes you from one platform to the next using a steel cable. It takes about two hours in all, and at the highest point you find yourself 30m from the ground. Now, 30m doesn't sound much when you look at it horizontally, but it\u2019s another matter vertically. Couple that with the kind of speed that makes your eyes water and you have the makings of a really exciting excursion. We completed the entire course without yelping once, but our fellow sliders let out a few good ones!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canopy tour was enough excitement for one day and so we decide to make our way to the Gowrie Farm Lodge, to spend the night.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This grand establishment is at the very end of Nottingham Road, which is an adventure in itself. The twisty road takes you past most of the tourist spots in the area, so you could check in at any one of them and enjoy a week touring the Midlands without driving more than 50km a day.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sportage was a joy to drive on these winding roads. It\u2019s not a sportscar, but it doesn\u2019t mind tackling the occasional mountain pass. It also looked at home parked outside the stunning Gowrie Farm Lodge, and that\u2019s when we finally realised the attraction of cars like the Kia. &nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soft-roaders offer their owners the opportunity to be part of an adventurous lifestyle without having to venture too far into the unknown. You can appreciate nature from within the leather clad luxury and safety of your car, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. In fact, catering for this market is big business these days. Almost every manufacturer has a soft-roader in its range, and Kia\u2019s offering is one of the best.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Midlands? This region ranks with the country's best for a leisure visit. Like the Kia, it\u2019s stunning to look at and offers the modern adventurer an easily accessible break from big city life without you having to give up any of your usual comforts.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/2014-2\/Kia%206.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\"&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to do the same?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in a quick KZN Midlands getaway, here\u2019s everything you need to know.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I get there and when should I go?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Midlands are easily accessible from the N3 highway. It\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive from Durban and four hours from Johannesburg. To get there from Cape Town, it\u2019s best to book a flight from Durban and rent a car at the airport.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An all-wheel drive SUV isn\u2019t a must, but some of the gravel roads may be tricky during the rainy season, from December to February. At this time you can expect almost daily showers, or downpours that can last for a few days.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In winter, day temperatures often rise into the twenties, but at night they frequently dip below freezing.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our experience, it\u2019s best to visit the Midlands during autumn or summer. The trout fishing is great in the autumn.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where can I stay?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are loads of luxury venues but also a few cheaper places to stay. The best way to find a place that suits your needs is to hop onto the internet and Google \u201cMidlands accommodation\u201d. The two hotels we stayed at are highly recommended. They were:&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Granny Mouse Country House&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great place for the whole family. It has both a Bistro and a fine dining restaurant. The rooms are immaculate and the lobby and dining areas have a warm, homely feel. The website is &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.grannymouse.co.za\"&gt;www.grannymouse.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rates change with the seasons, and reservations can be made by phoning 033 234 4071 or e-mailing &lt;a href=\"mailto:reservations@grannymouse.co.za\"&gt;reservations@grannymouse.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gowrie Farm Golf Lodge&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This establishment is situated in the upmarket town of Gowrie. The views from the main lounge are magnificent, and you can no doubt fit in a round of golf while you\u2019re there.&nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rooms are extremely comfortable and the surrounding area is as quiet as they come. This is definitely the place to go if you\u2019re in search of some much-needed R&amp;R.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates depend on the room you choose. Information is easily accessible on the website, &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.gowrie.co.za\"&gt;www.gowrie.co.za&lt;\/a&gt;. The website also has a booking function. (Tel 033 266 6294.)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can I do while I\u2019m there?&lt;\/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the places to visit are close to Nottingham Road (the R103). The Howick Falls, Karkloof Falls and Karkloof Canopy Tours are within 20km of Howick.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get to these sites, take the Tweedie off-ramp, turn left and drive straight through Howick's main street. At the end of street there are big signposts to guide you the rest of the way.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to explore the many minor roads in the district, remember to take an updated GPS or map along with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/travel-stories\/meandering-the-midlands\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Leisure Wheels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/841\"&gt;Midmar Dam&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1298\"&gt;Howick Falls&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1288\"&gt;Nottingham Road Brewery&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1272\"&gt;Piggly Wiggly&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1292\"&gt;Karkloof Falls&lt;br&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;a class=\"link-interest\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/node\/1269\"&gt;Karkloof Canopy Tours&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;      &lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n          &lt;\/div&gt;\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  &lt;div class='author'&gt;\n  \n      \n    \n      &lt;a href=\"http:\/\/www.leisurewheels.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;        &lt;img class=\"list-img\" src=\"http:\/\/www.nightjartravel.com\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/managing_authority\/public\/LWDec.jpg?itok=rDOVmCFG\" \/&gt;\n      &lt;\/a&gt;      &lt;h2&gt;Leisure wheels&lt;\/h2&gt;\n        &lt;div class='bio'&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n      \n    \n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;\n\n"]);
