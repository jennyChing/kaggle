       <i>
        needle phobia

       . Needle phobia, as it is generally defined, is a fear of medical needle procedures resulting from the sensation (or the memories of past sensations) of the needle entering the body. Some individuals experience pain with needle procedures. Other individuals experience a range of physical sensations with a needle procedure which various individuals describe as ranging from being merely
       <b>
        <i>
         creepy
        </i>

       Between 4 and 10 percent of the population has a form of needle phobia that is biological in origin, and that is unrelated to classic phobias. (In medical environments, the percentage of patients suffering from this genetic type of needle phobia is 3 to 5 percent, but at least twice that number with this genetic condition will
       <b>
        never

       seek medical care under any circumstances.) Needle phobia is a medical condition that deserves treatment just as much as any other medical condition. You shouldn't be ashamed of having needle phobia any more than you should be ashamed of having a headache. Whether your particular needle phobia is biological or psychological in origin, or both, in medical journals it is still called

       The medical profession pays inadequate attention to needle phobia, in part, because those with needle phobia tend to avoid contact with the medical profession. Few physicians have any idea about the magnitude of this problem. Many people would rather die than have a needle procedure, and countless thousands of people actually

        A significant fraction of the cases of needle phobia are actually a medical condition, probably with specific genetic origins, and not a traditional phobia at all.

       This is discussed further in Dr. Hamilton's 1995 medical journal article described below, and it has been discussed in other recent medical journal articles. In many cases, any perceived fear is actually directed mostly toward the involuntary physical reaction of one's body to needle procedures (rather than the needle procedure itself).

       There are, however, a large (and very rapidly-growing) fraction of the cases of needle phobia that are simply the fear of needles resulting from one or more traumatic experiences with needle procedures. The number of these human-caused "classic" phobias has been increasing dramatically over the past two decades, and has become the majority of needle phobics in the years since this web page was started in 1997. For many needle phobics, though, the first traumatic experience was the unexpected and involuntary reaction of their body to a needle procedure rather than the needle procedure itself. It can often be

            Even a child under 10, though, will probably not have experienced the "vasovagal reflex" type of needle phobia, which rarely starts until puberty.

       First, a brief overview of the types of needle phobia.
      </b>
      Different writers on the subject have used slightly different categories that what I am outlining here, but there is pretty close agreement on the following types of needle phobia.
     </p>
     <p>
      1. This page was originally written exclusively for what was once the most common category of needle phobia. These people have what is known medically as the
      <b>
       <i>
        vasovagal reflex reaction
       </i>
      </b>
      . In ordinary language,
      <b>
       <i>
        they faint (or nearly faint) and occasionally go into convulsions
       </i>
      </b>
      before, during or after a needle procedure. It is a part of what is known as blood-injury-injection phobia. This is a purely biological reaction, probably genetic, and is completely distinct from all other kinds of phobia. It is usually triggered, initially at least, by the sensation (which is not necessarily painful) of a needle entering the body. Later, the same reaction may be triggered by anticipation of a needle procedure or even discussions of needle procedures. The biological and evolutionary reasons for this have been discussed in medical journal articles. I will not discuss those causes in further detail because reading any such discussion could trigger vasovagal reflex reactions in those who suffer from this condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The second type of needle phobia is the
      <b>
       <i>
        classic phobia
       </i>
      </b>
      . This results from a early traumatic experience during a medical needle procedure. In the case of needle phobia, it is usually a medical event that occurs between the ages of roughly 3 and 6 years. Due to the carelessness and general thoughtlessness of medical professionals toward young children, this type of needle phobic has recently been rising at an astronomical rate. It has overtaken the first type in number of cases, and it now far exceeds vasovagal needle phobia. The recent explosion in the percentage of the population with this type of needle phobia, as documented in a number of medical studies, is an indication that the medical profession is doing something very wrong in the way that it deals with young children, and that this situation has gotten considerably worse in recent years.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The third type of needle phobia is a
      <b>
       <i>
        hypersensitivity to the pain caused by a needle
       </i>
      </b>
      penetrating the body. A needle procedure that the average person can barely feel will cause excruciating pain to these people. This type of needle phobia is rather rare and is suffered by less than 1 percent of the population.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. A major complication of needle phobia is the fact that some people can suffer from
      <b>
       <i>
        more than one of the types listed above
       </i>
      </b>
      . Although this complicates treatment, some aspects of treatment (such as topical anesthetic creams, patches and related devices) are common to all three of the types listed above.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a sub-type of the "classic phobia" that some people have separated out as a separate type. That is the combative/resistive type of needle phobia. Some otherwise tranquil people can become quite combative with medical personnel when facing a needle procedure. This probably results from the all-too-common practice of one or more large adults holding down a small child, often using great force, during needle procedures in childhood.
     </p>

      </tr>
     </table>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Some information on this page is repeated more than once. Although the repetition makes this page quite long, I have found that the repetition is necessary. Many needle phobics become very emotional when reading about this subject, and that impairs their ability to retain all of the information the first time that they read it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another factor that necessarily makes this page quite long is that there are many sub-types of needle phobia, and many people have more than one of these types or sub-types. For that reason, it is necessary to put all of the basic information on one long page so that you can select what is appropriate for you. There is no "one-size-fits-all" in needle phobia.

        Because needle phobia is a complex condition with many causes, the same treatments will not work for everyone. Here is a quick summary of the most effective treatments for needle phobia that are detailed below on this page:

       The most important needle phobia treatment is a topical anesthetic or device that will prevent the sensation of the needle penetration. In some cases, the topical anesthetic needs to be combined with a prescription oral sedative. The most effective of the topical anesthetics is the
       <b>
        <i>
         Synera
        </i>

       patch (known in Europe as the
       <i>
        Rapydan
       </i>
       patch). There are anesthetic creams that are messy to use and that have a much lesser degree of effectiveness, but which may be sufficient for some people. A device known as the

       In the past, it has been rare for any kind of psychological treatment alone to eliminate needle phobia, and it has almost never been helpful for those who experience the vasovagal (fainting) type of needle phobia (unless the psychotherapist has an unusual amount of knowledge about vasovagal needle phobia). For a many needle phobics, though, psychotherapy or hypnotherapy may be a necessary first step in eliminating needle phobia. Because discussions of needle procedures may cause some needle phobics to experience loss of consciousness with convulsions and potentially other serious medical problems, all psychotherapy or hypnotherapy should be done with great care. It is usually preferable that such treatment either be conducted directly by a psychiatrist (who is also a medical doctor) or in an environment where advanced medical treatment is rapidly available (such as by a psychotherapist or hypnotherapist whose office is in the same building as, and in very close proximity to, the offices of well-equipped medical doctors).

       In spite of my warnings and discouragement about using psychotherapy and/or hypnotherapy for needle phobia, it is very important to recognize that those techniques are only a danger for those who suffer from the vasovagal (fainting) kind of needle phobia. The dismal failure rate of psychotherapy in treating needle phobia may change in the future for those who experience needle phobia only as the (non-fainting)

       For those who experience the vasovagal (fainting) type of needle phobia, there are other techniques, such as Applied Tension, that can prevent loss of consciousness during or after needle procedures. There are very large differences in various evaluations of the effectiveness of Applied Tension, but it is a technique that is worth very serious consideration.

      When I started the original version of this page in early 1997, I did a
      <i>
       Medline
      </i>
      search of the medical literature since 1985.  At that time, the search turned up only 16 articles in response to a keyword search for
      <i>
       needle phobia.
      </i>
      One would expect that any disorder affecting more than 10 percent of the population would generate thousands of medical journal articles.  For example, a keyword search in the same database at that same time in 1997 on
      <i>
       diabetes
      </i>
      listed 66,190 articles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Things have gotten somewhat better in the intervening years. A search for the phrase "needle phobia" in the same database in early July of 2013, turned up 88 medical journal articles. By March of 2014, the number had grown to 98. By the end of 2014, the number of medical journal articles had exceeded 100 for the first time. So there is some progress being made.

      There is only one comprehensive review of needle phobia that has been published in the medical journals.  That review is an excellent and comprehensive article:
      <b>
       Needle Phobia: A Neglected Diagnosis
      </b>
      by James G. Hamilton, M.D. in the August, 1995 issue of
      <i>
       The Journal of Family Practice
      </i>
      . [Vol. 41, No.2, pp. 169-175]
     </p>
     <p>
      Dr. Hamilton's review does have 56 references, dating back as far as 1939, to other medical journal articles-- although many of the references are to single case histories, or to topics only secondarily related to needle phobia.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      There are large differences among individuals with needle phobia. Those who have studied needle phobia express the categories of needle phobia differently. For purposes of this page, needle phobia can be put into four broad categories:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) The type of needle phobia described in Dr. Hamilton's article is characterized by the
      <b>
       <i>
        vasovagal reflex reaction
       </i>
      </b>
      , a frightening reaction which includes plunging blood pressure and (often) loss of consciousness and (sometimes) convulsions.  This reaction generally occurs only after the onset of puberty, and is more common in men than women. Most estimates have been that 3.5 to 5 percent of the population suffers from this condition. It is likely that the percentage is far higher since vasovagal needle phobics tend to avoid all contact with the medical profession more than any other type of needle phobic, even when faced with death. Therefore, there is little opportunity for an accurate count of vasovagal needle phobics.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) It is very common for young children to be afraid of needles. Many children will simply "outgrow" their fear, but others will become adult needle phobics.  Children who are needle phobic can be administered topical EMLA cream or iontophoresis or the Synera/Rapydan patch (see below). The
      <b>
       <i>
        Buzzy
       </i>
      </b>
      device, described below, is also extremely helpful for children, especially for routine injections. Forcing needle phobic children to undergo needle procedures without the treatments described below will greatly increase the chances that they will become severe needle phobics and avoid medical care as adults. There is evidence that the prevalence of needle phobia is growing dramatically as more vaccines are available for important diseases, but these vaccines continue to be administered to children without any kind of pain mitigation. Children have a much greater sensitivity to needle pain than adults.
     </p>
     <p>
      The type of needle phobia that most people think that they have (but which, until recently, was suffered by only a small minority of needle phobics) is a classic phobia that results from a specific early traumatic experience (or multiple experiences).  Many people with needle phobia remember an early experience which they believe triggered their needle phobia. Quite often, though, these people are simply remembering their first needle phobia reaction.  The traumatic experience that is described is usually a routine needle procedure that occurred without any significant problem other than the physical needle phobia reaction itself. Some cases of needle phobia involve combativeness and active physical resistance that is, on rare occasions, quite violent. Although little, if any, research has been done into the sources of this combativeness, it is generally believed that this is the result of the unfortunate common practice of physically restraining children (often using more than one adult) in order to forcibly administer needle procedures. Unless a child is literally in danger of imminent death or long-lasting disability, such forcible restraint is clearly child abuse unless it is accompanied by sincere and effective efforts to comfort the child and minimize the pain.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) Some needle phobics have an acute sensitivity to pain. Needle procedures that are painless to most people cause considerable physical pain to these needle phobics, especially when a needle enters their vein. It is very unfortunate that the special purpose iontophoresis units that were designed for needle phobia are no longer available since these units, which electrically drove anesthethics through the skin, were of great value to those with an acute sensitivity to pain.
      <b>
       The Synera/Rapydan patch may be very useful to some individuals in this category, especially since most of these individuals experience great pain during intravenous procedures.
      </b>
      Intravenous procedures are an area where the Synera/Rapydan patch is most effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) Needle phobics can have any combination of the three types listed above. Many needle phobics fit into more than one of these categories, and there may be other categories that are not listed here. Needle phobia is a subject that has received very little formal study for a disorder that affects such a large fraction of the population. Whatever form your needle phobia takes, some of the treatments listed below on this page are likely to be useful.

      About 80 percent of vasovagal (fainting) needle phobics have a first-degree relative (parent, child or sibling) with needle phobia.  This is evidence that this type of needle phobia has a genetic component.
      <i>
       Vasovagal needle phobia is a genetic trait that had survival value for humans prior to the 20th century
      </i>
      . Before modern medicine, an individual with an inordinate fear of being stuck with a fang, a thorn or a knife was less likely to die in accidents or in encounters with hostile animals or men.  Prior to the 20th century, even an otherwise non-fatal puncture wound had a reasonable chance of causing a fatal infection.
      <b>
       This trait that had positive survival value prior to the 20th century now has a
       <i>
        negative
       </i>
       survival value
      </b>
      since it shuts its victims off from many of the benefits of 21st-century medicine.
     </p>
     <p>
      An episode of needle phobia of the vasovagal type can be frightening not only for the needle phobic, but for others present as well.  When needle phobia results in loss of consciousness, it is not uncommon for it to be accompanied by convulsions or respiratory distress.  There are, in fact, at least 23 documented cases of death due to needle phobia.  One of those deaths was the father of Dr. Hamilton, who wrote the review article mentioned above.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Of much greater concern than the very rare cases of death directly due to needle phobia are the countless thousands of premature deaths caused by the avoidance of medical care due to all types of needle phobia.
      </b>
      The avoidance of medical care due to needle phobia causes an amount of human suffering that is on a scale with many major well-known diseases.  I know of no way to get solid data on the number of deaths caused by needle phobics avoiding medical care, but it is likely that avoidance of medical care due to needle phobia is among the top ten causes of death in the industrialized world. I have a separate page about the estimates of the

       <b>
        prevalence of needle phobia
       </b>
      </a>
      . I will be expanding that page later.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Most physicians tend to greatly aggravate the needle phobia problem by the way that they treat children who require needle procedures. Commonly, two techniques are employed with children. One technique is that the children are forcibly held down by adults while a medical professional sticks needles in the child. The second technique is to resort to one of many kinds of deception, threats and trickery in order to administer the needle procedure. Either technique will help to guarantee that the child will develop a lifelong distrust of any kind of medical professional.

      All forms of needle phobia can be overcome, though. In fact, even though I am a lifelong needle phobic, I wrote the first draft for this page in 1997 sitting with a needle in my left arm, undergoing an elective 3-hour intravenous therapy as part of my personal program of preventive medicine. The first draft of this page was written during the 2nd of 10 such sessions.  I decided to begin this web page after suffering a vasovagal reflex reaction and losing consciousness and suffering convulsions shortly after beginning the first of these 3-hour I.V. treatments a week earlier.  That was my first needle phobia reaction in many years, even though it had been a constant problem for me up through my early twenties. I have not had a needle phobia problem since August 2001.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overcoming needle phobia does present special difficulties, and it does not usually respond well at all to traditional techniques for overcoming phobias.  Nearly half of the cases of so-called needle phobia are
      <i>
       a distinct physiological reaction
      </i>
      that is, to some extent, hard-wired into the human brain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Quite often, even after a person has lost his conscious fear of needles, the patient may retain anxiety about the physiological needle-phobia reaction.  For many needle phobics, the physiological needle-phobia reaction is
       <i>
        much more
       </i>
       unpleasant and anxiety-provoking than the needle stick itself.
      </b>
      (I have pretty much lost all conscious fear of needles myself, and I can even give myself injections; but I still am in danger of having a vasovagal reflex reaction occasionally if I'm not careful, and I find the vasovagal reflex reaction to be a truly terrifying experience. Fortunately, I have had only one vasovagal reflex reaction since beginning this page nearly 18 years ago. In that 2001 event, I was talking with the nurse about needle phobia and the Needle Phobia Page during the needle procedure. I inadverently gave a demonstration of the vasovagal needle phobia reaction when I passed out less than a minute after the needle procedure was finished. Being a well-known needle phobic to everyone in the office, no one was taken by surprise when I suddenly collapsed on the floor.)

       The differences between needle phobia and other common phobias cannot be over-emphasized.
      </b>
      Psychologists and counselors should be warned against attempting to treat needle phobics in a non-medical environment unless they are certain that the needle phobia is not of the vasovagal type. (Conventional treatments for phobias have a
      <b>
       <i>
        very
       </i>
      </b>
      poor track record against needle phobia, even in cases where the phobia is acquired from a traumatic event.) Conjuring up images of needle procedures can evoke a full needle-phobic reaction, including vasovagal shock and possible cardiovascular problems.  Although permanent injury is very rare, no one should risk evoking the physiological needle-phobic reaction without emergency oxygen and the presence of medical personnel skilled in cardiovascular resuscitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hypnotherapy alone also has a
      <b>
       <i>
        extremely poor
       </i>
      </b>
      track record in the treatment of needle phobia, although (as stated earlier) there are likely to be many cases where hypnotherapy combined with other treatments may be necessary for the effective treatment of needle phobia.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rare fatal reactions to needle phobia should not deter anyone from getting needed medical attention, or even preventive medical procedures.  Even a needle phobic with a weak heart is more likely to die in a traffic accident on the way to the doctor's office than of a needle phobia reaction.
      <b>
       Every needle phobic is far more likely to die from avoiding medical care than from a needle phobia reaction. Even though there is no solid data on the subject, nearly everyone who looks seriously at the needle phobia problem will conclude that needle phobics suffer premature deaths in extremely large numbers as a result of avoiding medical care.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A modern physician's office is well-equipped to deal with a typical needle phobia reaction and has several people present who are well-trained in cardiovascular resuscitation in the rare event that it should become necessary.

      Many needle phobics who were born prior to the mid-1960s had their needle phobia reinforced in childhood by poor quality control in needle manufacture which resulted in occasional dull or poorly-beveled needles.  Also, many medicines, such as penicillin, that were given in earlier days were highly viscous liquids that required large gauge needles.  Most substances given by injection today use very thin and very sharp needles that can hardly be felt by most adults (although they are still quite painful for very young children).  Quality control in needle manufacture is far superior to what it was forty or more years ago.

        Needle Phobia in Dentistry:
       </b>
      </font>
     </p>
     <p>
      The main mistake that people make with respect to dental needle phobia is going only to a familiar, or arbitrarily chosen, dentist without regard to any knowledge that the chosen dentist might have about needle phobia.  There are many dentists who
      <b>
       do
      </b>
      understand needle and dental phobias, but you have to actively search and find them.  They won't just knock on your door one day.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are dentists, in many countries where this Needle Phobia Page is read, who do specialize in either
      <b>
       sleep dentistry
      </b>
      or
      <b>
       sedation dentistry
      </b>
      .  Most of those dentists have their own informative web sites because of the somewhat specialized work that they do.
     </p>
     <p>
      With
      <b>
       sleep dentistry
      </b>
      , the patient is completely asleep while the dental work is being done.  With
      <b>
       sedation dentistry
      </b>
      , the patient is not asleep, but is so deeply sedated that he usually forgets completely about the fear of needles for a while.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <b>
       major
      </b>
      problem is that all sleep dentistry and most (but
      <b>
       <i>
        not all
       </i>
      </b>
      ) sedation dentistry requires the use of a needle in the arm to put the patient to sleep or to sedate the patient.  Some sedation dentistry uses only oral sedation (taking a strong tranquilizer pill in the dentist office an hour or so before the dental procedure).   Both sleep dentistry and sedation dentistry often use nitrous oxide before administering the sedative or anesthetic when it is given with a needle in the arm.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like all needle phobias, the particular procedure has to be individualized to accommodate the particular fears of the patient. When it comes to dental needle phobias, individual differences tend to be quite unique to the individual. It is a good idea to have brief telephone conversation with the dentist before making the appointment to make sure that your particular needle phobia can be accommodated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the great majority of dentists will do nothing to help needle phobics (except possibly offering nitrous oxide, which can be
      <b>
       <i>
        very
       </i>
      </b>
      useful in many cases), sleep dentistry and sedation dentistry are becoming increasingly popular among a very small percentage of dentists. You just need to make the effort to find the best dentists, and the specific dentist who is the most appropriate for your individual situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      I have been contacted by one dentist who specializes in needle phobia and other dental phobias.  You can contact him at the

       This Needle Phobia Page has been on the internet continuously for more than 18 years, and it is still updated frequently.

      This page originated because of my strong personal interest in preventive medicine.  Preventive medicine may have remarkably beneficial effects that are indicated clearly on blood tests, but those benefits may remain invisible for years without the necessary lab tests. Since effective preventive medicine can be expensive and time-consuming, if the benefits are invisible in the short-term, motivation may be lost; and the unfortunate result may be that a very effective program of preventive medicine is discontinued.

      There are a number of methods that can be used to cause the human brain to avoid the needle phobia reaction. Because of the number of different kinds of needle phobia, and the variations in the intensity of needle phobia, some of these techniques are likely to be useless for any specific case of needle phobia. You will have to read each one carefully to decide which one may be right for you. Overcoming needle phobia is usually very difficult, but with the correct individualized plan of action, needle phobia can be overcome. If you happen to choose the right individual plan of action quickly, though, sometimes even a very severe case of needle phobia can be overcome with amazing speed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the marketing materials for the most effective treatments for needle phobia would tend to cause a person to believe that they are only effective for avoiding pain from needle procedures in children. Many of these products are quite effective in adults who experience extreme discomfort, but not pain, during needle procedures. Many people pass over effective treatments for needle phobia because they were designed for children. You need to evaluate the specific treatment, and not judge the treatment on whether you are now a child or are just someone who was a child a long time ago.

         One of the most effective steps in overcoming severe needle phobia is to anesthetize the site of the needle stick.

       Since modern sharp needles produce a needle stick that is usually painless for most people, topical anesthetics are rarely used.  But this completely misses the point of using anesthesia in needle phobics (although part of the needle phobia reaction is often a great amplification of any pain that does occur).  The reason for topical anesthesia is to totally eliminate the sensation of being stuck by a needle.  It is necessary to temporarily block the site of the needle procedure from sending the needle puncture signals to the brain.

      Topical lidocaine has been tried for this, but topical lidocaine alone will anesthetize skin only to a depth of 2 or 3 mm.

      With the Synera and Rapydan patches, we enter the realm of really effective needle phobia products. The same patch is sold in the United States under the brand name

        Synera

      and in Europe under the brand name
      <b>
       Rapydan
      </b>
      . The patch was developed by ZARS Pharmaceuticals in Utah. The marketing of this product has been a true comedy of errors by people with absolutely no understanding of needle phobia. After several companies managed to keep this product a virtual secret for the first 8 years following its initial approval, the United States rights to the Synera patch have been sold to the U.S. division of Galen Pharmaceuticals. Galen is a United Kingdom company which obtained the rights to Synera in July 2013. This gives Synera a real chance for a fresh start. Galen seems to be taking advantage of this fresh start, although things happen slowly in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Published medical studies have shown this patch to be much more effective than other anesthetic creams and patches for needle procedures. It is also much faster-acting than most anesthetic creams, although the Synera/Rapydan patch still requires 20 minutes or more to achieve full effectiveness. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to be able to obtain and use the Synera/Rapydan patch have generally found it to be far more convenient, and far more effective, than the other alternatives. In addition, the the dual action of the warming effect of the patch plus the vasodilation of the tetracaine component makes veins much easier to access during needle procedures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Although the Synera/Rapydan patch has been approved for several years, like most products for needle phobics, in the past it has been marketed exclusively to the people who believe that it is unnecessary.
      </b>
      The Synera/Rapydan patch went practically without any effective marketing during the first 8 years after its FDA approval in the United States, but there is some indication that this product may become more easily available to needle phobic patients in the future. In the United States, the Synera patch is currently available by prescription (but not yet
      <i>
       easily
      </i>
      available). Although very few doctors know about Synera (and only a few hospital and specialty pharmacies have Synera patches in stock), any United States licensed physician may purchase the Synera patch or write a prescription for their patient to use the Synera patch.  Synera patches are nearly always a special order item from a conventional pharmacy, and it can be a one or two week process to obtain it from a local pharmacy. It is not yet clear how Galen eventually plans to sell and distribute the Synera patch. So far, they have, at least, greatly expanded the ineffective practice of selling Synera only to physicians directly.
      <b>
       Physicians can now also prescribe Synera for delivery directly to the patient's home.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The manufacturer of the patch had been somewhat constrained by the FDA-approved labeling which required that it be used only in a medical setting; but in June of 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Synera for home use. In Europe, where the patch is marketed as Rapydan, the marketing has in recent years been done by EuroCept, and the availability may vary greatly from country to country, although the Rapydan patch has been approved for use in the United Kingdom and throughout the European Union. It is not clear how the purchase of U.S. rights to the Synera/Rapydan patch by a company based in the United Kingdom will affect its availability in the United Kingdom and the European Union.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nuvo Research, which was a former owner of Synera and which still owns many of the rights to Synera, entered into marketing contracts for Synera with a distributor in Canada and has applied to the Canadian government authorities to license the Synera patch for sale in Canada. It is very clear, however, that Nuvo Research still does not understand what an important and revolutionary product that they have had.
     </p>
     <p>
      Published reports on the Synera/Rapydan patch indicate that this may be an extremely valuable product for those suffering from needle phobia (and I have personally found it much better than anything else that I have used).

      <b>
       The Synera/Rapydan patch could be a revolutionary development for needle phobics because of its ease of use and for its ability to, in effect, temporarily disconnect the brain from the part of the body undergoing the needle procedure. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how good the product is if patients cannot obtain it. Fortunately, Galen-USA is finally making it easier for United States residents to obtain this patch. See the

        (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a unique topical anesthetic cream that is available by prescription in the United States, and over-the-counter in Canada and throughout most of the rest of the world.

      One of its uses listed on the FDA-approved labeling of EMLA is for "intravenous cannulation and venipuncture."  It was one of the first and oldest medicines used for this purpose. EMLA is a mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine that is a liquid at room temperature, even though both lidocaine and prilocaine are room-temperature solids.  (This is what is meant by
      <i>
       eutectic
      </i>
      .  Another common eutectic mixture is solder, which has a lower melting point that its constituent metals.)  The liquid penetrates much more deeply than ordinary anesthetic solutions.  The anesthetic doesn't penetrate as deeply as it does with the Synera/Rapydan patch or the iontophoresis units mentioned below, nor does it act nearly as fast; but EMLA has the advantage of being much more readily available, and less expensive for most people. EMLA is rather messy and must be applied at least one hour before the needle procedure. Any pharmacy can get EMLA easily, but most United States pharmacies (except for hospital pharmacies) do not keep it in stock. Although EMLA is available without a prescription in Canada, Canadian pharmacies now require a prescription from United States residents ordering by mail order or on the web.  EMLA cream should be applied one hour before the needle procedure. Some individuals may require more time, and many people find the process to be rather troublesome and messy, and many find it to be not very effective. The effectiveness of EMLA cream varies greatly from individual to individual. EMLA works fairly well for many people whose needle phobia reaction is triggered by the sensation of the needle going in. EMLA does
      <b>
       not
      </b>
      work well for most people whose primary problem is an acute sensitivity to pain. An EMLA patch is also available in many countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      EMLA is one of the older and less effective solutions for needle phobia. Its main advantage is that, since it has been around longer, more doctors know about it, and it is generally easier to obtain that other options that are likely to be much more effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      A disadvantage of EMLA is the vasoconstriction it causes, which can make your veins more difficult to access. In this regard, tetracaine and (especially) the Synera/Rapydan patch are much better.

      Although a prescription

      <b>
       <i>

       Use caution about where tubes of EMLA cream are stored.

      There have been cases of people (especially young children) confusing EMLA cream with toothpaste, sometimes with serious results.

     <p>
      The most important thing about EMLA is its relative ease of availability outside of the United States. Even within the United States, medical personnel are more likely to be familiar with EMLA than with much more effective topical anesthetics such as the Synera patch.

      Tetracaine is also known as amethocaine, and is sold under a number of brand names in various countries. Tetracaine has the additional advantage over EMLA that it will dilate veins, making them easier to access. This is in contrast to EMLA, which contains prilocaine, which is a vasoconstrictor, and can therefore make access to veins more difficult. A topical 4 percent tetracaine gel sold under the brand name

       WARNING:
      </b>
      All of the anesthetic creams mentioned above should only be applied to a small area where the needle procedure is to be done. They all need to be applied in a rather thick layer, and they must be left on for 30 to 60 minutes. For most people, these creams will
      <b>
       not
      </b>
      produce total numbing, but will usually be quite helpful. If you don't already know, find out (in advance) on what part of your body the needle procedure will be done. There have been some people who have suffered severe adverse effects from using these creams over a very large area of their body. Also, keep these creams out of reach of the unsupervised use by children. There have been severe adverse effects from young children mistaking these anesthetic creams for other products such as toothpaste. The anesthetic creams are very helpful for most people, but do not reduce sensation as much as the newer products such as the Synera patch.

     </ul>
     <p>
      There have been a number of scientific tests of beta blockers for vasovagal reflex, but the results have been very inconsistent. Beta blockers do seem to be very useful for some people, though. The older beta blockers, such as propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol (Tenormin) are very inexpensive and very safe (especially when used only occasionally).  When used only intermittently in healthy people, they are almost completely free of side effects. Beta blockers are most commonly used as blood pressure medications, but they have many other uses. One big advantage of beta blockers over other medications is that they rarely have any significant effect on thinking and reaction time.  So, unlike large doses of tranquilizers or anti-anxiety medications, beta blockers usually don't usually affect your ability to do things like driving. Be careful about standing up too quickly when you are on a large dose of a beta blocker, though. Standing up too quickly can cause "postural hypotension." Postural hypotension can cause you to faint if you aren't careful, but it is not nearly as terrifying as the fainting caused by a vasovagal reaction. If you are considering the use of both lidocaine and a beta blocker, you need to be aware that there have been some rare reports of interactions between these two medicines. In some people, beta blockers can increase the severity of allergic reactions.

        Dr. Hamilton reports that nitrous oxide can be quiet useful, either alone or combined with an oral anti-anxiety agent.

      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Nitrous oxide is probably the safest and most convenient anti-anxiety agent, especially for milder cases of needle phobia.  Unfortunately, nitrous oxide is rarely available in doctor's offices. There are reports that a few hospitals are finally beginning to make nitrous oxide available for use during needle procedures, although they are restricting the use of nitrous oxide in hospitals mainly for use in children only.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nitrous oxide could be one of the most useful agents for needle phobia if it were used properly. This is especially true for the 50-50 mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen, which makes a very safe anesthetic for needle procedures. Nitrous oxide has a very rapid time of onset of action and a very rapid return to normalcy after it is withdrawn from the patient. Unfortunately, it is very seldom used for needle phobia outside of dentistry. In the United States, a very curious situation exists with regard to nitrous oxide. Many dentists in the United States are able to use nitrous oxide on their patients with only a single dental assistant to help them with the process. Medical clinics and hospitals in the United States have generally judged themselves to be incompetent to use nitrous oxide. In many other  countries, however, the 50-50 mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen is commonly available in clinics and hospitals.

        Needle phobics who have avoided medical care and have not received an injection in a long time should consider taking a first step in overcoming this condition by getting a quick and minor needle procedure, such as a routine vaccination (such as a flu injection at the appropriate time of the year).

Those who can work up the courage to take a simple vaccination as a first step, however, should not hesitate to do so.

      One thing of particular importance, especially for needle phobics with a tendency to faint, is keeping well-hydrated before the needle procedure. Many blood tests require no food or beverage intake for several hours before the test. Unless the medical people specifically tell you otherwise, though, it is vital to continue to drink water before the test. You must not only drink enough water to replace your normal fluid intake, but you must also replace the water content that you would normally get from the water content of food. Dehydration just makes fainting more likely.

      <b>
       Rapydan
      </b>
      ). It requires a prescription, but most doctors have never heard of it. This is a good opportunity for patients to educate their doctors about needle phobia and about the things that are available for needle phobics. The Synera/Rapydan patch is currently intended for things like intravenous procedures. The patch may not numb deeply enough for intramuscular injections; but it should help a little, and every little bit helps. Many needle phobics find the Synera patch life-changing for blood tests and other intravenous procedures. The Synera/Rapydan patch is not yet available in Canada or Australia.

       Applied Tension
      </b>
      seems to be a good technique to prevent fainting. Applied Tension is a technique that does require some practice, though. It is a technique that you can practice doing at home, however, when you are not actually facing a needle procedure. Applied Tension may also be useful to those who tend to lose consciousness when watching or listening to descriptions of medical procedures.

      In spite of the fact that the physiological vasovagal reflex reaction is rather consistent, there are individual differences in the subjective perceptions of needle phobics; and many needle phobics have other reactions, and do not experience the vasovagal reflex reaction at all.  The best techniques to use to prevent a needle phobia reaction vary greatly from individual to individual.  These individual differences must be taken into account when choosing a solution.

       </i>
      </b>
      because of having veins that are difficult to access. Many people have smaller or deeper veins than normal, others have veins that tend to "roll" or break during needle procedures. There is no longer any excuse for this to happen to anyone because of the recent development of devices for imaging veins. A number of such devices are available. One of the most sophisticated is the

      <i>
       The Journal of Family Practice

      is available in any medical library.  Most cities have at least one hospital with a medical library that is available to the public. Many people have recently been having a very difficult time finding this article since most libraries are no longer keeping older issues on the shelves. Most medical libraries that no longer have 1995 issues on the shelves usually

      Showing a copy of Dr. Hamilton's 1995 article from the
      <i>
       Journal of Family Practice
      </i>
      to your physician may encourage him to take your needle phobia more seriously.  I cannot emphasize the importance of this enough. Often, the only way to convey new medical information to a physician is to show the physician a copy of an article from a respected medical journal. You may be surprised how often this can make a real difference in your treatment. Every time that you successfully educate a medical professional about needle phobia, you will be making life better for yourself and for many other needle phobics, as well.

      Another very useful article from the Journal of Family Practice about the medical experiments with needle phobia that were done on Dr. Hamilton is no longer available on the web.  During those tests, which were reported in a 1991 article, Dr. Hamilton's blood pressure dropped from 130/90 to a very dangerously low 70/0 after insertion of the needle.  That article is available through medical libraries using the following citation:

      The only way that any progress is going to be made against needle phobia is if those who suffer from this condition educate the medical profession about this condition.
      <b>
       Do not sit back and wait for a course in Needle Phobia to suddenly be taught at the Harvard Medical School. This just isn't how things happen.
      </b>
      This isn't the way that medical professionals find out about the conditions that they are currently ignoring. Information about needle phobia will only come to the medical profession from those who are suffering from the medical condition and from their loved ones.

      Doctors and other medical professionals need to be politely educated about the nature of needle phobia and its treatments. Unfortunately, it is up to patients with needle phobia to educate themselves about this condition, and then to convey that information to their physicians. I keep repeating this over and over for a very good reason, but few hear me.
      <b>
       Those who suffer from needle phobia need to learn from those who have suffered from conditions such as breast cancer and AIDS.  The recognition of the importance of an ignored major medical condition usually begins with the patients, not with the medical profession.

     <p>
      Among the large amount of email that I receive, a very small percentage come from needle phobics who have developed a high level of anger toward the medical profession.  This anger, although often entirely understandable, is extremely counterproductive in our efforts to politely educate the medical professionals about needle phobia.  If you are one of these individuals, please try to find a way to overcome your anger before you become a Needle Phobia activist.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you have developed hostility and anger toward the medical profession, you may find it very useful to have several sessions talking this over with a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who is trained to discuss and to help you to understand these types of problems. Considering the brutal way that many very young children are treated during needle procedures, it is not surprising that many people develop this hostility. Someday, though, you are likely to reach a point where your health, and possibly your life, depends upon these medical professionals. So if you feel this hostility, please take steps to overcome it before you develop a serious medical problem where you desperately need medical professionals. You must learn to deal with medical professionals

      <i>
       Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)
      </i>
      . It is a sub-type of blood-injury-injection phobia, which is sometimes called B-I-I phobia. It is also listed in DSM-5 (the fifth edition). It is very briefly discussed on pages 198 and 199 of DSM-5. The standard ICD-10 medical insurance code for injection and transfusion phobia is F40.231. (ICD-10 medical insurance codes are in use in much of the world, but have been repeatedly delayed in the United States.)

       Unfortunately, I do not know of any physicians offering help or treatment for this condition.
      </b>
      I would very much like to develop a list of physicians who treat needle phobia; but that list does not yet exist, and I doubt that it will at anytime in the foreseeable future.  Physicians who make special provisions for needle phobic patients are desperately needed. (There are some dentists who offer considerable help with dental needle phobia.) I am asking doctors who are interested to contact me at the email address shown below. I do keep this site updated frequently; and after more than 18 years, there are still no practicing physicians who specialize in helping patients with needle phobia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Needle phobics who are unable to find a cooperative physician to write prescriptions for things like anti-anxiety medications or the Synera/Rapydan patch may consider consulting a psychiatrist for help with this.  Unlike a psychologist, a psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medicines like Valium and anesthetic skin patches like Synera.  Psychiatrists are generally much more comfortable prescribing such medicines, and they are much more knowledgeable about the use of anti-anxiety medicines than other physicians.
     </p>
     <p>
      I have heard from psychologists who claim to be able to treat needle phobia successfully, but nearly all needle phobics who report going to a psychologist report negative results. The number of needle phobics who have emailed me reporting unsatisfactory results from sessions with psychologists is extremely large. I am particularly concerned about what might happen in a non-medical setting if someone experiences a severe vasovagal reflex reaction (as many people do when talking about needle procedures). Psychologist may have much more success with needle phobia if they learn to separate those with vasovagal (fainting) needle phobia from the recently skyrocketing number of needle phobics created by uncaring medical practices, especially with regard to young children.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dr. Hamilton is retired and is
      <b>
       not
      </b>
      in private practice. In past years, he has seriously considered writing a book on needle phobia. Other matters have stood in the way of completing such a book.

     <p>
      Some companies have, or are developing, products with the potential to dramatically improve the lives of millions of needle phobics. Echo Therapeutics has developed products for needle-free glucose monitoring and drug delivery that are not yet on the market. It remains to be seen whether either of these companies will market their products in such a way that they will ever become easily available to needle phobic individuals. Most companies still insist upon marketing their products exclusively to the people who believe that such products are unnecessary in spite of the millions of dollars that have already been tragically wasted on such efforts.

      I do read all of my needle phobia email, but the volume of this email has recently become so enormous that I have no hope of ever being able to respond to more than a small fraction of it. I am just one person fighting a losing battle. I have had to stop responding for individual requests for help. The needle phobia problem is just too overwhelming for one person to handle, especially with very little financial support.

      I want to thank the readers of this page for withholding their requests for personal help recently. It has been nice to finally have some time for myself. I will continue to try to make relevant additions and other improvements to this page. I hope soon to be able to, once again, begin responding to most of my email. I am still struggling financially.

The Needle Phobia Page was viewed 98,992 times in 2014.  The monthly page views, however, steadily increased during 2014; and nearly tripled during the course of the year.

         I am asking for donations because after more than 18 years of subsidizing the Needle Phobia Page out of my own pocket, I am finding it impossible to continue paying all of the costs of this website myself. I am now trying to get by on a monthly Social Security check plus some occasional electronics consulting and freelance science writing work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reader donations through PayPal will allow me to further develop this site and continue its operation. Ivery greatly appreciate donations of any amount. Donations are processed through PayPal, and I never see any of your credit card information.
        </p>
        <p>
         During 2014, the Needle Phobia Page received 7 donations totaling 170 dollars. Although these donations did not cover all of the expenses of this site, they did enable me to continue the operation of this page. I may have missed personally thanking everyone who made a donation, but I sincerely appreciate every single donation. I hope that this page can continue to make a positive difference in the lives of people suffering from needle phobia.

         Even though there is a lot of specific product information on this page, it has, unfortunately, never earned a penny from paid advertising. I would very much like to have advertising of products that are both relevant and effective. There is potentially a lot of additional information on these products that could be added to the needlephobia.com web site.

         Important information regarding your donation:  The Needle Phobia Page is
         <b>
          not
         </b>
         yet a part of any non-profit corporation or non-profit foundation.  It was developed by me in 1997, and it is maintained by Futurescience, LLC, which is just the legal entity under which I do this kind of work.  No one else is involved except me.  I would like to eventually make the Needle Phobia Page into the web presence of a non-profit organization to conquer needle phobia; but such a non-profit entity does not yet exist, and the millions who suffer from needle phobia seem, so far, to have little interest in such an endeavor. I would like to change that, but that dream is a long way off.
        </p>

         <b>
          It is very important that any donations you make to the Needle Phobia Page reflect its value to you, the reader. I want my future decisions about to what extent I should continue my work against needle phobia to reflect the value to you of what I have done so far.

         In return for any donation over $25 (U.S. dollars),
         <b>
          if you request it
         </b>
         , I will send you an official reprint of Dr. James Hamilton's 1995 article,
         <b>
          Needle Phobia:  A Neglected Diagnosis
         </b>
         from the August 1995 issue of the Journal of Family Practice.
         <b>
          This reprint request must be made in a separate email to me
         </b>
         at:
        </p>
        <div align="center">
         <img border="2" height="50" src="e-je.jpg" width="300"/>
        </div>
        <p>
         Your email should request the reprint and state the exact mailing address where the reprint should be sent.  Also, state the date of your contribution to this web site and the amount. Only one reprint per person, please.  For readers outside of the United States, please read the following:
        </p>
        <p>
         Additional postage is required to send reprints to United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. For readers in these countries, the minimum donation to receive a reprint is as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
         Canada: 40 Canadian dollars
         <br/>
         Australia: 40 Australian dollars
         <br/>
         United Kingdom: 20 pounds
         <br/>
         Other European Countries: 30 Euros
        </p>
        <p>
         When I run out of these official reprints, I do not intend to purchase any more. Medical journals are quite expensive, and so are their reprints. Dr. Hamilton's article is only 7 pages long, but the reprints were quite expensive to purchase. I bought them several years ago when I could afford such things. Now such reprints are far out of range of my financial abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Please allow some time to receive these reprints. I can only mail them out about once a week, and they will take some time to get to you, especially if you live outside of the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         I only have the
         <b>
          paper
         </b>
         reprints of Dr. Hamilton's article. Even the original publisher of the article is no longer selling the individual electronic reprints from before 1999. I do not know of anyone who has electronic reprints of the complete article for sale.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are more comfortable mailing a donation to me in the form of a check or money order in U.S. dollars, you can mail the contribution to:
