         Dear American Jewish Community,
        </p>
        <p>
         Its time for us to talk. I know for many of you that you still dont want to talk  many of you have spent the last few weeks effectively covering your ears and eyes, endlessly repeating IDF talking points, as if they will magically make the reality disappear  but if there was ever a time to take the plunge and really look in the mirror at where we have gotten ourselves, this is the time. Its time for us to talk about Israel, its time to talk about Zionism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those of us, those Jews who have spoken out against Israels inhumane actions or Zionisms warped nationalistic beliefs, have never been well received within our community. When we have argued for human rights and international law, we have been ostracized and excluded from all aspects of mainstream Jewish life. When we have argued against an exclusionary, segregationist regime, we have been attacked with the most vicious of slanders; self-hating Jews, Nazi collaborators, and worse. When we have tried to stand up against colonialist violence and occupations, we have been met with angry rejection from our closest friends and family. When we have tried to reaffirm the values that Palestinians are human beings, deserving of equal rights and a future with dignity, we have been met with the full force of an incredibly powerful and well-funded Pro-Israel public relations machine. A climate of neo-McCarthyism has reigned within side the Jewish community stifling all debate, dissent and free thought on the issues of Israel, Palestine and Zionism. But its time for all of that to end.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that the last few weeks may have been hard for you. From a young age we all have been raised  indoctrinated even  on Pro-Israel ideology. Every facet of our Jewish life has been infected with Zionism, from our youth groups, to our synagogues, to our Hebrew schools, to our family Seders. The world hates us, Israel protects us, there we are free and safe and democratic weve come to believe. But in the last few weeks we have seen that supposed progressive, freedom loving, democratic Israel unmask itself before the whole world as a lynch mob society. We American Jews have been tricked into projecting all of our hopes and insecurities onto Israel, and to have those beautiful dreams and illusions shattered so brutally can be difficult. But for all the emotional pain we may be going through in seeing our Star of David pasted on the bombs being dropped on innocent civilians, its nothing compared to the pain being felt by those civilians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Palestinians have suffered greatly at our hands. They have been violently forced from their land and homes to appease the Holocaust guilt of Europe and the greed of Zionist colonists. They have been forced to live under an openly Jim Crow, discriminatory and segregationist Jewish Only apartheid state. And the whole process has become endemic in its repetition, with wave after wave after wave of land theft, oppression, segregation and violence. The Nakba has been made into a continuous, never ending, 66-year-old ongoing catastrophe. Palestinians have been bombed, shot, detained, brutalized, tortured, dehumanized, occupied, and worse. All in our name.
        </p>
        <p>
         We Jews have a lot of blood on our hands, we have been made complicit in these inhuman acts, and we have a responsibility now to do something about it. We need to rethink what Never Again really means; does it mean for us Never Again for Jews Only, or does it mean Never Again For Everyone?
        </p>
        <p>
         I am not asking or expecting you, the whole American Jewish community, to renounce everything you have been taught to believe overnight, just yet. But I am asking and expecting you to open your minds a little, to start questioning what you have been taught. The Pro-Israel bias in our community has corrupted and stifled open free discourse for far too long. The exclusion of any dissenting Jewish opinion outside of the most narrow of ultra-Zionism has led our people into a cul-de-sac of intellectual dishonesty, moral poverty and political thuggery, where questioning is discouraged and obedience is rewarded. This must come to end, now, if we are to redeem ourselves and pave a path for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         All I ask is the following; that you reopen our community to dissenting opinion, that you open up every synagogue, every Jewish community center,
         <a href="http://www.openhillel.org/">
          every Hillel
         </a>
         , every Hebrew School, to a free debate and discussion on Israel, Palestine and the core beliefs of Zionism. I and others like me, want to make our case to you, directly, as Jews to Jews, on why the Palestinians deserve our solidarity, on why Israeli militarism must be opposed, on why the Jewish State of Israel necessarily leads to apartheid, and on why the nationalistic and supremacist beliefs of Zionism have led to the corruption of our people with the sins of racism and colonialism.
        </p>
        <p>
         I dont expect a warm reception. But I do expect at least a moment of your time, and a part of your attention. You owe it to yourself, to your people, to your children, and to all Palestinians, to enter into this discussion with open minds and open hearts and start confronting the hard questions. Please help us in taking this moment and reassess who we are, what we have done, and where we want to go from here.
        </p>
        <p>
         I look forward to the discussions ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sincerely,
         <br/>

                  <p>
                   Those Jews with blood on their hands for dispossessing non-Jews, stealing non-Jewish/non-Israeli territory by war, slaughtering innocent non-Jewish babies, children, mothers, fathers to take their land, deserve the same criticism as any other people whod do the same. Theyre vile, evil people! A disgrace to humanity and so are the dregs of humanity who blindly support them!

                   We Jews have a lot of blood on our hands, we have been made complicit in these inhuman acts, and we have a responsibility now to do something about it.

                   Saying Jews have blood on their hands or implying it is racist (which does not mean Jews are a race, but the point is that it is a racist kind of statement).

                   This is not about Jews. Its about nationalism. Nationalism is the common denominator when we compare Zionism to other fascist nationalistic movements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And while Judaism and Jewish identity (such as it is due to history) impart unique identifiers and such onto this particular nationalism, Zionism  the overarching problem is still the nationalism.

                   The Israeli government presents itself as the Jewish homeland and representative of Judaism. Many people actually believe it.

                  <p>
                   As an American who protested the war in Iraq I dont believe I personally have blood on my hands for the fiasco of our our invasion. I do not back our bloody meddling in Latin America or the rest of the world.

                  <p>
                   But I certainly understand when I have been confronted by foreigners who accuse Americans of having blood on their hands that I share a certain inferred guilt in their minds.

                  <p>
                   It is not their bigotry that leads them to draw such a broad generality. It is the bigotry of some many Americans beginning with our leadership that promotes such conclusions.

                  <p>
                   And so it is for Israel and Judaism.

                   The main topic of the article is that zionism should be questioned within the jewish community (and its true for most jewish communities around the world). It is an article written by a jew talking to jews and the we have blood on our hands I think is to be understood more as a slogan to wake up zionist jews rather than being an antisemitic attack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Other jews are indeed antisemitic, Gilad Atzmon for example, and you notice that they are uninterested in reaching out to jewish communities for them to question zionism. They are only interested in telling non jews how evil judaism is by essence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Nevertheless, I disagreewith Annie Robins blame on tribalism as the fundamental problem. Some of the most tribalist jewish movements have also been some of the most antizionist if we think of bundism or haredi communities. The very tribalistic jewish communities of north africa strongly rejected zionism at the begining (only to later become its most ardent supporters due to complex historical phenomenons).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The problem is not jewish tribalism (which is not an antisemitic statement, but it is a-historical and can potentially lead to antisemitism). The problem is that, facing antisemitism, world Jewry adopted a false liberation movement deeply rooted in European supremacy and colonial ideology, zionism. What a group of latin american intellectuals call coloniality (the symbolical, political and ontological consequences that colonialism had in configuring how we see and treat the other as well as ourselves) has become almost hegemonic within judaism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Tribalism has helped shape great liberation movements in the US or south Africa with say the black panthers party or Steve Bikos black consciousness movement. It has helped many subaltern groups defend themselves against oppression and alienation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Jewish history has seen unparalleled levels of oppression within the west and Europe, culminating in genocide. But the liberation movement which came out of it was rotten to the core as it transformed jews in one of western hegemonys little rabid guard dogs. Historical antizionist solutions within Judaism have failed to counter it. Whether religious orthodoxy (if we suffered genocide it was our fault, we didnt respect all of the mitzvot!), universalist leftist solutions (which in the end, are assimilationist in nature and reject jewish spirituality), bundism (most of them got killed anyways) and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Therefore, focusing on tribalism is not the way out of zionism and it is based, IMO, on a wrong understanding of the whole story. The pseudo divide between tribalism and universalism is a fake one. You can find tribalism everywhere in our societies: in unions, in professions, in social classes (in the marxist sense), in districts, in artistic subcultures, in politics, and yes, sometimes in religion and ethnicity too.
                   <br/>
                   Yet these tribalisms dont necessarily produce inhumane violence as what we are seeing in Gaza. Because the explaining factor of the violence suffered by Palestinians is not tribalism, it is colonialism. The ideology which is both cause and consequence of this colonialism has completely infected our jewish communities everywhere in the world. This what jewish antizionists ought to fight against, not pseudo tribalism.

                   The IDF in Gaza reminds me of the French armys response to the Algerian war of independence, 1954-62. The French won the battle, in good part by their willingness to employ inhumane methods and to censor the domestic press. But they lost the war.
                   <br/>
                   Zionism is an attempted colonialist solution to a European sociological problem called (not very accurately) antisemitism. As such, Zionism is doomed as all of European colonialism has been doomed. I reached this conclusion in the 1970s. The fall of National Party rule in South Africa bears out my thinking here.
                   <br/>
                   I do not agree that the IDF is genocidal. But I do agree that Israel has become an apartheid regime, based on a deep disdain for Moslem Arabs.
                   <br/>
                   I support Iron Dome and the destruction of the Gaza tunnels. But I condemn in the strongest terms the argument that because Hamas allegeldy uses human shields, and because the use of human shields contravenes international law (I do not believe that international law applies wars of liberation), then the IDF is blameless when civilians die in Gaza. When fighting against colonialism, one uses the weapons at hand, and a very common weapon in anti-colonial struggles is the fact that many voters in the colonial power are people with a conscience.

                   It is very curious that the branch of Judaism that has seen most clearly that there is something fundamentally wrong with Zionism, is the haredim, esp. Naturei Kara and Satmar.

                   wow, I feel honored that you explained this to me twice!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I read this article by this Jewish gentleman. This makes good sense to me:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Palestinians have suffered greatly at our hands. They have been violently forced from their land and homes to appease the Holocaust guilt of Europe and the greed of Zionist colonists. They have been forced to live under an openly Jim Crow, discriminatory and segregationist Jewish Only apartheid state. And the whole process has become endemic in its repetition, with wave after wave after wave of land theft, oppression, segregation and violence. The Nakba has been made into a continuous, never ending, 66-year-old ongoing catastrophe. Palestinians have been bombed, shot, detained, brutalized, tortured, dehumanized, occupied, and worse. All in our name.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We Jews have a lot of blood on our hands, we have been made complicit in these inhuman acts, and we have a responsibility now to do something about it. We need to rethink what Never Again really means; does it mean for us Never Again for Jews Only, or does it mean Never Again For Everyone?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In that context and in the entire article, he makes good sense to me and is not at all racist. I think that all Americans have Palestinian blood on our hands for our governments continued support of Israels murderous actions, theft, and the ongoing Nakba lo these many years. I also think that we have the blood of millions of others on our hands. Is that racist?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think not.

                   Never mind calling others racist. If you dont renounce this bloody legacy built on crimes against others, then you are part of the problem and

                   Yes, if you believe jews have blood on their hands for being just jews you are a racist.

                  <p>
                   I dont see that he is saying jews have blood on their hands * just for being jews*.
                   <br/>
                   I believe what he is meaning is that the Jewish communitywithout counting the numbers on who did/does and did/didnt support zionism- has some responsibility for letting it get to this bloody point because they are a community that has generally supported Israel.
                   <br/>
                   IMO anyone, jew or gentile, non jew, whoever, that has/ had any interest at all, any inkling of what has and is going on in Israel or P/I  but because of their own religon, ethnic ties or politics *will not accept* the gory truth of P/I and *speak against it* does indeed have  some blood at least on their hands.
                   <br/>
                   I have railed against this for years, warned it would get worse and worse but yet I have to say I didnt do enough, didnt drop everything to do more or something different about it so yea I dont feel squeaky clean myself.

                   I am still confounded by the statement. I believe the article was about separating Zionism and nationalism from Judaism and had nothing to do with racism. Perhaps I am wrong. I am ok with that.

                   actually, aside from mentioning
                   <i>
                    Every facet of our Jewish life has been infected with Zionism
                   </i>
                   (and the like) the author doesnt mention judaism even once.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   just, people just take away different things from an article thats all. in terms of the authors intent, i think its a really good letter. but..hes not writing it to me. if theres one thing ive learned here over the years, is that i definitely wasnt raised in any kind of insular tribal sort of environmentmeaning..i just never had this sense i was in some larger clan so to speak, other than just being american or part of the human race.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   i think, on the other hand, for a large part of the jewish community its different. and this difference has perhaps facilitated a feeling of a demand to be loyal to this tribe think, or something. a conditioning of sorts of an obligation. an obligation i only have for members of my immediate family or close friends.orwhat is morally right. but not to a very large group of a certain million people or anything. so, when i read the letter my ears
                   <i>
                    did
                   </i>
                   picked up on:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   <i>
                    We Jews have a lot of blood on our hands, we have been made complicit in these inhuman acts, and we have a responsibility now to do something about it.
                   </i>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   i just thought to myself, well..that could be said about most americans. and i thought, why am i not included in this message? why is he only speaking to jews? and of course, like all people, some are much more complicit than others whether they are jewish or non jewish. and i reject the idea jews, as a whole, should be blamed for whats happening there. i think that kind of thinking leads to retribution for all jews. just like i reject the notion muslims have to be or should be called to account for terrorism committed in the name of islam. i just do not think its helpful. so to me, when i read jpbs statement i thought, well, thats right. one cant really say that every jew has blood on their hands. its too much to lay on one people as a whole. its a terrific burden to lay on a child for example. i mean really. does a 5 year old jewish kid who lives in nebraska have blood on his/her hands? of course not. does a 15 yr old high school trumpet player in fresno who plays in the school band who happens to be jewish, is that kid more responsible for gaza than other kids in his school band, just because he is jewish?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so if, like me, someone is reading thru this and that line happens to jump out at them ..then a natural thought trajectory might be.that kind of blame is racist. albeit obviously not the authors intent. its part of a group think and if one is accustomed to accepting group think and group responsibility then it seems like normal speech. but as an american, i have (and we have) blood on my hands for this situation. we facilitate this. its a bunch of cowards who let this go on. i mean look at obama, hes not jewish and hes facilitated this just like millions of non jewish americans. its not only jews who kowtow to this zionist narrative and its going to take a much larger group than american jews to turn it around. much much larger.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   anyway. hope thats helpful.

                   I certainly did not mean to cause a ruckus weve got many better ways to channel our frustration and energy toward the folks that need to be made fully aware of what is being done in our name.

                   You got blood on your hands cause Zionism? Well, if its real blood, I hope you meet with prosecution for your crimes. You got figurative blood on your hands? You can go around out, damn-spotting or wash it the hell off.
                   <br/>
                   Do you give up and say, become a neo-conservative tea-partier because of the figurative blood you have on your hands as an American? No, you disclaim it, within the context of being an American citizen.
                   <br/>
                   With a religion, its even easier. You dont have to pay taxes to your Temple.

                   </i>
                   because of things Zionists have done, because maybe I put money in the Blue Box? Or even believed in it, at one time? No, theyre going to have to work a little harder than that to get me to take on their guilt. Ive got better things to feel guilty about.
                   <br/>
                   I feel
                   <i>
                    angry
                   </i>
                   about it. Not guilty, screw that

               Dear American Jewish community, its time to talk! And talk, and talk, and talk. Because the more we talk, the more we try to give the impression that Zionism answers to Jews, and can be persuaded, the more space and time Zionism buys.
               <br/>
               And remember, if Zionism takes even one of our suggestions, they own us! (We did what you wanted, and look what happened!)
               <br/>
               Also, we will feel sort of absurd, like somebody outside a homocidal maniacs cell, saying Oh, let me go in and talk to him, hell listen to me! Sure.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its time for American Jews to save what they can from the Zionists. Not save the Zionists from themselves. Its time to turn our backs on them.
               <br/>
               If there is anything the Zionists know how to do, its handle Jews, manipulate Jews, and use Jews. I say stay the hell away from them and their works. You try to help them, and they will bite your hand, same as they have always done. They are much less afraid of Jews than anybody else.

                 Mooser, say what you wish about Benjamin Silverman but when it comes to identifying responsibility  a necessary precursor for effective action  I find him a lot more convincing than Professor Ellis.

                 MOOSER- If there is anything the Zionists know how to do, its handle Jews, manipulate Jews, and use Jews.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A rather accurate assessment. Zionism has been spectacularly successful in replacing Jewish apparent fondness for socialism with demonstrable Jewish new-found love of militarism and Israel. This, of course, was a necessary change to enable Jews to ascend the corridors of power. It was after Israels military success in 1967 that Trotskyists became neocons, and empire Jews became spectacularly successful.

                   I have repeatedly pointed out to Mooser that the worldwide Jewish religious establishment (the contemporary leaders of Judaism) have completely merged Judaism and Zionism into a single messianic ethno-religious nationalist ideology and that Zionism draws its key themes and memes from traditional Judaism (namely the concepts of sacred peoplehood, sacred nationhood, sacred territory and endless conflict with the nations  the unchosen nations).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I am still waiting for Mooser to engage on this topic in a substantive way, without responding with ugly Talmudic curses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Moosers latest tack is to suggest that Europeans, whites and Aryans are responsible for Zionism  not several thousand years of Jewish ethno-religious nationalism (next year in Jerusalem). The Old Testament is arguably one of the most racist and genocidal books in world literature  some people would say the most racist and genocidal  and those views are based on a religious doctrine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That would be a cute trick  to try to pretend that Zionism isnt a thoroughly Jewish movement. Its all the fault of Europeans! :) Supposedly Zionists arent real Jews, like Mooser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Truly, I find Gilad Atzmon to be a more vigorous and more truthful thinker than Mooser  and he has the guts to defend his views in fair and open debate, head-to head, toe-to-toe. His ideas hang together coherently and are eminently defensible.

                   I think anyone who wants to be taken seriously in Internet discussions needs to be able to test his or her views in fair, open and reasonable debate, regardless of his or her level of fame. I have seen Gilad engage in quite a few vigorous debates and take the heat with grace. (Not sure about the comment policy on his blog  I will check that out.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You are one of the most fearless debaters I have encountered on the net  that is one reason why I respect you. You are intellectually honest, well-informed and stand your ground under heavy pressure from opponents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Regarding the connections between Zionism and 19th and early 20th century nationalist and ethnic nationalist movements in Europe  you are correct  Zionism was strongly influenced by those developments. But each ethnic nationalist movement draws upon its own sources of inspiration  holy texts, myths, legends, etc.  and has to take responsibility for its own beliefs, policies and actions. Contemporary Zionism relies much more on biblical texts for its ideology and program than on European sources. (And you will notice that Europe abandoned ethnic nationalism after the debacle of Nazism and Italian Fascism.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The most salient point in my mind is that the Jewish religious establishment has fully embraced Zionism (Jewish ethnic nationalism)  I think that establishment needs to take responsibility for its decisions. Jewish religious leaders exert enormous influence within the Jewish community  they have the power to move views on Israel and Zionism in a positive direction if they choose to exercise it. I wish they would.

                   There is no such thing as guilt or merit that comes purely by heredity or by agreeing with people who do bad or good things on topics not concerning those things that they do. I share what I think is the majority Mondoweiss view that Zionism has clearly been accepted by the majority of people who consider themselves Jewish but is, for all that, a highly inauthentic form of Jewish culture.
                   <br/>
                   There was a time when Zionism appealed at least as much to Christians as to Jews, many of whom thought that it was just a plan to export them from Europe and America. That time is over, I admit.

                   weve had this conversation or one like it so many times sean. and while i agree with you in large part about this infusion of zionism into judaism and vice versa to strengthen the grip of zionism i still believe, for the most part, zionism is primarily a function of colonialism, or something.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   i think theres a growing secular-ness in the jewish community (and obviously jews who follow judaism outside a monolith zionism org), especially the youth. and regardless of what zionism has become, so thoroughly drenched within the religious community, its roots were secular and its intentions were not very different that other nationalists of that day and age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so when you say reject the idea
                   <i>
                    Europeans, whites and Aryans are responsible for Zionism
                   </i>
                   and suggest
                   <i>
                    several thousand years of Jewish ethno-religious nationalism
                   </i>
                   are at the core of contemporary Zionism, it suggests to me that its not primarily a colonialist project very much intended, by secularists, to take over the land.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   the reliance of biblical texts, which was also used and promoted in christian zionism happened with a lot of intent after the fact (and that can be seen in the morphing of the bible interpretation). i think as the secular community grows so will anti zionism. and i dont think its required to reject judaism (which is a religion, not a people) to reject zionism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   but more immediately in this conversation, frankly i think having a person suggest someone should give up there identity as a jew, what kevin said, to just walk away from being jewish if thats who they are, is weird (not to mention rude and none of someone elses business). and then you chime in, in an antagonistic insulting goading way, (repeatedly pointed out to Mooser , I am still waiting for Mooser to engage, Moosers latest tackand That would be
                   <b>
                    a cute trick
                   </b>
                    to try to pretend that Zionism isnt a thoroughly Jewish movement. )
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   but alas, youve just admitted yourself Zionism isnt a thoroughly Jewish, when you said Zionism was strongly influenced by 19th and early 20th century nationalist and ethnic nationalist movements in Europe. zionism is, and remains primarily tool of colonialism regardless if contemporary zionism relies on or has merged with biblical texts. (recall most religious jews rejected zionism initially so claiming its origins are biblical is a non starter).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   non religious jews, many of them are not zionists. and you continually go back to referencing American Jewish establishment as if every jew is part of some establishment. they simply are not all engaged with this group think, nor is there any requirement to be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so you launch into your critique against mooser, goading him to engage you over this American Jewish establishment which as far as i know, he isnt part of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   frankly, i dont get it. whats the point? working for a showdown in the MW threads?

                   I dunno. I see lots of sync between Atzmons and Moosers POV. Whats most interesting is precisely how they differ on any issue related to Israels actual conduct and the reasoning behind it. What they seem most troubled by is whether or not they want to be part of the chosen people at all. Lots of inherited baggage there, both pro and con. Maybe Jerry Springer can have them both on, with Socrates being a third contestant for a date with the girl, who is Plato? The audience could be divided between Bill Kristol clones and Code Pink clones. No room for Audie Murphy, and besides, whats he got to contribute anyway? The Troubles? Or should Quentin Tarintino be the clone model on either side of the audience?

                    zionism is primarily a function of colonialism..annie
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have always disagreed with that description of zionism and think using the colonizer label misrepresents and downplays what it really was-and some who use it may do so to deliberately down play the true nature of it so they can compare it to other colonizing of the past. Zionism was about taking over land and to create a Nation on it -not merely colonize a country for economic gain thru its resources and native laborwhich was what most past colonizing was about.
                   <br/>
                   I think we can apply the colonizing label to the illegal settlements somewhat but not to zionism itself. But even there the zionist goal is to actually convert that land into their official Nation not merely have it as a semi- part or out post of the motherland or overlords running it for the colonizer.

                   Sean, do you really see Gilad Atzmon as so very different in perspective from Mooser? Atzmon has a different style which Mooser doesnt like, especially with Atzmon originally hailing from Israel, which makes Mooser suspicious of him because he does not trust most Israelis, and who can blame him? Mooser wants to save the baby from the bathwater, so to speak, when he wants to repudiate those who have used his religion to support Zionism and damn the torpedoes, whereas Atzmon is more comfortable throwing out the religion he was brought up with because, from his point of view, in his experience, it was so closely entwined with the Israeli propaganda he rejects, and probably, with his education, it was.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Atzmon sometimes turns the lingo on its head in a refreshing way. As does Mooser. Mooser is more self-deprecating, Atzmon more combative. Atzmon is more willing to bring up embarrassing history outright to puncture some conceits; Mooser prefers the pinprick rather than the bludgeon. Some people need the intellectual bludgeon, some might just need the pinpricks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And Sean, really, are you still under the impression that go boil your head was some sort of ugly talmudic curse? Because Im pretty sure Mooser, the little

                   So she looked over at me and said: You know this whole gay-marriage thing is really changing my thinking. I may just divorce you, and marry a

                   I should worry myself about that? With Sean here to answer for me? Who needs my input? And if Sean doesnt satisfy you, many, many other people have given their opinions (every one of them long and well considered) on the state of my Jewishness.
                   <br/>
                   Why should I wonder about it, when Ive got so many smart people to give either me the answer, or in this case, anybody else who asks? Im telling you, its a load off my mind. My identity is in good hands.

                  Its time for American Jews to save what they can from the Zionists. Not save the Zionists from themselves. Its time to turn our backs on them. If there is anything the Zionists know how to do, its handle Jews, manipulate Jews, and use Jews.

                 This is what I find confusing: you are positing two groups  good American Jews and bad Zionists. But the American Jewish establishment  which enjoys the support of many American Jews  are themselves passionate Zionists! Are they manipulating themselves? I dont grasp the world model here.

                   actually hes not. he said american jews and zionists. obviously this combination can make up more that 2 groups. and of course people within subgroups get manipulated by their own kind, all the time. i mean look at israel hasbara directed towards israeli citizens:

                   try harder, this is not that complicated. first id suggest comprehending there are more than a handful of free thinkers or free agents who self identify as american jews. iow, you have to extract this concept you seem wedded to that theres some jewish establishment who speaks for all jews. there just is not. but as long as you refuse to comprehend that, youre stuck in your own reality and wont get it.

                   There *is* a Jewish establishment that claims to speak for the Jewish community  the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations  which includes AIPAC, the ADL, the AJC, the leading Orthodox, Conservative and Reform organizations, and many other leading Jewish groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This institution wields enormous influence in American politics  the Jewish dissidents you refer to wield no influence at all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Here is an overview of the Conference of Presidents from Wikipedia:

                  <p>
                   By comparison, groups like JVP (Jewish Voice of Peace) are relatively inconsequential.

                   What do you think motivated Benjamin Silverman to write this article?

                  <p>
                   The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations is the most influential and powerful advocate for Zionism outside of Israel  they are not the victims of anyone and they are not being manipulated by anyone. They have embraced Jewish nationalism because they believe in it, passionately.

                  <p>
                   That the American government listens only to the Conference of Presidents on Israeli and Jewish issues, and to no other Jewish groups, underlines the point that CoP is in fact the Jewish establishment  the official face of the Jewish community that possesses real political clout.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Im not sure what were arguing about. I know that there are quite a few Jewish dissidents out there. I also know that they have no leverage over the Congress or executive branch  zip.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We both hope that this situation might change going forward  we shall see. But I am talking about things as they are right now in 2014.

                   Mooser has tried to make the argument that American Jews are victims of Zionists. Wrong. Overwhelmingly they represent the Zionist establishment by free choice and with passionate conviction. Perhaps one might argue that they have victimized themselves.

                  <p>
                   well, the way things are right now there is a lot of handwringing and 100s of millions of dollars invested in countering what is considered to be a very big threat to zionism. the left, anti zionists and especially the jewish youth. why would they be spending all that money if the threat was not there?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   once again, youve brought up mooser. really sean, i cant speak for him no matter how many times you claim i want to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   but i will address
                   <i>
                    your
                   </i>
                   statement:
                   <i>
                    Overwhelmingly they represent the Zionist establishment by free choice and with passionate conviction.
                   </i>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   they being american jews in the context of your paragraph. youre saying american jews represent the zionist establishment. and youre also saying the zionist establishment represents them. so they represent each other. thats a nice neat little box youve got sewn up there sean and the only american jews outside that box are quite a few Jewish dissidents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   <i>
                    Im not sure what were arguing about.
                   </i>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   well, in my perception of things there are actually very few people who inevitably control the masses or the perception of the masses. . not millions of people. so i would no more say american jews represent the zionist establishment. than i would say americans represent congress. i make a distinction between those in power and those they seek to, or do, represent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   but theres something most people in power have in common, (represented by the old story of the emperor w/no clothes) and that is that theres a powerful tool in having people think everyone supports them whether they do or not. so those who control the image of the masses can control the masses. it keeps people from stepping out of line and it starts at a very young age. thats why dissent (like the 99% protests) burst the bubble of that image and become dangerous for the establishment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so by agreeing with the jewish establishment that they represent american jews, and perpetuating that notion, you are actually serving that establishment. you are doing their work for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   so how we disagree is that i think those of us who object to the zionist state, including american jews of which i think there are more than a few inconsequential dissidents, are making a difference. and you seem to think we have no power because congress votes 100-0. i think the masses in this country have been victims of the establishment, i think they use us to create the idea they are all powerful (like the way zionist trolls always say the vast majority of americans support israel) they did what they do in our name and brainwash americans thru the media from a young age (accusations of anti semite or self hating jew (depending on whether one is jewish or not) for those who step out of the zionist narrative) and use us as hosting agents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   but since you believe theres generally no distinction between american jews and the establishment, i dont know, it sounds to me like youre just part of that cog that perpetuates the idea of a streamlines boxed in group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   i see them more as free agents, albeit possibly more conditioned from birth not to step out of line.

                  <p>
                   I agree decidedly with your analysis here of how a small number of people at the top of the power pyramid are manipulating most Americans in destructive and self-destructive ways  so for the time being let me just say that I hope we can all combine our efforts to try to change the status quo on many important issues  not just Mideast or Israeli issues. (I have in mind radical wealth inequality, state mass surveillance, and many other issues.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have always agreed with you on most issues  the question of the role of religion in Zionism opened up a few disagreements between us. We can set that aside for the time being if you would like.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Its easy to set up Google Alerts to track that topic  which Ive done  and I see a flood of disturbing news on that front on a daily basis. You have other interests, and I respect that. And thanks again for all the work you do here at Mondoweiss.

                   . The American Jewish community (whatever exactly that is) organising to put pressure on the people who push the POTUS around? I dont think so.
                   <br/>
                   But for like-minded American Jews to rent a storefront, put up a sign, get hold of a Rabbi who shares the convictions, and start practicing Non-Zionist Judaism, (really, it wont be that hard) website, mailing list, possibly hold public events to explain, etc, that maybe we could manage.
                   <br/>
                   Nobody has to join who doesnt want to, and theres a lot of empty storefronts.

                   For Christs sake, I dont know if theres two groups But well never find out, will we, until somebody tries to establish a place for that other group to form, support each other, make themselves known. And that, at least, is quite practical and doable.

                   I thought that the way Phil posed the question was setting himself up for a Mooser response. I was going to say typical Mooser response' but then I realized that that would be setting myself up for a typical Mooser response.

                   Dear American Jewish community, its time to talk! And talk, and talk, and talk. Because the more we talk, the more we try to give the impression that Zionism answers to Jews, and can be persuaded, the more space and time Zionism buys.

                   @Mooser,
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Your use of humor to highlight ridiculous reality is heart-warming, and there is no sarcasm intended here. The farcical nature of this essay by Benjamin Silverman is too much to face.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When we have argued for human rights and international law, we have been ostracized and excluded from all aspects of mainstream Jewish life. When we have argued against an exclusionary, segregationist regime, we have been attacked with the most vicious of slanders; self-hating Jews, Nazi collaborators, and worse. When we have tried to stand up against colonialist violence and occupations, we have been met with angry rejection from our closest friends and family.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So, whats new Ben? What has changed? Do you think that your plea to Israel right or wrong Zionist American Jews, by far the majority of American Jewry, is going to elicit an invitation to dialog? Shouldnt your plea be directed to Americans as a whole, who could have a real effect in taming the monster Israel?

                   Im sure that whatever way Phil tries to organize hell be honest and do his best. And inclusive, even tho I thought that it was put a bit clumsily (since hell really be organizing individuals, not communities, I think). But then, Im the only guy who believes the about page.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But Im reaching a different conclusion, and harder conclusion. Im becoming convinced that only
                   <i>
                    repudiation
                   </i>
                   in the most complete and concrete way possible, will help.
                   <br/>
                   Dont even think Im worried about what the non-Jews or Gentiles will do to Jews as a result of this. That is something that
                   <i>
                    doesnt
                   </i>
                   enter into it at all. I have no way of knowing that and I cant speculate on it. And I dont care what happens, nobody is going to make me worry about that now.
                   <br/>
                   No, I think repudiation is necessary to save
                   <i>
                    Jews
                   </i>
                   from the Zionists, from Israel. Any attempt to moderate or influence them will be to be manipulated by them. The idea that Zionists will somehow be susceptible to my advice, or deal with me honorably or honestly because I am, like them, Jewish, is insulting both to what there is of my intelligence and to my principles.
                   <br/>
                   So if there
                   <i>
                    is
                   </i>
                   going to be a conversation, I hope repudiation will be, well, not even the most extreme thing discussed. Given the resources and organization of the Jewish community as an actual Jewish community, it might be about the only concrete effective thing that could be done. It would at least give the opportunity to Jews who wanted to be in some tangible part of a Jewish community (that is part of a community formed or joined by some aspect of Jewishness or the Jewish religion) to try and keep their kids safe from Zionists, and keep themselves and their
                   <i>
                    schul
                   </i>
                   out of the clutches of Zionists and free from Zionism. Not the repudiation of Judaism or Jewishness, however you like actualize those things certainly not, no, the repudiation of Zionism.

                   Lets ask you, are you commenting to wipe Israel off the map, or save it from itself? Im just an ordinary American taxpayer, brought up to believe in certain American values, which I dont see displayed very often either domestically, or in foreign affairs and foreign aid. Im really a geezer, and its been this way since I turned adult. Many recently have asked,  Does Never Again apply to all humans, or just Jews? From what I decipher, Atzmon and Mooser both agreeit applies to all humans. IMO, the distinction between Atzmon and Mooser is that Atzmon sees a link between the way Judaism is taught in Jewish religious schools and Jewish history classes, and whats now happening in Gaza. Mooser, seems to me, to say theres no link, but look what happening in Gaza. Seems to me, Atzmon (Former IDF soldier) understands Lindemanns Esaus Tears (Modern anti-Semitism and the rise of the Jews, copyright 1997), a tad more than Mooser. Dont get me wrong, I think both Atzmon and Mooser are valuable humans. Further, I have no doubt Atzmon is a real humanist who happens to be a great jazz player. As for Mooser, well, he says hes a moose with antlers. And he does jazz up MW. So now Im left with Phil Weiss well, he banned Atzmon, welcomes Mooser. Says he wants to appeal for humanitarian reasons to both Americas Jews and Non-Jews. He at least gives real data to anybody in USA whos trying to understand the I-P conflict and US role in it. That alone makes him a good human being. I say all three deserve to live and prosper, as if I were a Roman chief directing my thumb at the gladiator fight. Yet make no mistake, those innocent trapped people in Gaza dying have loved ones and families just like me and you, as we type protected and comfortable in our homes, here on MW.

                   I know, it gave me a start, too. I was thinking, it isnt a hard enough job just sticking with the demands of the about page, now he wants to organize, already?. And Id dial back the Colossus bit, to a foot in the door.

                   <br/>
                   Really? Maybe Phil was mainly sticking with his about page on his blog; after all, one thing hes definitely doing is organizing and feeding data to his blog so folks can learn things not available in the American media about the I-P situation and the US special relationship to it? Anyway, hes talking about two feet in the door, not one. Got a problem with that? Careful. I know you know America is only around 2% Jewish. And I know you know how the US SC vetoes go on anything Israel, and I know you know US Congress just fed more $ to Iron Kippa, and gave Israel a blank check to replace its Palestinian kid-killing mission munitions stockpile in Israel at even more US expense.

                   Why not speak plainly, not behind your Moose pen name, what are you driving at regarding Phil Weisss motive or agenda?

                   Okay, youve cornered me, and Ill tell you the truth and straight out, no equivocating or jokes. I think Phils motive is to try and make a positive contribution to a terrible situation as best he can, and his agenda? I think his agenda is to be the best journalist and writer on the subject he can be.
                   <br/>
                   Why, Citizen, do you have an other explanation for why he puts so much work and time into this? Please, lets hear it.

                    Any attempt to moderate or influence them will be to be manipulated by them. The idea that Zionists will somehow be susceptible to my advice, or deal with me honorably or honestly because I am, like them, Jewish, is insulting both to what there is of my intelligence and to my principles.Mooser

               Gosh, if only somebody could come up with a couple of concrete examples of things Israel might do to at least ameliorate the situation somewhat! I guess well have to talk about it, may take a while before anybody can think of one.

               This, all this breast-beating happaned after Cast Lead, too. Its part of the process of normalizing what Israel is doing. Well, I guess you can say if murder is reduced to a misdemeanor, its still a crime, huh?

                All I ask is the following; that you reopen our community to dissenting opinion, that you open up every synagogue, every Jewish community center, every Hillel, every Hebrew School, to a free debate and discussion on Israel, Palestine and the core beliefs of Zionism. I and others like me, want to make our case to you, directly, as Jews to Jews, on why the Palestinians deserve our solidarity, on why Israeli militarism must be opposed, on why the Jewish State of Israel necessarily leads to apartheid, and on why the nationalistic and supremacist beliefs of Zionism have led to the corruption of our people with the sins of racism and colonialism.

               We Jews have a lot of blood on our hands, we have been made complicit in these inhuman acts, and we have a responsibility now to do something about it.

               Yes, but dont stop with Palestine. All Americans are to some degree complicit in the crimes of empire. Unfortunately, the power imbalance in our society is so radically out of balance that it is difficult for the 99% to resist the 1%. Worse yet, the 99% seem to take comfort in imperial mythology, their thoughts and actions easily controlled at the macro level, exercising negligible responsibility as citizens, the all-too-willing victims of their own ideological seduction, supporting a system they dont understand nor want to, and which they basically dont want to change except to improve their own personal situation.

                 <br/>
                 I agree. And Phils mission to talk to both Jewish Americans and non-Jewish Americans I think is rational considering said complicity, often labeled the special relationship, the one raining gifted US missiles down on Gazas children, with more Iron Dome funding and replacement munitions now on the way to Israel.

               But it is not just strikes from the air that are the problem. There is more:
              </p>
              <p>
               However, military analysts and human rights observers say the IDF is still using unguided, indirect fire with high-explosive shells, which they argue is inappropriate for a densely populated area like Gaza 
              </p>
              <p>
               
               <b>
                [Israels 155m howitzer] shells have a lethal radius of 50 to 150 metres and causes injury up to 300 metres from its point of impact. Furthermore, such indirect-fire artillery (meaning it is fired out of direct sight of the target) has a margin of error of 200 to 300 metres
               </b>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Read that again: a margin of error of up to 300 metres, plus a lethal radius of up to 150 metres and an injury radius of 300 metres. So thats a killing and injury zone of close to half a kilometre from the intended precise site of impact  in a territory that is only a few kilometres wide and long. In short, one of the main shells Israel is using in Gaza is completely imprecise.

               On a side note, I just realized that were only a few weeks away from the start of classes at colleges and universities, here, and that makes me nervous.

               I think theres every chance that these issues will soon dominate campus life across the country and, this year, may even create battlegrounds in some places that are not just intellectual but also physical.

               I am sick and tired of hearing this bullshit about self hating Jew. Germans who opposed Hitlerself-hating Germans? IDF tactics strongly reminiscent of Hitlers SS goons. The persecuted turning into vicious persecutors. Turning Gaza into an open-air shooting gallery. How utterly repugnant. I am ashamed of my Jewish background. Anyone condoning this has blood on their hands and souls too.

                 Yes, where do you think the White Rose would stand on what Israel is doing in Gaza, and what US enables? I know, you know. Thanks for your comment. Please comment more.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Always amazing to me that any American can complain about the US government, and continually criticize it, but the moment any American criticizes Israels conduct they are slurred as either anti-Semitic messengers ( in 98% Goy America) or self-hating (American) Jews.

               Notice that Benjamin Silverman targets the American Jewish COMMUNITY and the Jewish COMMUNITY for his critique  which is a broader concept than the American Jewish establishment or leadership or the Jewish establishment or leadership. He also uses the term indoctrinated:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I understand that the last few weeks may have been hard for you. From a young age we all have been raised  indoctrinated even  on Pro-Israel ideology. Every facet of our Jewish life has been infected with Zionism, from our youth groups, to our synagogues, to our Hebrew schools, to our family Seders.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Well, one cant accuse Mondoweiss of not posting articles that are bold and daring.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding our people:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The exclusion of any dissenting Jewish opinion outside of the most narrow of ultra-Zionism has led OUR PEOPLE into a cul-de-sac of intellectual dishonesty, moral poverty and political thuggery, where questioning is discouraged and obedience is rewarded.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Thats a courageous article. I shudder to think of the heat he is going to take for expressing these thoughts  or of the heat Mondoweiss is going to take for publishing them. The community will not be pleased.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gilad Atzmon has dealt with these problems by withdrawing from this community and collectivist thinking in general  hes an individual relating to a world of other individuals. I am sympathetic to that mental style.

                   You have repeatedly expressed upset and even anger about associating the Israeli government, the Israel lobby and Zionism with the Jewish *community*. I am pointing out to you that Benjamin Silverman just did precisely that in this Mondoweiss article.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I myself would prefer to use the terms Jewish establishment or Jewish leadership in this context  but Silvermans article is quite solid on the whole.

                  <p>
                   and you might notice there on the first page ive blockquoted cecilie surasky, from the very same group the author is a long standing member of, jvp:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Saying something over and over again doesnt make it true. The Bay Area JCRC, and local offices of the ADL and the AJC, are not synonymous with the Bay Area Jewish Community. In fact, while the Jewish Community Relations Council claims to represent Bay Area Jews, they wont release the number or names of groups they represent. That certainly makes one wonder if the number is embarrassingly small. And its likely shrinking. There is no shortage of Jews around here, from a wide political spectrum, who would be appalled to be associated with an attack on a Muslim group for using a word that Israeli officials use regularly.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   my hunch is, the author is probably closer to my own thoughts regarding the jewish community, that yours. in fact, he might even agree that many jews are the victims or tools of zionism.

                   You didnt answer my main point: Jewish dissenters like Cecilie Surasky exercise no influence whatever over American politics. Compared to the Conference of Presidents, and the dozens of establishment Jewish organizations that are members of the CoP, they are inconsequential.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Certainly the few dissidents out there dont speak for the mainstream Jewish community  if they did, the policies of that community would be very different than they are now and Benjamin Silverman wouldnt have found it necessary to write this article.

                   Your hunch is that Benjamin Silverman agrees with Mooser that Jewish Zionists are the victims of Jewish Zionists?

                   Well, why not ask him if he believes that?

                  <p>
                   My opinion is that all individuals are responsible for their own individual views. Blaming the views of, say, William Kristol, Douglas Feith, Sheldon Adelson, David Brooks, Haim Saban, Martin Peretz or Jeffrey Goldberg on a sinister outside force strikes me as preposterous  passing the buck in the extreme. A cop-out, and rather a sleazy one.

                   well in all fairness i dont quite recall whatever conversation your referencing and what mooser may have said or not said so i am not sure if those are moosers words. nor would i claim the author agrees w/mooser. but i think the idea jews are tools of a zionist agenda is sort of a no brainer and something lots of people would agree with, including many jews. personally, i think jews are targeted and manipulated, the footsoldiers of the zionist agenda. for sure.

                   thats because your main point is full of crap. cecilie surasky is a vital member of group that puts fear in the heart of zionist leaders. the group that bleeds members from liberal zionist groups like j street. the jewish youth are flocking to groups like jvp and sjp in droves. their membership is flourishing on campuses, and conferences are held to try to stop that growth.

                  <p>
                   if they were consequential, stand w/us wouldnt beat a path to wherever it is theyre demonstrating. they also wouldnt be able to generate 10s of thousands of signatures on petitions over night, effectively influence and organize around the presby vote, and the list goes on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   of course, compared to the Conference of Presidents, and the dozens of establishment Jewish organizations that are members of the CoP, they are a small org, but definitely not inconsequential. and i dare say i think the author, who is a member of that group, would agree with me.

                   I would be more sympathetic to your argument if you could mention ways in which dissidents like Surasky have managed to influence the Obama administration, the US Congress, the Republican and Democratic Parties, the mainstream media, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I admire activists like Surasky, but I am a realist on these matters. They do not speak for the Jewish establishment (or community) and they have not had the slightest impact on American Mideast policy. Very sad, but true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Perhaps we will indeed have to agree to disagree on these matters. In no way do I want to discourage your own activism  keep up the good fight.

                   well sean, im not sure if youve noticed how many articles have been written lately either about, or referencing, that recent gallop poll mentioning american youth. the 19-32 demographic (off the top of my head, i could have that age bracket skewed). theres this concern out there (the one referenced by the is gov and ruet as the deligitimization groups or something..allegedly more threatening to the jewish state than any military threat). so while you are correct the admin and US congress is locked in, there are some people very concerned about the next generation. some hand wringing going on about how the largest demographic in support of israel is old people and republicans/white.) so my hunch is that the growth of this group and ones like it, is a threat.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   and i dont agree with you that
                   <i>
                    Cecilie Surasky exercise no influence whatever over American politics.
                   </i>
                   i think they do. and i think it was very telling a group like j street wasnt even allowed into that big jewish group, i think were seeing a push from the left using words like apartheid and bds, which sort of broke thru into the mainstream somewhat this yearalbeit not enough, i dont think that would have happened had members of groups like jvp/sjp been applying pressure these last few years.

                   its built from the ground up. theres a swelling in the ranks. and this will bear fruit eventually.

                   <br/>
                   As a practical matter, re American Jews, I see things differently as an American non-Jew. I see I have no effective voice at all when it comes to Americas funding of the Gaza massacre, and general incremental genocide of the Palestinian people as a whole. You see something else? Big question, since America is actually 98% not Jewish? Is there something in the water in S Carolina, for example, that makes American politicians Israel First , right or wrong , the way to go? I dont get it at all, not sure I even get the distinction between N and S Rebel states,when it comes to rubber-stamping whatever Israel does,

                   Exactly, and repudiation is doable, practical, and will attract notice. And give people who do want to be Jewish, live out aspects of their Jewishness, but cant abide Zionism, a chance to do that.
                   <br/>
                   Judaism belongs to the people who are Jewish. If any Jew (or in my case, a typical Jew) wants to iterpret and actualize his or her religion with Zionism, they have a right to.

              <p>
               I think Benjamin Silverman knows the Jewish community better than you do  he speaks as an insider. And he made no effort to blame Zionism on colonialism or to filter Zionism through a Marxist critique or any other anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist narrative or conceptual framework  he goes much deeper than that.
              </p>
              <p>
               (All serious students of Zionism, by the way, know that many of the early Zionist leaders were themselves Marxists.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding Mooser: I am asking him to defend his claim that Jews are the victims or tools of Zionism  an assertion that makes no sense on the surface or after close inspection. So far he hasnt lifted a finger to explain himself. The worldwide Jewish establishment itself has been the main promoter of Zionism.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why dont you let Mooser speak for himself, debate for himself and express his own thoughts? He has never been shy about about challenging other commenters here (often with a great deal of verbal abuse). I want to understand why he is making the claims that he has made  they make absolutely no sense to me.

                 are you suggesting i am censoring mooser? because i am not. it seems to me like he is speaking for himself, in fact hes made a lot of comments on this thread. maybe hes just not saying what you want him to say or addressing your obsession. i cant do anything about that sean. maybe you should take your own advice and let Mooser speak for himself, debate for himself and express his own thoughts?
                </p>
                <p>
                 im not the one hounding mooser, you are.

                   Quite the contrary  I am stating factually that whenever I try to engage in a discussion with Mooser concerning statements he has made that I find curious, you rush in and intervene  speaking for him. Isnt Mooser capable of speaking for himself and defending his own ideas?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Regarding hounding Mooser  I have been much more civil to him than he has been to many other commenters here (including myself). I am trying to engage him in reasonable discussion about important issues (like the relations between Judaism and Zionism) on which he has expressed strident opinions on Mondoweiss.

                   The fact that you describe efforts to engage Mooser in rational discussion here on a few points that he himself has raised as an obsession, when he has posted more than 16,000 comments on Mondoweiss  many of them abusive and obsessively focused on particular individuals  strikes me (and some other people here) as peculiar.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You need to step back, Annie, and notice that you are not engaging in these interventions on behalf of any other commenter on Mondoweiss. Others here are independent adults and can stand on their own two feet  they dont need extra help.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now: where is Mooser on the issue of Jewish Zionists being the victims of Jewish Zionists? I am interested in hearing his thoughts. When I hear that line of argument I laugh  more than I laugh at Moosers standup comedy.

                   You have repeatedly misstated my views on this:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>

                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   That is not my view  that is the view of the contemporary Jewish religious establishment  *not* my view  and that view is exerting tremendous influence on the beliefs and behavior of religious Zionists  Orthodox, Conservative and Reform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And this isnt a theory  its a fact, amply documented by the official statements of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish leaders over the last half century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think this may be the most important issue of all concerning all the debates about Israel, Zionism and the Israel lobby. Feel free to disgree  but please at least make an effort to represent my views accurately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Zionism has morphed into a religion  the contemporary face of Judaism  and religions are impossible to argue with on rational or pragmatic grounds. That is why it is so difficult to make effective headway in changing the views of many leading Israeli leaders and pro-Israel activists.

                  <p>
                   and just to be clear are you saying:

                  <p>
                   Zionism has morphed into a religion  the contemporary face of Judaism

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   btw, lots of theories are true. im just wondering is a secular zionist would agree with you theyre actually practicing a religion called zionism.

                   What distinctions do I personally make between Judaism and Zionism? Well, I am sympathetic to Enlightenment Reform Judaism of the type that revered universal human values and explicitly discarded nationalism as a key element of Judaism. Very few current establishment Jewish religious leaders would agree with me  that era of Judaism has dissolved and disappeared for the mainstream Jewish religious community, to be replaced by devotion to Jewish nationalism and Israel.

                   and what about political zionism? do you see that as a powerful force? worthy of focus?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   one of the distinctions i make between zionism and judaism is one i consider primarily political and the other, regardless of how organized jewry has appropriated judaism to serve the zionist project, is a spiritual endeavor open to interpretation that can easily be practiced by the individual without the appropriation of land, as a communion with god.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   and because it requires individual interpretation it means anyone at anytime can alter the way they practice it. it can morph just as easily away from zionism as it did towards it generationally or otherwise.

                   There are few distinctions between political and religious Zionism now  religion gets dragged into discussions about Israel all the time, usually by Jewish religious Zionists and Christian Zionists, usually as a pretext to rationalize or justify Israeli policies, especially with regard to the ever-expanding settlements.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Political and religious Zionism constitute a single juggernaut  which is why Zionism is often described now as an ethno-religious nationalist movement  not simply an ethnic nationalist movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Many people are not aware of how many prominent Zionists in American life are religious Zionists  that would include Thomas Friedman, Dennis Ross, Elliott Abrams, Douglas Feith, Michael Ledeen, David Brooks and many, many other household names (in the Mondoweiss household). Once you start digging, its amazing. For them, this is about BOTH politics and religion.

                   <p>
                    I think Benjamin Silverman knows the Jewish community better than you do  he speaks as an insider. And he made no effort to blame Zionism on Judaism or biblical text  he goes much deeper than that.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Two passages from Silvermans article:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Every facet of our Jewish life has been infected with Zionism, from our youth groups, to our synagogues, to our Hebrew schools, to our family Seders.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    All I ask is the following; that you reopen our community to dissenting opinion, that you open up every synagogue, every Jewish community center, every Hillel, every Hebrew School, to a free debate and discussion on Israel, Palestine and the core beliefs of Zionism.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   But that discussion is not occurring in mainstream Jewish religious institutions  why?  mainstream Jewish religious leaders believe on religious grounds  on beliefs rooted in Judaism  that Zionism is a righteous ideology  the natural expression of Judaism. In fact, they no longer draw any distinctions between Judaism and Zionism at all.

                   sean, heres the problem with your logic. stating

                   does not support the notion the author believes Zionism is  the natural expression of Judaism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   those are your words, not silvermans and nothing youve written or blockquoted changes that. in fact, i agree w/silverman, practically everything he said in his article. but i wouldnt think of using that to claim he agreed with me on the roots of zionism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   could you please blockquote the part of the article that discusses the roots of zionism? because if the author didnt address those roots, how do we know what he believes? do we even know if the author is religious or secular?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   he wants a discussion on the core beliefs of Zionism, but where did he say those core beliefs are inseparable from judaism?

                   I didnt say that Silverman believes that Zionism is the natural expression of Judaism. I said that the *Jewish religious leadership* believes that  and those official representatives of the Jewish community have effectively marginalized and censored dissidents like Silverman and Surasky. Until that belief system is changed, there will be little progress in pushing back against the Israel lobby in the United States.

                   so you dont believe Zionism is the natural expression of Judaism? i misunderstood you, i thought you were trying to build the case the author would agree with you. and i thought youve agued time and again that zionism and judaism had essentially been fused together.

                   Yep, I see that re the discussion of how much traditional Jewish history/religious teachingcant really separate them since they are united, is a major problem. I think Atzmon addresses this, but not this blog.

                   The mental and emotional blocks in addressing this issue  the mutual ideological infiltration of Judaism and Zionism  are so intense as to be unbelievable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Gilad Atzmon is a very smart guy and was able to cut through this mental complex quite easily. He possess a mind unencumbered by the usual narrow cultural conditioning we all undergo.

                    The Reform Jewish movement is now in the process of abandoning its traditional opposition to Jewish nationalism and adopting a Zionist worldviewgoing so far as to encourage American Jews to emigrate to Israel which, in the view of todays Reform leaders, is central to Judaism and is, in fact, the only place where a full Jewish life can be led.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This represents an almost complete reversal of the philosophy embraced by those who created Reform Judaism in the U.S. in the 19th century. The Pittsburgh Platform of 1885, the basic statement of Reform principles, defined Jews as a purely religious community and rejected the idea that they constituted a nation.

                   Yes, a very strict standard of theological, liturgical and political uniformity is enforced by the Jewish Pope. All materials in all Temples are standardized, and teaching methods are rigorously controlled. Regular inspection of Jewish facilities insures compliance! And all Jewish people are compelled to demonstrate satisfactory Scripture Knowledge! And woe to those who pass the test by dint of a list of begats inscribed on their shirt-cuffs or middy-blouse!

                   Because if we dont have the conversation there, it isnt a Jewish conversation?. Rent a hall. Sounds to me like you want to go into the lions den to discuss whats for dinner.
                   <br/>
                   Watch how fast every synagogue/Hebrew School opens up to the discussion once theres someplace else Jews can go. I dont have a damn thing to discuss with them.

                   After all, if a bunch of Jews, get together in that context, to do something they label as Jewish, an objective, a project, well, that thing becomes, by definition, Jewish almost doesnt matter what it is. Weve already seen that.

                 The notion the Jewish nationalists are the victims of Jewish nationalists strikes me as absurd on its face  unless you are making the assumption that Jews are not free and independent individuals who are capable of taking responsibility for their own beliefs and actions  and that would be a highly insulting assumption.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many of the leading Jewish neoconservatives (who are militant Jewish nationalists) have Ph.D.s from elite universities like Harvard, Yale and Princeton. No one is leading them around by the nose or tricking them. Stop looking for some mysterious outside agent to explain their behavior.

                   what can we as a country do about our politicians kowtowing to israel? expose them. yell about israeli crimes and how they suck up to zionist money during the election cycle. make loyalty oaths to israel and trips to israel an embarrassment for them. last i heard they still need our vote to get into office.

                   I agree we Americans need to do all you say. I do it daily as much as I can. But SCOTUS has opened the door to even more ways our single votes can be made useless by equating corporations with humans in terms of our political campaign finance system, and surely you realize the real power to win power is not in our votes? Theres a reason why theres so much talk about a vote not meaning much if all you have to vote for is Tweedledee and Tweedledum, as presented by big money bag donors with a singularly focused special interest. Every day we Americans can read and see that the US Congress can not agree on anything, except more funding and diplomatic cover for Israel, a foreign country thats not even technically an ally of America and has never shed a single soldiers live fighting alongside US soldiers.

               Thank you for your truth and bravery, Mr. Silverman. Your leadership on this road is not an easy one for sure, as many of comments reflect, as they reflect exactly the dynamics you speak truth to in the Jewish community. I am not Jewish, but know many who have been punished gravely for speaking up and for simply providing the facts. Indeed, many of us non-Jews of all races are quickly silenced. Bravo to you, the mountain is moving, albeit slowly. Your sisters and brothers in the struggle for human rights for all  not for some  are with you.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                and this fact, can you document Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish leaders stating zionism is a religion, the contemporary face of Judaism?
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Document that particular quote? The point is that they have blended together Judaism and Zionism in their public statements on both Judaism and Israeli politics  erased the line between the two ideologies and made them one. It shouldnt be necessary to Google up a few thousand articles from the Jewish and Israeli press to convince you of this  you read that press yourself and know the score.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                btw, lots of theories are true. im just wondering is a secular zionist would agree with you theyre actually practicing a religion called zionism.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Not all Zionists are religious Zionists but most Zionists are religious Zionists these days. And the rhetoric of many secular Zionists is grounded in religious myths and symbols  see David Ben-Gurion, for instance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Zionism has been heavily religionized  that is why it is impossible to have a rational discussion with so many Zionists  you are arguing with true believers in what in many respects has the attributes of a cult  an Old Testament cult to be specific, based on the concepts of sacred peoplehood, nationhood and territory. One hears that strain of messianic Old Testament rhetoric in Benjamin Netanhayus speeches.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is the mindset that Jewish dissidents like Surasky and Silverman are up against  its a tough nut to crack.

                 can you find one expert source who says zionism is a religion. if this is indeed a fact it shouldnt be that hard. youve made the argument this is fact as opposed to theory and buttressed by claims its amply documented by the official statements of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish leaders over the last half century.
                </p>
                <p>
                 i just have not heard jewish leaders saying zionism, per se, is a religion. but i understand and agree w/your point  they have blended together Judaism and Zionism in their public statements on both Judaism and Israeli politics, i just not understanding how zionism, which began and still very much operates as a political colonialist construct, is now defined as a religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 but im open!
                </p>
                <p>
                 id also like to make the point that by blending zionism into a religion, for those who do, how that facilitates manipulating the masses. this is one way throughout history religious and political institutions have manipulated cultures and societies into doing their bidding. it is in this way the masses become the unwitting victims of both the religious and political powers of the day. thats not new at all however laughable you might find the notion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 but i do make a distinction between political and religious constructs. i dont believe zionism is a religion. but unlike you i am not claiming my ideas are facts.

                   Did anybody ever admit Communism was a religion? Yet, wasnt it perceived as such by many notables with high credentials? Ideology and religion are not the same? I agree only in the sense that one posits a God or G-D, and a heaven for the dead, the other posits a first principle to govern life here on earth, to make earth heaven for the living.

                   who were or were not communists? iow, did communists call it a religion. my point is that is you have an opinion about someone or something thats perfectly valid, to have an opinion. but to state it was fact and claim lots of notable communists leaders agree with you then it makes sense to quote one while making your claim.

               I just saw the following and it strikes me wrong. Do Jews like this have blood on their hands? Is it bloody to pray for yourselves and your Jewish union and to protect Israel and not a word or prayer for the people your Jewish union in your Jewish state are slaughtering?
               <br/>
               If the Forward represents mainstream Judaism it is in deep doo-doo..
               <br/>
               Completely inappropiate at this time and not excusable just because its under the heading of prayingit matters what the hell you pray for.

               Prayers for the State of Israel. Yes, Now.
               <br/>
               By Elissa Strauss and J.J. Goldberg
              </p>
              <p>
               I get the impression that a lot of folks are feeling lost and helpless right now as we watch the tragedy unfolding in Israel and Gaza. Especially with Tisha bAv approaching, people are looking for some way to express what theyre feeling in a manner that joins them with others in a community of spirit, of longing and grief and hope. I gather, too, that many of us are tired of the rancor that divides us when what we really want is to feel the bond of kinship that transcends political differences.
               <br/>
               When we speak together in unison, we become joined in spirit in a way that transcends differences of the moment. (Yes, even gigantic moral differences can be transcended. If we let them.)
              </p>
              <p>
               Right now Im thinking about the Prayer for the State of Israel. Basically the one composed in 1949 by the chief rabbis of Israel, Yitzhak Halevi Herzog (yup, grandfather of) and Ben-Zion Uziel, though some say it was composed for them by the future Nobel laureate author Shmuel Yosef Agnon.
               <br/>
               Prayer for the State of Israel
               <br/>
               Our father in heaven, rock and redeemer of Israel, bless the State of Israel, [that it may be] the first flowering of our redemption. Guard over it with your lovingkindness, envelop it in your peace, and cast your light and truth upon its leaders, ministers and advisers, and bolster them with good counsel before you.
               <br/>
               Strengthen the hands of the defenders of our holy land, and grant them deliverance, O our God, and cloak them in victory; and grant peace to the land and eternal happiness to its inhabitants.
               <br/>
               And watch over our brethren, all the house of Israel in all the lands of their dispersion, and unite our hearts in love and awe of your name, to keep all the words of your Torah, so that we may be a blessing to all the inhabitants of your earth. Fulfill in us the vision of your prophet: For out of Zion will come the Law, and the word of God from Jerusalem. Amen
              </p>
              <p>

               After 60 odd years of supporting the Gov of Isreal maybe its time to turn our backs and walk away. Constant efforts to reach an accord have failed. Sometimes the best way to end a fight in the playground is to let them be and settle it themselves. When the death toll gets too high on either side, maybe theyll see reason. Either way, not my circus, not my monkeys

               Zionism is a belief that God chose the Jordan Valley as the promised land of the hebrews, after the departure from Egypt. What isnt stressed is that Joshua and the Judges practiced genocide to reach that goal, effectively wiping out Cannanite cities. Seems like history is repeating itself after 3000 years

                   One can be a secular Zionist and still hold racist views that are based on biblical themes and attitudes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also: religion and colonialism are not mutually exclusive categories  that is a false dichotomy. Some religions, like ancient Judaism and modern religious Zionism, are colonialist and imperialist enterprises from the ground up, at their ideological core. Colonialism can be a subset of religion, an expression of religion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Zionism combines religion with colonialism  and even secular Zionists rely heavily on biblical myths, symbols, legends and memes to pursue their objectives. Zionism is a biblical ideology, the product of an Old Testament outlook and value system.

                   sure, but they could hold racist views not based on biblical themes also. not all racism is bases on something ancient, albeit racism has been around a longlong time.

                   sean, i totally accept that you hold a similar concept of what zionism is as those who support it:

                   <p>
                    Defenders of Zionism say it is a national liberation movement for the repatriation of a dispersed socio-religious group to what they see as an abandoned homeland millennia before.[5][6][7] Critics of Zionism see it as a colonialist[8] or racist[9] ideology that led to the denial of rights, dispossession and expulsion of the indigenous population of Palestine.[10][11][12][13]

                  <p>
                   whereas, i define it as a critic does. you can repeat yourself til youre blue in the face. you can also believe that a person who does not believe in god is telling the truth when they claim they have a right to something because the bible says so, as opposed to just going along with the game to get what they feel is their just deserts (notice all those jews lining up to support christian zionists even tho they do not believe jesus will swoop down any day now). seriously sean, we simply disagree. the way you see it there are simply NO zionists, who dont buy the whole biblical routine, which is simply ridiculous on its face considering people like Hertzl was an atheist. even the idea of reviving an ancient homeland doesnt require a belief in religiosity simply because not everything in the bible is religious. for example, lots of people who do not believe jesus was the son of god none the less believe jesus existed as a person. that doesnt make them religious.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   anyway, i completely get it you wont back down. but that in itself doesnt make you right or your understanding of things factual. if you want to believe zionism is a religion, so be it!

                   The ongoing expansion of Jewish-only settlements is based on a biblical mandate to create Greater Israel. The Israeli government supports the settlements. The worldwide Jewish lobby supports the Israeli government. Jewish religious myths are driving the entire project. The worldwide Jewish religious establishment uses Judaism to justify Israeli policies.

                   A good question, but wheres the archaeological record? is also pretty good, though the answer tends to get more complicated. But its something of a relief to know that there was no genocide in the Hitler sense, at least not by the Israelites, way back then in 1300-odd BCE.
                   <br/>
                   I think that Zionism is about claims made on behalf of Jewish people in the modern world, or at least the world as it raced on from the fateful meetings of 1905, though ancient world claims are used to back them up.

                   The most effective thing, the effective, practical and doable thing that Jews can do, in the context of being Jews, about Zionism,
                   <i>
                    is at least start differentiating themselves, as Jews, religiously, publicly, from Zionists
                   </i>
                   .
                   <br/>
                   Start from there. Nobody has even offered that yet, and its doable.

               Its arguable that Zionism reflects a rejection of God, and surely the Wests support of a new state we all know now as Israel also is complicit in such rejection. Basically, the West support of Israel, beginning with Truman beating USSR to the punch in recognizing it in the first place (during the initial stage of the Cold War, USSR rushed to beat US officially, not with a mere letter) is, as a practical matter, the result of US domestic politicsRemember Dewey was thought to be a shoo-in? Truman had no money to run his whistle-stop campaign until Zionists gave him a big bag full. Truman is also on record as stating he had no Arab constituents.
               <br/>
               Certainly none voting in NY at that time, nor writing OP-eds for big US newspapers.

                 And the Palestinians had no direct representation at the UN when the US &amp; allies decided to partition their homeland and give most of it to Jews. The solution to the Jewish Question was to dump the Jews onto the backs of Palestinians. Thats how the Palestinians became political, became Palestinians, not just Arabs ruled by the Ottoman Empire, or Arabs ruled by the Brits. Seems thats how Christian Guilt works. Say Im sorry, and go to heaven because you authorized and supported Shoah Jews moving to the Palestinian homeland and booting out the Palestnians, or simply starving and killing them. A Shoah Jew is anyone ever to be born into the tribe, forever. How will this work out?

                4. Goyim [non- Jews] were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world; only to serve the People of Israel Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat With gentiles, it will be like any person: They need to die, but God will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that ones donkey would die, theyd lose their money. This is his servant. Thats why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew.

                5. You cant teach a monkey to speak and you cant teach an Arab to be democratic. Youre dealing with a culture of thieves and robbers. Muhammad, their prophet, was a robber and a killer and a liar. The Arab destroys everything he touches.

                6. [Non-Jews are] murderers, thieves and senseless Today they say there are eight billion people in the world. And what are they all? Murderers, thieves and senseless. Did God create the world for these murderers? The world was created for the righteous people who study Torah. That is the purpose of creation  The nations of the world have no redeeming qualities.

               All of these quotes are from Jewish religious Zionists  Jews who have effected a seamless merger of Judaism with Zionism  and most of them are from leading religious authorities in Israel  rabbis  official representatives of Judaism. These kinds of beliefs are commonly expressed in Israel  even at high levels of Israeli society.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the question is this: for how much longer will the worldwide Jewish religious establishment be able to continue to support Israel and Zionism without being held responsible by the world for the words and actions of Israelis?
              </p>
              <p>
               Why do the leaders of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Judaism continue to support Israel and Zionism with so much enthusiasm and religious fervor?
              </p>
              <p>
               What do you envision as the likely future of Judaism in the United States and Europe?
