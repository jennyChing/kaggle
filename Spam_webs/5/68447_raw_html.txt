        With 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 7 boys being sexually abused before their 18th birthday and with 93% of them knowing their perpetrator, it is time sexual abuse prevention education (also known as body safety) was taught in our homes and our schools.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
        As parents and teachers, we happily instruct children in road safety and water safety; we teach about stranger danger, and with older children we teach them about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. But my concern, as both a mother and a teacher, has always been with our little ones  Im talking about children from 3 to 10 years olds. And in particular, younger children who just want to be good and do what the big person says. I believe we can reduce these horrific statistics, if we just teach body safety to the kids in our care. Knowledge is powerful and forewarned is forearmed!
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Simply put, the message to children is: your body is your body and no-one has the right to touch it, and if they do, you must tell someone you trust and keep on telling until you are believed. And the lesson for us as parents and teachers is we need to believe children. A childs voice is important and if we dismiss a disclosure or and indicator that something is not right, that child may never tell again.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Teaching body safety is not rocket science. It can be simple, non-threatening but the knowledge a child gains from such instruction is very powerful. This knowledge just may prevent a child from a lifetime of ongoing trauma. Too often I have heard survivors of childhood sexual abuse say  if only someone had told me it was wrong, I would have spoken up.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Story is an excellent medium to talk about difficult topics, such as inappropriate touch, with very young children.

         Parents, teens, and survivors are lucky that Elin Stebbins Waldal has the courage to share her own harrowing experience with teen dating violence. At 17 she unwittingly fell in love with an abusive man. Tornado Warning is the true, honest portrait of how he whittled her downwith words, hands, and weaponsfrom a confident teen to the shadow of a woman. But Stebbins Waldal offers more. Interwoven with her real-life journal, she reflects on how this relationship has affected her since, and how she is working to protect her teenagers from succumbing to a similar experience. Provocative and healing, Tornado Warning is a must-read for parents, women, and anyone who has suffered at the hands of a loved one.

         Julie, who is eight or nine, talks about privacy and about saying no to touching that makes her uncomfortable. I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She has been learning about the concept of privacy (in the bathroom, etc.) for some time now so she is very interested in it. She has asked to have this book read to her for a number of nights in a row. She is four-years-old and it is an appropriate level for her, and also for older kids. It engages her interest. There is nothing in the book that is scary to her, because nothing is explicit, but it clarifies a lot of concepts and covers a lot of possible scenarios in non-threatening ways. As the mother in the book says to her daughter, its like learning what to do if there is a fire  its not something you have to worry about, and probably not something that will ever happen, but you need to know what to do if it does (that is, if someone touches the private parts of your body, or any part of your body in a way you dont like, you say no and tell your mother). Reading this to my daughter also gave me a good opportunity to ask her, while we were reading, if anyone has ever touched her body in a way that made her uncomfortable, to which she fortunately said no. I am very comfortable reading this book to her, and it covers the subject of privacy and bodies very well. I highly recommend it for every girl.  Book review from Inmassachusetts

         Written and illustrated by a young girl who was sexually molested by a family member, this book reaches out to other children in a way that no adult can. Jessies words carry the message, Its o.k. to tell; help can come when you tell. This book is an excellent tool for therapists, counselors, child protection workers, teachers, and parents dealing with children affected by sexual abuse. Jessies story adds a sense of hope for what should be, and the knowledge that the child protection system can work for children. Simple, direct, and from the heart, Jessie gives children the permission and the courage to deal with sexual abuse. Please Tell! is a beautifully simple book with a profoundly important message for children who have been sexually abused: the abuse wasnt their fault. Written and illustrated by Jessie, herself a pre-teen survivor of sexual abuse, it tells kids just what to do to get the help they need.

         Helping kids set healthy boundaries for their private parts can be a daunting and awkward task for parents, counselors and educators. Written from a kid s point of view, I Said No! makes this task a lot easier. To help Zack cope with a real-life experience he had with a friend, he and his mom wrote a book to help prepare other kids to deal with a range of problematic situations. I Said No! uses kid-friendly language and illustrations to help parents and concerned adults give kids guidance they can understand, practice and use. Using a simple, direct, decidedly non-icky approach that doesnt dumb down the issues involved, as well as an easy-to-use system to help kids rehearse and remember appropriate responses to help keep them safe, I Said No! covers a variety of topics, including: Whats appropriate and with whom. How to deal with inappropriate behavior, bribes and threats. When and where to go for help, and what to do if the people you re turning to for help don t listen. Dealing with feelings of guilt and shame. Ages 4+

         Preschool children learn safe boundaries, how to distinguish between good and bad touches, and how to respond appropriately to unwanted touches. This book is a powerful book for enhancing self-esteem. Parenting Presss bestseller! Its so important to educate kids to be assertive about their bodies. My Mom used this book with me 28 years ago and now I an using it with my daughter. I looked at a lot of other books but none presented the topic the way I wanted. This is a great book to open discussions about appropriate touch, child adult relationships, and abuse prevention. This book does NOT go into detail about abuse or private parts. However it does teach assertiveness to kids in a non-scary way. We started reading this book when my daughter was ~2 1/2 years old. She is now 3 1/2 and I use the page with the scary looking man to talk more about the topic. This is NOT a book that you just read cover to cover, but it is a great tool for starting conversations about bodies and abuse.  Review by Toddler Mom.Ages 3-8

         Speaking to children on their own terms, this critically acclaimed book sensitively establishes boundaries for youngsters. In a non-threatening, engaging manner, this guide teaches kids that when it comes to their body, there are some parts that are for no one else to see and empowers them to tell a parent or teacher if someone touches them inappropriately. Telling the story of a gender-neutral child who is inappropriately touched by an uncles friend, this tale delivers a powerful moral when the youngster reveals the offender and the parents praise the childs bravery. Most importantly, this narrative assures young ones that sexual molestation is not their fault, and by speaking out, the child will continue to grow big and strong. A Suggestions for the Storyteller section is also included to assist in facilitating a comfortable discussion afterwards, thereby helping to prevent the unthinkable from happening to any child. With inspirational rhyming and beautiful illustrations, this is a compelling and uplifting message of what is right and wrong. Ages 3-5

         The Right Touch reaches beyond the usual scope of a childrens picture book. It is a parenting book that introduces a very difficult topicthe sexual abuse of young children. This gentle, thoughtful story can be read aloud to a child by any trusted caregiver. In the story, young Jimmys mom explains the difference between touches that are positive and touches that are secret, deceptive or forced. She tells him how to resist inappropriate touching, affirming that abuse is not the child s fault. The introduction provides valuable information about sexual abuse and guidance on what to do if your child experiences an abusive situation. Jody Bergsmas gentle illustrations soften the impact of this story; yet this portrayal of a dangerous situation is very realistic. If your child is old enough to sit still and listen to a story, he or she is old enough for The Right Touch. Used by parents and teachers nationwide to help children avoid sexual abuse, this book won the 1999 Benjamin Franklin Parenting Award. It was a finalist for the Small Press Award and was also Selected as Outstanding by the Parent Council, Ltd. Ages 4+

         In simple, reassuring language, the author explains that a childs body is his or her own; that it is all right for kids to decline a friendly hug or kiss, even from someone they love; and that you can still be friends even if you dont want a hug now. This book is positive and assertive without being frightening. It lets young children know that its all right for them to choose when, and by whom, they are to be touched. It goes on to define private parts as the places on your body covered by a bathing suit, and states that they should never be touched by people other than medical personnel and adults helping with bathroom functions. The prefatory note to parents is an important one as it reminds them to trust a childs instincts and concerns related to unwanted touching. Weidners simple watercolors are adequately rendered and are appropriate to the content.  Review byRosie Peasley, Empire Union School District
