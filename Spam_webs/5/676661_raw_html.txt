Her clients come to her with an issue, a question, a mystery, and she figures out the best way to find the answer &ndash; using whatever tools she can. &ldquo;I use a combination of new technology and old technology, because I have to solve a problem. So I&rsquo;ve used everything from geese and dogs to Roombas to drones to GPS.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright is a private investigator &ndash; and owner of the Wright Group &ndash; based in Anaheim, California. She&rsquo;s worked in the business for more than 40 years, and has seen the tools available to investigators change dramatically. Early on, stakeouts in vans were important. More recently new technology in the form of tiny cameras and social media has begun to play a role. And she&rsquo;s embraced those changes. Today, when the problem calls for it, she uses drones to do her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gives me a few examples. If two people are meeting in a public place, a drone can be a helpful way to discreetly watch them. &ldquo;We stay at about 50-75 feet [15-23 metres] above so nothing can be heard.&rdquo; Drones are also helpful for aerial surveillance of locations that are hard to access on foot. And if a school or church is worried someone might be stealing or vandalising property, drones or small off-road vehicles (&ldquo;Roombas on steroids&rdquo; as she calls them) can film the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yhk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Wright was asked to figure out whether or not a soda salesperson was crossing county lines and cheating on his contract. California is one of many states in which salespeople have regional contracts &ndash; for instance, Bob sells Pepsi in Los Angeles County and Nancy sells Pepsi in Orange County. If Nancy arrives at her usual businesses to sell her Pepsi and finds the soda supply has already been topped up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that someone (perhaps Bob) has crossed county lines and sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-tech toys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright was asked to figure out whether this was happening. To do so meant visiting every major soda wholesaler from San Luis Obispo to San Diego &ndash; about 300 miles (480km) of California coast &ndash; and checking whether any were selling soda from the wrong salesperson. When there was illegal soda on sale, she would use a drone to follow the soda delivery trucks back to their depots. In one case, the warehouse the truck led her back to was out in the desert and would have been impossible to approach by car or foot without being noticed. But the drone was able to spy on the trucks covertly. &ldquo;We could see between the warehouse door and the truck loading.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright gets her drones from high-end toy stores, for about $200 each. They&rsquo;re an expensive investment: not only do you have to buy the device, you also have to pay one or two people to pilot and spot the thing. And if you lose one during a mission, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of your budget. But it can be worth it, because for the cases in which they&rsquo;re useful, they can be very useful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yh4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright doesn&rsquo;t pilot the drones herself. &ldquo;I try to hire gamers. I go to the colleges and high schools and I find out who the geeks are, and then I hire them.&rdquo; She said that her pilots are more skilled than she would ever be &ndash; and they like the challenge. Some of them are working towards their own private investigator licences, and their hours piloting the little devices can count as hours towards their certification. (None of Wright&rsquo;s gamer pilots were willing to talk for this article. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re introverts,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Not shy, but introverts.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the idea of using drones to spy on people isn&rsquo;t something everybody is comfortable with. &lt;a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/05/chs-x-files-capitol-hill-drone-pilot-spotted-glowing-orbs-phone-thief-on-wheels/\"&gt;In a case in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a woman reported that someone was using a drone to spy on her. &ldquo;This afternoon, a stranger set an aerial drone into flight over my yard and beside my house near Miller Playfield,&rdquo; she told the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog. &ldquo;I initially mistook its noisy buzzing for a weed-whacker on this warm spring day. After several minutes, I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away.&rdquo; Her husband asked the drone operator, who was standing nearby, to move along &ndash; but the operator claimed to be acting within his legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening regulations&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t always clear. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx\"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 35 states considered adding drone bills to the books last year, and 10 states actually did add new laws. In Iowa, for example, it&rsquo;s now illegal for the state to use drones to enforce traffic laws. In North Carolina, no one can use a drone for surveillance of a person or private property. And Tennessee now specifies that it&rsquo;s a misdemeanour to use drones for surveillance of people who are hunting or fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&rsquo;s drone operations might soon become legally questionable too. Earlier this month, a California senator &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/calif-lawmakers-consider-drone-privacy-bill/31326004\"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would extend property rights into airspace, meaning that drones flying over private property would be considered trespassers. Just a few days before that, President Obama and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/15/a-brief-summary-of-the-faas-new-drone-regulations/\"&gt;announced new drone regulations&lt;/a&gt; as well, requiring &ndash; among other things &ndash; that drones must be under 55lb (25kg) and that operators must keep the flying vehicles in sight at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7xlr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the laws are murky, many private investigators steer clear of drones. &ldquo;The use of drones for surveillance is highly restricted by law,&rdquo; said Kelly Riddle, a private investigator in Texas. &ldquo;There are air space regulations as well as privacy laws that can easily be violated. Obtaining video using a drone has thus far been something that we have been advised is illegal.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because drones are often used to observe activities that can&rsquo;t be seen via a direct line of sight at ground level. Going out of your way to spy on such activities is considered an invasion of privacy, says Riddle. A lot of Wright&rsquo;s work sidesteps this privacy question, because it involves helping schools and churches monitor their own property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the use of drones will be restricted under a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations in the United States sooner than later. But in the meantime Wright will continue to use them when they can help with her work. But she also says that regardless of the legality, if someone thinks their privacy is being compromised, they&rsquo;re going to do something about it. That can mean shooting down drones &ndash; another activity that &lt;a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/man-shoots-down-drone-lawyers-scratch-their-heads\"&gt;may or may not be legal&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;I think a lot of my colleagues have lost them and realised that it is a tool, and if you invade someone&rsquo;s privacy, well, if they can hit it they will.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-18T11:27:45Z","HeadlineLong":"The private investigator who spies using drones","HeadlineShort":"I use a drone to spy on people","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Aerial vehicles are the latest tool for private detectives  but for how long?

The pair have been friends since childhood. Within the first year of their friendship, nerve damage inflicted by an inherited genetic condition robbed Haug of his sight and hearing. He was nine. But children are natural innovators. &ldquo;We started to invent languages and forms of communication just because we were kids and we wanted to play,&rdquo; says Schwengber. &ldquo;It was annoying that he couldn't hear me, and I couldn't write something down,&rdquo; she says. So the two invented their own tactile language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Haug and Schwengber grew older, they replaced their private language with one that is more widely understood: Lorm, a tactile alphabet spelled out with strokes to the hand. It was invented in the nineteenth century by Hieronymus Lorm &ndash; an anonymous pseudonym, for Austrian-born poet, journalist, and novelist &lt;a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12762.html\"&gt;Heinrich Landesmann&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; and is still used today by the deaf-blind community in German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv0k9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the importance of Lorm to Haug and Schwengber. But Lorm, and other forms of tactile signing, have their limits. A reliance on physical contact between communicators has historically constrained the social circles of the deaf-blind to those they can meet face-to-face (or more accurately hand-to-hand) on a regular basis &ndash; and even within this relatively small group of people, only those who take the time to learn and practice Lorm can really become part of a deaf-blind individual&rsquo;s social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Haug&rsquo;s social circle currently consists of about five people: his mother, Schwengber, teachers, and therapists. Once a year he spends about 10 days visiting relatives in Stuttgart in Southern Germany. &ldquo;The first five days they need to practice Lorming, so they can remember the letters, and by the tenth day when they are quite fast, it's time to go back home,&rdquo; explains Schwengber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these drawbacks might soon disappear, if a new invention by Tom Bieling is commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactile translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling, a researcher at the Design Lab in Berlin, has developed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.design-research-lab.org/projects/mobile-lorm-glove/\"&gt;glove kitted out with fabric pressure-sensors&lt;/a&gt;. By translating a tactile hand touch alphabet into digital text, the mobile glove could eliminate the necessity of hand-to-hand physical contact for deaf-blind communication. Even better, because a great deal of online communication is text-based, the glove could act as a translating device that allows people who are deaf-blind to communicate freely with anyone &ndash; and for anyone to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an invention reminiscent of the outlandish gadgets seen in James Bond movies, and it won Bieling first prize in the 2014 Falling Walls Lab competition &ndash; a kind of TED Talks meets Dragon&rsquo;s Den &ndash; held annually in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1kq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first prototype was made from Gore-Tex fabric and felt much like an ordinary glove, Bieling explains. It&rsquo;s embedded with small vibrating motors, and &ldquo;as soon as you receive an incoming message, it starts vibrating on those dots where the letters are positioned&rdquo;, he says. In the current version, users can adjust the intensity and speed of the incoming tactile messages according to their reading skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the whole hand area of the glove is now wired for sensory input, &ldquo;just like a tablet [computer]&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The system recognises both the position and pattern of the finger movement.&rdquo; So users can also spell out their own messages.If a sign isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;typed&rdquo; quite correctly, the Lorm glove system recognises the closest symbol &ndash; just like a spell checker on your smart phone. For example, a circle in the hand would be an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, explains Bieling, and even if you type a triangle or a square, the system is clever enough to recognise the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; as the closest correct symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enhancing independence&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking through Schwengber&rsquo;s translation, Haug describes the glove prototype as a bit slower than what he is used to in terms of receiving messages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his teacher or his mother Lorming,&rdquo; says Schwengber, compared with her own speedy pace. &ldquo;But he really likes it,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the glove, &ldquo;I can send and receive &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; says Haug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling&rsquo;s project is part of his doctoral studies exploring links between design and ability. He argues that feeling disabled is a question of design &ndash; a ramp, for instance, is easy for anyone to ascend, even if they are in a wheelchair. He hopes that his design will enable deaf-blind people to engage with a broader spectrum of their community and &ldquo;gain access to a broader range of information, thus enhancing their independence&rdquo;. But he also hopes that gaining knowledge about alternative communication systems can profit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1wv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haug, now 22, currently lives with his mother in Spreewald, about 100km south of Berlin. He is studying massage therapy in the hopes of pursuing it as a profession. He would like to move to Berlin, explains Schwengber, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that has thus far eluded him because of the lack of assistance available. The glove could expand Haug&rsquo;s ability to stay in close touch with those closest to him while living at a distance. But it could do more than that: it could allow him to expand his currently small social circle dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Haug, with help from Schwengber, has been having fun on Twitter, a medium enabling him to converse with people who need never know that he is deaf-blind. On social media, Haug is &ldquo;just a person behind the Twitter account saying something&rdquo;, explains Schwengber. Haug describes it as a bit like playing carnival, because &ldquo;you just mask up and say anything you want&rdquo;, translates Schwengber. &ldquo;Content matters, not the person,&rdquo; she explains. So Haug gets a kick out of the reaction from followers when he Tweets amusing things, something he&rsquo;d be able to do more easily and independently with his own Lorm glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the first thing he would say with a Lorm glove of his own, Haug says he would talk to his cousin in Stuttgart and ask him if he can remember the name of an interesting film they recently spoke about. (Schwengber and Haug often go to the cinema &ndash; where Schwengber simultaneously translates the movie for Haug via Lorm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted the digital revolution and the amazing new connections it has offered. For those constrained by a barrier of unseen sights and unheard sounds, it was once unexplored territory &ndash; but with the Lorm glove, they might just have that world in the palm of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-13T09:29:01Z","HeadlineLong":"The glove that transmits touch over the internet","HeadlineShort":"The glove turning touch into talk","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Blind-deaf people are often forced to live in a small and isolated world.

Just ask the Popular Mechanics writer who said, in 1949, &ldquo;Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 2013 presents a unique opportunity to make safe predictions. Maybe not about consumer tech, but at least about the annual trade show that celebrates it: the Consumer Electronics Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, CES was North America&rsquo;s biggest trade show. It&rsquo;s been running in various forms since 1967. Every January, nearly 150,000 attendees walk its 2,700 booths, then wait 45 minutes for taxis so they can return to their overpriced Las Vegas hotel rooms with aching feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what&rsquo;s the prediction? That CES has started a long, slow decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CES is not open to the public. It&rsquo;s attended exclusively by electronics representatives, investors, and members of the media. Its function: for tech companies to display the new gadgets they&rsquo;ve been working on - and to beg the press to write about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we do. Every January, we, the press, dutifully report the industry&rsquo;s latest message. This will be the year we surf the web on our TV sets! This will be the year for 3D television! This will be the year someone besides Apple has a hit tablet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as time goes by, it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that CES isn&rsquo;t serving anyone very well. Not the public, not the press, not even the manufacturers. And that is down to four reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the elephant in the room: When 2,700 companies try to introduce new products simultaneously, they&rsquo;re guaranteed to dilute the press coverage. In fact, a CES debut is the worst way to make a product announcement - you&rsquo;ll be lost in the shuffle. Why not wait for a quieter week in tech, when your news has some impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I can tell you firsthand how ineffective CES announcements are. In the month of December 2012, I received over 300 email pitches for products coming out at CES 2013. I write &lt;a href=\"http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/\"&gt;two columns a week for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You do the math.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad clones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second worrisome sign: the big names are leaving the show. Apple hasn&rsquo;t attended CES for years, preferring to announce new products when they&rsquo;re ready, rather than being locked to CES&rsquo;s annual January cycle. Dell&rsquo;s stopped renting booths in 1997; like Lenovo (the world&rsquo;s number two computer maker), Dell now sends reps only for hotel-room meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this year another major firm will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, Microsoft not only brought a booth the size of Britain, but CEO Bill Gates or Steve Ballmer gave the opening-night keynote speech. But no longer. &ldquo;Our product news milestones generally don&rsquo;t align with the show&rsquo;s January timing,&rdquo; Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And what consumer-electronics megabrand will be replacing Microsoft for this year&rsquo;s opening CES keynote speech? Qualcomm, a maker of cellphone circuits. Hold on to your hats!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&rsquo;s departure doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of CES, but other companies may well follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran tech reporters may remember that the biggest tech show &lt;em&gt;used &lt;/em&gt;to be Comdex, the computer show also held in Las Vegas. But when IBM pulled out in 1998, Comdex began a long, slow decline. By 2004, Comdex was history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third problem: the timing is horrible. Everybody knows that in the gadget biz, you want to unveil your shiny new product just in time for the holiday shopping season. But January? You&rsquo;ve barely formed your strategy, let alone polished up the new gizmos for the following Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder so many new products introduced at CES never actually make it to store shelves. Companies are forced to pre-announce unfinished goods&mdash;and tip off their competition in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, CES has become a platform for electronics trade groups to push what they hope will become new, exciting trends. Sometimes, these trends catch on; the VCR (1970), consumer camcorder (1981), and the DVD (1996) all debuted at CES shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lately, the industry has been pushing technology nobody wants. The 2013 show will be the seventh consecutive edition where we&rsquo;re told we&rsquo;ll surf the Web on our TV sets, and the fourth where we&rsquo;re told we want to put on 3D glasses to watch TV, and the third where cheap Chinese iPad clones will flood the show floor. Year after year, the public has spoken: no matter how much you shove these technologies in our faces, we&rsquo;re not interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is CES? A very expensive tradeshow that&rsquo;s at the wrong time of the year, attended by fewer important companies, trying to set an agenda the public doesn&rsquo;t want, by throwing 2,700 press releases at journalists who have room for only a few stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&rsquo;s one more safe prediction: In the tech business, the only constant is change. If CES can&rsquo;t justify its existence soon, it could be the next Comdex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with David?&lt;/em&gt; I&lt;em&gt;f you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"CES: Does the consumer technology show have a future?","HeadlineShort":"Powering down?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"This week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is one of the world's largest showcases for new gadgets and technology.

For some, 2013 may begin by going to the gym, or giving up smoking. But what about a more thorough and personal approach towards self-improvement, like monitoring your thoughts, e-mails, or even your bowel movements? If the answer is yes, then perhaps this is the year that you&rsquo;ll be joining a growing group of people who are using technology to measure their lives in extraordinary detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably since the dawn of humanity, people have been fascinated by even the most minute details of their lives, and kept track of what was going on in their bodies and minds. The Roman philosopher Seneca tracked the food he ate and what he dreamt at night. Benjamin Franklin consistently recorded his performance on 13 measures, such as cleanliness, frugality and overindulgence, believing it would keep him virtuous. Engineer and architect Buckminster Fuller nicknamed himself &ldquo;guinea pig b&rdquo; and kept a diary on his daily life and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the past, record-keeping was time-consuming, requiring a commitment that only a very few had the patience to muster. Others cared, but not THAT much. Today, that&rsquo;s changing, as it becomes easier to track everything, from diet to mood to sleep quality. Smartphones come equipped with features like GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes that can record your activity, location and other vital statistics. Millions of fitness-focused or diet-conscious people track their workouts or their desserts with apps and devices like &lt;a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/\"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt; that track physical activity or calories burned. New technology also makes it easier to share results with others &ndash; who doesn&rsquo;t want to brag the first time they run more than 5 miles (8km), or be praised when they&rsquo;ve managed to lose 10 pounds (5kg)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing band of devotees centered in the United States, called the &lt;a href=\"http://quantifiedself.com/\"&gt;Quantified Self movement&lt;/a&gt;, has taken the effort to another level. Its members track a whole list of measures and push the technology available to keep tabs on their ideas, their mental health, even their microbiome &ndash; the colonies of bacteria that live on or inside their bodies. Some might scoff at their efforts to keep spreadsheets documenting their mood, diet or sleep patterns. &ldquo;But the insights that we could learn from having all this quantified self data available are almost unfathomable,&rdquo; says Amy Robinson, an organiser of Quantified Self Boston, a group that includes about 650 members and holds bimonthly meet-ups to share ideas and progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Quantified self helps you keep a reference to how you lived not only the day before but two weeks before or a year before,&rdquo; Robinson says. &ldquo;You know when you achieve your best, you know when you exceed your best and it makes that possible by simply having the numbers there.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet such lofty personal goals come down to something that couldn&rsquo;t be more mundane: manually recording the number of daily bowel movements or every bite of food consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence David spent a year tracking 300 measures about his health and behaviour &ndash; including the microbes in his digestive system &ndash;&nbsp;while he was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David created a self-tracking system by tinkering with an iPhone app designed to record and manage business cards. Every meal became a new &ldquo;card&rdquo; entry, with hundreds he had to type in by hand over the year &ndash; one night&rsquo;s entry could be cheeseburger and fries, the next pepperoni pizza. &ldquo;One of the few datasets out there is going to be full of junk food,&rdquo; he says, confessing to a personal weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got to the point where he hated the process so much that he didn&rsquo;t want to eat because then he&rsquo;d have to record it. &ldquo;It was terrible,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;Super tedious.&rdquo; But when his boss, associate professor Eric Alm, got food poisoning while self-tracking, it was the first time the microbial pattern of human diarrhoea had been followed in real-time. Sounds gross, but understanding the progress of food poisoning in such a manner could be an important step toward developing treatments for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And other than confirming his love of junk food, he did learn some useful things about himself. David discovered that he wasted a lot of time on e-mail during the day, and wasn&rsquo;t as productive as he thought he was late at night. Now, he saves most of his e-mailing for the evenings &ndash; instead of disrupting his research to respond &ndash; and doesn&rsquo;t feel guilty when he takes a night off. He&rsquo;s stopped tracking most of the other measures, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like David, others who use technology to self-track rely on a mix of mind-numbing and automated measures, and they talk about the greater good, as well as what they&rsquo;ve learned about themselves. The Quantified Self movement originated in San Francisco, after it was first proposed by Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007. As of October 2012, the Quantified Self movement counted more than 70 meet-up groups worldwide with over 5,000 members &ndash; of course, they keep track of that sort of thing. (There&rsquo;s actually a greater number of self-tracking apps on mobile phones than members &ndash; around 7,500 at the moment.) Many of these self-trackers are researchers, computer scientists, or simply tech-savvy, 21st-century Benjamin Franklins who think the act of collecting so much data has the power to transform themselves and the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet-ups are part 7-minute show-and-tells, part social hour. At her first meet-up, in Alabama, Amy Robinson was the only one who had tried quantifying anything, while other attendees were just curious about the idea. In Boston, as you might expect from being an academic and tech hub, many of the participants have developed their own hacks and want to trade tips on how to maximise their record-keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson says she has long been fascinated with where ideas come from, so she started sending herself an e-mail whenever a good one popped into her head. Recently, she collected &lt;a href=\"http://joost.1.ai/amy/\"&gt;six months of these e-mails&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; 770 in all &ndash; analysed them, and presented the results at a Quantified Self meetup in Boston in October. Among the themes that came up most often were &ldquo;science&rdquo;, &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; and &ldquo;health.&rdquo; She found that she had the most new ideas immediately after attending an inspiring conference, travelling or experiencing something new. Doing this exercise helped feed her fascination with the human mind, she told the group, as well as &ldquo;discover more ways to think about myself and discover how my mind works relative to other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Melanie Swan, founder of DIYgenomics, a California-based non-profit that promotes personalised medicine, has presented her findings at several Bay Area meet-ups, and she says meet-up attendees have changed as the movement has evolved. At first, the typical person was obsessive, &ldquo;someone who is really rigorous about self-tracking either because of a health reason or they&rsquo;re compelled to improve their mental performance or whatever,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s now at the meet-ups is a much broader slice, though I would say it&rsquo;s still a pretty tech-forward thinking kind of audience &ndash; anybody interested in improving an aspect of their health.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of the nudge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their interest in self-quantification is technological, another factor is a more general one: the growing obsession with self-improvement over the past few decades, says Natasha Schull, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Weight Watchers has been telling people since the 1970s that if they want to lose weight, they need to track what they eat. The field of behavioural economics,&nbsp;which studies the connection between thoughts and financial decisions, has found that if you alter peoples&rsquo; social environment, they might be nudged into conducting more rational behaviour. For instance, if school cafeterias display fruit before fried chicken, students are more likely to eat fruit because they grab the first food they see. And having people track their actions makes a difference, says Schull, encouraging more people to make the effort to track.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Self-tracking might not have been such a fringe activity in the past, either. There were plenty of people keeping diaries and self-accounts in the 1800s and 1900s, says Schull. &ldquo;Even having a watch and being mindful of time is a form of self-regulation that went along with industrialisation,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as there have been people tracking themselves, there have been people mocking those trackers, Schull adds. D.H. Lawrence &lt;a href=\"http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/lewiss/lawrence.htm\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a piece making fun of Franklin&rsquo;s self-obsession and the cockiness embedded in his 13 virtues, including this description: &ldquo;He was a little model, was Benjamin. Doctor Franklin. Snuff-coloured little man! Immortal soul and all!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind such insults lies the idea that tracking the minutiae of one&rsquo;s life can be pointless, an end in itself. Others worry that it could be used for self-destructive purposes, like an anorexic tracking how little she eats. &ldquo;It seems to me in the contemporary US example, the means and the end are blurring,&rdquo; says Schull, who co-taught a class at Harvard University in the autumn called &ldquo;Self as Data&rdquo;. &ldquo;I think people are still motivated &ndash; at least they say they are &ndash; by some kind of transformation, but it&rsquo;s seen as something that doesn&rsquo;t really end.&rdquo; Like the Alcoholics Anonymous model, where people who were once alcoholics are always recovering, Schull says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a different model of what health is.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight and see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University, tracking his weight helped him keep it under control. &ldquo;If you watch things, you tend to do better, by virtue of being aware of them,&rdquo; says Gerstein, who has a wifi-enabled bathroom scale that automatically records his weight and feeds it into a database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerstein has also been tracking his asthma symptoms in hope of being able to reduce his medication. He says he sees a little correlation between his exercise and his peak air flow, and thinks the more he can measure about himself, the more he&rsquo;ll know about what triggers his wheezing and the better he&rsquo;ll be at controlling it. It&rsquo;s not just Gerstein&rsquo;s data that&rsquo;s important, this kind of information from thousands of people who have asthma could become much more powerful when it&rsquo;s aggregated. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole other level of what happens when all this information flows together and you can look for patterns and trends,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all self-quantification efforts are successful. Schull&rsquo;s student, Sneha Khullar, began &ndash; reluctantly &ndash; tracking several measures as a class assignment. In her final presentation to the class in December, she explained that she enjoyed using a pedometer to track her footsteps and an app called RescueTime, which showed she is most productive on Fridays &ndash; now that she&rsquo;s given up partying. But writing down everything she ate was too much of a drag, and piling up chocolate wrappers didn&rsquo;t help her moderate her sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khullar, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, self-tracking needs to be easy enough to carry out routinely, but not so easy that it can be ignored. Having to convert miles into kilometres so she could figure out how much she had run required just enough effort to get her invested in the process, with an incentive to keep running more. &ldquo;I could not have imagined I could run more than 5 miles,&rdquo; she proudly told her classmates. But, these tools were way more successful in behaviour-enhancing than in controlling bad habits, she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps this barrier to participation is key to whether self-tracking will fully make the leap from tech obsessives to the mainstream public. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of when does it become easy and when does it become useful,&rdquo; says Stephen Wolfram, creator of the technical computing software Mathematica. He says he&rsquo;s been self-tracking for a quarter of a century &ndash; everything from his personal health to his e-mail to the use patterns of every room in his house. But there are some things even he declines to measure. He doesn&rsquo;t bother with skin conductivity measures, for instance, because he doesn&rsquo;t like wearing the devices. He doesn&rsquo;t wear a camera around his neck, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s not socially realistic for the life I lead &ndash; maybe if I were much younger.&rdquo; And he doesn&rsquo;t record his side of phone conversations because speech recognition software still isn&rsquo;t good enough to provide an accurate transcript. Why would he want a transcript of every conversation? &ldquo;Am I repeating myself? You can immediately check,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next crucial step for self-tracking, several people said, will be the ability to integrate different data streams. Right now, the wifi-enabled scale doesn&rsquo;t talk to the program that monitors blood pressure, diet or sleep &ndash; but such integration will come eventually. Maybe someday it will even link up with &ldquo;smart&rdquo; toilets that can read shifting microbial populations and warn of impending illness. The key will be finding ways to make the data meaningful, rather than just overwhelming. And to keep it private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yale&rsquo;s Gerstein says he worries a lot about the privacy aspects of all thins data. Right now, it seems harmless to share information about our sleep patterns, genes and microbial populations. But one day, that information could be more meaningful &ndash; and could be used against us. Sleep patterns could be relevant, say, in a court case about a traffic accident. People who post genetic information now are revealing things about their future children and grandchildren. &ldquo;I think the fear is people will pile up a lot of information about themselves and share it without fully seeing the implications,&rdquo; Gerstein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson says there&rsquo;s no question the Quantified Self movement she is part of will have to address privacy issues. &ldquo;Let the people who want to share their data in a way that maintains their privacy, but also helps other people,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And doctors are going to need to learn how to deal with all the data their patients are beginning to bring them. Right now, Robinson says, people in the Quantified Self movement &ldquo;want to share their information with their doctor, but their doctor doesn&rsquo;t really know what to do with it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfram, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href=\"http://www.wolfram.com/\"&gt;Wolfram Research&lt;/a&gt; and founder of the technology company Wolfram|Alpha, thinks the data will eventually redefine what doctors do. A doctor would be hard-pressed to make sense of the data once people are wired to track their heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure and dozens of other measures. But computers will be able to easily spot patterns and trends, diagnosing far more accurately than doctors can today, and far earlier in the disease process, says Wolfram, who is developing analytics to meet this need. He thinks that eventually we&rsquo;ll go from sensor-based data to being able to treat whatever concern the technology diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, perhaps a Quantified Selfer will figure out a way to measure whether this actually improves our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-01-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Quantified self: The tech-based route to a better life?","HeadlineShort":"A measured life","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Self-improvement has never been easier, thanks to apps and devices that measure all your everyday activities.

Every January, nearly 150,000 attendees walk its 2,700 booths, then wait 45 minutes for taxis so they can return to their overpriced Las Vegas hotel rooms with aching feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what&rsquo;s the prediction? That CES has started a long, slow decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CES is not open to the public. It&rsquo;s attended exclusively by electronics representatives, investors, and members of the media. Its function: for tech companies to display the new gadgets they&rsquo;ve been working on - and to beg the press to write about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we do. Every January, we, the press, dutifully report the industry&rsquo;s latest message. This will be the year we surf the web on our TV sets! This will be the year for 3D television! This will be the year someone besides Apple has a hit tablet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as time goes by, it&rsquo;s becoming clearer that CES isn&rsquo;t serving anyone very well. Not the public, not the press, not even the manufacturers. And that is down to four reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the elephant in the room: When 2,700 companies try to introduce new products simultaneously, they&rsquo;re guaranteed to dilute the press coverage. In fact, a CES debut is the worst way to make a product announcement - you&rsquo;ll be lost in the shuffle. Why not wait for a quieter week in tech, when your news has some impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(I can tell you firsthand how ineffective CES announcements are. In the month of December 2012, I received over 300 email pitches for products coming out at CES 2013. I write &lt;a href=\"http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/\"&gt;two columns a week for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You do the math.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad clones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second worrisome sign: the big names are leaving the show. Apple hasn&rsquo;t attended CES for years, preferring to announce new products when they&rsquo;re ready, rather than being locked to CES&rsquo;s annual January cycle. Dell&rsquo;s stopped renting booths in 1997; like Lenovo (the world&rsquo;s number two computer maker), Dell now sends reps only for hotel-room meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this year another major firm will be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, Microsoft not only brought a booth the size of Britain, but CEO Bill Gates or Steve Ballmer gave the opening-night keynote speech. But no longer. &ldquo;Our product news milestones generally don&rsquo;t align with the show&rsquo;s January timing,&rdquo; Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(And what consumer-electronics megabrand will be replacing Microsoft for this year&rsquo;s opening CES keynote speech? Qualcomm, a maker of cellphone circuits. Hold on to your hats!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&rsquo;s departure doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of CES, but other companies may well follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran tech reporters may remember that the biggest tech show &lt;em&gt;used &lt;/em&gt;to be Comdex, the computer show also held in Las Vegas. But when IBM pulled out in 1998, Comdex began a long, slow decline. By 2004, Comdex was history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third problem: the timing is horrible. Everybody knows that in the gadget biz, you want to unveil your shiny new product just in time for the holiday shopping season. But January? You&rsquo;ve barely formed your strategy, let alone polished up the new gizmos for the following Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder so many new products introduced at CES never actually make it to store shelves. Companies are forced to pre-announce unfinished goods&mdash;and tip off their competition in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, CES has become a platform for electronics trade groups to push what they hope will become new, exciting trends. Sometimes, these trends catch on; the VCR (1970), consumer camcorder (1981), and the DVD (1996) all debuted at CES shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lately, the industry has been pushing technology nobody wants. The 2013 show will be the seventh consecutive edition where we&rsquo;re told we&rsquo;ll surf the Web on our TV sets, and the fourth where we&rsquo;re told we want to put on 3D glasses to watch TV, and the third where cheap Chinese iPad clones will flood the show floor. Year after year, the public has spoken: no matter how much you shove these technologies in our faces, we&rsquo;re not interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is CES? A very expensive tradeshow that&rsquo;s at the wrong time of the year, attended by fewer important companies, trying to set an agenda the public doesn&rsquo;t want, by throwing 2,700 press releases at journalists who have room for only a few stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&rsquo;s one more safe prediction: In the tech business, the only constant is change. If CES can&rsquo;t justify its existence soon, it could be the next Comdex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with David?&lt;/em&gt; I&lt;em&gt;f you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"559a66a082f2d2dbf7bcb96f"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"CES: Does the consumer technology show have a future?","HeadlineShort":"Powering down?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"This week's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is one of the world's largest showcases for new gadgets and technology.

It was a similar &ndash; albeit more low key &ndash; reception at Pier 57 in New York City on Thursday, when the head of Microsoft appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tail end of October has been dominated by the Big Two launches: &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20042738\"&gt;Apple&rsquo;s iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20072497\"&gt;Microsoft&rsquo; Windows 8 and Surface tablet&lt;/a&gt;. Complete with banked photographers and ecstatic press scrums trying to get a glimpse of the latest &ldquo;model&rdquo;, they felt as much like fashion shows as product launches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that should come as no surprise. It is all part of a shift in technology that has gradually moved away from an emphasis on utility to today&rsquo;s holy trinity of look, feel and lifestyle.&nbsp; A shift pioneered by Apple but increasingly championed by all tech firms, it takes its cues from fashion, positioning tablets, computers and software as cultural beacons: stamps that immediately say who you are or, rather, who you aspire to be. If anything proves just how far technology is ingrained in our lives, it is this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet what&rsquo;s most significant about this move is not what it tells us about Apple or Microsoft or any other technology firm, but what it tells us about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone think different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, a modern tablet computer or operating system is a minor miracle of excess, able comfortably to accomplish every daily digital task demanded of it. But what we merely do is no longer the key factor. Far more significant is the way that owning and using these objects makes us feel: status, self-expression and how we would like to be perceived by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is something that is subtly and repeatedly emphasised by tech firms. The rhetoric around the iPad mini is familiar enough, with &lt;a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/\"&gt;official descriptions&lt;/a&gt; emphasizing its beauty, fluidity and tactile intimacy of experience. Even Microsoft, though, are now playing the same game for all it's worth, with the public presentation of Windows 8 coming across as an attempt to out-Apple Apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=251529\"&gt;product guide&lt;/a&gt;, &ldquo;Windows has been reimagined to focus on your life. The beautiful, fast, and fluid design is perfect for a range of hardware... it&rsquo;s smooth, intuitive, and gives you instant access...&rdquo; And so on. What&rsquo;s on offer is a kind of technological sublime, promising not only the ultimate lifestyle accessory, but a place where the experience of living itself can be perfected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move from technology manufacturer to fashion label has helped Apple become the world&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19325913\"&gt;most valuable company&lt;/a&gt;. More than anyone, it has defined the increasingly image-conscious space within which digital technologies try to position themselves. Think of its &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_%28advertisement%29\"&gt;1984 advert&lt;/a&gt; for the first Macintosh or its &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different\"&gt;&ldquo;Think Different&rdquo; campaign of 1997&lt;/a&gt;, which emphasised that buying into a technology immediately bought you membership of a cultural elite. This worked well, but what really gave it a kick was when gadgets left the office and appeared on the high street. With mobile phones and MP3 players, people were able to show off just how different they were all the time by simply popping a million identical pairs of white headphones into their ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Apple had completed its transition from a technology company into a lifestyle brand: something that comes complete with apparent media privileges. As Alexis Madrigal, editor of the Atlantic tech &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexismadrigal/status/260805815718526978\"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; when Apple showed its latest commercial: &ldquo;Gotta say: that's a damn good iPad Mini commercial. Luckily, the press does all the work of explaining the thing, so Apple can just brand.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conveniences of a compliant technology press are not to be underestimated. But there is a still more significant aspect to being a lifestyle brand within the digital space, closely related to something I call emotional obsolescence: the point at which a purchase stops imparting the gratification it first afforded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise that novelty and beauty can bring happiness and status is hardly a new feature of consumerism. Yet this sentiment, imported from the realms of brands and fashion, has arrived among digital technologies in a particularly intense &ndash; and intensely lucrative &ndash; form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Never satisfied&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the author (and fellow BBC Future columnist) Matt Novak &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/paleofuture/status/260802228284166144\"&gt;noted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; when Apple introduced its fourth generation iPad on Tuesday: &ldquo;the real story here is that Apple shortened its planned obsolescence cycle to 6 months.&rdquo; Aiming to achieve a revolutionary technical breakthrough several times a year is an impossible business plan. Fuelling a frenzy of public feeling at the same interval, however, is eminently possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence the heady ecstasy of the modern product launch &ndash; and the fact that the best generator of technological profit margins in 2012 isn&rsquo;t features or value for money, but the very fact that there is another model out there which is newer and different. It is an emotional experience that money most certainly can buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s also a seductive, dangerous game to play. Can one company continue to dominate perceptions of quality, cool and desire? Microsoft, Samsung, Google and many others are betting not. Will consumers continue to buy into shorter lifespans and incremental changes to products? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my mind, though, what ultimately differentiates digital technologies from fashion and other forms of consumption is the nature of the promise being sold &ndash; and of the emotional obsolescence being rammed down purchasers&rsquo; throats. The notion of shoes and clothes making you a better person is one kind of fiction, and a powerful one at that. But with interactive media, what&rsquo;s being promised is a lifestyle in a far more literal sense: a complete system for expressing yourself in the world, not to mention regularly topping up the premium status of this existence with purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an operating system that &ldquo;works the way you do&rdquo; &ndash; as Microsoft &lt;a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=251529\"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; makes a powerful appeal to our sense of self. It may also offer a magnificent user experience. Yet it begs the question: if this is so great, why should I keep on seeking something better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One answer is that this seeking is just another part of how we work: never satisfied, seeking perfection in continual motion away from the present. And while this isn&rsquo;t the whole story, it is a large part of the vision of lifestyle and humanity that the freshest crop of product launches are selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s an important warning in all this. As MIT professor Sherry Turkle puts it, in her recent book &lt;a href=\"http://noetic.org/noetic/issue-eight-march/alone-together-why-we-expect-more-from-technology/\"&gt;Alone Together&lt;/a&gt;, &ldquo;Technology&nbsp;is seductive when what it offers&nbsp;meets&nbsp;our human vulnerabilities.&rdquo; More than ever, we need to make sure we know what we're really signing up for when we plug into these new seductive lifestyles. Buy and enjoy by all means. But remember: few things are more perfectly engineered to fade over time than seduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

For some, 2013 may begin by going to the gym, or giving up smoking. But what about a more thorough and personal approach towards self-improvement, like monitoring your thoughts, e-mails, or even your bowel movements? If the answer is yes, then perhaps this is the year that you&rsquo;ll be joining a growing group of people who are using technology to measure their lives in extraordinary detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably since the dawn of humanity, people have been fascinated by even the most minute details of their lives, and kept track of what was going on in their bodies and minds. The Roman philosopher Seneca tracked the food he ate and what he dreamt at night. Benjamin Franklin consistently recorded his performance on 13 measures, such as cleanliness, frugality and overindulgence, believing it would keep him virtuous. Engineer and architect Buckminster Fuller nicknamed himself &ldquo;guinea pig b&rdquo; and kept a diary on his daily life and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the past, record-keeping was time-consuming, requiring a commitment that only a very few had the patience to muster. Others cared, but not THAT much. Today, that&rsquo;s changing, as it becomes easier to track everything, from diet to mood to sleep quality. Smartphones come equipped with features like GPS, accelerometers and gyroscopes that can record your activity, location and other vital statistics. Millions of fitness-focused or diet-conscious people track their workouts or their desserts with apps and devices like &lt;a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/\"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/a&gt; that track physical activity or calories burned. New technology also makes it easier to share results with others &ndash; who doesn&rsquo;t want to brag the first time they run more than 5 miles (8km), or be praised when they&rsquo;ve managed to lose 10 pounds (5kg)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing band of devotees centered in the United States, called the &lt;a href=\"http://quantifiedself.com/\"&gt;Quantified Self movement&lt;/a&gt;, has taken the effort to another level. Its members track a whole list of measures and push the technology available to keep tabs on their ideas, their mental health, even their microbiome &ndash; the colonies of bacteria that live on or inside their bodies. Some might scoff at their efforts to keep spreadsheets documenting their mood, diet or sleep patterns. &ldquo;But the insights that we could learn from having all this quantified self data available are almost unfathomable,&rdquo; says Amy Robinson, an organiser of Quantified Self Boston, a group that includes about 650 members and holds bimonthly meet-ups to share ideas and progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Quantified self helps you keep a reference to how you lived not only the day before but two weeks before or a year before,&rdquo; Robinson says. &ldquo;You know when you achieve your best, you know when you exceed your best and it makes that possible by simply having the numbers there.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet such lofty personal goals come down to something that couldn&rsquo;t be more mundane: manually recording the number of daily bowel movements or every bite of food consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence David spent a year tracking 300 measures about his health and behaviour &ndash; including the microbes in his digestive system &ndash;&nbsp;while he was a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. David created a self-tracking system by tinkering with an iPhone app designed to record and manage business cards. Every meal became a new &ldquo;card&rdquo; entry, with hundreds he had to type in by hand over the year &ndash; one night&rsquo;s entry could be cheeseburger and fries, the next pepperoni pizza. &ldquo;One of the few datasets out there is going to be full of junk food,&rdquo; he says, confessing to a personal weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got to the point where he hated the process so much that he didn&rsquo;t want to eat because then he&rsquo;d have to record it. &ldquo;It was terrible,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;Super tedious.&rdquo; But when his boss, associate professor Eric Alm, got food poisoning while self-tracking, it was the first time the microbial pattern of human diarrhoea had been followed in real-time. Sounds gross, but understanding the progress of food poisoning in such a manner could be an important step toward developing treatments for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And other than confirming his love of junk food, he did learn some useful things about himself. David discovered that he wasted a lot of time on e-mail during the day, and wasn&rsquo;t as productive as he thought he was late at night. Now, he saves most of his e-mailing for the evenings &ndash; instead of disrupting his research to respond &ndash; and doesn&rsquo;t feel guilty when he takes a night off. He&rsquo;s stopped tracking most of the other measures, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like David, others who use technology to self-track rely on a mix of mind-numbing and automated measures, and they talk about the greater good, as well as what they&rsquo;ve learned about themselves. The Quantified Self movement originated in San Francisco, after it was first proposed by Wired editors Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly in 2007. As of October 2012, the Quantified Self movement counted more than 70 meet-up groups worldwide with over 5,000 members &ndash; of course, they keep track of that sort of thing. (There&rsquo;s actually a greater number of self-tracking apps on mobile phones than members &ndash; around 7,500 at the moment.) Many of these self-trackers are researchers, computer scientists, or simply tech-savvy, 21st-century Benjamin Franklins who think the act of collecting so much data has the power to transform themselves and the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet-ups are part 7-minute show-and-tells, part social hour. At her first meet-up, in Alabama, Amy Robinson was the only one who had tried quantifying anything, while other attendees were just curious about the idea. In Boston, as you might expect from being an academic and tech hub, many of the participants have developed their own hacks and want to trade tips on how to maximise their record-keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson says she has long been fascinated with where ideas come from, so she started sending herself an e-mail whenever a good one popped into her head. Recently, she collected &lt;a href=\"http://joost.1.ai/amy/\"&gt;six months of these e-mails&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; 770 in all &ndash; analysed them, and presented the results at a Quantified Self meetup in Boston in October. Among the themes that came up most often were &ldquo;science&rdquo;, &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; and &ldquo;health.&rdquo; She found that she had the most new ideas immediately after attending an inspiring conference, travelling or experiencing something new. Doing this exercise helped feed her fascination with the human mind, she told the group, as well as &ldquo;discover more ways to think about myself and discover how my mind works relative to other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Melanie Swan, founder of DIYgenomics, a California-based non-profit that promotes personalised medicine, has presented her findings at several Bay Area meet-ups, and she says meet-up attendees have changed as the movement has evolved. At first, the typical person was obsessive, &ldquo;someone who is really rigorous about self-tracking either because of a health reason or they&rsquo;re compelled to improve their mental performance or whatever,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s now at the meet-ups is a much broader slice, though I would say it&rsquo;s still a pretty tech-forward thinking kind of audience &ndash; anybody interested in improving an aspect of their health.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power of the nudge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their interest in self-quantification is technological, another factor is a more general one: the growing obsession with self-improvement over the past few decades, says Natasha Schull, a cultural anthropologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Weight Watchers has been telling people since the 1970s that if they want to lose weight, they need to track what they eat. The field of behavioural economics,&nbsp;which studies the connection between thoughts and financial decisions, has found that if you alter peoples&rsquo; social environment, they might be nudged into conducting more rational behaviour. For instance, if school cafeterias display fruit before fried chicken, students are more likely to eat fruit because they grab the first food they see. And having people track their actions makes a difference, says Schull, encouraging more people to make the effort to track.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Self-tracking might not have been such a fringe activity in the past, either. There were plenty of people keeping diaries and self-accounts in the 1800s and 1900s, says Schull. &ldquo;Even having a watch and being mindful of time is a form of self-regulation that went along with industrialisation,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as there have been people tracking themselves, there have been people mocking those trackers, Schull adds. D.H. Lawrence &lt;a href=\"http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/lewiss/lawrence.htm\"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; a piece making fun of Franklin&rsquo;s self-obsession and the cockiness embedded in his 13 virtues, including this description: &ldquo;He was a little model, was Benjamin. Doctor Franklin. Snuff-coloured little man! Immortal soul and all!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind such insults lies the idea that tracking the minutiae of one&rsquo;s life can be pointless, an end in itself. Others worry that it could be used for self-destructive purposes, like an anorexic tracking how little she eats. &ldquo;It seems to me in the contemporary US example, the means and the end are blurring,&rdquo; says Schull, who co-taught a class at Harvard University in the autumn called &ldquo;Self as Data&rdquo;. &ldquo;I think people are still motivated &ndash; at least they say they are &ndash; by some kind of transformation, but it&rsquo;s seen as something that doesn&rsquo;t really end.&rdquo; Like the Alcoholics Anonymous model, where people who were once alcoholics are always recovering, Schull says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a different model of what health is.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight and see&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at Yale University, tracking his weight helped him keep it under control. &ldquo;If you watch things, you tend to do better, by virtue of being aware of them,&rdquo; says Gerstein, who has a wifi-enabled bathroom scale that automatically records his weight and feeds it into a database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerstein has also been tracking his asthma symptoms in hope of being able to reduce his medication. He says he sees a little correlation between his exercise and his peak air flow, and thinks the more he can measure about himself, the more he&rsquo;ll know about what triggers his wheezing and the better he&rsquo;ll be at controlling it. It&rsquo;s not just Gerstein&rsquo;s data that&rsquo;s important, this kind of information from thousands of people who have asthma could become much more powerful when it&rsquo;s aggregated. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole other level of what happens when all this information flows together and you can look for patterns and trends,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all self-quantification efforts are successful. Schull&rsquo;s student, Sneha Khullar, began &ndash; reluctantly &ndash; tracking several measures as a class assignment. In her final presentation to the class in December, she explained that she enjoyed using a pedometer to track her footsteps and an app called RescueTime, which showed she is most productive on Fridays &ndash; now that she&rsquo;s given up partying. But writing down everything she ate was too much of a drag, and piling up chocolate wrappers didn&rsquo;t help her moderate her sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khullar, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, self-tracking needs to be easy enough to carry out routinely, but not so easy that it can be ignored. Having to convert miles into kilometres so she could figure out how much she had run required just enough effort to get her invested in the process, with an incentive to keep running more. &ldquo;I could not have imagined I could run more than 5 miles,&rdquo; she proudly told her classmates. But, these tools were way more successful in behaviour-enhancing than in controlling bad habits, she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps this barrier to participation is key to whether self-tracking will fully make the leap from tech obsessives to the mainstream public. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of when does it become easy and when does it become useful,&rdquo; says Stephen Wolfram, creator of the technical computing software Mathematica. He says he&rsquo;s been self-tracking for a quarter of a century &ndash; everything from his personal health to his e-mail to the use patterns of every room in his house. But there are some things even he declines to measure. He doesn&rsquo;t bother with skin conductivity measures, for instance, because he doesn&rsquo;t like wearing the devices. He doesn&rsquo;t wear a camera around his neck, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s not socially realistic for the life I lead &ndash; maybe if I were much younger.&rdquo; And he doesn&rsquo;t record his side of phone conversations because speech recognition software still isn&rsquo;t good enough to provide an accurate transcript. Why would he want a transcript of every conversation? &ldquo;Am I repeating myself? You can immediately check,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next crucial step for self-tracking, several people said, will be the ability to integrate different data streams. Right now, the wifi-enabled scale doesn&rsquo;t talk to the program that monitors blood pressure, diet or sleep &ndash; but such integration will come eventually. Maybe someday it will even link up with &ldquo;smart&rdquo; toilets that can read shifting microbial populations and warn of impending illness. The key will be finding ways to make the data meaningful, rather than just overwhelming. And to keep it private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yale&rsquo;s Gerstein says he worries a lot about the privacy aspects of all thins data. Right now, it seems harmless to share information about our sleep patterns, genes and microbial populations. But one day, that information could be more meaningful &ndash; and could be used against us. Sleep patterns could be relevant, say, in a court case about a traffic accident. People who post genetic information now are revealing things about their future children and grandchildren. &ldquo;I think the fear is people will pile up a lot of information about themselves and share it without fully seeing the implications,&rdquo; Gerstein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robinson says there&rsquo;s no question the Quantified Self movement she is part of will have to address privacy issues. &ldquo;Let the people who want to share their data in a way that maintains their privacy, but also helps other people,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And doctors are going to need to learn how to deal with all the data their patients are beginning to bring them. Right now, Robinson says, people in the Quantified Self movement &ldquo;want to share their information with their doctor, but their doctor doesn&rsquo;t really know what to do with it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfram, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href=\"http://www.wolfram.com/\"&gt;Wolfram Research&lt;/a&gt; and founder of the technology company Wolfram|Alpha, thinks the data will eventually redefine what doctors do. A doctor would be hard-pressed to make sense of the data once people are wired to track their heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood pressure and dozens of other measures. But computers will be able to easily spot patterns and trends, diagnosing far more accurately than doctors can today, and far earlier in the disease process, says Wolfram, who is developing analytics to meet this need. He thinks that eventually we&rsquo;ll go from sensor-based data to being able to treat whatever concern the technology diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, perhaps a Quantified Selfer will figure out a way to measure whether this actually improves our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-01-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Quantified self: The tech-based route to a better life?","HeadlineShort":"A measured life","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Self-improvement has never been easier, thanks to apps and devices that measure all your everyday activities.

It ends with a final &ldquo;salute&rdquo; from the pilot to indicate that the aircraft is ready to be catapulted off the deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the X-47B, the US Navy&rsquo;s newest prototype combat aircraft, prepares for its first carrier launch early next year, there will be no salute.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because there will also be no pilot. Instead, the X-47B will blink its wingtip navigation lights, a robotic nod to the human salute (and mimicking what the Navy does for night launches), before the catapult officer presses the launch button, and the robotic aircraft is flung off the front of the ship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of development, and recent land-based tests, the highly anticipated carrier flight for this stealthy, tailless, unmanned drone is imminent. &ldquo;It should be in early in 2013,&rdquo; says Carl Johnson, vice president and program manager at defence firm Northrop Grumman, which builds the X-47B. &ldquo;We have to coordinate ship schedules as well as all the other airspace issues.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X-47B is a strike fighter-sized prototype drone developed as part of the United States Navy's UCAS-D (Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstration) programme, which aims to develop technologies necessary to field a combat drone on carriers. As a result, it has folding wings and is built for the rigors of sea life, including salt water, deck handling and of course take-off and landing from an aircraft carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the X-47B is a prototype, the Navy hopes to actually field operational unmanned combat aircraft on carriers by the end of the decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unmanned &ldquo;flying wing&rdquo; aircraft, which takes some of its design cues from Northrop Grumman&rsquo;s B-2 stealth bomber, is supposed to demonstrate reconnaissance and strike capabilities&mdash;it has a full-sized weapons bay, although the prototype will not fly with weapons.&nbsp; And, unlike existing drones, which are usually remotely &ldquo;flown&rdquo; by pilots once in the air, the X-47B is designed to fly autonomously, with just the occasional click of a mouse from an operator to send it instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big deal, but it&rsquo;s an extension of something that was already happening,&rdquo; says Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Brooking Institution in Washington, DC, and the author of Wired for War, a book on the military&rsquo;s robotics revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craft was revealed in 2008 but is only now undergoing sea tests aboard the USS Harry S. Truman, including moving around on the carrier. Whilst this kind of trial may not sound remarkable, in some ways it&rsquo;s one of the more challenging steps toward proving that the X-47B, which weighs in at 20,000 kg (44,000 lb) and has a 20m (62 ft) wing span, is ready for flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting around on a crowded flight deck is difficult, says Johnson, because the aircraft must maneuver very close the edge of the carrier, sometimes pivoting so that it appears that half the airplane is hanging off the ship. &ldquo;The precision involved in doing that is very difficult with a pilot following directions from a person on the deck,&rdquo; says Johnson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very difficult to do that as well with an unmanned system.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the engineers have built a wireless remote control device that can be used to move the aircraft around the deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X-47B has already been tested on land in conditions meant to mimic operations on a carrier deck, including a catapult launch, but operating on a real carrier crowded with people and equipment presents fresh challenges. &nbsp;For example, the X-47B must be tested for electromagnetic interference, in other words, making sure that the aircraft&rsquo;s electronic systems don&rsquo;t clash with the myriad radar and emitters that are on a ship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;While we go through a rigorous test program, you really learn a lot when you&rsquo;re at sea and you&rsquo;re validating your system against the true environment of the carrier,&rdquo; says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes well with these tests, the Navy will then be ready for its first at-sea flight. This will likely be a short affair, according to Johnson, and will start with a catapult launch and end with the aircraft landing not on the carrier, but on firm ground. Later that year, the X-47B will also perform an &ldquo;arrested landing,&rdquo; meaning it will land back on the aircraft carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key flight test will take place in 2014, when the X-47 demonstrates that it can perform autonomous aerial refueling. Currently, the craft has a range of around 3,200km (2,000 miles) and can stay aloft for six hours. But for effective operations, the Navy would like it to stay aloft for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head-to-head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if all those tests go smoothly, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the X-47B will actually be deployed. The stealthy, aircraft is still merely a prototype. The Navy soon plans to launch a new program to develop an operational unmanned combat aircraft, which will involve fielding up to half a dozen armed drones on carriers by the end of the decade as part of what&rsquo;s called the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early next year, the Navy will hold a competition to build the new drone. That means Northrop, the incumbent, will have to compete against other companies, including Lockheed Martin, which built the stealthy RQ-170 (famously captured by Iran), and General Atomics, which makes the familiar Reaper and Predator drones, and Boeing, which developed the X-45, a one-time competitor to Northrop&rsquo;s drone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as a prototype, however, the X-47B&rsquo;s upcoming launch from an aircraft carrier, the &ldquo;heart of US naval aviation&rdquo;, marks a significant watershed for drones, says Singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the places where we haven&rsquo;t seen them yet.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the X-47B&rsquo;s upcoming flight is not about proving that drones can work&mdash;that&rsquo;s already been done&mdash;but expanding how and where they are used. &ldquo;The Wright Brothers moment already happened,&rdquo; says Singer. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in the equivalent of 1920s and 1930s.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:13:03Z","HeadlineLong":"X-47B stealth drone targets new frontiers","HeadlineShort":"Stealth drone hits new frontiers","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The US Navy's cutting-edge robot fighter plane aims to be the first unmanned aerial vehicle to take-off and land at sea.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"slideshow","SummaryLong":"The US Navy's cutting-edge robot fighter plane aims to be the first unmanned aerial vehicle to take-off and land at sea.","SummaryShort":"Radical robot jet prepares for take off","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:13:03Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"d54edd3c-85a7-4f61-a9ba-f113bf3dbecd","Id":"wwfuture/story/20121218-stealth-drone-targets-life-at-sea","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:13:03Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20121218-stealth-drone-targets-life-at-sea"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20121218-stealth-drone-targets-life-at-sea","_id":"559a6a1882f2d2dbf7bd4827"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;The dangers of talking on a mobile phone or texting whilst driving are well known.&nbsp; So adding what, on first glance, look like added distractions may not seem like the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers and car firms are increasingly looking to give drivers enhanced, or augmented reality (AR) that adds extra information ranging from directions to social media feeds to the view through the windscreen. And, perhaps the most unintuitive part of it is that it is designed to make the roads more secure for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The biggest way augmented reality can be useful is in supporting safe driving,&rdquo; says Professor Anind Dey, of the&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/\"&gt;Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Institute&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;at&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\"&gt;Carnegie Mellon University&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;The ability to enhance information around us that might otherwise be opaque to us is invaluable.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality\"&gt;AR&lt;/a&gt; is usually considered to be a live view of the real world, onto which extra data &ndash; usually pulled from the internet - is layered or superimposed. It is similar to the view of the world that Arnold Schwarzenegger had in the Terminator movies. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology is already well established elsewhere. For example, there are numerous smartphone apps that allow users to overlay the view from their camera with everything from directions and transport options to restaurant reviews and house prices. Point your phone at something of interest, power up your app and you are away.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like Google are taking it one step further. Earlier this &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17618495\"&gt;year the search giant unveiled its Google Glass project&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of minimal glasses that overlay a person&rsquo;s vision with everything from weather data, location and diary appointments. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is an idea that has been seized upon by other firms, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20462840\"&gt;such as Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now AR is making its way into cars. It builds on so-called &ldquo;heads up display&rdquo; (HUD) technology that is commonly used in fighter planes and began to make its way into high-end cars in the late 1990s. These HUDs are frequently used to project directions or speed onto the windscreen in the driver&rsquo;s line of sight to minimize the amount of time the driver takes their eyes off the road. But augmented reality could allow these displays to go much further than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking glass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Car manufacturers such as BMW, Toyota, Mercedes and GM have shown off various prototypes in recent years. For example, a Mercedes concept unveiled earlier this year and known as Dice allowed drivers to conjure up information about passing places of interest by merely pointing at them while friends driving past the car show up as an icon on the windscreen, alongside their social network status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another concept from GM, known as the enhanced vision system, uses an array of sensors and cameras mounted inside and outside the vehicle to monitor the environment around the car and the driver&rsquo;s eye and head movements. This information is then used to overlay the view from the windscreen with relevant information about driving conditions &ndash; such as the location of the building you are trying to find or dangers that you may not be aware of, such as an animal or child at the side of the road. Another mode marks the edges of the road when fog obscures the drivers view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other concepts take AR even further. Japanese car maker Toyota has shown off a prototype of &lt;a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13746_7-20081402-48/toyota-demos-augmented-reality-enhanced-car-windows/\"&gt;&ldquo;enhanced car windows&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that would allow passengers to zoom in on places and objects of interest that they are passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the most extreme concept comes from designers at &lt;a href=\"http://tachilab.org/modules/projects/rpt.html\"&gt;Keio University in Japan&lt;/a&gt;, who are working on technology that will make the back seat of a car appear transparent, so that when drivers are reversing they can see everything around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experimental setup uses cameras mounted outside the car &lt;a href=\"http://tachilab.org/modules/projects/transparentcockpit.html\"&gt;to project an image inside the car in the driver&rsquo;s field of view&lt;/a&gt;. Using similar technology to a heads-up display, the image is shown on a reflective screen mounted behind and between the two front seats. When a driver looks back over his shoulder, he sees the &ldquo;real&rdquo; image out of the rear view window continued, through augmented reality, right down the seats to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovations like this may be a long way from going into production. But other uses of AR could appear much sooner. For example, the most common use of AR is to overlay the world with directions that are overlayed on the road in front of you. Almost all concepts show some variant of this and, earlier this year, electronics firm Pioneer claimed to introduce the &lt;a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/09/pioneer-touts-worlds-first-car-gps-with-augmented-reality/\"&gt;world&rsquo;s first GPS with AR&lt;/a&gt;, that can be installed in any vehicle.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of innovation would be helpful to any driver. But Professor Dey and his team believe it could be especially useful for &lt;a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Esjunikim/download/SJKimCHI09.pdf\"&gt;older people&lt;/a&gt;, whose sense of spatial awareness may be reduced. This is especially problematic when they must look down at a navigation system, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The amount of time being spent not looking out the windshield, and the number of times that occurs on a short drive, can get pretty high,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Particularly when you are talking about elder drivers who may have diminished facilities for driving, you want to reduce the amount of time they are looking away.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, he devised a simulator that projects the navigation system across the full width of the screen. The driver sees the real world, but with a map superimposed on top. As turns or streets come up, the map updates like a panning computerised window that is locked to the real world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the system is a prototype, it has given Prof Dey and his team clues about how a real system should work. For example, to ensure that one set of distractions is not replaced by another, he believes that drivers should be allowed to personalize a system so that they can receive notifications from the system in ways that feel intuitive to them, such as audio tones, or even by touch, using haptic feedback through the steering wheel and seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&ldquo;We should be using technologies like augmented reality to personalise the driving experience much more so that we are currently.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials have also flagged potential problems. For example, many of the subjects who have tried the system out in Professor Dey&rsquo;s simulator have reported that it feels like playing a computer game &ndash; this &nbsp;detachment from reality is an issue that the engineers know needs to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to lessen the impact of making a mistake,&rdquo; Professor Dey explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, and perhaps most importantly, more work needs to be done to work out what is the optimum amount of the windscreen that can be covered with AR graphics, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, augmented reality is only useful if the driver is in touch with the reality behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:14:24Z","HeadlineLong":"Cars turn to augmented reality ","HeadlineShort":"Cars turn to augmented reality ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Car firms hope to turn windscreens into giant computer displays that overlay the real world with useful information, such as directions or even social media feeds. \n","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Car firms hope turn windscreens into giant computer screens that overlay the real world with useful information, such as directions or even social media feeds.

Our global extractions are environmentally damaging and &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120418-no-silver-bullet\"&gt;depleting some resources&lt;/a&gt; to the extent that they are in danger of &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120308-touch-and-go-screens\"&gt;running out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of those resources find their way into the goods, gadgets and machines that we find indispensable in our everyday lives. But do we really need so much stuff, or are we simply addicted to the new? There's no doubt that our consumption of resources from food to gadgets has risen dramatically over the past 60 years, and much of the world seems to be in the grip of a &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120712-beating-our-consumption-habit\"&gt;shopping epidemic&lt;/a&gt;. But is there a conscious effort driving it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been many times during my travels when I've needed something repaired, from rips in my backpack, to holes in my clothes, zippers that have broken or memory cards that have lost data. From India to Ethiopia, I have had no trouble in finding someone who can sort the problem out, repair what is broken or find an ingenious way of side-stepping the issue. In rich countries, such items often would be thrown away and replaced with new ones without a second thought. But the developing world is still full of menders, make-doers and inspired users of others&rsquo; scrap. I&rsquo;ve seen a bicycle in Nairobi made from bits of car, a colander and a leather belt; aerials made from all manner of implements; and houses constructed out of old boat sails, rice sacks and plastic drinks bottles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then there are those items that seemingly can&rsquo;t be repaired. My camera shutter, battered by the dust and grime of travel, no longer works. I'm told I should throw away my camera, even though it works fine, apart from the shutter mechanism. Like the majority of consumer electronics, my camera has not been designed to be easily reparable. Thirty years ago, I could have found service manuals and spare parts for all camera models, as well as a thriving repair industry. But things have changed. Camera models have got far more numerous and complicated, and manufacturers no longer release repair manuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the mobile phone handset market reached saturation in Europe and the United States about a decade ago, we have chosen not to wait for our devices to fail. Almost all new phones purchased are &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo;, replacing functioning phones simply for reasons of fashion or for technological additions that many of us rarely use, and which could otherwise easily be achieved through software upgrades to existing handsets. Indeed, most phone companies compete for business by automatically upgrading customers&rsquo; phones every year. And these smart phones use mined resources from some of the most ecologically sensitive areas of the world, as a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9KYQfctNk\"&gt;Friends of the Earth campaign&lt;/a&gt; points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made to fail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that something that works fine should be replaced is now so ingrained in our culture that few people question it. But it is a fairly recent concept, brought about by a revolution in the advertising and manufacturing industries, which thrived on various 20th century changes, including the mass movement of large populations to cities, the development of mass production, globalisation, improved transport, international trade and public broadcast media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest example of manufacturers convincing people to frequently replace a product may be the so-called &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://documentaryheaven.com/the-lightbulb-conspiracy/\"&gt;lightbulb conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, in which a group of companies is supposed to have orchestrated the Phoebus Cartel to prevent companies from selling lightbulbs with a longer than 1,000-hour lifespan (most settled on 750 hours), even though bulbs lasting more than 100,000 hours existed. The cartel said its intent was to develop international standards, but the net result was that households needed to replace their bulbs regularly, providing a far larger consumer market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This way of selling more products by designing products that deliberately fail, cannot be repaired, or have a set lifespan imposed in some other way is known as planned obsolescence. However, it is not just a cynical plot dreamed up by manufacturers to boost profits, many politicians and economists believe it to be a societal necessity. The idea was born in the US during the 1930s depression as a way to get the economy moving again by compelling people to buy more stuff. There were plenty of factories and masses of unemployed looking for gainful work, the trouble was the people who could afford to buy things already had them. What was needed, strategists proposed, was a reason for shoppers to buy things they already had, or didn&rsquo;t know they &ldquo;needed&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1950s, planned obsolescence had become the dominant paradigm in mass production with things no longer built to last. A sophisticated advertising industry persuaded people to shop. Mechanisms flourished to make this easier, from department stores to credit. Consumerism was born. Some industries, such as fashion are predicated on planned obsolescence, with items being made to last a single season or less. Other industries are following fashion&rsquo;s high-turnover model and bringing out products that have cosmetic gimmicks or seasonal appeal but which will soon appear dated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer says no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people wonder whether electronic products are being designed to fail, from television sets, which have heat-sensitive condensers deliberately fitted onto the circuit board next to a heat sink connected to the transistors, to washing machines with ball-bearings fitted inaccessibly into the drums so they cannot be replaced. Specific lifespans are programmed by the manufacturers into chips in some equipment, so that printers will stop working after a preset number of pages (sending a message: &ldquo;internal error&rdquo;), coffee makers will cease functioning after a preset quota of brews, and memory cards will stop uploading after a preset number of photo uploads. The user is then forced to buy a replacement. Some computers are difficult to upgrade &ndash; new versions of software are upwardly compatible so files won&rsquo;t work on older models or, as in the new Apple MacBook Pro, the RAM is &lt;a href=\"http://ifixit.org/2763/the-new-macbook-pro-unfixable-unhackable-untenable/\"&gt;soldered to the motherboard&lt;/a&gt;, making it difficult or costly to upgrade or replace the hard drive and &lt;a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405921,00.asp\"&gt;battery&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, users can find themselves buying a new computer every couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another trick is to make parts and accessories incompatible between brands or even models of the same brand. Thus, not only do consumers need to buy a different memory card or battery or charger for each device or brand of electronic equipment they buy, from phones to laptops to toothbrushes, but they must also &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/09/iphone_5_dock_connector_the_one_incredibly_irksome_feature_that_will_leave_you_cursing_apple_.html\"&gt;buy a new charger or adaptor&lt;/a&gt; when they upgrade from an iPhone 4 to the iPhone 5, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some consumers are starting to hit back, though, advising people on the internet how to find and remove the printer chip or over-write the memory card software. But this is technically challenging and time-consuming, and most people aren&rsquo;t even aware of the reason for their device no longer working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Californian Kyle Wiens is the type of sophisticated electronics tinkerer that emperors of the IT industry like Microsoft and Apple dream of employing. But Kyle is a guerilla geek &ndash; he slipped through their net and crossed over to the consumer side. Instead of dreaming up intricate ways of fitting more and more components into ever-slimmer gadgets, Kyle is taking them apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It started a decade ago, when he was a student and his iBook stopped working, Kyle explains. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get find a service manual for it, so as my friend [fellow student Luke Soules] and I took it apart to fix it, we created our own manual.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle and Luke began taking apart computers and other equipment, getting around the copyright protection by creating their own service manuals from scratch, and posting them online for free. The pair called their site &lt;a href=\"http://ifixit.com/\"&gt;iFixit.com&lt;/a&gt; and over the past decade, they have expanded to hundreds more manuals, encouraging home hackers to create their own manuals for the site &ndash; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re a Wikipedia of service manuals&rdquo; &ndash; and they also sell the tools and spare parts users need to fix their own electrical devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are contributing to a cultural shift in perception, Kyle says. &ldquo;When someone has repaired their broken iPad or whatever, it&rsquo;s a life-changing experience. That person will become a different consumer. They will choose new products based on how long-lasting they are and how easy they are to take apart and repair.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, there is little onus on manufacturers to improve, and indeed things may be getting worse. As Apple&rsquo;s beautiful-looking and increasingly thin gadgets take an ever-larger share of the market, other manufacturers are following suit. &lt;a href=\"http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_maxx-review-800.php\"&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/15/nokia-lumia-900-review-this-ones-a-no-brainer/\"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were known for their durable phones with easily replaced long-lasting batteries, have now both released thin phones with glued-in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some companies have been bucking the trend. HP and Dell release service manuals and make computers that are easily upgradable and repairable &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://ifixit.com/\"&gt;iFixit.com&lt;/a&gt; recently gave HPs Z1 model a score of 10 out of 10 for repairability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And other companies are joining the move towards a circular economy, in which economic growth is uncoupled from finite-resource-use. Instead of the linear manufacturing route: mining materials, fabricating, selling, throwing them away; a circular economy is based around making products that are more easily disassembled, so that the resources can be recovered and used to make new products, &lt;a href=\"http://www.rreuse.org/t3/\"&gt;keeping them in circulation&lt;/a&gt;. British yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur is a strong advocate of the concept and &lt;a href=\"http://www.thecirculareconomy.org/\"&gt;commissioned a report into the idea&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the benefits to Europe&rsquo;s economy alone could be $630 billion, based on cycling just 15% of materials in 48% of manufacturing and just being recycled once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-end outdoors clothing company &lt;a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com/email/11/112811.html\"&gt;Patagonia&lt;/a&gt;, for example, issues a guarantee that it will repair any of its products for free over their lifetime, and employs a team of seamstresses to do just that. And in 2011, it actually ran an advertising campaign asking consumers to buy less of the stuff they don&rsquo;t need, to curb waste and environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mines become depleted, it could soon force the market to change its recent ways. During the course of the 20th century there was a steady fall in the price of commodities, but that price has been climbing since 2000. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re moving towards a resource-limited economy, which means manufacturers are going to have to move their business model towards remanufacturing and repairs, as the cost of rare earth metals and other resources slash profits,&rdquo; Kyle says. Perhaps, then, planned obsolescence will begin to reach its own expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Gaia?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The high cost of our throwaway culture","HeadlineShort":"The cost of our throwaway culture","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In the second of a two-part series, Gaia Vince explains how our consumer appetite is draining the planet of its resources, and why it is time to act more responsibly.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"In the second of a two-part series, Gaia Vince explains how consumerism is draining the planet of its resources, and why it is time to act more responsibly.","SummaryShort":"How we are draining the planet of its resources","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"64938ee8-34f9-4df5-8748-dcd5478a24ec","Id":"wwfuture/story/20121129-the-cost-of-our-throwaway-culture","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20121129-the-cost-of-our-throwaway-culture"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20121129-the-cost-of-our-throwaway-culture","_id":"559a6a1682f2d2dbf7bd47f1"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;If you&rsquo;re looking for a headline to capture our technological times, this recent one might fit the bill: &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/the-diy-kidtracking-drone\"&gt;The DIY kid-tracking drone&lt;/a&gt;.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help keep a close eye on his child, American parent Paul Wallich adapted a quadcopter to follow a GPS chip in his son&rsquo;s backpack to the bus stop every morning on the way to school: an ingenious outsourcing of parental responsibility, and a formidable piece of hacking to boot. What, though, does this say about the increasing delegation not only of daily tasks to machines, but of potentially life-changing decisions themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a life and death dilemma that could soon be science fact rather than fiction. As psychology professor Gary Marcus pointed out in a recent &lt;a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/11/google-driverless-car-morality.html\"&gt;piece for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, driverless cars are now street-legal in three American states and could soon be cruising into a garage near you. But if your driverless car were hypothetically to encounter a bus full of schoolchildren on the wrong side of the road, how should it react: should it make a decision to swerve, preventing a collision but putting your life at risk; or should it collide with the bus if there&rsquo;s a greater chance of you surviving? &ldquo;If the decision must be made in milliseconds,&rdquo; Marcus reasons, &ldquo;the computer will have to make the call.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cars are an interesting case study because they already represent one of the most hazardous technological environments most of us enter on a regular basis &ndash; and because the belief that technology should make this environment as safe as possible has been accepted, and been saving lives, for decades. As a famous adage of product design puts it, once you&rsquo;ve built the car, your task is not simply to hope that you can prevent all accidents, but to design a better car crash &ndash; that is, to make those inevitable occasions on which things go wrong as unlikely as possible to cause fatal harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minimising harm is a clear enough good. What happens, though, to ethical issues in design when the product you&rsquo;re creating is itself going to be making decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus&rsquo; driverless car scenario riffs off the famous &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem\"&gt;trolley problem&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;: a thought experiment that asks subjects to decide between pushing one man off a bridge in order to save the lives of several others trapped in the path of a runaway railway trolley, or allowing that one man to survive while the others meet their doom. Most respondents are unwilling physically to push another human being to their death even if it would save multiple lives &ndash; one of the factors the test is designed to measure. A machine&rsquo;s response, though, would depend entirely upon the decision-making model encoded by its creators. One robot might refuse to act; one might save the many; one might not even recognize a choice exists. It&rsquo;s up to us to decide which program to write. But once we&rsquo;ve done it and set things in motion, it&rsquo;s up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programming this into cars is one thing. Weapons are quite another &ndash; and represent perhaps the most urgent testing-ground for machine ethics today. Early this December, Iran boasted that it had &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20594431\"&gt;captured a US ScanEagle drone&lt;/a&gt; over its airspace; one of the most basic models of the thousands of unmanned aerial vehicles that have become the standard stuff of warfare over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Paul Wallich&rsquo;s child-minding quadcopter, most drones are more like sophisticated remote-controlled aircraft than autonomous decision-makers. Late November, though, saw some of the first tests of what &lt;a href=\"http://rt.com/usa/news/us-drone-launch-autonomous-986/\"&gt;some news outlets colourfully labelled a &ldquo;killer robot&rdquo;:&lt;/a&gt; a US Navy stealth drone piloted by artificial intelligence. Snappily named the X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System, the 19m- (62ft-) wide aircraft is designed to take split-second decisions on its own initiative &ndash; and even land itself on an aircraft carrier &ndash; while remaining under the overall control of human operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as anything, it&rsquo;s the relationship between these human operators and their subject that&rsquo;s most disturbing. Thought experiments like the trolley problem demonstrate something self-evident but extremely significant in moral thinking: how our sense of obligation is modified by distance and immediacy. We feel differently about pushing someone off a bridge with our own hands than we do about pushing a button to achieve the same result. Weapons are real-world examples of this: the arrow differs from the fist, the rifle from the arrow, the bomb from the gun. And by the time you reach autonomous systems, many of the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; setting them in motion will have taken place months or even years ago: as part of a process of programming and design whose eventual consequences may be entirely unknowable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all this sounds rather removed from real life, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that the cutting edge of today&rsquo;s battlefield will represent little more than the state-of-the-art in domestic appliances a decade from now. Such is the speed of technological change, and the steady migration of its moral conundrums towards the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s a field in which the ghostly outlines of future controversy are already clearly visible. If a drone can oversee your child&rsquo;s journey to school today, will it be driving you both to work tomorrow &ndash; and should you insist on this, if the machine is demonstrably a safer driver than you? If robot soldiers can fight for your country without risking your sons&rsquo; and daughters&rsquo; lives, should you gratefully embrace automated warfare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are new questions, but answering them means grappling with ancient ethical issues about responsibility. What does it mean to hold someone responsible not only for their actions, but for the chains of consequence they set snaking through the world? And what does it mean to exercise human ingenuity responsibly, given the ever-expanding scope of our powers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the best contemporary answer may mean giving up some of that power &ndash; and asking what it means to create machines that can take responsibility for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

To those unfamiliar with the vehicle, it might have looked roughly similar to the US space shuttle, the manned spacecraft that shuttled astronauts into space for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this spaceplane, called the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, is very different. While it looks like a plane, is launched on a rocket, has a cargo bay and uses some of the same technology as the shuttle, such as thermal shielding to protect it during reentry, it is smaller and unmanned. It is designed to stay in orbit for months on end and can automatically land back on Earth. Perhaps more crucially, the Boeing-designed plane is operated by the US Air Force and its mission is a closely held secret, prompting a slew of speculation about its true purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the first X-37B was launched in 2010, amateur satellite spotters have carefully followed the robotic spacecraft&rsquo;s orbit, while those unconnected with the program have speculated that the plane could be anything from an anti-satellite weapon to so-called &ldquo;on demand reconnaissance,&rdquo; shorthand for a spy satellite that can be placed over any country in the world. Compounding the mystery was the launch of a second vehicle in 2011, which stayed in orbit for 469 days, long exceeding the Air Force&rsquo;s stated maximum requirement of 270 days for the spaceplane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a third launch is slated for 11 December, according to an Air Force spokesperson, once again ramping up the rumour mill. So, what do we actually know about the plane?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports focused on the X-37B&rsquo;s seeming resemblance, at least in size and weight, to &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-20_Dyna-Soar\"&gt;the X-20 Dynasoar&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dynamic Soarer), a 1950s-era hypersonic vehicle that was envisioned for a variety of military missions, including bombing and sabotaging enemy satellites. However, experts familiar with the X-37B programme emphasized that its technology is actually closer to the recently retired space shuttle (a &lt;a href=\"http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/2011/CDReadymspace11_2426/PV2011_7315.pdf\"&gt;fact reinforced by Boeings&rsquo; proposal for a crewed version of the vehicle&lt;/a&gt; known as the X-37C). The Air Force blandly described the role of the X-37B in &lt;a href=\"http://www.af.mil/information/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16639\"&gt;a factsheet given to media&lt;/a&gt; as a \"reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Air Force also says the mini-shuttle has two objectives: testing &ldquo;reusable spacecraft technologies&rdquo; and conducting &ldquo;experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth&rdquo;. Again, this is similar to the stated aims of the space shuttle. But many forget that earlier craft also had a secret military role. Although ostensibly a civilian program, it conducted a series of missions from 1982-1992 on behalf of the National Reconnaissance Office, carrying a series of classified spy satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, most outside experts now agree that it&rsquo;s likely the robotic space plane is being used for some sort of secret reconnaissance. &ldquo;I think the guess that makes most sense is quick-response tactical imaging, meaning hours to a couple of days from request to delivery,&rdquo; says Allen Thomson, a former CIA analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson says it is also possible that it could have a more mundane but useful task, such as &ldquo;maintaining up-to-date general purpose mapping imagery.&rdquo; However, if that is the case, Thomson says that it could be a waste of money. &ldquo;I think that the commercial satellites could and should do that cheaper and better than X-37B,&rdquo; he says. It is a view &lt;a href=\"http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/space_weapons/technical_issues/the-x-37b-space-plane.html\"&gt;backed by parts of the scientific community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the X-37B launches comes in the middle of a larger debate about the role of government-operated spy satellites, which have proven enormously costly but can provide some of the most advanced imagery, versus commercial satellite imagery. The US intelligence community recently slashed its budget for commercial imagery, indicating that it was going back to greater reliance on its own classified satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view that the X-37B is a reconnaissance platform is strengthened by observations from amateur satellite watchers, who track the vehicles&rsquo; orbits, and noticed that it has similar orbits to spy satellites and scientific remote sensing craft. In addition, they noticed the craft changing its orbital path several times during its test flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected, says Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security studies at the US Naval War College in Newport. &ldquo;The upcoming launch will continue just to see what the vehicle can do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;One of the things they are testing is maneuverability. The problem with satellites in orbit is they are very predictably in certain orbits at certain times, and thus vulnerable to anti-satellite weapons (ASAT).&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson-Freese says the military has long been interested in the ability of a spacecraft that has &ldquo;the ability to evade, to maneuver, to not be in a predicable place at a predicable time.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She expects the Air Force will be &ldquo;pressing the envelope for manoeuvrability and duration&rdquo; during the X-37B&rsquo;s next flight. &ldquo;That will give them the idea of potential missions where avoidance of ASATs comes into play.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;No weapons&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although its orbits may be difficult to predict in advance, its tracks show where the X-37B has been and its likely purpose, says Brian Weeden, a technical advisor at the Secure World Foundation, a Washington-based foundation that focuses on space issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he says, the X-37B flew at inclination of 42.79 degrees, which tells you how far north and south in latitude the spacecraft can see. &ldquo;The tradeoff is that something at a 90 degree polar orbit covers the whole world, but its frequency is less; it may arrive only every couple of days,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If something is 40 or 45 degrees, it would be covering a smaller portion [of the earth], but more often. &ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a 42.79 degree inclination, the X-37B would be useful for looking at a geographic region such as the Middle East, says Weeden, pouring cold water on one theory that that it was used to spy on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16423881\"&gt;China&rsquo;s spacelab, Tiangong-1&lt;/a&gt;. And given the current political context, he says, the Middle East &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeden also suggests the X-37B&rsquo;s orbit may indicate that the military is trying out a new sensor system, such as radar imaging or &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging\"&gt;hyperspectral sensors&lt;/a&gt;, which collect information across different wavelengths. He suggests this could be the case, because unlike satellites collecting light in the visible wavelength, the X-37B&rsquo;s orbits are not synchronized with the sun, a trick used to maintain a predictable angle between the sun, satellite and ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, like with many of the theories surrounding the X-37B, he warns, &ldquo;it is just speculation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, the Air Force itself is silent about the plane&rsquo;s use, only speaking to allay fears that it was a weapon. \"I don't know how this could be called weaponisation of space. It's just an updated version of the space shuttle type of activities in space,\" said Gary Payton, the Air Force's deputy undersecretary for space programmes, in 2010.&nbsp; \"We, the Air Force, have a suite of military missions in space and this new vehicle could potentially help us do those missions better.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever its purpose; the X-37B is perhaps one of the few bright spots among the Pentagon&rsquo;s hypersonic test vehicle programs.&nbsp; The Air Force&rsquo;s X-51A Waverider, a scramjet powered hypersonic missile, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120815-hypersonic-ambitions-fall-short\"&gt;suffered a fatal mishap earlier this year on a test flight&lt;/a&gt;, and never reached hypersonic speeds.&nbsp; Separately, another hypersonic prototype, known as the Falcon Hypersonic Test Vehicle-2, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-14497641\"&gt;suffered mishaps in both flight tests&lt;/a&gt;, plunging into the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those other efforts, which are focused on creating missiles, are still in early testing phase, while the X-37B is clearly further along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think the one interesting question is whether this is just test and evaluation, or is it being used to be support real world operations,&rdquo; says Weeden. But like most questions about the plane, it is one that is currently impossible to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"X-37B: Secrets of the US military spaceplane","HeadlineShort":"Secrets of US military spaceplane","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"As the US Air Force prepares for the third launch of its mysterious X-37B vehicle, BBC Future looks at what is known about the classified project.
