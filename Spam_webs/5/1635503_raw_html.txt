            Ben Wheatley:
           </strong>
           I guess the first one I ever saw in the cinema wouldve been the Disney
           <em>
            Jungle Book
           </em>
           . Where we livedin Essex, which is a county outside of Londonthere wasnt really When I was a kid, there were only films on TV. No VHS, no cable, and no cinemas nearby. So I didnt really see much stuff. Going to cinema was a major event. I could probably name all the films I saw when I was a kid, because there are only about five or six. [Laughs.] Also, I used to get to bed quite early, being 5. Id see the beginning of a film, and then get sent to bed, and Id take a long time to work out what that film was. I think I saw the beginning of
           <em>
            Dr. No
           </em>
           , but not the rest of it. I remember that vividly as a kid. Id get sent to bed around the beginning of the second act, just as it would get interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
           So yeah, I guess
           <em>
            The Jungle Book
           </em>
           would have been the first film, and then something like
           <em>
            Herbie The Love Bug.
           </em>
           And to see a film in a cinema when I was a kid was kind of overwhelming. Id never had anything like that experience since, because it was so rare. When I think about my own son, weve got films that he sees regularly. He watched all the Miyazaki movies by the time he was 5, except for the really horrible ones. And he would have experienced all the cool kids films that I saw later, or that I wanted to see. Hes completely literate where I was not. I mean, in the U.K. at that time, in the 1970s, there were only three channels. There just wasnt much on.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of something like
           <em>
            The Jungle Book
           </em>
           influencing me, the influence was more that it was an incredibly exciting and bright and impactful experience going to see
           <em>
            anything
           </em>
           . Even the adverts were amazing. And eating popcorn and all those things. I wasnt a child that was taken to the cinema every day, or would sneak out and do that kind of Tarantino or Scorsese thing, of going to see films all the time. There just werent any opportunity when we were little. The cinema was in the nearest town, which was five miles away from where we lived.

           Youd probably get the same answer for anyone my age: For that period,
           <em>
            Star Wars
           </em>
           wouldve been the biggest thing. And I never even saw the sequels in the cinema. I saw
           <em>
            Empire Strikes Back
           </em>
           on Super 8, like a digest version of it, a 15-minute version. And I didnt actually see that until I was 18. I say it out loud, and it sounds quite Calvinist. [Laughs.] It felt like that at the time, too. These things just werent important to my parents.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Star Wars
           </em>
           , I remember seeing it first in a magazine. In those days, we had this massive gap between when the films came out in the States and when they came out here. We could wait years for a film. It was incredible. Youd have the kind of cultural flash of it on the horizon, and you might get the toys first, or the comics or something, but you wouldnt get the film until a long time afterward. America was a very exotic place for us, because everything was different there, from what we saw. The cars were all different, the architecture was all different. Now its sadly much more homogenized. You go to a mall in America, you go to a mall here, its the same thing. The cars are all the same, too. Back then, I remember
           <em>
            Star Wars
           </em>
           coming out and it being this incredible event that was coming, coming, coming. Youd see kids that would spend some holidays in America, and theyd come back with T-shirts, and youd want to know what was going on.
          </p>
          <p>
           So yeah, I remember seeing it, and it blew my mind, really. It was just so bright and big and fun. I must say, its not something I obsess about, particularly now as an adult. Ive watched all the
           <em>
            Clone Wars
           </em>
           stuff and the animation bits, primarily through my son, I guess. But the boldness of that first film is just amazing when you actually think about it. I was a big fan of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon and all those serials, too. I dont know if you used to have that in the States, but they used to repeat them a lot on British television in the 1970s, so we would watch them a lot. In a way, the experience of watching those things, and then watching
           <em>
            Star Wars
           </em>
           which is directly influenced by themmade them all feel contemporary to us. Well, to me, anyway. You could see the direct link.
           <em>
            Star Wars
           </em>
           was just a much more expensive, much more amazing version of that stuff.

           When VHS tapes first became available at video stores, I watched an incredible ton of stuff. This wouldve been before the video nasty legislation came around in the U.K., so there was no certification for rentals. You could get whatever you wanted. No one even thought about it. And the most influential one probably for me was
           <i>
            Taxi Driver
           </i>
           , which seemed to be a very weird film to rent at the time, because why would you want to watch a film about a taxi driver? But my friends and I heard that this film was pretty incredible, so we tracked it down. By that point it was quite an old movie by our standards10 years old, or something like that. I had never seen anything like it.
          </p>
          <p>
           It sounds like a clich, but watching
           <i>
            Taxi Driver
           </i>
           , I really started to realize that there were such things as directors, and they had signature ways of working. I started to put it together. I realized that Robert De Niro seemed to be in all these movies that were directed by this guy called Martin Scorsese. So Id seek out all his movies and watch those. The next big thing that hit me was
           <em>
            Goodfellas
           </em>
           . Again, I never saw any of these films in the cinema, they were always on tape. I went into my sisters room and she had rented that just as itd come out, and I saw 40 seconds of it and had to run out of the room and rent it for myself and watch it. Because it seemed to be, visually, the most incredible film Id seen.
          </p>
          <p>
           Around the same period, I remember wed program our own little film festivals. I remember one time I watched
           <i>
            Silver Bullet
           </i>
           and
           <i>
            The Dead Zone
           </i>
           and
           <i>
            Videodrome
           </i>
           and
           <i>
            Texas Chain Saw Massacre
           </i>
           in one sitting. Wed do that regularly, just find these movies that would blow the top of your head off. With no context, and no one telling us if they were good or bad, or what they even were. There was no Internet to read up on stuff, and no film books. We couldnt afford books or anything, really, and I lived out in the sticks. Its not like now. Nothings really a secret anymore. You can look everything up, you know the dates of everything, and what these people have done, and you connect all the dots together. But back then, everything seemed to be a massive mystery. It was a brilliant time.
          </p>
          <p>
           Obviously, Im very nostalgic for it, because I was young. It might be even more exciting now. Its hard to say.

            Wheatley:
           </strong>
           When I was at college, I started to broaden my horizons in terms of art cinema and European cinema. Seeing Jean-Luc Godards
           <i>
            Weekend
           </i>
           , I realized you could jump-cut, and that films could affect you in a way that wasnt just emotional. They could be complicated, and full of different types of information. Film has a matrix of ways of delivering information. They dont have to necessarily be in a linear or in three-act narrative-structure form.
          </p>
          <p>
           Once Id seen that, I started watching a lot of the Godard stuff, and Buuel and Kurosawa, and just really watching as much as possible. When I was 20, I met up with Rob Hill, who was in
           <em>
            Down Terrace
           </em>
           . I worked with him a lot over that period. We would just watch movies all day long. I had about a three- or four-year period of just watching films, from getting up in the morning to going to bed at night. Just one after the other. Drinking lots of beer, smoking lots of dope, watching lots of movies, and talking about film and making films. That was the beginning, for me, of full-on being obsessed with cinema. Before that, I didnt really know what it was. There was no film school you could go to particularly if you were young, and there was no information about how to make movies. No one in my family had ever done anything like that.
          </p>
          <p>
           I only recently have ever met a film director. The last three or four years. So the idea of how to make a film then was incredibly abstract. When I was a teenager, it was very difficult to work out what you even did. I didnt even know that films were edited. I was very nave about it. It seems ridiculous now to think I could be so innocent about it, but I just didnt know. I never went to film school, or anything like that. It took me a long time to work out what was inside the movies technically, and how you make one yourself. I guess thats still going on now. Im still on a journey of just trying to work out how things fit together in terms of emotions, and what different types of shots mean, and what sequences mean.

           I should mention Kubrick.
           <i>
            A Clockwork Orange
           </i>
           is a big one. I remember going to see that in Paris. You couldnt see it in England, because it was banned for a long time, so I went specifically to this one cinema that used to play it every day in Paris for fans who couldnt get to see it in their own countries. That opened up all those other movies, like
           <em>
            2001
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            Strangelove
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            Barry Lyndon
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            The Shining
           </em>
           . Those movies, I still watch a lot.
          </p>
          <p>
           At that point, though, I was working as a runner. Id been at college, had a fine-art degree, had made short films and stuff, so at that point, I was just basically trying to get many jobs in the industry, so I could learn. I was working as an edit assistant, and then I was a storyboard artist. So the most influential film of that period would be
           <em>
            Project: Assassin,
           </em>
           a film that Rob Hill made with his friends Andy Hurst and Mike Hurst. Its a film that no one really knows about, shot on news cameras, on Beta SP. It was a sci-fi movie. What it showed me was that you could, if you had enough balls and energy, make your own film.
          </p>
          <p>
           Basically, the three of them got together, and over a period of four years, they made this movie, and they took it to Cannes and sold it. And then they went off Hollywood to work on different projects. That was, for me, the blueprint for what I did later on, with
           <em>
            Down Terrace
           </em>
           and making my own short films. You dont need anyones permission. You dont need to talk to people, or show people your work and ask them if its all right, or ask them for money to make stuff. You can just make it yourself. Thats exactly what they did. And I think thats a very strong message, though it took me a long time to really understand it. Lots of people dont understand that now. Theyre trapped in a circle of thinking that they need to be told that theyre allowed to make films, and its nonsense. You just have to make your own stuff and find out if its good or not.
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont think its even available now, that film. You might be able to get a German copy of it. It got sold to Roland Emmerichs distribution company at the time, and then got dubbed into German. [Laughs.] Maybe you could see it on German television.

           By that point, I was probably just seething about the fact that I wasnt making any films. The kind of stuff I liked wouldve been Michel Gondrys pop promos. I remember watching those and being really amazed by them. Most things, I could look at and understand and digest and work out how to do them myself, and could understand what the thought process behind them wouldve been. But the Gondry stuff, I couldnt understand it. It was so alien to me, and so brilliant and visual. His stuff is just so original.
          </p>
          <p>
           The other thing I really liked then was
           <em>
            Tetsuo II: Body Hammer
           </em>
           . Id been watching stuff like that, and some Von Trier stuff as well, like
           <em>
            The Idiots
           </em>
           and the Dogme stuff. I really liked all that. I remember going to Cannes to see
           <em>

           as well, [Thomas] Vinterbergs thing. It really made me think about the image itself onscreen. As a short-film makeras an up-and-coming filmmakeryou kind of kid yourself that you cant make movies unless theyre in 35mm, because you have these ideas of professionalism, which are just basically constructs that you hold to, to stop yourself from making stuff. When you see something like
           <em>
            Festen
           </em>
           , which is shot on a camcorder that you can buy in the shop for 700 bucksthats it. Thats all you need. That and some brilliant actors, and youre away.

           I was doing a lot of TV, so I guess the most influential thing I probably watched in that period was a DVD set called
           <em>
            Hollywood Blocking
           </em>
           , which was a how-to video on how to move people around the screen. [Laughs.] I watched that quite a lot while I was shooting the TV series
           <em>
            Ideal
           </em>
           . I would watch
           <em>
            Hollywood Blocking
           </em>
           every night, and then come in the next day and experiment.
           <em>
            Ideal
           </em>
           itself ended up as my film school. I did two series of it: one six episodes, six half-hours, and one was eight half-hours. It was a quite visual show, and they let you get on with it. You could change scripts, and you could kind of do what you liked, so there was a lot of experimentation for me that went into that. TVs so fast that you cant really make any mistakes. The decisions are on the spot, and you can pre-plan, but you never know whats going to happen each day, so youre always in a state of chaos. And if you cant pull it out of the hat quickly, then you can panic.
          </p>
          <p>
           I guess also around this time,
           <em>
            The Sopranos
           </em>
           was pretty influential, which you can see in
           <em>
            Down Terrace
           </em>
           . I used to watch
           <em>
            Sopranos
           </em>
           with the sound off, just to look at how they did it.
           <em>
            The Sopranos
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            Hollywood Blocking
           </em>
            those things helped me a lot.

           My main years of ingesting movies were from my teenage years to my mid-20s, and after that, I kind of stopped. Id watch bits and bobs, but it didnt imprint on me as much after that period. Once I started making stuff, I watched a lot less, and I wasnt as interested in other peoples work. Making movies spoils cinema for you. Most of cinema, anyway. Because you know how its done, and you see behind it. Unless its really brilliant, it just becomes a series of technical things, especially if youve done screenwriting as well. You just kind of go, Oh, I know why theyve done this, theyre awful. [Laughs.] It just kind of destroys it. Which is a shame, because its one of those things where youve got to be careful what you wish for. I went into making films because I loved them, and then all of a sudden I cant watch them anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
           But then when you see something thats brilliant, its just a relief. Recently, I saw
           <a href="http://thedissolve.com/reviews/447-the-wolf-of-wall-street/">
            <em>
             Wolf Of Wall Street
            </em>
           </a>
           , and that was a fantastic experience, just going, God, this is a proper film. I mean, I still watch a lot of commercial movies, and I just cant bear it. I dont know why its done this way, but I feel like my ship has sailed. The demographic of the 40-year-old manwere not really catered to that often in cinema. Im not an audience that spends enough money on cinema, so I dont really get movies made for me anymore.
          </p>

           <em>
            Wolf
           </em>
           was the most recent film I saw that I really enjoyed, thats for sure, but in terms of a film thats influenced me lately, I dont know. I watch so many older films now. Ive been watching lots of Tony Richardson movies; I dont know how I managed not to see them the first time around. Ive been watching
           <em>
            Charge Of The Light Brigade
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            Tom Jones
           </em>
           and all that stuff. Lately, Id say
           <em>
            Come And See
           </em>
           influenced me heavily. The Elem Klimov film, about the Russians fighting the Nazis in Belarus. I had that on my shelf and Id heard it was really good, and Id kind of been afraid of watching it. I think I had it for about five years before one night I popped it open and watched it, and it blew my mind. And it kind of made me think you could make a film thats incredibly creative and arty, but also feel absolutely real at the same time, even though its really abstract and has lots of directorial flourishes. It felt like it was truthful, in a way that showed maybe you dont need realism to make things feel real.
