        "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWilliam Gibson lives in an overwhelmingly green suburb with old-money roots south of Vancouver\u0027s downtown, and it is in this suburb that I am currently wandering, looking for William Gibson. Yesterday, over lunch, he\u0027d given me an address that seems not to actually exist, and just a minute ago, over the phone, he gave me a real address that wasn\u0027t his. I know this because I\u0027m standing in front of a massive gated house, the kind of house in which a reclusive beverage magnate might live, marveling at the elaborate hedges, when Gibson appears behind me. He\u0027s laughing.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m not that rich,\u0022 he says, apologizing for the confusion. He\u0027s wearing wire-framed glasses and has a kind of severe oracular thinness that complements his severe six-foot-four-inch height. At 66 he is permanently bent over, breaking-wave-shaped, the result of a lifetime of leaning down to listen. He points across the street at a more modest but still quite stately home where he actually lives.\u000A\u000AInside it\u0027s Arts and Crafts-y, wood floored, quiet. We sit in the living room, and without ceremony he picks up where we left off the day before.\u000A\u000A\u0022I figured out the two things where I was most dumbstruck,\u0022 Gibson says. \u0022The two questions were: Was I thinking about retiring? Which I still haven\u0027t got my head around. But the other one, which I think is gonna be the big one when I tour with this book\u0022The Peripheral, his tenth and most recent novel\u0022is: Have I been too terribly bleak, or do I think the world is absolutely fucked?\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd do you?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t have an answer for that yet,\u0022 Gibson says, the light slanting through his windows. \u0022In retrospect, I think I wrote the book to try to find out.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe all should probably hope William Gibson doesn\u0027t think the world is fucked. In the thirty years since the publication of his first novel, Neuromancer, he\u0027s gotten plenty wrong about the future but also an unsettling amount of it right. We have Neuromancer to thank for making ubiquitous the word cyberspace, which Gibson described as \u0022a consensual hallucination\u0022still maybe the best description of whatever it is we now spend most of our days doing. Since then, in books like Virtual Light (1993) and Idoru (1996), he\u0027s imagined a pretty convincing facsimile of modern reality television, long before the advent of anything that actually resembled modern reality television; a cure for AIDS that increasingly seems like a way we will in fact finally cure AIDS (Virtual Light again); and a whole host of other now familiar ideas about nanotechnology and viral marketing and drones shaped like silvery penguins that swim through the air (2010\u0027s Zero History; yes, they do exist).\u000A\u000AHis hard-boiled bookscool but not cold, deceptively well writtengo by in tangles of sleek sentences. Uncannily prescient ones. \u0022I was never able to predict,\u0022 Gibson says. \u0022But I could sort of curate what had already happened.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Peripheral is an emphatic return to the science fiction he ceased to write after the turn of this century, set in not one but two futures. The first, not far off from our own present day, takes place in a Winter\u0027s Bone-ish world where the only industries still surviving are lightly evolved versions of Walmart and the meth trade. The second future is set further along in time, after a series of not-quite-cataclysmic events that have killed most of the world\u0027s population, leaving behind a monarchic class of gangsters, performance artists, and publicists in an otherwise deserted London. Like many Gibson books, The Peripheral is basically a noirish murder mystery wearing a cyberpunk leather jacket and, after an uncharacteristically dense first one hundred pages, a super enjoyable readthough perhaps less so when you consider just how accurate Gibson can be when he\u0027s thinking about what might come next.\u000A\u000ABecause according to The Peripheral, what is coming next is, to borrow Gibson\u0027s phrase again, wellfucked.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFor a while, characters in William Gibson novels tended to be orphans, or had mothers who left, or were otherwise bereft of family. And though not much in Gibson\u0027s books is directly autobiographical, it\u0027s impossible not to read this tendency against the story of Gibson\u0027s own life, which for a while was uncommonly, improbably sad.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, the whole thingit\u0027s a story of trauma,\u0022 Gibson begins, sitting on his couch. He is not a guy to self-dramatize. He\u0027s goofy, colloquial as a 22-year-old, a father of two. Smiles a ton. \u0022Like, major trauma.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe story starts in the American SouthTennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, states through which Gibson\u0027s family would follow his father\u0027s construction business, until his father died. He\u0027d been away on business and choked to death. This was before people knew to do the Heimlich maneuver, Gibson recalls neutrally. \u0022Just one of those things that could just take anybody out.\u0022\u000A\u000AGibson was 7 or 8, he doesn\u0027t remember exactly. He and his mother moved back to her childhood home of Wytheville, Virginia, a tiny town where the modern world scarcely existed. He read science fiction and fantasized about leaving; finally his mother sent him to boarding school in Arizona.\u000A\u000AThen she died, too.\u000A\u000AGibson had just turned 18. \u0022She collapsed on the street one day,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AIt was 1966, and Gibson basically lost his mind for a while. He remembers coming to, temporarily jolted out of whatever fog of grief he was in, while riding an overnight bus to Toronto. It was that moment when he first saw the future, the signature dystopian vision now familiar from his books, where the sky is always gray or the color of television tuned to a dead channel.\u000A\u000AIt looked like trash.\u000A\u000A\u0022In the morning, when the light was coming up, I saw green plastic garbage bags for the first time in my life,\u0022 Gibson remembers.\u000A\u000A\u0022Millions of them, because, as it happened, there was a municipal strike going. And I couldn\u0027t understand why there were so many of them, and I had to infer their purpose. Isn\u0027t that strange?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAn enormous orange cat joins the two of us in Gibson\u0027s living room, and in the momentary silence I remind Gibson that I never actually brought up retirementhe did.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 Gibson says after a long pause. \u0022That\u0027s right. But subsequently I think I sort of realized that I\u0027m just not there.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhich is a relief: Gibson\u0027s writing is so thoroughly part of the world now that it\u0027s hard to imagine a world without it. His work has permeated the culture to the point that even he can\u0027t tell what\u0027s his and what isn\u0027t. Even something as randomly familiar as a bar-code tattoo: That was Gibson\u0027s idea, something he imagined in an early screenplay draft for Alien 3, Gibson\u0027s firstthough not lastforay into screenwriting, and the only bit of his that made it into the finished film.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGibson\u0027s Hollywood years are lesser known than his books, probably for good reason. In the \u002790s, a bunch of producers somehow gave Gibson and the artist Robert Longo $26 million to make the film that would become Johnny Mnemonic, a movie that climas with Ice-T leading a crossbow battle against the yakuza while Keanu Reeves hacks his own brain with the aid of a heroin-addicted dolphin. Gibson remembers staying at the Chateau Marmont for monthsyearsas the film descended into development hell, batting away questions from the studio like: Can the dolphin perhaps not be addicted to heroin?\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s a thing that really happened,\u0022 Gibson says, laughing.\u000A\u000AJohnny Mnemonic was released in 1995, to deservedly disastrous reviews, and Gibson returned to his desk, where he filled his next two novels, Idoru and All Tomorrow\u0027s Parties, with acidly satirical meditations on fame and the entertainment industry. Four years later, a movie called The Matrixanother term Gibson popularized in Neuromancercame out, also starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who hacks his own brain, and grossed $463 million: a Hollywood message of some sort, though by then Gibson wasn\u0027t around to listen.\u000A\u000AFor nearly two decades, he\u0027d been writing science fiction set somewhere off in the future. But then, at the dawn of this century, the present started seeming weirder than anything he could imagine, so he began writing about that instead. The subsequent three books he publishedPattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), Zero History (2010)were thrillers in a different, more mature mold, DeLillo-esque but pop, too: about marketing consultants hunting shadowy filmmakers, or former indie-rock frontwomen investigating stolen shipments of cash. For the first time, Gibson found himself on the New York Times best-seller list.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022It was a very good feeling,\u0022 Gibson says today. \u0022I\u0027m kind of concerned now, a little bit, about where this book\u0022The Peripheral, which returns to the future\u0022goes with that.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Peripheral is indeed sci-fi, or at least it initially presents itself as such: It\u0027s oriented around something that comes to be called \u0022the jackpot,\u0022 a slow but disastrous cataclysm built out of not one cause but many. Droughts, failing antibiotics, disease, war\u000A\u000ABasically, exactly what\u0027s taking place during the week that Gibson and I spend together, which has a remarkably jackpot feel to itEbola in West Africa, something close to martial law in Ferguson, terrible violence in Iraq and Syria and Gaza, the whole world vibrating in a way that seems like it might come entirely apart. As if whatever disastrous near-future Gibson imagined in The Peripheral were already here, years ahead of schedule.\u000A\u000AI tell Gibson that I\u0027ve spent the week wondering whether this particular dire scenario of his has already arrived.\u000A\u000A\u0022Me, too, actually,\u0022 he admits. \u0022And that makes me very uncomfortable.\u0022\u000A\u000AGibson is in fact an optimist by nature; his books, dire as they get, tend to have happy endings. So I ask: Do you dare hope for a brighter future than the one you wrote in The Peripheral?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, I do,\u0022 Gibson says. \u0022I do indeed. But I haven\u0027t yet come up with one.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s video of Gibson in the years after his mother died that still survives, from a Canadian television documentarya tall, thin young man, making his way through Toronto amid the Summer of Love, sporting a cigarette and a loose corduroy shirt: \u0022This is Bill, a real hippie.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIn fact he was not, or not spiritually, anyway. Years later, when he\u0027d begun to write, his books would often feature some mysterious corporate agent scouring the marginsthe Internet, the fashion industryfor things to co-opt and monetize. While many other writers of Gibson\u0027s generationThomas Pynchon, sayregard the eventual betrayal of the \u002760s counterculture as the signal trauma of their lives, Gibson has always seemed curiously agnostic about the weird psychedelic years he lived through at the end of that decade. Over lunch one day, I ask him why that is.\u000A\u000AAnd this is how Gibson comes to tell me about the first big prediction he ever made. It\u0027s a story about how quickly \u0022reality\u0022 and fiction can change placesand have many times, as Gibson now knows.\u000A\u000AGibson doesn\u0027t talk about the experience much, but he went to Woodstock. Got stuck in traffic on the way there, along with everyone else. \u0022I sat on the rear deck of the car with some girl, smoked a joint, and fell asleep. When I woke up, there were a million other cars, but I never found the people I came with again.\u0022 For two days, he wandered alone, then left before it was over. \u0022And as I was coming out, I was looking around at all these mud-splattered pickups, going, \u0027Whew, this is going to be a fucking disaster. Wait till the newspapers find out how bad this thing sucked.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThis was the way William Gibson pronounced the most historically beloved music festival in human history a total failure before it had even ended.\u000A\u000AHe got home and fell asleep for five hours, and when he woke up, \u0022there was Woodstock Nation on the cover of, like, The Washington Post. The narrative changed that quickly.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd so began your long career of accurately predicting the future.\u000A\u000AGibson laughs.\u000A\u000A\u0022But what I always miss is that the future changes the next morning.\u0022\u000A\u000AZach Baron (@xzachbaronx)  is GQ\u0027s staff writer.",

          William Gibson lives in an overwhelmingly green suburb with old-money roots south of Vancouvers downtown, and it is in this suburb that I am currently wandering, looking for William Gibson. Yesterday, over lunch, hed given me an address that seems not to actually exist, and just a minute ago, over the phone, he gave me a real address that wasnt his. I know this because Im standing in front of a massive gated house, the kind of house in which a reclusive beverage magnate might live, marveling at the elaborate hedges, when Gibson appears behind me. Hes laughing.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.2">
          "Im not
          <em>
           that
          </em>
          rich," he says, apologizing for the confusion. Hes wearing wire-framed glasses and has a kind of severe oracular thinness that complements his severe six-foot-four-inch height. At 66 he is permanently bent over, breaking-wave-shaped, the result of a lifetime of leaning down to listen. He points across the street at a more modest but still quite stately home where he actually lives.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.3">
          Inside its Arts and Crafts-y, wood floored, quiet. We sit in the living room, and without ceremony he picks up where we left off the day before.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.5">
          "I figured out the two things where I was most dumbstruck," Gibson says. "The two questions were: Was I thinking about retiring? Which I still havent got my head around. But the other one, which I think is gonna be the big one when I tour with this book"
          <em>
           The Peripheral
          </em>
          , his tenth and most recent novel"is: Have I been too terribly bleak, or do I think the world is absolutely fucked?"

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.6">
          <em>
           And do you?

         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.7">
          "I dont have an answer for that yet," Gibson says, the light slanting through his windows. "In retrospect, I think I wrote the book to try to find out."
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.8">
          We all should probably hope William Gibson doesnt think the world is fucked. In the thirty years since the publication of his first novel,
          <em>
           Neuromancer,
          </em>
          hes gotten plenty wrong about the future but also an unsettling amount of it right. We have
          <em>
           Neuromancer
          </em>
          to thank for making ubiquitous the word
          <em>
           cyberspace,
          </em>
          which Gibson described as "a consensual hallucination"still maybe the best description of whatever it is we now spend most of our days doing. Since then, in books like
          <em>
           Virtual Light
          </em>
          (1993) and
          <em>
           Idoru
          </em>
          (1996), hes imagined a pretty convincing facsimile of modern reality television, long before the advent of anything that actually resembled modern reality television; a cure for AIDS that increasingly seems like a way we will in fact finally cure AIDS (
          <em>
           Virtual Light
          </em>
          again); and a whole host of other now familiar ideas about nanotechnology and viral marketing and drones shaped like silvery penguins that swim through the air (2010s
          <em>
           Zero History;
          </em>
          yes, they do exist).

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.9">
          His hard-boiled bookscool but not cold, deceptively well writtengo by in tangles of sleek sentences. Uncannily prescient ones. "I was never able to predict," Gibson says. "But I could sort of curate what had already happened."
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.a">
          <em>
           The Peripheral
          </em>
          is an emphatic return to the science fiction he ceased to write after the turn of this century, set in not one but two futures. The first, not far off from our own present day, takes place in a
          <em>
           Winters Bone
          </em>
          -ish world where the only industries still surviving are lightly evolved versions of Walmart and the meth trade. The second future is set further along in time, after a series of not-quite-cataclysmic events that have killed most of the worlds population, leaving behind a monarchic class of gangsters, performance artists, and publicists in an otherwise deserted London. Like many Gibson books,
          <em>
           The Peripheral
          </em>
          is basically a noirish murder mystery wearing a cyberpunk leather jacket and, after an uncharacteristically dense first one hundred pages, a super enjoyable readthough perhaps less so when you consider just how accurate Gibson can be when hes thinking about what might come next.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.b">
          Because according to
          <em>
           The Peripheral,
          </em>
          what is coming next is, to borrow Gibsons phrase again, wellfucked.

          For a while, characters in William Gibson novels tended to be orphans, or had mothers who left, or were otherwise bereft of family. And though not much in Gibsons books is directly autobiographical, its impossible not to read this tendency against the story of Gibsons own life, which for a while was uncommonly, improbably sad.

          "Well, the whole thingits a story of trauma," Gibson begins, sitting on his couch. He is not a guy to self-dramatize. Hes goofy, colloquial as a 22-year-old, a father of two. Smiles a ton. "Like, major trauma."

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.g">
          The story starts in the American SouthTennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, states through which Gibsons family would follow his fathers construction business, until his father died. Hed been away on business and choked to death. This was before people knew to do the Heimlich maneuver, Gibson recalls neutrally. "Just one of those things that could just take anybody out."
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.h">
          Gibson was 7 or 8, he doesnt remember exactly. He and his mother moved back to her childhood home of Wytheville, Virginia, a tiny town where the modern world scarcely existed. He read science fiction and fantasized about leaving; finally his mother sent him to boarding school in Arizona.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.i">
          Then she died, too.

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.j">
          Gibson had just turned 18. "She collapsed on the street one day," he says.

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.k">
          It was
          <em>
           1966,
          </em>
          and Gibson basically lost his mind for a while. He remembers coming to, temporarily jolted out of whatever fog of grief he was in, while riding an overnight bus to Toronto. It was that moment when he first saw the future, the signature dystopian vision now familiar from his books, where the sky is always gray or the color of television tuned to a dead channel.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.l">
          It looked like trash.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.m">
          "In the morning, when the light was coming up, I saw green plastic garbage bags for the first time in my life," Gibson remembers.

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.n">
          "Millions of them, because, as it happened, there was a municipal strike going. And I couldnt understand why there were so many of them, and I had to infer their purpose. Isnt that strange?"

          An enormous orange cat joins the two of us in Gibsons living room, and in the momentary silence I remind Gibson that I never actually brought up retirementhe did.

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.q">
          "Yeah," Gibson says after a long pause. "Thats right. But subsequently I think I sort of realized that Im just not there."
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.r">
          Which is a relief: Gibsons writing is so thoroughly part of the world now that its hard to imagine a world without it. His work has permeated the culture to the point that even he cant tell whats his and what isnt. Even something as randomly familiar as a bar-code tattoo: That was Gibsons idea, something he imagined in an early screenplay draft for
          <em>
           Alien 3,
          </em>
          Gibsons firstthough not lastforay into screenwriting, and the only bit of his that made it into the finished film.

          Gibsons Hollywood years are lesser known than his books, probably for good reason. In the 90s, a bunch of producers somehow gave Gibson and the artist Robert Longo $26 million to make the film that would become
          <em>
           Johnny Mnemonic,
          </em>
          a movie that climas with Ice-T leading a crossbow battle against the yakuza while Keanu Reeves hacks his own brain with the aid of a heroin-addicted dolphin. Gibson remembers staying at the Chateau Marmont for monthsyearsas the film descended into development hell, batting away questions from the studio like:
          <em>
           Can the dolphin perhaps
          </em>
          not
          <em>
           be addicted to heroin?
          </em>
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.u">
          "Thats a thing that really happened," Gibson says, laughing.
         </p>
         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.v">
          <em>
           Johnny Mnemonic
          </em>
          was released in 1995, to deservedly disastrous reviews, and Gibson returned to his desk, where he filled his next two novels,
          <em>
           Idoru
          </em>
          and
          <em>
           All Tomorrows Parties,
          </em>
          with acidly satirical meditations on fame and the entertainment industry. Four years later, a movie called
          <em>
           The Matrix
          </em>
          another term Gibson popularized in
          <em>
           Neuromancer
          </em>
          came out, also starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who hacks his own brain, and grossed $463 million: a Hollywood message of some sort, though by then Gibson wasnt around to listen.

          For nearly two decades, hed been writing science fiction set somewhere off in the future. But then, at the dawn of this century, the present started seeming weirder than anything he could imagine, so he began writing about that instead. The subsequent three books he published
          <em>
           Pattern Recognition
          </em>
          (2003),
          <em>

          (2007),
          <em>
           Zero History
          </em>
          (2010)were thrillers in a different, more mature mold, DeLillo-esque but pop, too: about marketing consultants hunting shadowy filmmakers, or former indie-rock frontwomen investigating stolen shipments of cash. For the first time, Gibson found himself on the
          <em>
           New York Times
          </em>
          best-seller list.

          "It was a very good feeling," Gibson says today. "Im kind of concerned now, a little bit, about where this book"
          <em>

          is indeed sci-fi, or at least it initially presents itself as such: Its oriented around something that comes to be called "the jackpot," a slow but disastrous cataclysm built out of not one cause but many. Droughts, failing antibiotics, disease, war

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.10">
          Basically, exactly whats taking place during the week that Gibson and I spend together, which has a remarkably jackpot feel to itEbola in West Africa, something close to martial law in Ferguson, terrible violence in Iraq and Syria and Gaza, the whole world vibrating in a way that seems like it might come entirely apart. As if whatever disastrous near-future Gibson imagined in
          <em>
           The Peripheral
          </em>
          were already here, years ahead of schedule.

         <p data-reactid=".hicur5getc.1.1.0.0.3.11">

          Gibson is in fact an optimist by nature; his books, dire as they get, tend to have happy endings. So I ask:

          In fact he was not, or not spiritually, anyway. Years later, when hed begun to write, his books would often feature some mysterious corporate agent scouring the marginsthe Internet, the fashion industryfor things to co-opt and monetize. While many other writers of Gibsons generationThomas Pynchon, sayregard the eventual betrayal of the 60s counterculture as the signal trauma of their lives, Gibson has always seemed curiously agnostic about the weird psychedelic years he lived through at the end of that decade. Over lunch one day, I ask him why that is.

          And this is how Gibson comes to tell me about the first big prediction he ever made. Its a story about how quickly "reality" and fiction can change placesand have many times, as Gibson now knows.

          Gibson doesnt talk about the experience much, but he went to Woodstock. Got stuck in traffic on the way there, along with everyone else. "I sat on the rear deck of the car with some girl, smoked a joint, and fell asleep. When I woke up, there were a million other cars, but I never found the people I came with again." For two days, he wandered alone, then left before it was over. "And as I was coming out, I was looking around at all these mud-splattered pickups, going, Whew, this is going to be a fucking disaster. Wait till the newspapers find out how bad this thing sucked. "

          This was the way William Gibson pronounced the most historically beloved music festival in human history a total failure before it had even ended.

          He got home and fell asleep for five hours, and when he woke up, "there was Woodstock Nation on the cover of, like,
          <em>
           The Washington Post.
          </em>
          The narrative changed that quickly."
