And both happened within the space of a single hour, in the same room, in front of a standing-room-only crowd at the Game Developers Conference.\r\n\r\nThese events occurred as part of the Game Design Challenge, run by designer &lt;a href=\"http://www.ericzimmerman.com/\"&gt;Eric Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt;, who also moderated the conference session at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. \"It's about challenging game designers to think about unusual game design problems,\" says Zimmerman. \"It's a glimpse into how they think... a glimpse into new kinds of games.\"\r\n\r\nAbout two months ago, Zimmerman gave three leading game designers a unique idea and asked them to build a game. They were required to design something that could be played with existing technology, but didn't have to produce a working product. And while they must describe their idea in a GDC session, they could choose to present the game in whatever manner they wished.\r\n\r\nThis year's challenge: Create a game that could be a religion. Not a game about a religion, but a game that &lt;em&gt;is a religion.&lt;/em&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain World&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"zemanta-img\"&gt;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"180\" caption=\"Jason Rohrer (Image via Wikipedia)\"]&lt;a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jason_Rohrer_-_gamma_256_%282007%29.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img title=\"Jason Rohrer at gamma 256 in Montreal\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidewalt/files/2011/03/300px-Jason_Rohrer_-_gamma_256_%282007%29.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Rohrer at gamma 256 in Montreal\" width=\"180\" height=\"270\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]\r\n\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\nThe first contestant, &lt;a href=\"http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/\"&gt;Jason Rohrer&lt;/a&gt;, is known for thoughtful, cutting edge games like &lt;a href=\"http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/\"&gt;Passage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://sleepisdeath.net/\"&gt;Sleep Is Death&lt;/a&gt;. His creation, Chain World, was inspired by the way his family relates to a deceased patriarch: They repeat his favorite sayings like proverbs, and make pilgrimages to see the house he grew up in.\r\n\r\nThis suggested to Rohrer that \"we become like gods to those who come after us.\" And so he designed a game where one person plays at a time, changes the game in the process, and then passes it along to subsquent generations.\r\n&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;\nThe actual game is a modified version of the cult sandbox game &lt;a href=\"http://www.minecraft.net/\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;, where players mine resources in a 3D world and use them to build various constructions.\r\n\r\nIn Chain World, as each player explores the game environment, they can see what was madeby those who came before them, but don't know why or how they were made. They're left to wonder how the world came to being,and to invent their own stories about how things came to be.\r\n\r\nIn a neat touch that increases the mythic impact of the games, players can only access Chain World through a single physical object --a USB memory stick. Rohrer built the application and stored the only copy on a flash memory drive, which he showed to the GDC crowd. \"This is like an ark,\" he said. \"A holy relic  that's passed from person to person.\"\r\n\r\nThe rules of the game (what Rohrer called \"canon law\") are simple: When you receive the USB stick, run the game, and play exactly once, until you die. Quit and save, and the world you've modified will copy back to the USB stick, and delete from your hard drive. Then pass the USB stick to someone else --and never discuss what you saw or did in Chain World, and never play again.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of his presentation, Rohrer gave the USB drive to a random person in the front row. And now it's out in the world, passing from hand to hand like secret occult teachings. Its mythology will grow, and change, and among gamers it will become a thing of legend.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;Propagation&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nReturning Game Design Challenge champion &lt;a href=\"http://www.jenovachen.com/\"&gt;Jenova Chen&lt;/a&gt; makes quiet, artistically-minded games like the award-winning &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_%28video_game%29\"&gt;Flower&lt;/a&gt;; his new game was characteristically thoughtful. In Propagation, Chen proposed to replace the religious habit of \"trying to lure people into happiness\" with a set of tools to help people connect and influence each other in positive ways, creating their own happiness.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism for this, Chen suggested --and the centerpiece of the game-- are the talks given at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\"&gt;TED conference&lt;/a&gt;.  The organization's motto is \"ideas worth spreading,\" Chen pointed out,  but they do a poor job spreading them; their website is hard to use, has no  feedback mechanism, no measures of influence, no way to turn good ideas into action.\r\n&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;\nSo Chen proposed turning TED's web site into a game, adding  metrics like the number of \"people inspired\" to individual talks, and  \"people influenced\" to speakers. The &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification\"&gt;gamification&lt;/a&gt; of TED's site would also include a feedback loop, so people who do do  better at spreading ideas would win badges or points, and thus be  encouraged to continue spreading the word.\r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;@Messiah6502&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nThe third competitor in the Game Challenge went in yet another direction. &lt;a href=\"http://planetromero.com/\"&gt;John Romero&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of iD Software, is one of the best-known developers in the business, the man behind blockbuster first-person shooter games like &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%28video_game%29\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; and Quake.\r\n\r\nRomero took a left turn from violent shoot-em-ups to design a social game --and he played it with the GDC crowd during his fifteen-minute presentation.\r\n\r\nThe game, called @MESSIAH6502, tackled religion through the medium of Twitter. \"In the beginning there was @god,\" Romero told the crowd. \"But then rose the one true god, &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/god6502\"&gt;@god6502&lt;/a&gt;... who had a son, &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/messiah6502\"&gt;@messiah6502&lt;/a&gt;.\"\r\n\r\nRomero then instructed the audience to get on their laptops and phones and follow @messiah6502 on Twitter. A moment later, he called the first twelve followers, his \"apostles,\" up to the stage. Each one of these twelve were given a pile of yellow post-it notes, and told to wander the audience in search of more followers; sticking a note to someone meant they'd been converted.\r\n\r\nRomero gave each apostle two minutes to run through the crowd, most of whom clamored for the post-it notes; meanwhile, he instructed, \"everyone else, check into 'Mecca GDC' on Foursquare, and meditate in silent prayer.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the apostles' time was up, Romero told everyone in the crowd who'd received a post-it note to check the back of the paper. \"If your marker has a star on it, then you've received a miracle,\" he told them. Audience members with miracles were called back to the front, and told them to give them to their apostle; the apostles, in turn, counted their miracles, to see who had the most.\r\n&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;\nThe disciple who had the most miracles, Romero announced, was &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/squirreltweets\"&gt;@squirreltweets&lt;/a&gt;, a Dallas-based programmer and designer. \"To win the game,\" Romero joked, \"You must kill me, John Romero \" --an allusion to the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero#Doom_II_and_Final_Doom\"&gt;final boss in Doom II&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session, the GDC crowd voted via applause for their favorite game; Jason Rohrer's Chain World took the day.\r\n&lt;div class=\"zemanta-pixie\"&gt;&lt;img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=67e67efa-aca8-4903-bfbf-10accc8ee650\" alt=\"\" /&gt;&lt;span class=\"zem-script pretty-attribution more-related\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;","text":null,"description":"How the man who created Doom started a religion, and the most exclusive video game of all time was released, all in the same room on the same day.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/thumbnails/blog_983/pt_983_1656_o.jpg?t=1299528159","imageCredit":null,"showName":null,"type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidewalt/2011/03/07/game-design-challenge-2011-bigger-than-jesus/","comments":[],"visible":true,"pinned":null,"expireDate":null,"highlighted":null,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_3","section":"section_79","title":"Game Design Challenge 2011: Bigger Than Jesus","description":"On March 4 2011, the man who created Doom started his own religion, and the most exclusive video game of all time was released.

And both happened within the space of a single hour, in the same room, in front of a standing-room-only crowd at the Game Developers Conference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These events occurred as part of the Game Design Challenge, run by designer &lt;a href=\"http://www.ericzimmerman.com/\"&gt;Eric Zimmerman&lt;/a&gt;, who also moderated the conference session at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Its about challenging game designers to think about unusual game design problems, says Zimmerman. Its a glimpse into how they think a glimpse into new kinds of games.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;About two months ago, Zimmerman gave three leading game designers a unique idea and asked them to build a game. They were required to design something that could be played with existing technology, but didnt have to produce a working product. And while they must describe their idea in a GDC session, they could choose to present the game in whatever manner they wished.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This years challenge: Create a game that could be a religion. Not a game about a religion, but a game that &lt;em&gt;is a religion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; \n  &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"zemanta-img\"&gt; \n &lt;div&gt; \n  &lt;img title=\"Jason Rohrer at gamma 256 in Montreal\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/davidewalt/files/2011/03/300px-Jason_Rohrer_-_gamma_256_%282007%29.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Rohrer at gamma 256 in Montreal\" width=\"180\" height=\"270\" /&gt; \n  &lt;p class=\"wp-caption-text\"&gt;Jason Rohrer (Image via Wikipedia)&lt;/p&gt; \n &lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first contestant, &lt;a href=\"http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/jason-rohrer/\"&gt;Jason Rohrer&lt;/a&gt;, is known for thoughtful, cutting edge games like &lt;a href=\"http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/\"&gt;Passage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://sleepisdeath.net/\"&gt;Sleep Is Death&lt;/a&gt;. His creation, Chain World, was inspired by the way his family relates to a deceased patriarch: They repeat his favorite sayings like proverbs, and make pilgrimages to see the house he grew up in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This suggested to Rohrer that we become like gods to those who come after us. And so he designed a game where one person plays at a time, changes the game in the process, and then passes it along to subsquent generations.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;The actual game is a modified version of the cult sandbox game &lt;a href=\"http://www.minecraft.net/\"&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt;, where players mine resources in a 3D world and use them to build various constructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Chain World, as each player explores the game environment, they can see what was made&nbsp;by those who came before them, but dont know why or how they were made. Theyre left to wonder how the world came to being,&nbsp;and to invent their own stories about how things came to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a neat touch that increases the mythic impact of the games, players can only access Chain World through a single physical object a USB memory stick. Rohrer built the application and stored the only copy on a flash memory drive, which he showed to the GDC crowd. This is like an ark, he said. A holy relic thats passed from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The rules of the game (what Rohrer called canon law) are simple: When you receive the USB stick, run the game, and play exactly once, until you die. Quit and save, and the world youve modified will copy back to the USB stick, and delete from your hard drive. Then pass the USB stick to someone else and never discuss what you saw or did in Chain World, and never play again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of his presentation, Rohrer gave the USB drive to a random person in the front row. And now its out in the world, passing from hand to hand like secret occult teachings. Its mythology will grow, and change, and among gamers it will become a thing of legend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Propagation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Returning Game Design Challenge champion &lt;a href=\"http://www.jenovachen.com/\"&gt;Jenova Chen&lt;/a&gt; makes quiet, artistically-minded games like the award-winning &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_%28video_game%29\"&gt;Flower&lt;/a&gt;; his new game was characteristically thoughtful. In Propagation, Chen proposed to replace the religious habit of trying to lure people into happiness with a set of tools to help people connect and influence each other in positive ways, creating their own happiness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The mechanism for this, Chen suggested and the centerpiece of the game are the talks given at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\"&gt;TED conference&lt;/a&gt;. The organizations motto is ideas worth spreading, Chen pointed out, but they do a poor job spreading them; their website is hard to use, has no feedback mechanism, no measures of influence, no way to turn good ideas into action.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;So Chen proposed turning TEDs web site into a game, adding metrics like the number of people inspired to individual talks, and people influenced to speakers. The &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification\"&gt;gamification&lt;/a&gt; of TEDs site would also include a feedback loop, so people who do do better at spreading ideas would win badges or points, and thus be encouraged to continue spreading the word.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@Messiah6502&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The third competitor in the Game Challenge went in yet another direction. &lt;a href=\"http://planetromero.com/\"&gt;John Romero&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of iD Software, is one of the best-known developers in the business, the man behind blockbuster first-person shooter games like &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%28video_game%29\"&gt;Doom&lt;/a&gt; and Quake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Romero took a left turn from violent shoot-em-ups to design a social game and he played it with the GDC crowd during his fifteen-minute presentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The game, called @MESSIAH6502, tackled religion through the medium of Twitter. In the beginning there was @god, Romero told the crowd. But then rose the one true god, &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/god6502\"&gt;@god6502&lt;/a&gt; who had a son, &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/messiah6502\"&gt;@messiah6502&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Romero then instructed the audience to get on their laptops and phones and follow @messiah6502 on Twitter. A moment later, he called the first twelve followers, his apostles, up to the stage. Each one of these twelve were given a pile of yellow post-it notes, and told to wander the audience in search of more followers; sticking a note to someone meant theyd been converted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"brandvoice_inline\" dynamic-ad-unit=\"ntv-article\" data-dynamic=\"true\" class=\"article-native-ad\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Romero gave each apostle two minutes to run through the crowd, most of whom clamored for the post-it notes; meanwhile, he instructed, everyone else, check into Mecca GDC on Foursquare, and meditate in silent prayer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the apostles time was up, Romero told everyone in the crowd whod received a post-it note to check the back of the paper. If your marker has a star on it, then youve received a miracle, he told them. Audience members with miracles were called back to the front, and told them to give them to their apostle; the apostles, in turn, counted their miracles, to see who had the most.&lt;/p&gt;","&lt;p&gt;The disciple who had the most miracles, Romero announced, was &lt;a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/squirreltweets\"&gt;@squirreltweets&lt;/a&gt;, a Dallas-based programmer and designer.
