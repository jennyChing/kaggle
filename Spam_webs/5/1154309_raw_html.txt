          While many people think that building a network is only for those currently seeking a job, it never hurts to work on having a strong network of professionals at your disposal. Even if you love your job, you never know when a good network will be beneficial. For instance, you can use your professional network to help find medical care for a family member in another state if the need ever arises, or help a friend who's looking for a new job. The following tips can help if you're trying to build your professional network specifically in the healthcare industry.

          Even if you're still in school, it's important to start building your network immediately. Obviously, professionals who are working will have an easier time meeting other workers in the healthcare industry. However, colleges will often have organizations that students can join to help grow their network before they begin working. These organizations typically offer websites, forums, directories, and alumni activities that help students create contacts for their future job search.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h2>
          Take Networking Online
         </h2>
         <p>
          Social network sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn offer plenty of networking opportunities with other professionals. Many times, Twitter has dedicated chats and conversations where current and prospective nurses and other healthcare professionals can learn more about the healthcare industry. Additionally, Facebook has groups for many different types of healthcare professionals, and those seeking to expand their network can join. Often, other users will post industry news and current job openings in these groups.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <p>
          Finally, LinkedIn offers groups and forums that healthcare professionals find very useful for networking. On LinkedIn, most of these groups are just for specific areas in the healthcare industry. Here, professionals can ask questions, offer support, and learn from others in their industry. There's also a search function based on zip codes so you can find professionals within a certain region to grow your network.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h2>
          Join Professional Groups
         </h2>
         <p>
          Just about every area in the healthcare industry has a professional group that people can join. There are many advantages to joining a professional group other than just having another opportunity to build your network with professionals in a similar field.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <p>
          For example, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) is a
          <a href="http://www.aanp.org/membership/professional-membership" target="_blank">
           network of 50,000
          </a>
          future, current, and retired nurses. This group is responsible for holding the AANP National Conference, which is the largest conference for nurse practitioners. They also release a daily newsletter with news and current events about the industry, and offer a free subscription to
          <em>
           The Journal for Nurse Practitioners
          </em>
          . Additionally, they offer over 100 education course activities to help with continuing education requirements. Finally, because this particular professional group is also open to nursing students, they offer educational grant and scholarship opportunities.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h2>
          Attend a Conference
         </h2>
         <p>
          While networking at large conferences or seminars may seem intimidating, they're an excellent way to gain contacts and expand your network in the medical industry. If you
          <a href="http://www.healthcareglobal.com/administration/networking-your-way-to-a-great-healthcare-career" target="_blank">
           attend a conference
          </a>
          , make sure you travel throughout the room instead of staying in one area or spend all your time only talking to a few people. Also, remember one of the keys to a good conversation is to listen more than you talk. Be sure you aren't dominating every conversation, and make sure you learn and listen from others at the event. Finally, keep in mind that these are professional events, and you should always dress appropriately. Even though scrubs are the uniform on the job, don't wear them to these events. Treat these events as a formal occasion where business attire is more suitable.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h2>
          Make a Business Card
         </h2>
         <p>
          When you attend your next conference or seminar, make sure you bring a stack of business cards with your information on it that you can use for networking opportunities. Even in this high-tech society, a simple business card is one of your best tools for networking. Your business card should include your name, contact information, link to an online resume, and any certifications you hold.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <p>
          You shouldn't have business cards only with you when you go to a conference though. Instead, you should always have them available since you never know when you might need to hand one out. If you really want your business card noticed, consider using a non-traditional format. Magnets are always used to hold important papers on a filing cabinet and having your business card information displayed on one means it's always visible.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h2>
          Keep Networks from Your Old Job
         </h2>
         <p>
          Even though the healthcare industry may seem impossibly large, nurses in NICU have found that many times there are just six degrees or less
          <a href="http://www.ensearch.com/2013/11/19/make-break-networking-tips-neonatal-nurses/" target="_blank">
           separating professionals
          </a>
          in their area. While it's very tempting to tell your old boss exactly how you feel about your job when you're leaving, it's always better to leave every job on good terms and with contacts you can still use. Imagine a scenario where you have an interview for a new job
          <strong>
           
          </strong>
          the interviewer recognizes a name on your rsum and calls this person for a recommendation. Ideally, you didn't burn any bridges from your last job and a quick conversation only helps to build your case for the job instead of putting it at risk.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h2>
          Think Outside Your Current Industry
         </h2>
         <p>
          Even if you're very happy in your current job, you never know if you may need a change in the future. Whether that change is simply switching locations or perhaps doing something completely new, a professional network that's already in place will make this transition much easier. For example,
          <a href="http://www.jobs.net/article/cb-203-talent-network-healthcare-what-doctors-can-do-if-theyre-sick-of-working-in-a-hospital/" target="_blank">
           doctors who are tired
          </a>
          of working in a hospital may decide they want to use their experience to pursue a career in teaching or medical writing. While this type of switch may seem like a stretch, those who have a network that expands beyond their own industry may find they have the necessary contacts to make a seamless move.
         </p>
         <br/>
         <p>
          Even if networking is a task that gives you anxiety, it's important to work on it at every stage of your career. If you start early and build a network across the country of professionals in multiple industries, you'll find that it helps open doors in your professional and personal life.
