         was a great success. The environment of the
         <a href="http://www.thehospitalclub.com/">
          Hospital Club
         </a>
         was a perfect place tounveilthe latest chapter in the journey of this ever evolving landmark show.
        </p>
        <p>
         From the moment the doors opened to the private view on the evening of Thursday 4th June it was clear this happening was going to be a memorable occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initiallythis event was to herald the release of the first UK version of the self-titled Return of the Rudeboy Book.
        </p>
        <p>
         (There will be a post tomorrow on the blog dedicated to the book and how you can order your copy)
        </p>
        <p>
         But the whole event once again became an inspirational moment
        </p>
        <p>
         On the evening of the 5th June there was a 'Conversation - Q&amp;A ' between
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Jay">
          Norman Jay MBE
         </a>
         and Stephanie from
         <a href="http://www.letsbebrief.co.uk/">
          LBB
         </a>

         The Young Souls project arose when Dean was invited to submit photographic essay and a short film to 125 Magazine, the publication always revolves around a word and in this instance it was theinterpretation of Religion. Deanexplains Immediately the phase Keep the faith came into my head, music never being far from my mind, I thought that this would be a great opportunity to explore and present a subject that is close to my heart. With the stills I didnt want to recreate the past, but I did aim to produce timeless works that illustrate the culture as never before."

         For those of you who know about the culture of Northern Soul you will not need any explaination however for those new to this fabulous scene you can start off by having a look at the wiki link

         . The group show entitled ' Heroes' celebrates the concept of the photographer photographing their
         <em>
          Hero.
         </em>
         This novel concept has brought together some of the most prolific photographers who often work within the realm of 'music'. The exhibition actually opens on the 3rd but as there is a Bank Holiday it is a perfect opportunity to make alaunchevent on the Saturday (4th) to enable those travelling to the coast to enjoy the moment..all are welcome. Following this launch event there will be a special club night "STUDIO 45 vs BLACK CAT' at the Westcoast in King Street where Dean will join Dean Thatcher Stephen Saunders and Neil Barker to play Northern Soul, Ska and other uptight Dance floor tunes. It will be in a way an aftershow party for the Gallery event as well as a Bank Holiday outing for Studio 45 vs Black Cat. See the facebook event

         Join us as musician and former vocalist of The Specials Neville Staple comes to visit the exhibition in its final week. Together with his wife Christine, Neville will be reading extracts from his autobiography, The Original Rude Boy. As witty, incisive and entertaining as the man himself the book encompasses early life in Coventry and his involvement in the Two Tone movement in the 70s and 80s. In between readings our guests will be reflecting upon the cultural, social and political landscape at the time. Neville will also be signing copies of The Original Rude Boy in the bookshop after the reading.

        </p>
        <p>
         There is however a slight inaccuracy, there is a misquote attributed to Dean, itsays, "with a style that goes back to the late Eighties/ early Nineties, when men wore their Nike Air Max sneakers with pin tuck trousers." Dean would like to make it known that he is fully aware that the Rudeboy first emerged in the late 1950's early 1960's and it was only in a much later incarnation that said clothing was involved. We hope that clears the matter up. Tajinder has written a good article so pleaseclick on the picture toread on.

         This summeris certainly going to be a lively time on the embankment, Dean has linked up withcreative director Harris Elliott to present"Return of the Rudeboy" at

         .

         This original exhibition will reflect asartorial subculture through a series of portraits, installations and set pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the last yearDean and Harris have been working on this great new project,shootingover 60 sharply dressed individuals from across the UK, all embody the essence of what it is to be a Rudeboy (or Rudie) in the 21st century. The curated collection of images show subjects presenting their pure and singular sartorial swagger in locations linked to the Rudeboy lifestyle, whether it be on the streets of Shoreditch or Savile Row.
        </p>
        <p>
         The exhibition will be an immersive experience of visuals and sounds, taking visitors into the worlds of todays Rudeboys. Each of the subjects featured in the portraits have provided their signature playlist, which will be amalgamated along with curators and collaborators choices into a soundtrack to capture the spirit and soul of the Rudeboy, acting as a sonic backdrop to the visual works. Since grooming is integral to the Rudeboy routine, the space will host a pop-up grooming station where visitors can book appointments to get their hair cut or beard trimmed by a top Rudeboy barber. Working with artisan box maker Kitty Farrow and luggage manufacturer Alstermo, bespoke brief cases, hat boxes and luggage sets will be made to show how this collective of individuals pays attention to detail in all aspects with their fashions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In true Rudeboy style, Chalkley and Elliott have collaborated closely with a variety of inspirational and influential creative minds to contribute exciting, engaging and enriching content to the exhibition. These include Rashad Smith, a British-born, New York-based producer who has worked with the likes of The Notorious B.I.G, Busta Rhymes and Nas; the Art Comes First creative collective founded by top travelling tailors Sam Lambert and Shaka Maidoh; and founding member of Big Audio Dynamite, Grammy award-winning filmmaker and international DJ Don Letts, a pillar of the punk and reggae scene who inspired a generation through his groundbreaking music, films and fashions.
        </p>
        <p>
         There will also be an exciting season of events in conjunction with the exhibition for visitors to exchange and enrich their knowledge and understanding of this important and culturally significant subculture, from film screenings to sartorial workshops. The events will pay respect to the heritage and importance of the past, but focus on the present and future Rudeboy.

          Grammy wins

         last night. The robotic masters bagged five awards on the night including the two biggest prizes 'Record' and 'Album' of the Year. Dean shot Daft Punk for NME during 2013, the images were released to coincide with the launch of the electronic duos amazing album 'Random Access Memories' you can get it

         Daft Punk are seldom (like virtually never) seen without their helmets, ...we bet you wish you could see the frame after the one below hey... But we wouldn't want to show you all the roboty insides that lay beneath their shiny exterior, so the mystique must remain... They are truly out of this world though aren't they?

         Steve McQueen was of course a massive film star, but he was a style Icon too. We thought it was only right to tell you about an exhibition that has been created in his honour "I live for myself and I answer to nobody" Comprises of photography from the legendary Barry Feinstein (you can see one through the cars window above), The Mustang car (above) from the film Bullet, Motor bikes clothing etc, also there is a section of items that have been influenced by Steve McQueen.

         It is all very good and free to enter.

         is a great interview from the Huffington Post, and for even more info on the show click

         ...One word of advice though, when visiting the exhibition take a big coat it is on the 3rd floor of Brewer Street Car Park and it is cold.

From 10:30am the first 10 people who come in the store for the gig will be given a free DB Cohen CD. After 11 am DB Cohen will Perform a number of Songs. This session will be filmed and photographed. After the Instore session the filming will continue in Swiss Cottage and in Camden Town. The music will travel....This will be a good bit of fun before Christmas, so come along and get in the picture or be on the film..

         This collection has heritage and lux Street styles combing the two sartorial approaches seamlessly. As the Adidas statement says there is an undercurrent of sub-culture in these styles they also have a great feeling of cosmopolitan flare.

         The shoot took place in Shoreditch Studios with sets that reflected the essence of the collections direction. Certainly inner-city life brought to life.

         'That's What Happens' is the new album by legends Chas &amp; Dave. Dean stepped out with the fellas to shoot the album cover and press images. The album has received critical acclaim and finds the chaps in top form this is what the Guardian say about the album:Chas Hodges and Dave Peacock's first studio album in 18 years will come as a surprise to those who remember their hit-making heyday. They've been working together for 50 years now and this collection of covers harks back to their skiffle and blues roots. There are echoes of Leadbelly and country harmonies on the likes of opener Railroad Billand Midnight Special, and Hodges's voice has a kind of grit to it that only age and experience can provide on numbers such as Right String Baby. The old joanna doesn't even show up till the swinging, full-band single When Two Worlds Collide, and the only "rockney" track proper is piano-and-bass workout Rocking Gloworm. New Orleans march All By Myself closes the album with solos by Jools Holland and Hugh Laurie, but it's the jazzy I Can't Give You Anything But Love and the penultimate track Glory of Love, both featuring Martin Taylor on guitar, that are the real gems...

         That's how the NME Young Britannia feature kicked off; these Singers, Songwriters, Producers and Bands have really got it going on. Holburn studios got nice and messy when Dean acted as ringmaster to this crazy 'ol shoot. Well to be part of this was a must if you were part of this elite crop of new exciting bands that are exploding on to the music scene.... It was a total GAS! Everyone came away with smiles on their faces and most with fire extinguisher foam in they hair...

         'The Arena' is Deans latest film: Screened at the V&amp;A Museum London on Friday 27th September 2013 as part of it's Friday Lates sessions. The film spins around the Crash Bang Wallop World of Banger Racing, a 12 minute long ode to the sport and various characters from the Spedeworth Racing Track in Aldershot.
        </p>
        <p>
         The New British Magazine was invited into the V&amp;A to curate a space and present works that reflected the theme of Destruction. Kez Glozier the Magazines editor brought together works for several different artists to present an emotional informative and at times hard hitting selection of moving image pieces that reflect the essence of The New British's reason for being.
        </p>
        <p>
         'The Arena' film is not the end of the project, like all the works they point to more facets that will be announced soon, so watch this space, the

        </p>
        <p>
         Taking budding photographers back in time to the days of old school processes and analogue cameras, the vast space just off Brick Lane, in the East of London will reveal all.
        </p>
        <p>
         Guests can rent a 35mm film camera, hit the streets of London with their analogue in tow and on return personally print their own favourite image in the Darkroom with experts on hand to help guide people through the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout the four days of the pop up there will be a line-up of dynamic experts hosting interactive workshops too, these include learning how to make your own retro-pinhole camera, taking a tour with street photography experts who will help you take the perfectpictureand then take you back to the Darkroom to develop your masterpiece. As well as a pop-up classic camera store from photography specialists Films Not Dead.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dean Chalkley will be exhibiting a sample of images from'The Executioners' (see image above), a new and previously unseen photographic essay that portrays members of an obscurerenegade British Car Club.Dean comented: If you are using film on a shoot there's always an element of surprise, anticipation and excitement. Nowadays so many images are viewed On-screen, which is all good, but the beauty and physicality of a real photographic print and conventional photographic process is still a very special thing  Id definitely encourage everyone to experience it.Im delighted to be displaying this series of images at the Darkroom. I had to think differently on this shoot, relinquish a bit of control, but this slightly different approach has reignited my appreciation of doing things this way. I hope it will produce similar feelings in those getting involved and taking part in the Darkroom.
        </p>
        <p>
         Photographer and award-winning fine art printer Debbie Sears will be running the Darkroom for more info on all of this check out

         Due for release shortly is Adidas' Originals Blue Collection FW13 with a campaign shot by Dean Chalkley.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Adidas Originals Blue collection is a premium apparel and footwear line intertwining adidass impeccable lifestyle heritage with a luxury street aesthetic. Mixing functional sport utilitarianism with street attitude, the FW13 collection perfectly combines the two sartorial disciplines by focusing on versatile trainers and clothes. A sub-cultural edge is thrown into the mix, giving adidas Originals Blue an attitude worthy of any street corner in London, Berlin, Paris, Tokyo or New York.

        </p>
        <p>
         Prints clash but the colours match; adidas Originals Blue fuse all-over graphics, rock iconology, hip-hop culture, subversive camouflage and patterns from the animal kingdom. Innovative details, such as taped seams and technical zips, and high-tech water-repellent materials keep you on track. Classic basketball uniforms share the court with running gear re-appropriated for inner-city life.

         Gizzi Erskine is The Sunday Times 'new cook'. Dean shot the colorful cover feature in East London's Street Studios. The Feature was released on the 14th July 2013 generating a great deal of interest and introduced Gizzi in a beautifully vivid way. The Cover feature highlights Gizzi's modern cooking style and heralds Gizzi as a very exciting new recruit to the Magazines features crew. Dean wanted the images to reflect the essence of the 1950's and 60's prevalent in miss Erskines style and look. Link into the Magazine

         Dean has shot Liam Gallagher many times now, In fact Deans first ever encounter with Liam, Noel and the rest of Oasis was at the
         <a href="http://chelmsfordrocks.com/armyandnavy.html">
          Army and Navy pub in Chelmsford
         </a>
         way back in the 1990's. Dean was in a very embryonic stage of his photography, always connected to the music scene and went to the 'Army and Navy' to check out this band that had a great buzz about them. The gig was by all accounts incredible, Dean positioned himself to the right of the small stage and awaited the band, when Liam walked onto the stage he spotted the Camera and thrust 2 fingers virtually into the lens...Whooohhh ...what an Attitude...Apparently the gigwas amazing and the crowd went crazy, people dancing on the pubs counter as theband thrilled the eager the very excitable hipsters squeezed into this small venue.. Oasis finished their set with a cover of the Beatles classic 'I Am The Walrus'.
        </p>
        <p>
         That was a long time ago though, and much has changed... Oasis went through several different line-ups and became massive of course. The legendary relationship between the Gallagher brothers has exploded across the media on more than one occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both Noel and Liam now have very successful solo careers,Liam's splinter outfit is called 'Beady Eye' and they have just released their 3rd album since splitting up Oasis. The new collection of tracks it called "BE' and can be heard on Spotify, check out Beady Eye's website

         Mod! is a book about the distinctively British youth cult and the artistic and social influence it has had. What became known as Mod was an amalgam of American and European music, fashion and design that has left its mark not only on a variety of subsequent youth cults but also on British culture as a whole. At its peak, in the mid-1960s, Mod became shorthand for what it meant to be a modern Briton; it helped to shape popular ideas about social relationships, taste, lifestyle and national identity at a time when the British Empire was being dismantled and American consumerism was changing British society. - Richard Weight.

         The star-studded private view event was a buzz with movers and shakers. Bowie has of course had a massive effect on the course of popular music for more than 4 decades his creativity and uncompromising approach has penetrated through into general culture. He is a living legend, icon and Transcendental in his appeal he's inspired countless people. This effect is also celebrated in the show, Dean's image of La Roux is included in the show, La Roux is one of the contemporary artists that are clearly highly affected by Bowie.

         Dean Shot the band just after the Christmas break in West London (coincidentally in the same studio that he shot Paul Weller Miles Kane Noel Gallagher and Tim Burgess last year) The chaps were on good form and embraced the opportunity to make some very interesting photographs with Dean.

         Here's a cool little thing that Shortlist wrote up on Sonny 'Scully' Evans. You'll of course know Scully as the main guy in
         <a href="http://www.deanchalkley.com/video/">
          Young Souls film
         </a>
         and he also featured in the photographic series of the same name. Here Scully gives a couple of hints on how to do a classic Northern Soul dance move , The Back Drop. Later this year our good friend Elaine Constantine will release her film Northern Soul - The Film we are very excited to see it and know that it will be a great piece of work.

         The two collections complimented each other beautifully, one presenting us with a variety of Deans choice images from the vast pool of his Music Portraits, archives, containing both established (some of which have played at the venue) and new talent alike. The other being an exploration of the culture of Northern Soul, a music scene phenomenon focusing on a current burgeoning generation of young people who have immersed themselves into the music and culture that Dean himself, has collected and enjoyed since boyhood.

         The interview with Tom Howard gives NMEs readers a behind-the-scenes look into the bands maddest tour ever, with in depth descriptions of the astonishly impressive set designed by Matt Bellamy himself.

         Law' was given a very credible 8/10 in NME and, as the band informed Dean on the day of the shoot, that the album artwork is an illustration of the human brains intricate circuitry system, where the connections of how we process information has been represented in a colour coded graphic...Which is pretty cool.

         Last Thursday night The New BritishMagazine got physical. People gathered at the launch party. Eagerly people looked at the sought after copy of the magazine that was present in the gallery. The Magazine is very rare some tried (and failed) to half inch the copy. Exposure gallery in Little Portland Street London was THE place to be that night. We salute Kez Glozier (the man behind the publication), it a great Magazine click

         Dean's 'Young Souls' and 'Look.Hear' exhibitions remain up in the Royal Albert Hall until the 26th October, but this Saturday (6th October) will be the final Public Open Day.
        </p>
        <p>
         In other words this will be the last time you can just roll into the Royal Albert Hall off the street unless you are going to see a performance or on a guided tour. So, if you can make it along between 10am -3pm on Saturday it is the ideal time to see the work. We have heard that people have just arrived at the venue outside of the Public Open Days and have still been allowed to view the exhibitions but entry cannot be guaranteed, it is at the managements discretion.

         THIS IS A BAND YOU WILL LOVE! ....Palma Violets shot at Studio 180 London
        </p>
        <p>
         This Weeks NME magazine is full of Palma Violets pictures well there are other stories but the Palma Violets have a substantial chunk of the Magazine. This band are exciting! Some people are calling them the 'best new band', maybe they are?... The feature that Dean shot certainly captures them bursting out of obscurity. It seems very likely that we will reflect on this feature as apivotal moment.

         Dean is exhibiting both LOOK.HEAR and YOUNG SOULS exhibitions at the iconic and legendary Royal Albert Hall.
        </p>
        <p>
         LOOK.HEAR is a collection of large fine art photographic prints depicting many of the heroes and heroines of the music scene. Dean has shot the likes of Florence (and the machine) Welch, Kasabian, The Kills, Paul Weller, Ian Brown, Noel and Liam Gallagher all these and many more appear in the LOOK.HEAR exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
         YOUNG SOULS is a contemporary study of kids that are into the Northern Soul scene; originally published in the uber stylish 125 Magazine, this collection of prints is a perfect accompaniment to LOOK.HEAR further reflecting Dean's interest in the transferenceof music into a culture.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Both Shows run side by side, so a substantial photographic show awaits you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Virtually every night audiences of 5000+ stream through the doors of the Royal Albert Hall so it's fair to say the exhibition will be viewed by a vast amount of people over it's run.

          Update
         </strong>
         : Well Young Souls didn't win sadly, but... the film was actually nominated for 2 awards. Firstly the 'Best Music Based Film' and the second nomination for 'Best Cinematography' so we were all extremely pleased (especially Benoit Soler our brilliant Cinematographer) that the film was shortlisted in both categories. So great news! The event was great and the Cannes in a Van crew made a great party and ceremony.

         In Spring 2012 Kieran established his 'The Chance To Fail Foundation' as a response to the London riots and the closure of community youth centres. The foundation for 12-16 year olds aims to teach the craft of songwriting and recording music as a constructive creative outlet, and a way of empowering disadvantaged young people in the capital.

         When Mariella Frostrup mentioned she was frightened of the dark in one of her agony aunt colomns, her comments really caught the public's attention. She had so many letters from people who shared this phobia she decided to look more deeply into her 'Night Terrors'.

        <p>
         In the past Dean has shot the band on several occasions throughout their career, one time in San Francisco with them hanging off a tram.The Band are Back with a great new album called 'Four', you guessed it, their fifth album...Not really it is their fourth album and will take up where they left off

         The NME is celebrating its 60th anniversary. There are a whole series offeatures emerging that highlight the importance of the magazine and it's enduring influence.
        </p>
        <p>
         BEHIND THE LINES is a series of rare interviews with the photographers who have created some of the most iconic photographs that have appeared in the magazine over the years. This week the magazine talks to Dean about his quite surreal shot of the White Stripes. 'Big Bang..' gives you a clue to one of the things discussed, you'll have to pop out and get the magazine to read all about it all though (or stand in the news agents and pretend you're going to buy one...).There's lots more in the Magazine beside this feature of course. It's a kind of Vaccines meets Reading/Leeds Festival special so tons ofnews aboutfreshup and coming music as well as what to expect this weekend at the festival. Go on! Rush out and scoop up a copy...You know you want to...

         This is the moment when Nataliemy trusty assistant left Chalkley Towers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Natalie has been here for 2 years, shewas always getting stuck in to the work and using her numerous skills to help things running smoothly. We have had some great fun and explored parts of the visual world I could never have predicted. In fact some of the work Natalie contributed to has not even been seen yet, so keep an eye out for'Shake this Mortal Coil' , a shoot with Kieran Leonard and another very interesting session with 'Tess' plus many more exciting things that are waiting for release. Natalie will reconnect with her own work more deeply following the path she set out on whilst studying her degree.
        </p>
        <p>
         So Natalie thank you for everything it has been my pleasure working with you.. Dean

         How amazing does this guy look?... This dapper gent was photographed in Kentish Town by Dean this week. Dean said 'I thought he looked so great and totally authentic. This chap was not into 'The Look'. He was The Look, The Look was his!! I approached this just over 5 foot fellow and asked him if I could take his picture. He seemed surprised that anyone would want to, but in a strong Italian accent agreed. He also explained that his Daughter was a Photographer, if you are out there let me know who you are and please compliment your father on his appearance... Anyway after a few moments he was gone, into the station and on his way... Maybe he was over in London for the Olympics ?... Maybe I'll never know'.

         The Olympics have well and truly arrived in London!! Everywhere you look theres evidence of this massive sporting occasion.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next few weeks will be fun in old London Town, even more people people hustling and bustling on the tubes, lots of people smiling and talking with passes round their necks excitedly dashing towards Stratford, etc etc.. Its a gigantic event and London seems to be ready!!.
        </p>
        <p>
         Shortlist Magazine asked Dean to do a session with Sir Paul McCartney for the cover of the Olympic Special... Dean jumped at offer.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Olympic Special Shortlist Feature includes the cover and 4 pages inside the Magazine. There are several photographs and the Q&amp;A asks Sir Paul a raft of questions both musical and sporting. 'Do you have any concept of your status and influence?..' and 'What's your sporting pedigree like?' are just two examples it's a good read. There is no doubt Sir Paul is still having a great time enjoying life and excited about stuff!!
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         Oh and one final thing he is a total Legend isn't he!..

         Here is a picture of Dean... It was taken in his living room. As you can see there are several record boxes and a white cat lamp. Dean wears a knitted vintage short sleeved top from Mendoza, New Hemingway for Hush Puppies boots and White trousers from H &amp; M... Oh and Black shocks from one of the high streets best shops for socks Uniqlo. The article touches on Deans passion for vintage inspired Clothing, Vinyl record collecting and his discovery of such things back in the 1980's.

          This image shows a prototype component of Deans installation known as the Soul-a-Trope. The Soul-a-Trope (???) I hear you say... Havent you heard about the Soul-a-Trope? Well in many ways it represents an extension of Dean's visual repertoire. It's not strictly photography or strictly film, it's an amalgamation of both but presented as a gallery piece. Only seen once so far in public. Viewers responses were great, some could not comprehend it or factum out exactly what they were looking at...but all liked it and found it stimulating and engaging.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The Installation will appear again soon so please watch this space.

         Friday 22nd June 2012 was the last day of Krissi Murison's Editorship at the NME. This is a picture from her leaving 'Do'. The magazine always make a spoof cover for leaving presents.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Krissi was appointed in 2009, she became the first female editor the NME. Previously Krissi had worked for the title as a journalist and then for a brief period taken a position at Nylon Magazine. Her passion knowledge and charisma all made her the ideal choice to become the New Editor when Conor McNicholas the former Editor left.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Whilst at the helm Krissi commissioned many inspirational features none more controversial than a
         <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2009/dec/15/simon-cowell-v-nme">
          Christmas Simon Cowell story
         </a>
         . This was a great subversive moment that devided opinion, created debate and generally stirred things up.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Dean Says "Krissi is first and foremost a lovely individual, a person who truly cares about music. She is not frightened stick her hand in the hornets nest if it means pulling out a good story. She kept the NME at the cutting edge of things as well as reflecting the heritage of the music world. So good luck Krissi in your next job it was an absolute pleasure working with you."
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Krissi will join The Sunday Times Magazine as Features Editor. The new Editor of the NME will be Mike Williams he has been Deputy Editor since July 2011 perfectly positioned to get stuck in and take the magazine into the future.

          The Harrods Fathers Day Memories Competition was announced through Twitter on Friday 15th June. People sent lots of great images from their childhood with their Dads. So many of the pictures showed great humour, fondness and the special bond that is between kids and their Fathers. But after a very enjoyable editing process Dean settled on one image as the winner..This is how the winning image was announced on twitter
          <br/>

          Dean said, "There were some great pictures sent through, some really funny ones, some odd ones and loads of cute ones too of course. It was a very close decision and difficult to judge one emotion against another but I think the winning image really shows a very protective love, so congratulations to the winner. Everybody who entered took time to send their great memories through, so thanks for the great response it looks like you all had brilliant childhood memories with your fathers and these photographs will always remind you of those great times..Thank you for sharing them with us."

          paid a visit to

           Brentwood Ursuline Convent High School for Girls
          </a>
          to give a talk to the year 12 and 13 Photography students.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The talk took place in the library. Dean showed the students a selection of photographs he had taken throughout his career, from early collage work to the present day. The talk was then followed by a Q &amp; A with lots of questions from the eager students and a short portfolio review, where the girls showed some very promising work.

           Almost Grown Cellar Cinema Club
          </a>
          <br/>
          Dean created this 'Happening' in the famous basement of The Royal Hotel in Southend-on-Sea Essex UK. The 'Cellar Cinema Club' was a great link up, an amalgamation of film and music on a weekend that brought thousands of Scooterists to the sunny Essex coastal town of Southend-on-Sea. 'Almost Grown' is one of Essex's foremost Mod and Soul clubs and they organized a whole 'Weekender' of club nights. Dean laced together the 'Cellar Cinema' daytime idea hooking up Almost Grown with the Southend Film Festival, securing a brilliant opportunity to screen Young Souls to Film lovers and lovers of Soul music too. It was the last event in the programme on the Southend Film Festival fringe schedule.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The happening was multi-faceted incorporating 6 exciting and different elements to stimulate all the senses The Almost Grown Cellar Cinema Club comprised of:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          1. Young Souls, screened on the hour every hour between 4pm to 8pm.
          <br/>
          2. 'In Orbit : Periphery of Young Souls', a brand new just under 3 minute film of unseen footage taken from the edge of the Young Souls main filming.
          <br/>
          3. 'Bodies Brut &amp; Talc' and Odor Installation
          <br/>
          4. '6 DJ's' playing music of the style and period.
          <br/>
          5. 'Scully's Car from the film Young Souls ' presented as a static display
          <br/>
          6. 'Soulatrope' this very special never seen before installation that brings together dancing, vinyl, atmosphere and aesthetic, in a surreal manner.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Between 3pm - 8pm on Saturday 12th May 2012
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The basement of the Royal Hotel became a very unique happening.

           "The Seattle International Film Festival is a BIG DEAL!!! How amazing that Young Souls has been selected. It means a hell of a lot to me. Young Souls is now getting out there, audiences are getting a kick out of it and being turned on whether they are knowing of the culture or not. The SIFF is a highly prestigious Film Festival and the largest in the USA, so the film will reach out in a physical way as never before. Young Souls is amongst incredible company just look at the festivals programme.. I can't wait for the audience to come through the door to settle down, for the lights to dim and then to start tapping their feet and watching the story of Young Souls unfold." - Dean Chalkley (2012)

           of a subculture. In the film we are privy to their refreshingly honest, personal and polarised views, rooted in the ideology of a Modernist culture. The film forms a hypnotic visual experience as well as being an incisive and engaging contemporary document. Its also a pin point in a perennial subculture that began in the 1960s and has evolved and lives on in this modern age. It was received last night with rapturous applause. It was a great night of people dancing and enjoying the passionately selected tunes by the film's subjects.

          Here is what the organisers had to say about the selections:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          "What sacrifices must one make?
          <br/>
          No matter how it's defined, most people enjoy successes, but what we rarely reflect upon are the losses we suffer. Give-and-Take highlights the good and the bad of our endeavors. This program questions how much effort we are willing to put fourth to achieve our desire and to what lengths we are willing to go. But ultimately, these creative and inspiring shorts help us identify what we really value as individuals and determine for which ambitions we are willing to fight."

          In their issue dated 05.11.2011 (which featured Deans cover shot of the Arctic Monkeys in Fort Lauderdale) NME said:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          From shooting Arctic Monkeys for our Radar section to capturing Pete Doherty being set on fire  and plenty more besides - Dean Chalkley has been responsible for some of the most iconic music photography for the past 10 years.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Further celebrating this in their 12.11.11 issue, NME published 4 posters in it's centre pages taken from the vast Chalkley back-catalogue of work with the NME. This included a picture of the late Amy Winehouse, Ian Brown, the formentioned Pete Doherty picture as well as the winner of The Picture Editor's Portrait of the year award, which features Noel Gallagher.

The usually sunny state of Florida was hit by unexpected thunderstorms high winds and torrential showers but this didn't deter your intrepid photographer and Journalist Dodging Hobo's, hanging out in trailer parks and going to an insane Mansion all night party.

          Original Blues Legend David "Honeyboy" Edwards sadly passed away on the 29th August 2011. The Mississippi born Bluesman was born in 1915 and carried on playing as many as 100 shows a year right up until 2008. Even once this intensive touring period was over he still undertook performances across the globe until July 2011 when declining health forced retirement from public performance.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          "Honeyboy" won 2 Grammy's one in 2008 for his album "Last of the Great Mississippi Delta Bluesmen : Live in Dallas" and a lifetime achievement award in 2010.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As the title of the album states he was one of the greats! Through his long career he played with all the Godfathers of the Blues scene including Robert Johnson, Charley Patton, Johnny Shines, Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Dean took this photograph whilst David "Honeyboy" Edwards at the The Luminaire, Kilburn, London on 25th September 2009. By all accounts it was a brilliant gig and the warm personality, charm and pure musical talent of the 'Man' enveloped the enthralled audience.

          Last night Dean unveiled his new Short Film
          <br/>

           YOUNG SOULS
          </a>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          There was an electric atmosphere in The Bethnal Green Working Men's Club last night as eminent Soul DJ's built up the excitement with their finely tuned record selections.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Then it was time!..
          <br/>
          <br/>
          YOUNG SOULS played at 9pm...
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As the film drew to a close the audiences cheers, whoops and applause confirmed that YOUNG SOULS is not only a beautifully engaging Art piece but an accessible thrilling and energizing expression made with integrity and passion.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In total the film ran three times through the evening, each time to packed audiences. Between the screenings the DJ's kept the dance floors pulsing.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          As day broke and the night at Bethnal Green drew to a close YOUNG SOULS became available to view online at
          <a href="http://www.125magazine.com/?p_id=300&amp;pg=488">

          </a>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Already the film has been viewed by an incredibly high number of viewers and amongst its plaudits..
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The Word Magazine Tweeted:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          "If you've ever totally lost yourself while dancing, this brilliant short film by @nitzerdc (dean chalkley) will bring it all back ..."

          It was with great sadness that I heard the news of Amy's death. She was a great talent and will be missed, not only for her music but also for her character. Thoughts go out to her family at this difficult time. R.I.P Amy.

          Dean Shot the Foo Fighters the day after he shot all of the winners at the 2011 NME Awards, where Dave Grohl won "Godlike Genius award". The photoshoot took place in and around The Vinyl Factory in London's Soho District. The Foos were in the UK to promote their new album

           Wasting Light
          </a>
          and a new feature length documentary "Back and Forth" directed by James Moll, which Dean had the pleasure of seeing two nights previous to the shoot. Dean also got to see the band play at the end of the week at Wembley Arena too. So all in all a fun packed Foo Fighting Fantasia.

          This week the NME have chosen to go with Dean's classic shot of The White Stripes from 2003 as their cover to announce the news the The White Stripes are now no more.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The issue is a special tribute; dedicating 7 double page spreads to the band who have been together for 14 years. Over this period Dean has shot the band many times, some of these pictures can be found inside the magazine as NME map the bands success and pay tribute to their legacy.

          The result will be a short film, not be a feature film and it doesnt set out to be the definitive story of Northern Soul youll be relieved to know, but it does aim to celebrate it.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Also I thought that it would be necessary to mention that this project has no outside funding, which means that Dean will be paying for the whole thing himself. Therefore what is being asked is for people to donate their time!

          Here's one of Deans Clmence Posy shots which was published in The Observer Magazine on 19/12/10 The picture accompanies an interview of the lovely Clmence by Elizabeth Day.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Clmence emanates a 'quentisentually Galic' beauty. Strong yet effortlessly sexual, which made her perfect for the role of Joan of Ark, one of her resent films.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Out Today is Clmence' latest film '127 Hours', directed by Danny Boyle. The trailer can be seen

          Tony Christie's new album is released today.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          'Now's the Time'; released on Acid Jazz Record label. All of the photos taken for the album where taken by Dean in various Soho haunts.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Tony has spent time rediscovering the soul side of his early career, and has encompassed this into the recording of an incredible album, which was produced by friend, fan and one time collaborator, Richard Barrett from The All Seeing Eye.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The album brings together the sound of Northern Soul, British Beat and filmic soundtracks. Tracks like Get Christie (a re-work of the iconic theme from Get Carter) features a collaboration with fellow Dee-Dar, Jarvis Cocker, other collaborations on the album come from Roisin Murphy amongst others.

          It's a great album! Don't take our word for it though... here's what The Guardian had to say about it:
          <br/>
          <br/>
          "Tony Christie considers this album to be "the real me"... ...Now's the Time! returns the 67-year-old crooner to his comfort zone of brassy lounge-pop and film soundtracks, and he sounds pleased to be there. And why not? His tenor, which forever hovers at the edge of quivering melodrama, was made for high-quality MOR like this. The best of a uniformly good bunch is 7 Hills, a deliciously sleazy country duet with Risn Murphy, but also worth hearing are the jazzy Too Much of the Sun, which casts him as an old rou melancholically looking back at his life, and Get Christie, a spoof of the Get Carter theme with lyrics by Jarvis Cocker ("If a job needs doing and needs doing right, who ya gonna trust? Get Christie!")."- Caroline Sullivan
          <br/>
          <br/>
          **** Tony Christie's 'Now's the Time' was given a 4/5 review ****

          This week one of Deans pictures of Slash was published in the Observer to accompany an article of quick fire statements about the Musicians life and Career, covering drug addiction, groupies, God and Axl Rose. Slash was very cool, professional and did not disappoint, dressed in his iconic trademark style.

           Luella Bartley has recently released a book titled Luellas Guide to English Style. Luella chose Deans picture of Dizzee Rascal to feature in the book.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           This charming book is a beautifully-bound, traditional, embossed hardback and is guide to the social style rituals of Britain.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The former journalists study is a social, anthropological one supported by photographs, illustrations and occasional diagrams (which appear as numbered plates).
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The seriousness of the books exterior, along with the traditional layout, present a light hearted and humorous content which explores contemporary themes through chapters covering Tradition English Garb, fashion values according to class and the different Tribes of Britannia.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Deans picture (plate No. 33) supports Luellas analysis of Grime where she credits Grime artists such as Dizzee for salvaging working-class style form the chav, by injecting back into it a bit of humor and satire. The picture was taken from the front cover of Dizzee Rascals debut album Boy in Da Corner, which was shot by Dean.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           In all the book looks beautiful and is both enlightening to the uninitiated and affirming to the familiar. A really nice read.

            British Fashion Designer Matthew Williamson is the subject of a new book by internationally renowned publishing house Rizzoli which was released on the 18th October 2010.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The book is a definitive volume, exploring Matthews life, work and achievements. It is a wholly absorbing experience of riotous colour.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Deans contribution to the book is a picture of Matthew in his home. Matthew sits amongst his interesting bright and colourful study, its clear to see all his influences, including the Indian inspired colour pallet that permeates into his work for the likes of Pucci and his own eponymous label.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Book comprises of numerous photographs by the worlds top fashion photographers. Images of shows, collections, and even personal snapshots and sketches by Matthew himself are contained within its pages. Colin McDowell; the author of the book, chronicles Matthews career, from his debut collection, Electric Angels to his 10-year anniversary show giving a unique insight into the life of one of Britains most celebrated designers.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Dean was kindly invited along to the books launch on Tuesday 12th October at Somerset house. A concurrent exhibition is being held there until January 2011, featuring images from the book. Heres what Matthew Williamson said about the night:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            "This book feels like a new chapter in my life, it was so personal to me. It is amazing to be here with all my close friends.

           The week following Deans trip to New York to shoot Kings of Leon for the NME, the Kings of Leon came to the UK. This time the session took place at the beautiful Connaught Hotel, for Uncut Magazine.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The Magazine has run a six double-page spread on the Kings, with an interview by Jaan Uhelszki in which the Kings talk about their early songwriting days, recalling stories of a prophetic preachers from back home, as well as artistic differences in the band and of course the obligatory family bust-ups.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The magazine, which came out this week, also features a review of the Kings of Leon album Come Around Sundown, which they have given 4/5 stars.

           Deans picture of Paul Weller was chosen to be on the front cover of the NME this week.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Inside, Paul shares his thoughts on his musical past, his triumphant 2010 and confirms he has no plans to quit touring and recording music any time soon.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           He tells the music weekly: "If I can still stand up, I will be (touring), definitely. I don't think there's any end to it, until I drop dead."

         Dean flew to New York to catch up with the Kings of Leon for the 21st August 2010 edition of the NME. The shoot took place at Milk Studios on Manhattan.
        </div>
        <p>
         The Kings were in fine spirits, it was the first shoot they had collectively done for a while
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The images accompanied an great interview by the journalist Barry Nicolson, in the wake of the incident (youll have to read more of the magazine to find out about that..). The article touches many issues that are close to the hearts of the band not least the subject of the bands reaction to being accused of selling out as well as offering a prelude to the bands eagerly anticipated 5th album Come Around Sundown.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The shoot has a warm feel to it, Dean wanted to reflect the Followills homely small town, southern roots that challenges the Stadium Rock label that they have been attributed since the release of Because of the Times.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         According to those lucky enough to have had a sneak preview of the bands new record, it is reported to be very much back to their old roots, which will delight old fans as well as show the new comers the journey they have come.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         For more from this session go to NME.com or pop along to the news stand and pick up a copy of the magazine.
