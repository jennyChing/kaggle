       <p>
        Fifteen years after we broke up, my ex-boyfriend published a book of poetry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I bought a copy, partly out of curiosity, partly out of loyalty to a fellow writer and former friend. I wondered not so much what had become of John (I had a vague idea about his family, his teaching job) but what had become of him as a poet. For months, the slim book sat on my shelf like an awkward houseguest. Then, one quiet night, something nudged me out of my inertia, or dread, and I settled into bed with his book.
       </p>
       <p>
        And there I was.

        I still remember the first time I saw him, in the middle of a path between McCosh and Murray-Dodge Halls at Princeton University. He had piercing blue eyes, black hair, and a genius for conversation. I was dating someone else, a philosopher who was friends with his philosopher friend, and our friends had stopped to talk. As the conversation dragged on (philosophy!), this new boy sank to the ground, lit a cigarette, and looked straight at me. We might as well talk, he said, and so began a conversation that lasted almost seven years.

        and I were young together, and writers. All of my young ambitions about art, love, career, even familyall of that was tied up first with him. When we met, and during the long course of our affair, we wrote fiction, but we loved all of the ways that words formed beautiful, important things that seemed to us true (we read a lot of

        </a>
        and
        <a href="/bio/william-butler-yeats">

        </a>
        , but also

        ). We were part of a rich undergraduate community, surrounded by exceptional mentors and peers of untested but very real talent. Much of our social life was (predictably) inspired by the Left Bank writers and artists, the Bloomsbury circle, who were our clichd objects of admiration. Like undergraduates everywhere, we exchanged drafts of work; visited each others studios; gifted stories, poems, and end-of-semester projects; wore too much black; organized readings; invited faculty to dinner; drank a lot of bad wine; stayed up all night debating aesthetics; and wrote semiautobiographical novels, Symbolist stories, and earnest poetry collections for our thesessome of them good enough to be published. So even though very many of our English major friends ended up on Wall Street, we could see a future as writers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our romantic relationship thrived through Johns thesis and graduation, then mine; through a protracted year in Europe, where I worked and wrote in London and Belfast while he taught and wrote in Amsterdam. We befriended new writers and artists, visited each other frequently, returned to New York, had a rocky year, broke up, got back together, and finally moved to Austin, Texas, so John could pursue his MA. A little over a year later, after I had started my own graduate program in California, we broke up for good. Right before it ended, our best friend confronted me: Youd better be sure about this, she said. You have a long history together. The fact was that I loved John. Everyone loved him. His infectious energy, his talent, his great generosity (in a burst of enthusiasm, he gave my beloved clothbound Collected Shakespeare to a student) had put him at the center of every group of friends we had ever known. I knew I would continue to love him for a long time. But we couldnt stay together.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a heartbreaking breakup, and final. After, there was nothing to say. We spoke a few times on the phone, but the great conversation was over. John enrolled in an MFA program at the University of Arkansas, married a fiction writer, and started his family. Somewhere along the way, he became a poet. I finished my own MA and then went on to receive my PhD. I married a visual artist, left academia, had my own family, and emerged on the other side a nonfiction writer. Over the years, I heard sporadic reports from mutual friends, but our relationship seemed of another life entirely.

        The woman in the poem, and then again, a page later, in another, that woman, she was me, too. In 
        <a href="/archive/poem.html?id=241216">
         Missing Carnival
        </a>
         and 
        <a href="/archive/poem.html?id=241218">
         Shaved Head
        </a>
         I saw myself as subject, object, muse, femme fatale. The poems were not flattering. Their subject was a flinty, bitchy, callous girl. She might be beautiful, but she was also mercurial, capricious, thoughtless, inauthentic, shallow, and downright cruel. Even the occasion for Missing Carnival left me feeling betrayed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As soon as I read the lines Soon shed take bus / and ferry from London to Belfast, but first / the fire in her bed-sit, I knew exactly the visit from which the poem had sprung, a deeply private, unexpected weekend, one that had been shadowed by terrible news, though not, exactly, the news in the poem. My memory was of a late winter weekend, just on the cusp of spring, with pale silver skies and a dampening chill that we warded off with layers of scarves. Morning blurred into afternoon under a pile of down comforters. John had dropped everything to take bus, then ferry, then bus to get from Amsterdam, where he lived in a cozy attic, to the northern London suburb where I had a light-filled bed-sit. It had been an intensely romantic, gratifying time, a union of bodies and souls, you might say, and I saw my nostalgia evoked in the poems almost Wordsworthian lines: This time / her body made him think of countryside, / some figure from his childhood, sun on scythe, / wind blowing shadows across the shining barley. This she (me?) is the rural life, sun-drenched fields, and dented milk pails, innocence, joy, and plenitude. This mood conjured exactly the weekend that I remembered, but it also felt like
        <em>
         my
        </em>
        memory. I didnt want it out in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The poems high romance is rapidly punctured: the woman is leaving, their union is full of small deceptions. The speaker has lied to her about the origin of his scars; she is some kind of well-intentioned colonial activist, smuggling / French social theory into Ulster. Both aspire to an idealism they dont possess, and they dont talk about the most important fact between them: the death of her ex-lover.
       </p>
       <p>
        Carnival (the Dutch equivalent of Mardi Gras) becomes the signifier for childhood, joy, plenitude. Missing it defines the central quality of both characters: there is something hollow about both of them. I had no idea what the poems Dutch refrain meant:
        <em>
         O Venlo, Venlo, stedje van pleseer
        </em>
        (I still dont), and in this way I am exactly like the woman in the poem. She listens, her back to him, as her lover sings to her in a language she didnt speak. Their intimacy is haunted by a fundamental (and final) failure of language: she cannot
        <em>
         will
        </em>
        <em>
         never
        </em>
        understand him. Nor, her posture suggests, is she willing to try. Missing Carnival is not a romantic poem about the fecundity of leaf-mulch / and leather in the tack roomits about the loss of all of that. The lovers meet not in a field of daffodils, but in Eliots hollow valley. Missing Carnival is a lament for lost worlds, for everything we fail at, even though its final image is an attempt to return to a heart-pounding, celebratory joy:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         He thought of himself as the sun, kissing
         <br/>
         her neck at the hairline, turning grey cobblestones
         <br/>
         of the town-square silver, marshaling parades.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        But, of course, turning cobblestones to silver is an impossible alchemy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Its a beautiful poem. The problem was that its profound loss was not part of the weekend I remembered. Was my memory really so wrong? Was I that shallow? Had we, like these lovers, never really spoken the same language?
       </p>
       <p>
        As I reckoned what was and was not true in the poem, I had to admit that, yes, there were many similarities between life and art. But there were significant differences, too: my ex-lover was not dead. It was an imaginative act by the poet that made him so. (Even if that act was wishful thinking.) Other crucial details were wrong, too: nationality, occupation, physical facts. My spinning mind slowed. The speaker was not exactly John. Perhaps I was not exactly that woman, and perhaps this poem not exactly our history. I began to see the poem for what it was: not just a transformation of fact but a transfiguration of reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understood, reluctantly, that the poem told the more interesting story. Missing Carnival is an anti-romantic lyric about loss. Why do we long for the (dead) lover/the rural childhood/sunshine/carnival? Missing Carnival answers: we want to move out of the Shadow into the sun. We want out of the twilight kingdom. If Johns poem made my memory meaner, he also made it mean something more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shaved Head is a tougher poem. Reading its compressed, aggressive, even militant opening lines, I knew I was in trouble: Forget contingencies of weather and wind, / my Helens head was shaved. This woman will be hated and blamed. I read, breathless, as she paraded in jet patent-leather trench and high-heeled boots; marched in callous if superhuman fashion right through human waste / and Bowery puddles, stretched her legs over the last / old-fashioned hobos. Shes desirable, all right, a femme fatale with darkened arching / black eye-brows, Betty-Blue mouth penciled red. (How I hated that image, with its art-house connotations of the insane, insatiable woman!) Even in his admiration, the speakers voice is brittle and clipped: Simply and grudgingly put, / her talk was action.
       </p>
       <p>
        The poem lurches after its subject as she bicycles through Manhattans downtown (Johns and my old stomping ground), marches in protests, counsels noncombatants, and defends conscientious objectors. In the poems opening stanzas, shes passionate, powerful, and a little bit scary. But as her extreme self-fashioning suggests, shes also unpredictable, dangerous, probably unstable. She makes no sense:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Her precedents
         <br/>
         I knew lurched out of focus: photos from France
         <br/>
         after the Vichy fell, Jeannes and Sylvianes
         <br/>
         whod made Nazi moll; those Belfast girls
        </p>
        <p>
         last ditched by soldier boys or peelers; two-
         <br/>
         toned Bergen-Belsen, bald sister to Fort Santiago.
         <br/>
         Then Squeaky Fromm, the other Manson moms,
         <br/>
         at Charlies trial. Extremes of Joan of Arc,
        </p>
        <p>
         Or even Buddhist nuns.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        The litany was tough to read. I didnt blame the speaker for clearing out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The facts: I had shaved my head, worked for the War Resisters League, and wore combat boots; one of my middle names is Helen. But certainly: Manson moms, Nazi molls, peelers girlsthese things had never occurred to me. I had never, even vicariously, associated myself with them, and even now I wanted no part of themnot even in a poem. Who in their right mind would want to be associatedin any contextwith genocide, murderers, and assassins? Reading this version of myself, I was humiliated. Shaved Head is a violent poem, and full of hate. This Helen is not H.D.s, is not even Maud Gonne. There is nothing redemptive or aspirational about her. Mostly, shes scary, and its impossible to ignore the speakers devastating final indictment: his Helen is a fraud.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Shaved head,
         <br/>
         her slender neck, dark shouldersthat was half
         <br/>
         or lessher most convincing argument.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        My first thought: Shaved Head was a revenge poem. It expressed exactly how John felt about me. It seemed to me cruel to use the facts of my life in service of . . . what, exactly? To create an image of a callous, confused, unpredictable woman who mocks an illusion of strength and beauty? Who drew promiscuously from historical and pop-cultural reference for her own self-aggrandizement? Who used and abused her lover? I didnt know.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then, after some timea day, a week?the disconnect between the poems opaque intentions and my own grew. A wedge slipped between Johns meaning and my feeling, loosening my knot of fear. If the Nazi moll, the Manson mom, was not me, who was she?
        <em>
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        The art of Shaved Head is deliberate. Like many of the poems in
        <em>
         Bridge and Tunnel
        </em>
        , it engages formal questions and poetic tradition. It puts pressure on language. The poems extreme compression, its violent juxtaposition of (violent) images, complicated the poems precedenta gesture that was for me a simple gesture of sartorial defiance. Clearly, this woman had her roots in me, but she had morphed, under the pressure of image, under the compression of language, across the controlled span of line, the form of the quatrain, even the interruptive power of the dash that made Johns lines hurtle toward meaning. Shaved Head was a linguistic construction as much as a narrative one, a poetic investigation as much as a personal confession. She was not a real person. She lived in the realm of myth, mysterious as
        <a href="/bio/william-shakespeare">
         Shakespeare
        </a>
        s Dark Lady or
        <a href="/bio/emily-dickinson">
         Emily Dickinson
        </a>
        s Master. She was so unfamiliar, in fact, that I realized she belonged not to my past, but to the poet and his imagination, and, by extension, to his readers. I read the poem again, schizophrenically, confronting myself, severed from myself. I understood the speakers victory: in the end, he kills the muse. This is a good thing, I think, in poetry, and probably (metaphorically, of course) in life. Certainly, it freed this speaker. Maybe it freed John. It definitely freed me to understand that this woman wasnt a real person. She was an image, something made (and made true) by the poem. Maybe John would still call Shaved Head a revenge poem . . . but I let it go. The poems could have their own life in the worldwith and without me. They had to. What was I going to docall him up and yell at him?
       </p>
       <p>
        I was left with the fact of the poems, the book, and a quiet, surprising happiness. Yes, he had used me to create a poembut it was a
        <em>
         poem.
        </em>
        Even if I hated the girl in the poems, I loved the poems themselves, their beautiful, hard-earned truths. We had found our way to writing lives, though not in the way we first imagined. We had been right about that most important thing, but the road had been harder, longer, and considerably less romantic than I, at least, had ever imagined. Clearly, our conversation hadnt really ended. It had gone onwith ourselves and with other peopleone conflicted, searching word at a time. Like us, it grew up.

        As someone who has had the experience  of becoming an writer's object of  vengeful meditation, and as a poet who  has stepped away from that kind of  creative act over the years, I'd like to  say, respectfully, that there is no  disentangling yourself by reference to  aesthetic distances.  You can talk of  Emily Dickinson's master letters, and  you can talk of Shakespeare's Dark  Lady.  However, you are the person in  question. The artwork is forever directly  linked to you.   Sometimes an insult directed your way  is so artful that you can appreciate the  art. However, you still must be brave  enough to contemplate the insult.  Was it  fair?  Was it the right choice? Is this the  best way to speak to an audience with  art and language? I wish you good luck  in your contemplations.

        my ex gf was an author, and since the breakup I've avoided reading anything she's published. I can't handle seeing myself portrayed through her rather twisted lens. Not for many years anyway. I feel for you.

        Excellent piece! Well-thought-out, well

        book of poems and found that to be

        disturbing. Strangely enough, the poet

        handed me the book and watched me as a

        read it. I stopped after a short while,
        <br/>
        returned the poems to him and scarcely
        <br/>
        saw him again after that. I was very

        young and felt violated in some way.

        As poets and writers we use our  experiences to portray our visions of  the world. We portray a version. In  Lisa's confessional essay, we hear the  voice of a woman who got her feelings  hurt because her ex-lovers poems  don't exactly match her memories, or  her ideas of herself, or how she'd like  people to see her. I wonder, are there  any two people sharing a single  moment, having the exact same  experience? No.   I offer an example: In the middle of a  2005 reading with Eileen Myles and  Brent Cunningham in San Francisco,  Brent stopped and asked the audience  to check under their seats for a little  tape recorder. Maybe ten lucky people  raised a hand and received a  mysterious cassette tape containing a  private confession. The rest of us  listened to his poems as planned. The  experiment was a hyperbolic illustration  of every reading, of every experience.  Each person in the audience has a  unique experience. In the car, on the  way home, perhaps you realize that  while you loved the reading, your lover  was distracted by the day's politics or  some such. Whose version of the  evening is truer? More fair?   We bring our entire histories to our  perception of a moment. A year or two  later, we have changed, and so has the  memory of the moment. It changes  again in the rendering, becomes its own  entity. So I agree: None of these poems  are about Lisa. All of them are about  John. About the way he sees the world,  or saw it in the act of creation way back  then. Part imagination, part emotional  truth. Isn't that the right, the obligation  of the poet? Without that freedom is  there any sense in writing?

        John Hennessey's poems are exquisite and surprising.  You are very lucky to live on in such works.    A great poet, now passed away, told me he'd been thinking of me when he wrote several poems, and I treasure them.  "Do what you will.  I must live forever." --Frank O'Hara  I liked what you wrote about the conversation between the two of you going on after you'd parted, and the poems manifesting that.  I haven't been able to find the full version of Shaved Head, but for what it's worth the woman you describe sounds a bit like Maud Gonne -- in hating her don't you think you're being a bit too hard on yourself and John?  It's my hope you wrote this piece to draw attention to John's poems, as well as your own work.  Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.  (Everything changes, nothing perishes - for those of you who don't feel like looking it up).  Re those of you above, who find it so upsetting to be the subject of literature:  obviously your lives have been .  Get over it.  It's always an honor.  Are we the muse, or does the muse assume us?

        Wouter: I would disagree slightly with the translation of the Dutch line above. It's more Oh Venlo Venlo little town of pleasures - implying something more suspect than 'pleasantries', though I haven't read the poem.

        Found this story on Huffington Post a bit ago and was enthralled. How epically beautiful and romantic. What a ride it must have been digging into your past through words written by your former lover. I'm sure it gave some insight that would have been nice to have at the time. I think we all secretly wish a former lover would write about us. Thank you for sharing your story.

        Venlo is a city in The Netherlands (look it up on the map). In cute, low key Dutch, he is calling a city of pleasure. But he's deliberately spelled plezier wrong.

        Thank  you for this piece.  It's a fascinating examination of an important subject. I'm especially interested in your thoughts about "the transfiguration of fact" as well as the "transfiguration of reality."  Of course we draw from our own lives when we write.  Many different versions come of this art and in the Making, we need to feel absolutely free to let the poem take over, let the truth remake itself or gain traction; be utterly faithful to our imagination if not to the historical record.  I think we all want the room to write in such a way--unfettered by "what really happened" and liberated from anxieties about who will read it and what the consequences of that "recognition" might be.  The poem is a made thing.

        What self-important, self-indulgent poems!  And I can't say I care for your attitude either.  I'm rubbed entirely the wrong way by this whole piece, I guess.  I'd think that someone with your life experience would see past the dross of living to something more meaningful.

        On the contrary, I don't see anything embarrassing about truths, small and large and not wholly understood.   The article resonates, and the author chronicles well her journey through involuntary emotional response and the choice of intellectual rigor and investigation.   I like the way she explains the alchemy of process, how truths become distorted and discovered as they are shoved into the girdle of art, or, alternatively, stretched out over a frame. I agree.   Which is why I have to offer, when sharing work with non-poet friends and family, that a confessional poem exists in a tone or tones, but a poet lives in many tones.   No apologies! Wonderful work, and still nice eyebrows.

        Fascinating, Lisa.  I have often thought about what you said about not understanding one another as being one of the ends of a relationship.  It's so clear in your interpretations over his words that there was a disconnect, but I love how there is hope in how your conversation lives on.  It's as if it were a part of everyone, and not just a microcosm of relationship.  I admire your courage.
