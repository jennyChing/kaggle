     <p>
      On a rare sunny day in Oxford, outside a delicatessen, I sat munching on peas and humous with a friend who was about to make an odd confession. I can feel others pain, she said, not metaphorically, but literally.
     </p>
     <p>
      On a dinner table, she elaborated, if a person opposite me has a stomach ache, even a mild one, I get a stomach ache too. I cant remember how many times Ive had to leave group events because of such pain.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of us feel others pain to a certain extent. We flinch when we watch someones fingers being broken, even if only in a movie. We empathise with the passing away of a friends loved one. And we sometimes shed a tear on hearing a strangers sad tale.
     </p>
     <p>
      But for my friend, whom Ill call Alice, experiencing others pain was a real, visceral experience. Turns out she is not alone. Alice has a rare neurological condition called mirror-touch synaesthesia, which was first reported in the scientific literature as recently as 2005 (Blakemore et al, 2005). But touch and pain are not the only sensations they can feel. Watching others being kissed by their loved ones, for instance, can produce the same intense, pleasurable sensations too.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a recent conference in London, Fiona Torrance, who has multiple synaesthesia including mirror-touch, said that one of her first experiences as a child was feeling the flight of a dragonfly. Even today, as an adult, the best form of relaxation for her is to lie down on the ground to watch, and feel, birds fly (Torrance, 2011). One of the upshots of the condition for Fiona is that she never feels bored. Although she cannot always choose who she empathises with, when she is able to, it can be liberating. It is one reason why she now works with kids with learning disabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such feelings of pleasure and pain, however, can go into overdrive in a crowd. Many mirror-touch synaesthetes describe being overwhelmed. While living in London, Torrance often felt battered at the end of the day. Even those with other forms of synaesthesia have to shape their lives so that they can balance the pleasures and the pains that come with enhanced sensory experiences.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Lost in the haze
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Synaesthesia is a condition where sensations, such as taste or sound, which are usually experienced separately, get blended together. One of the most common forms of synaesthesia is grapheme-colour, where individual letters or numbers appear to be coloured. James Wannerton, president of the UK Synaesthesia Association, experiences lexical-gustatory synaesthesia, which led him to create a taste map of Londons Tube stations (Riley-Smith, 2013).
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the first medical description of synaesthesia can be found in the work psychologists dating back to late 19th century, it wasnt until the 1980s that researchers started examining its connection with processes in the brain. A common hypothesis to explain synaesthetic experience is that there is a higher than usual cross-talk between regions of the brain that are dedicated to specialised sensory perceptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cross-talk is perhaps why synaesthetic experiences can be stimulated by drugs, brain damage, or even sensory deprivation. If hallucinogenic drugs can cause mixing of the senses, then perhaps each one of us has the ability but it is merely suppressed in normal conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most research has focused on inherited variants of synaesthesia. Nearly four in hundred people have the condition passed down to them by their parents. However, a child of synaesthetic parents may or may not have synaesthesia, and, if he or she does, then it need not be of the same variety as either of the parents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mirror-touch (synaesthesia)
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Mirror-touch synaesthesia is slightly different from other forms. In his presentation at the London conference, Michael Banissy, of Goldsmiths University of London, one of the worlds leading researchers on mirror-touch, put the word synaesthesia in parentheses. When asked to explain that choice, he told me, Not everyone agrees that mirror touch is a form of synaesthesia.
     </p>
     <p>
      If synaesthesias definition is to be strictly restricted to increased cross-talk between different brain regions, then mirror-touch will have to be excluded from the list. In mirror-touch, it is a special set of neurons in the brain that is activated higher than normal. And we can understand how by looking at the example of amputees who often experience mirror touch-like sensations after their amputations.
     </p>
     <p>
      On losing a limb, amputees often report feeling as if their missing limb, or phantom limb, is still attached to their body. It is one way the brain deals with a sudden loss of senses from a part of the body. Vilayanur Ramachandran, a world-leading neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, has helped develop treatments for patients with phantom limbs. In 2009, to better understand how mental processes affect these patients, he conducted a simple experiment. He asked four arm amputees who felt they possessed a phantom arm to watch as experimenters touched the intact hand of volunteers. What he found was that all the patients reported vivid, precisely localised sensations in their own phantom hands (Ramachandran et al, 2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      This mirror touch-like result can be explained, according to Ramachandran, by the discovery of a set of neurons called mirror neurons. Even in normal individuals, these neurons get activated when an animal performs an action or watches another animal perform that action. Researchers believe that mirror neurons help animals imitate each other that leads to development of key motor and language skills. But among amputees, Ramachandran believes that, the mirror neurons are unusually active.
     </p>
     <p>
      When they fire under normal conditions their activation levels would be low enough to not trigger a conscious experience in the observer. However, in amputees the sensory deprivation caused by the loss of the actual limb probably pushes mirror neurons to cross that activation threshold, leading to the touch sensation in the phantom limb.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Mirror on the wall
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In mirror-touch synaesthetes, the tactile sensation is also the result of hyperactive mirror neurons. However, unlike the amputees, mirror-touch synaesthetes are born with the condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to Banissy, roughly one in a hundred people experience this condition, and there are two types of mirror-touch synaesthetes. For those with the first type, if they observe a person being touched on their left cheek, they will feel the touch on the left cheek. Only 20% fall in the first type. The rest have a mirrored responsethat is, they feel the touch on the right cheek.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is also variation in the intensity of experience felt. For instance, in a 2011 study published in the journal Consciousness and Cognition, Banissy and his colleagues showed that if the touch is observed on a real person, the intensity of experience is higher compared to touch on dummy bodies, picture of bodies or disconnected dummy body parts. This probably shows that mirror-touch synaesthetes knowledge of the real touch modulates experience intensity. (Banissy et al, 2011)
     </p>
     <p>
      Banissy and his colleague have been able to study more than 30 individuals who possess the condition. With the help of functional brain imaging (fMRI), they have been able to spot the parts of the brain show increased activity in mirror-touch synaesthetes compared to a control group that dont experience a synaesthetic response.
     </p>
     <p>
      In another 2011 study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, Ward and Banissy were able to show that mirror-touch synaesthetes are better than a control group at recognising facial expressions. However, they perform no better than the control group at recognising facial identity. So they are able to sympathise even if they will forget their face later (Banissy et al, 2011).
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Art and empathy
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The literal mixing of senses is of much interest for artists, who attempt to convey meaning, emotions and sensory perception through paintings, music or films. That is why the London conference was organised at Tate Modern. By bringing scientists, artists and synaesthetes together, the idea was to discuss how synaesthesia can help both artists and scientists.
     </p>
     <p>
      In one of the first few talks, Ward said that, in his work with variety of synaesthetes, he found there to be a bias among those with the condition to choose creative arts as a profession. But does that also make them more creative? We dont know, said Ward. On standard tests, which ask questions such as name alternative uses for this newspaper, synaesthetes dont perform much better than normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the process of writing this article, I was left with no doubt that mirror-touch synaesthesia shows must be a richer way of experience the world. But I am not sure I would want that ability permanently.
