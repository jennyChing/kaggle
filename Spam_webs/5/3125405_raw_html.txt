       Wearable technology is heavily hyped as the "next big thing" by just about any breathless technology article you'd care to name. But are early adopters being stung by less-than-stellar products that'll leave the concept stillborn for a while yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wearable computing as an idea has all sorts of high-concept devices in the planning stages, but right now you can break down the devices actually available to consumers quite simply.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the low end of the scale, there's any number of fitness bands from manufacturers ranging from Jawbone to Fitbit to LG to Samsung to Huawei. Costing generally under $200, they're the entry-level to wearable technology and particularly popular amongst fitness enthusiasts for their ability to track motion - usually referred to as "steps," because somehow the amount of motion in your legs is the only indicator of fitness. I'm no gym junkie, but somehow I'm not sure that's entirely true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not that there can't be upsides with fitness wearables. Up until quite recently, I've had a Jawbone UP 24 strapped to my wrist every day. Not because I have visions of being the next 80s-era Schwarzenegger, although I'm rather quickly turning into his 2014 saggy equivalent. No, it's more because like just about everyone I know I could do with being a little more fit, and I'm enough of a numbers nerd to get into the data tracking side of things. I've only stopped recently because the phone I'm using on a daily basis doesn't support the Jawbone UP app, which highlights another issue with the technology. If the supplier stops supporting the associated apps, they're more-or-less just plastic jewellery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, any number of tests strongly suggest that despite all the manufacturer hype, they're all not perhaps as good at
       <a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/which-is-the-most-accurate-fitness-gadget-test-shows-discrepancies-between-different-fitness-gadgets-worn-on-one-hike/story-fnda1lbo-1226945805852">
        tracking our steps as they might claim
       </a>
       . That doesn't fuss me too much, because I'm not personally shooting for a specific distance per se. I'm more interested in challenging myself within the number range that a particular band can deliver because presumably its margin of error is fundamentally constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an associated security worry with fitness bands, however. Smart health devices using Bluetooth connections might be
       <a href="http://www.techly.com.au/2014/08/12/smart-health-wearables-leaving-customers-vulnerable-attack/">
        extremely vulnerable to being hacked
       </a>
       . That's probably not a concern if all your band did was track a number of steps per day you took, which is just a number, but when correlated against where you are, or if you're using the same password for your data as with other services, it's a much more serious concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mid-range of consumer wearables right now you can drop around $200-$300 on a smartwatch that'll hook into your smartphone and make it easier to check whatever notifications it's pushing out to you. Again, I'm guilty as charged when it comes to smartwatches, with a Pebble on my wrist right now and a couple of competing smart watches within easy reach, but that's primarily because
       <a href="http://www.fatducktech.com/opinion/metadata-mayhem-smartwatches-smart-vertical-hold-episode-16-2014/">
        I've been testing quite a few of them lately
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with smartwatches is that while they've been around for a while now, we're still muddling around in the early-adopter phase of the technology. My personal pick of the bunch remains the Pebble, or Pebble Steel if you want the fancy version, but that's largely because its use of a greyscale screen means that it lasts between charges for anywhere from three to seven days.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with the Pebble is that while its app ecosystem is reasonably advanced, it's also pushing against the limits of its established technology. There's only so much you can do with a colour-free screen, no input microphone and limited acceleration tracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       While they're not as advanced on the apps front, the competing, largely-Android colour screen smartwatches do offer more of a technological upside when it comes to features, with everything from voice commands to heart rate monitoring built in. Still, there's a large problem with everyone else's iteration of smartwatches right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every colour-screen smartwatch I've tested, from manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and Sony won't make it through two days before running out of charge. This means if you forget to put it on its charger overnight, you're going to be carrying around a chunk of glass and plastic on your wrist that helpfully buzzes as it goes flat before finally failing to even tell you the time. In the case of these digital wonders, they're broken clocks that can't even be right twice a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike your smartphone, you've got no chance of borrowing a friend or co-worker's charger during the day, because they all use their own little custom chargers to get power.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about higher-end wearables, such as Google's much-hyped Google Glass?
      </p>
      <p>
       Google has spent serious time in years past hyping up Glass, offering at first only to a selected group of "Glass Explorers" who paid a hefty US$1500 for the privilege of being the first adopters of Google's theoretically-revolutionary technology. That's not a bad or indeed even an unusual strategy. The normal way that technology cycles go is to charge the maximum to early adopters while the individual parts of a gadget are still expensive to make, and then drop the price over time as mass production, acceptance and the march of technology makes it easier and cheaper to produce.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not what Google did, however. Instead it has made Glass widely available in the US, still for $1500 for anyone willing to drop cash on a pair. The sale scheme has also expanded to the UK, where it costs one thousand pounds, meaning it's even more expensive to buy there. Wherever you buy a pair, you're also running the extreme risk of being dubbed a "Glasshole," which is the kind of marketing speak that I'm pretty certain Google wishes people wouldn't use around its prime, wearable product. Glass makes those around it quite nervous because those unfamiliar with the technology worry that they're being filmed, or that they're just outright

       Then again, there was one product at its Google I/O conference that Google very conspicuously avoided talking about, and that was Google Glass. For a product that was meant to be transformative, it's not exactly an encouraging sign when you're continuing to charge the same, large amount for it but can't even be bothered to hype it up.

       There are undoubtedly some massive upsides for wearable technology, with everything from monitoring

       What's seemingly needed, and not yet in evidence, is the kind of revolution that came about with the original iPhone. I'm not suggesting, before anyone leaps on me that Apple will come along with a perfect wearable. Indeed, I'm moderately certain that an iWatch or iBand, if it were to appear this year, will more than likely have the same flaws as its contemporaries.

      <p>
       No, what I'm getting at is the
       <em>
        idea
       </em>
       that the iPhone kickstarted. Pre-iPhone "smartphones" were clunky and annoying creatures, or relatively-dumb phones with limited feature sets. The simplification of an app strategy and an interface to suit, made the iPhone 3G a smash hit and a seamless window into the smartphone future. That's the design that every wearable manufacturer need to strive for, but right now we're all busy wading amongst the failures and wobbly prototypes.

         So, a smart watch goes flat in 2 days? (snigger)
         <br/>
         While reading the article I was thinking 'I hope the batteries are replaceable once they go flat' but no, it's worse than that. They go flat in 2 days! How is that smart? A dumb watch can last for many years on a set of batteries.

         Other than the much hyped Moto 360, there's nothing currently on the smart watch horizon to get excited about. Android Wear as an operating system has enormous potential. But until hardware partners can start producing sleek, understated devices that can last more than a handful of days on a single charge consumers would be wise to wait.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         What we need is Apple in the game - not so much because I think they'll build the best wearable device, but because Apple's competition brings out the best in Google and its partners (and vice versa).

         We are still very early in the lifecycle for wearables. Too many devices are single purpose or platform-limited.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         In time, I suspect many of us use some form of wearable tech - much like how most people use a smartphone. But I'm pretty sure it won't look anything like the devices that are around now.
