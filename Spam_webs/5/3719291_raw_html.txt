   Abstract
  </h3>
  <p>
   Greywater re-use for garden irrigation should be encouraged in urban
and rural households. It utilises a valuable on-site resource, conserves
precious drinking water and reduces the load on wastewater disposal systems
(both on-site and centralised). If applied appropriately to gardens, greywater
re-use presents minimal health and environmental pollution risks.
  </p>
  <p>
   The key to appropriate greywater re-use is user-awareness of the issues
surrounding greywater. This includes hardware, health, environmental and
legal aspects, which are summarised in this presentation. The presentation
covers simple and complex greywater re-use systems, health risks with re-use,
potential environmental degradation, minimisation of greywater pollutants
&amp; additives, and the changing attitude of water authorities in Australia
to greywater re-use. With increased greywater knowledge, permaculturists
can play an important role in promoting the sensible re-use of this household
'waste' water.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Introduction - What Is Greywater?
  </h3>
  <p>
   'Greywater' is the term given to all used water discharged from a house,
   <u>
    except
   </u>
   for toilet water. Greywater includes shower, bath, hand basin,
kitchen sink, dishwasher, washing machine and laundry tub water. This water
is called 'grey' water because it turns grey if stored for a while. It
also becomes quite smelly if stored for a day or so.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greywater is sometimes called 'sullage' in Australian literature. Toilet
water is generally called 'blackwater' or 'sewage'. In most literature,
both are lumped together as 'wastewater'. This convenient label is misleading
because greywater is very different from blackwater, and neither should
be wasted water. Both can be re-used for garden irrigation, but require
different methods and levels of handling because of their fundamental differences.
Greywater is far easier, safer and cheaper to re-use than blackwater, and
is the focus of this paper. Houses with composting toilets have no blackwater,
and should be encouraged.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Why Bother To Re-Use Greywater?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Greywater re-use for garden irrigation provides several beneficial results.
It utilises a valuable on-site resource which is otherwise wasted, it conserves
fresh water which can remain in natural ecosystems, and it reduces the
load on wastewater disposal systems (both on-site and centralised). This
last point is important as many on-site septic tank systems in Australia
are failing, resulting in effluent surfacing in the leach field area. This
presents a significant health and environmental pollution risk for occupants
and the local catchment. Direct greywater re-use for garden irrigation
diverts much of the low-pollutant water load from a septic tank system,
allowing the system to function under far less stress.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    How Much Greywater Do We Create Each Day?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   An average urban Australian house uses 820 litres of water per day for
indoor and outdoor use. This encompasses toilet (140 L), greywater (340
L) and outdoor (340 L) use. Toilet water use is reducing as dual flush
toilets become more widespread. Greywater is generated in the bathroom
(180 L), laundry (110 L) and kitchen (55 L). Each house varies from these
averages depending on appliances and habits, but the volumes indicate a
lot of greywater is generated that generally disappears down the plug-hole
never to be seen or re-used again.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Can We Create Less Greywater?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Yes, and it is a positive step. Creating less greywater means we use
less fresh water, which can therefore stay in rivers and lakes where it
is needed by natural ecosystems. We can create less greywater in two ways
- use water efficient appliances and practice a water conservation ethic.
The most effective water saving devices are flow restrictor discs inserted
in the shower rose, low flow shower heads, aerators on taps, low water-use
dishwashers and front loading washing machines. A water conservation ethic
is easily learnt - shorter showers, bath to relax, wash full loads, turn
off the tap when brushing teeth - all the things local water authorities
have been encouraging for years.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    So What Is In Greywater?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Greywater contains what is washed down the drain, and so varies from
house to house. For most houses it is soap, shampoo, toothpaste, shaving
cream, food scraps, cooking oils, dishwashing detergents, laundry detergents,
hair and lint. Normal use of these products appears to do no harm to garden
soils and plants if greywater is used for garden irrigation. The most significant
general pollutant of greywater is powdered laundry detergents. These are
often high in salts (check for ingredients with 'sodium'), many still contain
phosphorus (which is known to contribute to algal blooms in Australian
waterways), and are often very alkaline. Continual garden re-use of laundry
water containing high salt, phosphorus-containing detergents can lead to
salt accumulations in re-use areas, and stunting of native Australian plants
with low phosphorus tolerance. Regions with regular rainfall may not suffer
salt build-ups due to leaching of salts from soil after rain. There are
several alternatives to using powdered laundry detergents. These include
liquid detergents (which are generally much lower in salt content, eg.
Ark), pure soap flakes (eg. Lux soap flakes) or ceramic disks (eg. Tri-Clean
laundry disks). High strength cleaners should be avoided in the home, as
they are often toxic to both people and the environment. If caustic cleaners
are washed down the drain, they are likely to kill beneficial treatment
bacteria in septic tanks, sewage treatment plants or soils if greywater
is re-used for on-site garden irrigation. Many 'green cleaners' are effective
alternatives to high strength cleaners, and can be found in books such
as 'The Green Cleaner' by Barbara Lord (1989). An environmentally friendly
option to using bleach is to use hydrogen peroxide, which breaks down quickly
to hydrogen and water in the environment. Products containing boron should
be avoided as this is toxic to plants even in small amounts. Nutrient levels
in greywater are generally low (except where phosphorus-bearing laundry
detergents are used) and are easily utilised by vegetation in the garden.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Accessing Greywater
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Many slab-based houses have plumbing pipes entombed in the concrete
slab, making access to greywater for re-use very difficult. Often greywater
is mixed with blackwater by the time it exits the slab, making direct garden
re-use inadvisable for health and environmental reasons. Housing construction
regulations could be changed to make mandatory the separation of greywater
and blackwater plumbing inside floor slabs so that greywater can be accessed
for direct re-use if desired. Non-slab houses generally can be replumbed
fairly easily to allow greywater re-use in the garden.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Greywater Re-Use - Is It Legal Or Illegal?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Direct greywater re-use for garden irrigation is currently illegal in
all Australian states. Greywater which has passed through a secondary treatment
system (eg. reedbed or aerating package plant) may be re-used for irrigation
in certain states if disinfection is provided (eg. chlorine tablets, UV
or ozone). Regulations are set by conservative state health departments
whose main concern is the perceived public health risks associated with
greywater re-use. This fear seems to be unjustified based on greywater
health risk research in Australia and America. Regulators are also concerned
with high nutrient loads in greywater. Research in Australia and America
shows this to be unfounded in households which do not use phosphorus-containing
detergents. Local councils can choose to override state regulations, and
this has occurred in some unsewered areas of Australia. A notable victory
for permaculturists came with the successful struggle of Michael Wilson
and Fiona Buining to be granted approval for a composting toilet and greywater
reedbed system in a sewered area of Hepburn, Victoria in early 1996 (see
   <i>
    Permaculture International Journal
   </i>
   #58 and/or
   <i>
    Earth Garden
   </i>
   #95).
  </p>
  <p>
   Encouragingly, direct greywater re-use for garden irrigation is now
being examined by some Australian water authorities as an option for reducing
fresh water demands in rural and urban areas. In January 1996, the Queensland
Department of Primary Industries released a Policy Options Paper on the
Use of Greywater, which examines the potential for regulated re-use of
greywater in sewered and unsewered areas of Queensland. Regulators realise
significant direct greywater re-use already occurs in Australia, and are
working towards recommending specific re-use techniques that minimise health
and environmental pollution risks.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    How Unhealthy Is Greywater?
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Diseases are potentially present in used house water only where occupants
are ill. The majority of diseases in used house water derive from enteric
pathogens excreted from human intestines (eg. Giardia and Cryptosporidium).
Greywater contains no faeces (except where nappies are present) and any
urine from showers is generally sterile. An important study by the Los
Angeles Office of Water Reclamation in 1992 monitored eight greywater re-use
systems for a one year period in the City of Los Angeles. The study concluded
'
   <i>
    the use of gray water at the pilot project sites does not pose a significant
risk to the users or the community
   </i>
   '. The study found disease organisms
were not present in greywater-irrigated areas, nor in stored greywater
and stated '
   <i>
    this may indicate either an entirely healthy test population
(highly unlikely), or a mechanism for deactivation of pathogens
   </i>
   '. There
have been no recorded cases of people in Australia, America or Britain
ever getting sick from contact with greywater re-used in the garden.
  </p>
  <p>
   To spread disease, people must come into contact with the contaminated
water. With sensible greywater management, this should never happen because
greywater should only be applied beneath mulch or soil. Topsoil is alive
with micro- and macro-organisms, and disease organisms struggle to survive
in such a competitive environment. Households with kids in nappies can
use a three-way diverter (eg. Suldi valve) on the washing machine tub to
divert poo-ey water to the blackwater stream.
  </p>
  <h3>
   <b>
    Basic Recommendations When Re-Using Greywater
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Greywater re-use systems can vary in complexity from bucketing water
out to the garden through to automatic sand filter/pump/drip irrigation
systems. The choice of individual homeowners will depend upon lifestyle,
size of garden, site layout, climate, available finances and other factors.
Some basic parameters should be adhered to whatever system is used.
  </p>
  <p>
   Storage of greywater should be avoided where possible. Pathogen numbers
can increase rapidly in a favourable greywater environment, and stored
greywater will begin to smell strongly as it becomes anaerobic (within
a day or so).
  </p>
  <p>
   It is best to apply greywater beneath mulch or soil. This stops the
possibility of greywater pooling on the surface where children and pets
can play in it or mosquitoes can breed. Surface spraying of greywater is
not recommended, as the potential for people/greywater contact is significantly
increased. Direct contact is virtually the only way for people to get sick
from greywater re-use. Sub-soil or sub-mulch application of greywater also
reduces the chance of water flowing overland into neighbours' properties
or into gutters and waterways. The easiest way to apply greywater sub-mulch
is to position greywater outlet points in swales or mulch basins then cover
with mulch. Applying greywater beneath mulch means the greywater must soak
through topsoil where micro-organisms and roots are most active. This biologically
active soil facilitates destruction of any pathogens, breaks down organic
matter and utilises nutrients in greywater. Greywater applied too deep
in the soil (around six inches depending on the site) does not have contact
with this most active soil horizon and will not get the same efficiency
of treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   Both bathroom and laundry water are generally far less polluted than
kitchen water, and so are easier to re-use. Kitchen water can be re-used
through an independent system (eg. directed to one or two mulch basins
around trees near the kitchen), or can be directed to the blackwater management
system if the household greywater system cannot handle the high-pollutant
load. Remember that kitchen water pollutants are mostly compost, and if
applied directly to soil under mulch, should decompose quite rapidly.
  </p>
  <p>
   A three-way diverter valve (eg. Suldi valve) plumbed under the kitchen
sink and/or laundry tub allows specific greywater loads to be directed
away from the greywater re-use system. This may be useful when harsh chemicals
have been used (eg. bleach) or nappies are being washed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Re-using greywater on the vegetable garden is probably not a good idea
because of the (remote) possibility of transferring bacteria from greywater
to food. Many permaculture practitioners will re-use greywater on vegetable
gardens, and should ensure greywater is applied beneath mulch and that
root crops are not watered with greywater for at least one week before
harvest. Never drink greywater or re-use it for showers, washing clothes
and dishwashing. If water is that scarce, then invest in water saving appliances,
a water conservation ethic and a larger rainwater capture area. This will
be far cheaper and safer than treating greywater back to full contact standard.
An old wastewater saying holds true here - clear water is not always clean
water.

   <b>
    Types Of Greywater Re-Use Systems
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Detailed explanations of greywater re-use systems are not going to be
attempted here. For a comprehensive description of greywater re-use systems,
I recommend the booklet 'Create an Oasis with Greywater' by Art Ludwig.
This American booklet is applicable to Australian conditions, and is well
illustrated and explained. It is available through the
   <i>
    Permaculture
International Journal
   </i>
   mail order catalogue for A$14.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greywater re-use can be broadly classed in two categories - untreated
greywater re-use and treated greywater re-use. Untreated greywater goes
straight from the house to the garden, sometimes with temporary surge storage
(eg. plastic barrel) so that large flows from the bath or washing machine
do not back up into the house. Untreated greywater may pass through a filter
(eg. old pantyhose), but will still contain suspended particles and organic
matter which can clog a drip irrigation system. Untreated greywater is
therefore generally applied to the garden through larger diameter emitters
(pipes or hoses). Treated greywater has passed through a treatment system
(eg. reedbed, sand filter or soil filter) before application to the garden,
and has few suspended particles or dissolved organic matter remaining in
the water. Treated greywater is therefore appropriate for drip irrigation
re-use. The use of drip irrigation increases the potential for high-efficiency
greywater re-use because water can be applied in well-regulated and well-directed
doses to trees, gardens or lawns. The biggest drawback with drip irrigation
re-use is that water must be delivered under pressure for the drippers
to function as intended. This requires either a pump or good gravity fall.
Installation of a treatment system (and most likely a pump) means treated
greywater re-use is generally more expensive than untreated greywater re-use.
  </p>
  <p>
   Untreated greywater re-use systems include: bucketing water out to plants;
siphoning water out of the bath/shower with a hose and directing to plants
of choice; showering in the garden; connecting a (non-kinkable, large diameter)
hose to the washing machine and directing water to plants of choice; discharging
laundry/bathroom water to a surge barrel (with pantyhose filter) then gravity
feeding or pumping to plants of choice; directly discharging kitchen sink
water to a tree with mulch basin (a mulch basin is a depression dug around
a bush/tree/banana circle, and excavated soil is positioned to form a wall
around the basin. The basin is then backfilled with mulch. Greywater is
directed to the basin, cannot escape, and cannot surface above the mulch).
These systems are generally simple to install and maintain, are inexpensive,
and provide reasonably efficient re-use of greywater.
  </p>
  <p>
   Treated greywater re-use systems include: constructed wetlands (reedbeds),
intermittent sand filters, soil filters, greywater septic tanks and aerated
wastewater treatment systems (which use considerable quantities of electricity).
These require detailed installation and maintenance and are relatively
expensive, but provide a high quality treated water which can be used in
drip irrigation systems. Regulatory authorities are more inclined (at this
point in time) to approve a system like this rather than an untreated greywater
system. This will hopefully change as untreated greywater re-use systems
are installed and successfully trialed in different areas of Australia.
  </p>

    Conclusion
   </b>
  </h3>
  <p>
   This paper has been an introduction to greywater re-use. It has not
attempted to describe re-use systems in detail, nor present a literature
review of greywater research in Australia and overseas. The author intends
to compile a greywater booklet which covers these issues in greater detail,
and which describes greywater re-use systems suitable for Australian conditions.
It is hoped the booklet will be used by homeowners, and by local and state
regulators seeking more information on greywater and its potential for
direct garden re-use.
