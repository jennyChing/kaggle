      Below are methods commonly used to farm EC (Energy Credits).
     </p>
     <h3 id="wiki_foundry_missions">
      Foundry Missions
     </h3>
     <p>
      This is a guide to farming EC, originally written by RockyCoon. By playing a
      <a href="http://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry" rel="nofollow">
       Foundry mission
      </a>
      once every day, a player can amass a few hundred thousand EC in less than 20 minutes.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>
       <p>
        Get a Federation, or Klingon character to Level 50. I imagine you can do this earlier than 50, but being level 50 insures you get the highest mark of loot.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Get yourself an escort of some sort. (Advanced Mirror Escorts and Patrol Mirror Escorts are cheap on the Exchange, as well as the Mirror Qin for KDF.) Outfit it for DPS. Or really, just outfit a ship for DPS.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Go to Drozana Station (for all factions.)
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Open the Foundry. (Shortcut Key is 'J' and hitting the Foundry Tab at the top of the window.). Look for the Mission called 'One and Done' via the 'Browse All' Tab on the Sidebar, and pressing the downwards triangle at the top to open the search dialogue. it may have a 'Fed' or 'KDF" Suffix in it depending on what faction you are. Start it by clicking 'Hail' at the bottom right. The start point is a cup of bloodwine near the bar.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        This is an easy mission that also qualifies for basic foundry rewards (dilithum).
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Do the mission. An escort/DPS Ship makes it fly by quickly. Complete it to the end, completely. Pick up all the loot the ships drop. Both mission uses a nebula around a portal to make a bunch of battleships coming in one by one easier to kill by stripping their shields... be sure to stay outside the nebula area so you can keep yours!
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        You should now have a crapload of commons, uncommons, and rares of various flavors, if you got lucky. Increasing your difficulty to 'Elite' will increase your chances of blues and purples, and possibly higher mark gear.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        The Bartender on Drozana should give you 50% sell rate. Sell your junk there!
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        You should make anywhere between 300,000 to 500,000 EC, depending how lucky you were. Shields and deflector dishes are the ones worth the most selling this way. You may want to check the exchange to see if you can't get more.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        You can repeat this until you stop getting expertise for killing ships, which also makes loot stop dropping.... as
        <strong>
         there's a daily/20 hour cap on the amount of foundry loot/drops/expertise
        </strong>
        . This is a 'Per Toon'/'Per Character' limit, so if you have an alt, you can switch to it and continue to farm loot for EC.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        I add this to my dailies list when I do dailies. It's a good way to make a chunk of change fairly quickly and meet your daily cap in one run.
       </p>

      PVE/PVP Combat
     </h3>
     <p>
      Like foundry mission farming, PVE/PVP combat can be quite lucrative. Play fleet actions like
      <a href="http://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_Starbase_24" rel="nofollow">
       Starbase 24
      </a>
      and
      <a href="http://sto.gamepedia.com/Gorn_Minefield" rel="nofollow">
       Gorn Minefield
      </a>
      and you can amass good amounts of EC, Fleet marks, Dilithium, junk loot, and potentially valuable reward loot in the process. Starbase 24 and Gorn Minefield both have a good reward system: first place awards 2 purple mk xi items, second place awards 1 purple mk xi item, and 3rd place awards 1 blue mk xi item.
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="http://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_Crystalline_Catastrophe" rel="nofollow">
       Crystalline Catastrophe Elite
      </a>
      (CCE) is another mission that awards two purple MK XI items to first place winners. Players with support builds have found it relatively easy to take first place, as healing counts more than damage inflicted in this fleet action.

      .
     </p>
     <p>
      A NOTE ABOUT DOWNGRINDING DOFFS: since white duty officers sell quickly due to their demand and relatively low prices, some doffers choose to acquire as many high-level doffs as possible through duty officer missions (listed below), sell the expensive ones, downgrind the rest to lower quality doffs, and sell the resulting white ones. This method can be very profitable, especially when fleets run projects that require a lot of common duty officers. To downgrind doffs, see the
      <a href="http://sto.gamepedia.com/Personnel_Officer" rel="nofollow">
       Personnel Officer
      </a>
      , located behind Lt. Ferra on Starfleet Academy and choose the option "Exchange Officers." Those without much time to spare may want to skip the downgrind step and sell all doffs acquired. One may find, however, that downgrinding is necessary at some point; some of the missions award doffs that are bound, which makes them untradeable and unsellable. So...use the grinder. It is your friend.
     </p>
     <h4 id="wiki_procedure">
      Procedure
     </h4>
     <p>
      Before embarking on doffing for EC, it is recommended that the player amass a sizable amount of purple and blue doffs to send on doff missions. While a
      <strong>
       critical success
      </strong>
      with common duty officers is possible, it is not as probable and not recommended. Complete at least a few of the Colonization missions (mentioned below) in order to maximize the chance of critical success on these missions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Use the mission list below as a guide and plot your route.
      <a href="http://sto.gamepedia.com/Map" rel="nofollow">
       Use a map
      </a>
      if you're unfamiliar with sector space. Check the community-updated DOFFJOBS spreadsheet (
      <a href="http://bit.ly/DOFFS" rel="nofollow">
       http://bit.ly/DOFFS
      </a>
      ) to see what missions are currently active. The general idea is to score critical successes to get items and more doffs, then sell the expensive items and doffs for EC. Rinse and repeat. It can be a bit of a grind, but with patience can be quite profitable.
      <strong>
       PROTIP
      </strong>
      : Always check the Current Map in the "Assignments" tab
      <strong>
       and
      </strong>
      in the corresponding department under the "Department heads" tab. Duty officer missions can be found in either location. Note that missions found under "Department heads" are exclusive to the player's console but
      <em>
       can
      </em>
      be shared with others via bridge invitations.

         The unbound equivalents of the purple rewards often fetch high prices on the exchange (several million EC in some cases), so completion of the assignment chains is recommended for those looking for valuable duty officers. Maela (Doctor) has two crit traits that give a higher crit chance in all colonization missions, so stocking up multiple copies is recommended. When you have the purple doffs you need for active duty &amp; other doff missions, grind down new ones at Starfleet Academy and sell the resulting unbound doffs.

      Farming Dilithium with Duty Officer missions
     </h3>
     <p>
      There are quite a few who get frustrated with, and ultimately abandon the DOff system. Even though it is a good passive source of dilithium, they feel that they don't have the understanding, or time to devote to it. This couldn't be further from the truth however. I've commonly found that I can fill up my queue of 20 missions with missions that reward items needed, dilithium, and DOff recruitment in about 2-3 sectors worth of wandering. This usually does not take me even half and hour, and this is spent mostly in between waiting for STFs to start. When a captain gets Diplomacy or Marauding maxed out, it gets even easier with the transwarp points unlocked.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        I often hear that KDF is better for DOffing for dilithium then FED, and it very much seems the case. It is often recommended that a FED player start a Klingon player to DOff with. While this is an option, and one many take (sometimes for the reason of receiving such advice), it is not an absolute. While it is true that Klingons have it easier when it comes to dilithium farming, it is far less efficient to start an alt, get fed up and bored with said alt, and then abandon DOffing altogether. FED players, do not despair! You can still farm dilithium on your main, and make a good showing for it, without having to spend time on an alt that you don't care about and which makes DOffing a chore.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        When FED players start out, they should definitely take all the diplomacy missions they can. The transwarp unlocks are useful in any context, not just DOffing. KDF players, this applies to you as well, but you will already be marauding your hearts out to gather prisoners for the slave battalions and contraband, so this will be less of a burden for you. Sorry FED, that's just how it is.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        On the upside FED, your strength in earning dilithium will be in transporting colonists, and I've found that the missions that provide colonists occur in ratio to missions that take colonists to be slightly better then KDF prisoner missions, with the caveat that KDF will always have available the opportunity to turn in ten prisoners for an almost guaranteed 1000 dil. Klingons will find however that this option, while it does offer the chance of a crit for 2500 dil, is in the long run less optimal with regard to use of prisoners and risk, but more optimal with regard to time with a 2 hr duration. Colonial missions are also not as frequent for the KDF.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Weigh carefully what you want more: Do you want fast dilithium, or more dilithium at less risk of disaster? Lets again look at the KDF example of prisoner labor. You have the mission of Consign Prisoners to Colonial Labor Battalion, it has a smoking 2 hr. cool-down, but a base disaster (only disaster, no simple failures here!) of a whopping 28%! It also requires ten prisoners, which means in four hrs, disaster or not, you've gone through 20 prisoners. Buying two prisoners from the Orion slavers has a duration of 8 hrs. and costs 2000 latinum (Yes, intrepid DOff'er, latinum is good for something! Buying slaves!), the other marauding missions that give prisoners have a cool-down of 2hrs., but do not guarantee prisoners (though they often deliver at least one). It isn't hard to see that by doing Consign Prisoners to Colonial Labor Battalion often, your brig will be swiftly depleted.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        The solutions to the problems of both the FED and KDF when it comes to colonists and prisoners respectively are, for the FED, to focus on transporting colonists, and for the KDF to seek out those missions which, while they have a longer cool-down, have a lower requirement in prisoners and a lower fail/disaster rate. Lets look at the FED first. Resettle Colonists is available fairly often for FEDs and has an 8hr cool-down. FEDs get 20 "free" colonist DOffs when they start out, but afterward this is the mission you need to get more. Fortunately, as stated, it is on offer fairly often. If you can't find it on the current map anywhere (gasp!) check with your operations officer in the Department heads tab or on your ships engineering deck. In the extremely unlikely event that this mission is available in not a single sector, and not on offer from your operations officer, you will have to wait for a sector update. Upon acquiring at least four or up to the maximum 20 colonists, you must find a place to drop them off. The mission &lt;Grant Passage&gt; to Colonists to &lt;Staging Base&gt; has a one hour cool-down and, if you have 20 colonists, 2500 dil assuming all success, or more if you crit (and yes, less if you fail...). The assignment &lt;Transport&gt; Colonists to &lt;Border&gt;, also known as Relocate Colonists takes 5 colonists per, can not be failed, I'll say it again, CAN NOT BE FAILED, and pays out 500 dil per mission, with a chance to crit for 1500. Lets think about these crits, assuming you crit all 5 of &lt;Grant Passage&gt; to Colonists to &lt;Staging Base&gt;, you will receive 5000 dil. If you crit all 4 of &lt;Transport&gt; Colonists to &lt;Border&gt;, you will receive 6000 dil. With the no fail rate and higher max payout, &lt;Transport&gt; Colonists to &lt;Border&gt; is clearly the better bet.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        KDF, admit it, you have it easy. You go to your one stop shop for dilithium DOffing and then your off to slay any weak and helpless Federation that happen across your path. But what if I told you that you're leaving dilithium on the ground, and that Cryptic laughs at your foolishness, dishonorable toHpaH that they are? Well, maybe not, but I'll lay out some numbers and let you decide how you want to sell your prisoners into slavery. We've already looked at the Consign Prisoners to Colonial Labor Battalion mission, with its 2 hr. cool-down, 28% disaster rate, and 1000 dil (2500 dil for a crit) payout. Now lets look at Forced Labor Camp in the &lt;star cluster&gt; and Forced Labor Requisition for &lt;system&gt;, which have a 4 hr and 8 hr cool-down respectively. Both have a disaster rate of 4% with no fail rate, you crit, succeed, or there is a disaster. Forced Labor Camp in the &lt;star cluster&gt; requires fewer prisoners, but also only pays out 350 dil (which is why you don't see it on
        <a href="/r/STODOff" rel="nofollow">
         r/STODOff
        </a>
        's lists), it also requires 5 provisions. Forced Labor Requisition for &lt;system&gt; requires 4 prisoners, but has an 8 hr cool-down. But it is sustainable, as the longest mission duration for obtaining prisoners is the Orion slavers, you should be able to cycle prisoners into dilithium without looking further then 2-3 sectors. Take the small extra time needed, and you will have and extra 500 dilithium for only two more prisoners then is needed for Consign Prisoners.... True, you won't have the chance for that sweet crit, but you also don't risk that devastating disaster, and as has been said, Consign Prisoners... isn't very sustainable.

     #Farmer's Guide to Energy Credits and Dilithium

[ Back to the wiki index](http://www.reddit.com/r/sto/wiki/index#wiki_reddit.27s_star_trek_online_wiki)

-----

##Farming Energy Credits

Below are methods commonly used to farm EC (Energy Credits). 

###Foundry Missions

This is a guide to farming EC, originally written by RockyCoon. By playing a [Foundry mission](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry) once every day, a player can amass a few hundred thousand EC in less than 20 minutes.  

1. Get a Federation, or Klingon character to Level 50. I imagine you can do this earlier than 50, but being level 50 insures you get the highest mark of loot.

2. Get yourself an escort of some sort. (Advanced Mirror Escorts and Patrol Mirror Escorts are cheap on the Exchange, as well as the Mirror Qin for KDF.) Outfit it for DPS. Or really, just outfit a ship for DPS.

3. Go to Drozana Station (for all factions.)

4. Open the Foundry. (Shortcut Key is 'J' and hitting the Foundry Tab at the top of the window.). Look for the Mission called 'One and Done' via the 'Browse All' Tab on the Sidebar, and pressing the downwards triangle at the top to open the search dialogue. it may have a 'Fed' or 'KDF" Suffix in it depending on what faction you are. Start it by clicking 'Hail' at the bottom right. The start point is a cup of bloodwine near the bar.

5. This is an easy mission that also qualifies for basic foundry rewards (dilithum).

6. Do the mission. An escort/DPS Ship makes it fly by quickly. Complete it to the end, completely. Pick up all the loot the ships drop. Both mission uses a nebula around a portal to make a bunch of battleships coming in one by one easier to kill by stripping their shields... be sure to stay outside the nebula area so you can keep yours!

7. You should now have a crapload of commons, uncommons, and rares of various flavors, if you got lucky. Increasing your difficulty to 'Elite' will increase your chances of blues and purples, and possibly higher mark gear.

8. The Bartender on Drozana should give you 50% sell rate. Sell your junk there!

9. You should make anywhere between 300,000 to 500,000 EC, depending how lucky you were. Shields and deflector dishes are the ones worth the most selling this way. You may want to check the exchange to see if you can't get more.

10. You can repeat this until you stop getting expertise for killing ships, which also makes loot stop dropping.... as **there's a daily/20 hour cap on the amount of foundry loot/drops/expertise**. This is a 'Per Toon'/'Per Character' limit, so if you have an alt, you can switch to it and continue to farm loot for EC.

11. I add this to my dailies list when I do dailies. It's a good way to make a chunk of change fairly quickly and meet your daily cap in one run.

###PVE/PVP Combat

Like foundry mission farming, PVE/PVP combat can be quite lucrative. Play fleet actions like [Starbase 24](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_Starbase_24) and [Gorn Minefield](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Gorn_Minefield) and you can amass good amounts of EC, Fleet marks, Dilithium, junk loot, and potentially valuable reward loot in the process. Starbase 24 and Gorn Minefield both have a good reward system: first place awards 2 purple mk xi items, second place awards 1 purple mk xi item, and 3rd place awards 1 blue mk xi item. 

[Crystalline Catastrophe Elite](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_Crystalline_Catastrophe) (CCE) is another mission that awards two purple MK XI items to first place winners. Players with support builds have found it relatively easy to take first place, as healing counts more than damage inflicted in this fleet action. 


###Tour the Universe

[Tour the Universe](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Tour_the_universe) is an hour-long, galaxy-wide event in which the player is awarded 50,000 EC for visiting all sectors of a sector block. ~~It is possible, with the proper planning, to amass nearly 3 million EC during the event. Read the [2.99 mil EC Race Route](http://i.imgur.com/lomZU.jpg) for instructions on how to earn millions of EC in one hour.~~ 

**NOTE:** a 4 hour cooldown for this mission was introduced with the launch of the Legacy of Romulus expansion pack in 2013. The maximum amount that can be earned during the event is 350,000 EC. 


###Farming EC with Duty Officer missions (FED)

This section deals with accumulating Energy Credits by: 

1. Acquiring, downgrinding, and selling *duty officers* via [Duty Officer Assignments](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment)
2. Acquiring and selling *items* via Duty Officer Assignments

*Seller beware:* this is a guide on acquisition, not selling. Prices can and will fluctuate on the exchange, depending on rarity, availability, and the amount of game-wide Starbase projects currently running. Note that your results will vary from others. For duty officer discussion, visit /r/STODOff/. 

A NOTE ABOUT DOWNGRINDING DOFFS: since white duty officers sell quickly due to their demand and relatively low prices, some doffers choose to acquire as many high-level doffs as possible through duty officer missions (listed below), sell the expensive ones, downgrind the rest to lower quality doffs, and sell the resulting white ones. This method can be very profitable, especially when fleets run projects that require a lot of common duty officers. To downgrind doffs, see the [Personnel Officer](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Personnel_Officer), located behind Lt. Ferra on Starfleet Academy and choose the option "Exchange Officers." Those without much time to spare may want to skip the downgrind step and sell all doffs acquired. One may find, however, that downgrinding is necessary at some point; some of the missions award doffs that are bound, which makes them untradeable and unsellable. So...use the grinder. It is your friend. 

####Procedure####

Before embarking on doffing for EC, it is recommended that the player amass a sizable amount of purple and blue doffs to send on doff missions. While a **critical success** with common duty officers is possible, it is not as probable and not recommended. Complete at least a few of the Colonization missions (mentioned below) in order to maximize the chance of critical success on these missions. 

Use the mission list below as a guide and plot your route. [Use a map](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Map) if you're unfamiliar with sector space. Check the community-updated DOFFJOBS spreadsheet (http://bit.ly/DOFFS) to see what missions are currently active. The general idea is to score critical successes to get items and more doffs, then sell the expensive items and doffs for EC. Rinse and repeat. It can be a bit of a grind, but with patience can be quite profitable. **PROTIP**: Always check the Current Map in the "Assignments" tab **and** in the corresponding department under the "Department heads" tab. Duty officer missions can be found in either location. Note that missions found under "Department heads" are exclusive to the player's console but *can* be shared with others via bridge invitations. 


####Doff missions that reward duty officers

All missions can be found under "Current Map" unles otherwise noted.

**Mission Name**|**Location**	|**Commendation**|**Time**	|**Requirements**|**Reward**	|**Notes**
:--		|:--		|:--		|:--		|:--		|:--		|:--
[**Support Colonization Efforts**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Support_Colonization_Efforts)		|All star clusters		|Colonial &amp; Recruitment		|4 hrs		|Completion of the respective star cluster's [7-step colonization assignment chain](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment_chain:_Colonization). 5 duty officers (returned to your roster upon completion).		|*Critical success:* 1 bound purple doff and 1 unbound white refugee. *Success:* 1 unbound white refugee		|The unbound equivalents of the purple rewards often fetch high prices on the exchange (several million EC in some cases), so completion of the assignment chains is recommended for those looking for valuable duty officers. Maela (Doctor) has two crit traits that give a higher crit chance in all colonization missions, so stocking up multiple copies is recommended. When you have the purple doffs you need for active duty &amp; other doff missions, grind down new ones at Starfleet Academy and sell the resulting unbound doffs. [**Full list of rewards for the Colonization chain**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Duty_officer/Special#Colonizing_the_Exploration_Clusters) (link goes to Gamepedia's STO Wiki). 
[**Extricate Intelligence Asset**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Extricate_Intelligence_Asset)		|Regulus, Eta Eridani, Omega Leonis		|Espionage		|2 days		|3 security doffs (returned to your roster upon completion).		|Non-common Refugees		|*Recommended*: use Security Officers with the Logical crit trait. Don't use those with Honorable or Unruly traits, as those have a high probability of failure.

Quality (purple, blue) depends on refugee quality and crit traits.		|Use white (preferably green) refugees with crit traits. Refugees can be acquired as rewards from "Support Colonization Efforts" and can be purchased on the exchange. Don't bother with the Saurian mission, as it requires a refugee with "Cold Blooded" or "Resilient" traits (difficult to find). 
[**Officer Exchange Program**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Officer_Exchange_Program)		|Bajoran space		|Recruitment		|4 hrs		|1 duty officer that will be *permanently removed* from your roster.		|*Critical success:* 1 unbound purple duty officer. *Success:* 1 unbound blue duty officer.		|This mission can be a good, quick source of purple doffs. Use cheap greens or blues with crit traits for this mission.
[**Instigate Defection**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Instigate_Defection)		|Can be found in many sector blocks		|Espionage		|2 days		|1 Advisor, Diplomat, or Security officer and 1 other doff (doffs will be returned to your roster upon completion)		|*Critical success:* 1 bound purple doff. *Success:* 1 bound blue doff.  		|This mission can be found in several sector blocks (the map on the Gamepedia wiki page is incorrect; it has been seen in Psi Velorum).  *Recommended:* purchase and use purple doffs from Lt. Ferra at Starfleet Academy. Szyeichwa (Diplomat under Recruitment) has 2 crit traits and Ghoaech (Botanist under Colonial) has 3 crit traits. These two doffs give a 30% crit rate. [Full list of rewards](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Duty_officer/Special#Instigate_Defection). [Screenshot of mission](http://i.imgur.com/2PHDM4o.jpg).

Several other random items, including low-value gear and commodities are awarded upon completion.   		|The Dominion Fugitive can be sold on the exchange or used in other missions that will permanently remove the doff from your roster. 
[**Exchange Prisoners with Dominion**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Exchange_Prisoners_with_Dominion)		|Bajoran space		|Recruitment		|4 hrs		|1 Dominion Fugitive, which will be *permanently removed*. 		|*Critical success:* 1 unbound purple duty officer. *Success:* 1 unbound blue duty officer.		| This mission can be a gamble. Try it if you're feeling lucky. *Recommended:* don't do the other prisoner missions (Negotiate Prisoner Exchange, Return Dominion Fugitive to Facility 4028, Deliver Dominion Fugitive to Gamma Quadrant, Transfer Prisoners to Starfleet Command), as they offer little to no rewards. 
[**_____ Cultural Exchange**](http://sto.gamepedia.com/Assignment:_Tellarite_Cultural_Exchange)		|Starfleet Academy		|Recruitment		|20 hrs		|none		|*Critical Success:* 1 unbound purple duty officer and 2 unbound white. *Success*: 1 unbound white			|There are 3 missions.

##Farming Dilithium

###Farming Dilithium with Duty Officer missions

There are quite a few who get frustrated with, and ultimately abandon the DOff system. Even though it is a good passive source of dilithium, they feel that they don't have the understanding, or time to devote to it. This couldn't be further from the truth however. I've commonly found that I can fill up my queue of 20 missions with missions that reward items needed, dilithium, and DOff recruitment in about 2-3 sectors worth of wandering. This usually does not take me even half and hour, and this is spent mostly in between waiting for STFs to start. When a captain gets Diplomacy or Marauding maxed out, it gets even easier with the transwarp points unlocked.

* I often hear that KDF is better for DOffing for dilithium then FED, and it very much seems the case. It is often recommended that a FED player start a Klingon player to DOff with. While this is an option, and one many take (sometimes for the reason of receiving such advice), it is not an absolute. While it is true that Klingons have it easier when it comes to dilithium farming, it is far less efficient to start an alt, get fed up and bored with said alt, and then abandon DOffing altogether. FED players, do not despair! You can still farm dilithium on your main, and make a good showing for it, without having to spend time on an alt that you don't care about and which makes DOffing a chore.

* When FED players start out, they should definitely take all the diplomacy missions they can. The transwarp unlocks are useful in any context, not just DOffing. KDF players, this applies to you as well, but you will already be marauding your hearts out to gather prisoners for the slave battalions and contraband, so this will be less of a burden for you. Sorry FED, that's just how it is.

* On the upside FED, your strength in earning dilithium will be in transporting colonists, and I've found that the missions that provide colonists occur in ratio to missions that take colonists to be slightly better then KDF prisoner missions, with the caveat that KDF will always have available the opportunity to turn in ten prisoners for an almost guaranteed 1000 dil. Klingons will find however that this option, while it does offer the chance of a crit for 2500 dil, is in the long run less optimal with regard to use of prisoners and risk, but more optimal with regard to time with a 2 hr duration. Colonial missions are also not as frequent for the KDF.

* Weigh carefully what you want more: Do you want fast dilithium, or more dilithium at less risk of disaster? Lets again look at the KDF example of prisoner labor. You have the mission of Consign Prisoners to Colonial Labor Battalion, it has a smoking 2 hr. cool-down, but a base disaster (only disaster, no simple failures here!) of a whopping 28%! It also requires ten prisoners, which means in four hrs, disaster or not, you've gone through 20 prisoners. Buying two prisoners from the Orion slavers has a duration of 8 hrs. and costs 2000 latinum (Yes, intrepid DOff'er, latinum is good for something! Buying slaves!), the other marauding missions that give prisoners have a cool-down of 2hrs., but do not guarantee prisoners (though they often deliver at least one). It isn't hard to see that by doing Consign Prisoners to Colonial Labor Battalion often, your brig will be swiftly depleted.

* The solutions to the problems of both the FED and KDF when it comes to colonists and prisoners respectively are, for the FED, to focus on transporting colonists, and for the KDF to seek out those missions which, while they have a longer cool-down, have a lower requirement in prisoners and a lower fail/disaster rate. Lets look at the FED first. Resettle Colonists is available fairly often for FEDs and has an 8hr cool-down. FEDs get 20 "free" colonist DOffs when they start out, but afterward this is the mission you need to get more. Fortunately, as stated, it is on offer fairly often. If you can't find it on the current map anywhere (gasp!) check with your operations officer in the Department heads tab or on your ships engineering deck. In the extremely unlikely event that this mission is available in not a single sector, and not on offer from your operations officer, you will have to wait for a sector update. Upon acquiring at least four or up to the maximum 20 colonists, you must find a place to drop them off. The mission &lt;Grant Passage&gt; to Colonists to &lt;Staging Base&gt; has a one hour cool-down and, if you have 20 colonists, 2500 dil assuming all success, or more if you crit (and yes, less if you fail...). The assignment &lt;Transport&gt; Colonists to &lt;Border&gt;, also known as Relocate Colonists takes 5 colonists per, can not be failed, I'll say it again, CAN NOT BE FAILED, and pays out 500 dil per mission, with a chance to crit for 1500. Lets think about these crits, assuming you crit all 5 of &lt;Grant Passage&gt; to Colonists to &lt;Staging Base&gt;, you will receive 5000 dil. If you crit all 4 of &lt;Transport&gt; Colonists to &lt;Border&gt;, you will receive 6000 dil. With the no fail rate and higher max payout, &lt;Transport&gt; Colonists to &lt;Border&gt; is clearly the better bet.

* KDF, admit it, you have it easy. You go to your one stop shop for dilithium DOffing and then your off to slay any weak and helpless Federation that happen across your path. But what if I told you that you're leaving dilithium on the ground, and that Cryptic laughs at your foolishness, dishonorable toHpaH that they are? Well, maybe not, but I'll lay out some numbers and let you decide how you want to sell your prisoners into slavery. We've already looked at the Consign Prisoners to Colonial Labor Battalion mission, with its 2 hr. cool-down, 28% disaster rate, and 1000 dil (2500 dil for a crit) payout. Now lets look at Forced Labor Camp in the &lt;star cluster&gt; and Forced Labor Requisition for &lt;system&gt;, which have a 4 hr and 8 hr cool-down respectively. Both have a disaster rate of 4% with no fail rate, you crit, succeed, or there is a disaster. Forced Labor Camp in the &lt;star cluster&gt; requires fewer prisoners, but also only pays out 350 dil (which is why you don't see it on r/STODOff's lists), it also requires 5 provisions. Forced Labor Requisition for &lt;system&gt; requires 4 prisoners, but has an 8 hr cool-down. But it is sustainable, as the longest mission duration for obtaining prisoners is the Orion slavers, you should be able to cycle prisoners into dilithium without looking further then 2-3 sectors. Take the small extra time needed, and you will have and extra 500 dilithium for only two more prisoners then is needed for Consign Prisoners.... True, you won't have the chance for that sweet crit, but you also don't risk that devastating disaster, and as has been said, Consign Prisoners... isn't very sustainable.
