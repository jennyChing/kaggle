            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Weve had extensive internal discussions about how to rank these three giving opportunities against each other. These discussions have been particularly challenging this year because:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             The three have extremely different strengths and weaknesses, in our view. Much of the decision between them comes down to judgment calls about how to weigh factors such as (a) estimated cost-effectiveness of a charitys activities (SCI appears strongest here, in isolation, though some staff discount this observation because of the low robustness of our estimates); (b) potential
             <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/16/leverage-in-charity/">
              leverage
             </a>
             (DtWI has a potential advantage here, as it focuses on influencing government spending rather than covering all costs with its own funds); (c) a direct and robust case for impact (we believe GiveDirectly is strongest on this front); (d) upside, in terms of potential for the charitys growth to have far-reaching effects beyond the direct impact of its services. (We think all three have some upside but see GiveDirectly as particularly promising in terms of its potential to improve the aid communitys understanding of, and interest in, cash transfer programs.)
            </li>
            <li>
             The amounts of money given on the strength of our recommendations could be substantial, and so the question of what do further donations accomplish? can have complex answers: for example, the first million dollars to a charity can be quite different in their expected impact from the second million. We lay out what we know about each charitys funding gap below.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            For each charity, we have set out a minimum target that we very much hope to see it raise. The targets have no precision to them, but roughly speaking, we see more value in donations up to the minimum target for
            <em>
             each
            </em>
            charity than in donations beyond the minimum target for
            <em>
             any
            </em>
            of them. (In other words, if two of the charities had hit their minimum target and the third had not, we would prefer additional donations to go to the third charity until it hit its minimum target.) We believe that each charity will hit its minimum target. We would also be happy to see each charity raise funds beyond its minimum target, and expect that this will happen to some degree.
           </p>
           <p>
            The minimum targets consider both the nature of the funding gap and the goal of providing positive incentives via rewarding charities that exemplify the values GiveWell is seeking to promote, such as transparency, strong monitoring and evaluation, and full participation in GiveWells evaluation process. We believe that all three top charities are outstanding in these respects and thus hope to move substantial funds to each, though we also feel there are some differences on this front that contribute to our differing minimum targets.
           </p>
           <p>
            When it comes to donations beyond the minimum target, we havent reached a clear conclusion on which charities should be prioritized, and feel that donors will decide  reasonably accurately  which charities are the best fit for their own worldview and values with the guidance we provide. Accordingly, we have decided
            <strong>
             not to provide numerical rankings this year.

           </ul>

            The rest of this post lays out what we see as the key considerations regarding the funding gap, strengths and weaknesses of each recommended charity.

            We provide the details of GiveDirectlys funding gap in our
            <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly#Roomformorefunding">
             review
            </a>
            . In brief, GiveDirectly has told us that, to facilitate its planning, it aims to raise $40 million, the amount it budgets for 2014 and 2015. It hopes to spend $14 million in 2014 and $26 million in 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            As of the writing of this blog post, GiveDirectly has allocated or committed over $5 million to cash transfer campaigns (the vast majority of these funds in the past year), utilizing most of the funds it has received to date from donors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our understanding is that the majority of additional donations will go directly to cash transfers, which themselves are part of GiveDirectlys (a) experimentation with its operational model as it expands and (b) experiments into the impacts of different models of cash transfer programs.
           </p>
           <p>
            We hope that GiveDirectly is able to close a sizable portion of its funding gap, and have set a minimum target of $2.5 million, about half of what it has spent in the last year. We would be relatively comfortable with its receiving up to $20 million, though as it received more funds we would begin to prefer that those funds be allocated elsewhere.

             Cash transfers are relatively strongly evidence-backed, and are in the range of our other priority programs cost-effectiveness, but our best guess is that cash transfers are 2-3x less cost-effective than the deworming programs carried out by SCI. Details at

              top charities
             </a>
             are evidence-backed, but GiveDirectly is the only one that has a randomized controlled trial (finding strong results) of its own implementation of its program. Thus, GiveDirectly has been evaluated in a more rigorous way than our other top charities. We also feel that we have seen stronger evidence of successful execution of its program than for our other top charities.

             <strong>
              Directness and robustness of the case for impact.
             </strong>
             We believe there is a highly direct and robust connection between GiveDirectlys receiving funds and those funds reaching very poor individuals. We believe GiveDirectly to be the strongest of the recommended charities on this front.

              Scale.
             </strong>
             Were GiveDirectly to receive the full level of support it is seeking, this would result in a significant increase in scale. We view this both as a risk and an opportunity. As of the end of 2013, GiveDirectly was distributing cash at a rate of approximately $3.6 million per year; it hopes to reach close to $15 million by the end of 2014. GiveDirectly has scaled up successfully in the past; it had been distributing cash at a rate of $360,000 per year at the end of 2012. For donors who believe GiveDirectly can effectively scale up, this represents an opportunity to provide early-stage funding to an organization that may eventually grow to be much larger. For donors who are skeptical of GiveDirectlys ability to scale, providing such funds may appear unreasonably risky (though only after the first $5-10 million in support; the first $5-10 million would be consistent with the size GiveDirectly has been to date).

           </p>
           <p>
            SCI has told us that it hopes to raise at least $4 million for work it plans to undertake in 2014 and believes it could effectively absorb up to $10 million (though some of this spending would spread into 2015). This work would mostly consist of direct implementation of deworming.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since November 2011, when we first recommended SCI, SCI has received approximately $4.6 million in unrestricted funds. It has spent $2.9 million, committed an additional $1.2 million and approximately $1 million remains unallocated, including approximately $500,000 it had in reserve prior to our recommendation (
            <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative/updates/October-2013#Activitiesfundedwithunrestrictedfunds">

            ).
           </p>

            We have set a minimum target of $1 million for SCI, which is consistent with the levels of GiveWell-attributable funding it has received in the past. We would be relatively comfortable with its receiving up to $10 million, though as it received more funds we would begin to prefer that those funds be allocated elsewhere.

             </strong>
             We recently
             <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/29/rethinking-scis-evidence-of-impact-2/">
              became aware of major limitations
             </a>
             to the studies we had previously been relying on as evidence of SCIs impact. We will be reviewing further evidence that SCI sent us in response; we had not previously focused on collecting such evidence because of our impression that the studies we were using were sufficient. The program SCI works on (
             <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming">
              deworming
             </a>
             ) is relatively strongly evidence-backed.

             <strong>
              Directness and robustness of the case for impact.
             </strong>
             We believe that the connection between SCIs receiving funds and those funds reaching very poor individuals is more direct than DtWIs but less direct than GiveDirectlys. SCI has spent (and plans to spend) a sizable amount of its budget directly carrying out deworming programs, but it also spends funds on a variety of activities related to deworming (e.g., advocacy, operational research).
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Transparency and participation in our process.
             </strong>
             From 2009 (when we first made contact with SCI) through mid-2013, we struggled to communicate well with SCI. Since August 2013, our communication with has SCI has improved substantially. We still do not feel that we have the same level of visibility into SCIs operations as we do into those of our other top charities, and this is a major factor in the relatively lower minimum target we have set for SCI as opposed to other top charities, though we are optimistic that this will change in the next year.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Scale.
             </strong>
             Were SCI to receive $5 million, it would represent an increase in the amount of funding it processes. SCI has spent (or committed) approximately $2 million in unrestricted funds in each of the past two years and is currently primarily funded by a 5-year, ~$15 million grant from DFID. It is currently under consideration for a 4-year, $15-18 million grant from DFID. In sum, SCI has been operating at a level of approximately $6 million/year and may soon be operating at a level of approximately $10 million/year (due to the DFID grant). An additional $5-10 million would increase its scale further.

           <p>
            DtWI has told us that it would like to receive $2-3 million to give it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that are not directly funded by other donors. It has also told us that Evidence Action, its parent organization, has a funding gap over the next 2 years of $5-7 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because our analysis has focused on DtWI, we have focused on its funding gap.
           </p>
           <p>
            We would like to see DtWI close much or all of its gap so that it can have an adequate supply of unrestricted funding, and we have set a minimum target of $2 million. We see significantly less value in funds beyond that point, and particularly past the $3 million mark.

              Program impact and cost-effectiveness.
             </strong>
             In isolation, our best guess is that DtWIs deworming program is likely less cost effective than SCIs (about 50-100% as cost effective) and GiveWell staff differ about its cost-effectiveness relative to cash transfers (1.5-3x as cost effective). This is because worm infections appear less prevalent and (particularly) less intense where DtWI works than where SCI works. However, DtWI focuses on influencing government spending rather than covering all costs with its own funds, and we think it is therefore appropriate to give it some degree of credit for leverage  making your dollars go further than they otherwise would. Estimating the degree of leverage is highly subjective; our best guess is that it should add a multiplier of about 3 to the cost-effectiveness, making DtWI more than competitive with other top charities on this front.

              Monitoring and evaluation.
             </strong>
             We believe DtWIs self-evaluation to have been less rigorous than that of GiveDirectly, though we are hopeful that it will improve going forward. (As noted above, we are currently revisiting the quality of SCIs self-evaluation.)

              Directness and robustness of the case for impact.
             </strong>
             DtWI is a technical assistance/advocacy organization, and therefore the chain from donation to person helped is the least direct of any of our top charities. This is the flip side of DtWIs potential leverage  because it focuses on influencing and assisting other players rather than on direct implementation, its value-added per dollar spent is quite plausibly higher but also harder to pin down.

             <strong>
              Quality of communication.
             </strong>
             From 2009 (when we first made contact) through early 2013, we struggled to communicate well with DtWI. Since early 2013 (which coincided with DtWI changing its leadership), our ability to communicate with DtWI improved substantially. We now feel that we have as much visibility into DtWIs operations as we do any of our other top charities.

              Scale.
             </strong>
             Our understanding is that $2-3 million in unrestricted funds will provide DtWI with flexibility that will be helpful as it grows. Because DtWI requests $2-3 million, we would expect that any funds it receives above $2-3 million would likely effectively support Evidence Action more broadly (e.g., its Dispensers for Safe Water program, which we have not examined although we have published a
             <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality">
              report on water quality interventions

             , and potentially other initiatives that it might launch).

             <strong>
              Fungibility.
             </strong>
             DtWI is an initiative led by its parent organization, Evidence Action. There is some possibility that funds given due to this recommendation effectively support Evidence Action and its Dispensers for Safe Water program (or future initiatives) rather than DtWI. If donors are particularly concerned about this, they should carefully consider their support of DtWI.

             A note on Against Malaria Foundation (AMF)
            </strong>
           </center>
           As discussed
           <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/">
            in this blog post
           </a>
           , we are not recommending AMF to donors this year due to lack of short-term room for more funding. AMF currently has access to approximately $12 million that it has yet to commit to funding distributions.
           <p>
            We believe that it is not unlikely that AMF will reach an agreement to use the bulk of its funds in the next 6 months, and therefore would not be surprised if donors choose to continue supporting it.
           </p>
           <p>
            We will continue to follow AMFs progress and reconsider its recommendation status if/when it finalizes a distribution.

               Im in a different place than much of GiveWell staff re: SCIs relative cost-effectiveness. I dont think our deworming cost-effectiveness estimates are sufficiently robust to deserve substantial weight in ones decision about where to give. In our cost-effectiveness spreadsheet, I input two sets of values in our
               <a href="http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx" rel="nofollow">
                cost-effectiveness model
               </a>
               : one set that is optimistic to deworming and pessimistic to cash and one set thats pessimistic about deworming and optimistic about cash. My cost-effectiveness estimates for deworming range by a factor of ~300 for DtWI and 20 for SCI.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think all of the values inputted are reasonable, and Alexander, the GiveWell staffer who led our work on these figures this year, agrees (though our spreadsheet also contains his best guesses about the appropriate values and these differ from mine). Given these wide ranges, Im not relying on the cost-effectiveness of deworming in my personal analysis of where to give.

               Will you have a way to let us watch funds moved through GiveWell to your top three charities? And approximations (perhaps by communication with the organizations) of funds moved not through GiveWell? Or is minimum-target just for future reference and very large donors?

               I second the interest in tax-deductibility and suggest this information is collected somewhere centrally.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also second Guys suggestion that it would be useful to have access to target &amp; status information (e.g. something like
               <a href="http://goo.gl/jtOu6T" rel="nofollow">
                http://goo.gl/jtOu6T
               </a>
               ) on funds raised with respect to the targets outlined above  not least because this may be an attractive marketing tool for supporters of GiveWell.

               Elie, in the spreadsheet you linked to, what are the meaning of Alexander, Elie etc.? These are assumptions made by different people? Are any more data available? I would like some access to make some visualisations.

               It looks like your parameters put DtW way in front of Sci. Whats the issue here? Are you skeptical about deworming in general, or is it just the rankings that concern you?

               Are you able to provide any commentary on charities that were finalists for a recommendation, but werent selected?  Knowing who the recommended charities beat and why would provide helpful context for the recommendations.
              </p>
              <p>
               In particular, Im interested in other organizations that focus on insecticide treated bed nets, like the Against Malaria Foundation does.  Last year AMF was GiveWells top recommendation, and given the reasoning for why AMF dropped off the list, it seems that charities pursuing the same solution might be a reasonable contender for a recommendation.  It would be interesting to know why none made the recommendation list.

               Note: I formerly worked as a research analyst at GiveWell.
              </p>
              <p>
               As usual, Im impressed by the quality of thought thats gone into GiveWells recommendations.
              </p>
              <p>
               Something that stood out to me reading over the post is that 2 of the 3 recommendations (SCI and DtW) are the same as Giving What We Cans top recommendations in 2010. The process that led to GiveWells recommendations is in many respects very different from the process that led to GWWCs recommendations, and in light of this, its surprising that theres so much overlap. (I recognize that the giving opportunities available prior to this year are different from the giving opportunities available this year, but the degree of overlap is still surprising to me.) Id be interested in hearing any of your thoughts on why such apparently different processes converged on the same charities.
              </p>
              <p>
               A closely related question is that of how much value is added by deep diving philanthropic opportunities, as opposed to making decisions based on surface considerations. When one is moving a lot of money, one doesnt need to increase efficacy of donations by 2x or more in order for research to have high value, but the size of the multiplier is still decision relevant

               These recommendations are great, and I appreciate the high quality of thought that went into them.  I am, however, like Jonas, interested in how they came to overlap so much with Giving What We Cans recommendations (despite having significantly more depth) and wonder if this means GiveWell is over-investing in depth.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another aspect Im slightly concerned about is that, despite GiveWell labs operating for 2+ years and now receiving the majority of GiveWell staff time, there still have been no recommendations made to individual donors on the basis of GiveWell labs research.  I certainly dont think you should rush things, but can you comment on where things are with regard to making a top charity recommendation on the basis of labs research?

               Concerning Tax  There are two ways to donate to SCI and still receive tax deductability in USA  The first is to donate to Givewell who will pass the donation through to SCI in UK with no deductions, yet the donation receives tax deduction because it is a donation to Givewell. The second is to donate to Imperial College Foundation, a 501c3 which represents SCI in USA and can accept donations for SCI.

We would guess that all of the organizations will hit the minimum target that we set above, in part because

All of the publicly available data is included in the spreadsheet in the Parameters sheet or linked to from the Sources referenced sheet. Id encourage you to work through the model to get a sense of the details of how it works; its only in one of Elies (corner) scenarios that DtWI appears to come out far ahead of SCI. In most other staff members scenarios, DtWI appears comparable to or worse than SCI. SCI and DtWI work differently (though both focus on deworming), so differences in cost-effectiveness could be quite significant.

               Jonah and Peter: that question is a good one, and one that weve been thinking a lot about. My current thinking on the matter follows. (Well be responding to other comments shortly.)
              </p>
              <p>
               For this comment, I focus on Giving What We Cans process for recommending charities as it existed around 2010. According to
               <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/601634589892902/?comment_id=601817793207915&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=16" rel="nofollow">
                this thread
               </a>
               , Giving What We Cans process (around 2010) can be described as find the interventions with the highest cost-effectiveness in the published literature (DCPP type stuff) and then look for reputable organizations with good surface signs delivering those interventions, bolstered by some willingness to go with prospects that looked like high expected value based on harder-to-quantify factors (like political influence). This mostly comports with my impression. For simplicity, I stick with the present tense and refer to Giving What We Cans 2010 process as GWWC-2010.

              </p>
              <p>
               There are certain criteria that both GiveWell and GWWC-2010 use that narrow the field of charities considerably, making convergence more likely all else equal.
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                Both groups look for interventions with relatively easy-to-quantify outcomes, which leads mostly to a focus on global health.
               </li>
               <li>
                Both groups look for charities that focus exclusively, or near-exclusively, on such interventions. This filters out a large number of charities that work on a wide variety of programs. It also, I think, narrows the field of possible interventions to something narrower than one might initially guess. Many of the health interventions listed in the

                 DCP2
                </a>
                (which I believe to be one of GWWC-2010s main sources) are integrated with the health infrastructure in a way that makes it unlikely that a charity would focus on that intervention. The list of not-obviously-non-cost-effective candidate interventions is

               , specific conditions of the intervention, etc. We only recommend charities if they agree to participate in this intensive process, and we recommend and rank charities based on its outcomes.

               GWWC-2010, as I understand it, recommends and ranks charities based in large part on the estimated cost-effectiveness (according to DCPP and WHO-CHOICE) of the program.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thus, GWWC-2010s reasons for ranking SCI and DtWI highly hinge largely on the DCPPs cost-effectiveness estimate for deworming. By contrast, our rankings are based on the fact that (a) our own cost-effectiveness estimates (after correcting
               <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/" rel="nofollow">
                errors made in the DCPP
               </a>
               as well as integrating studies that DCPP had not considered) have deworming as a cost-effective health intervention (though not more so other health interventions such as
               <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets" rel="nofollow">
                LLIN distribution
               </a>
               ); (b) both organizations have engaged thoroughly with our process and made a relatively strong case for their impact and room for more funding.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Some reasons that convergence is more likely than one might have guessed
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               We have de-recommended two charities as a direct result of their getting significant funding via GiveWells recommendations. GWWC-2010s recommendations havent (we believe) driven as much funding and thus havent led to this issue. At the same time, we and Giving What We Can share quite a bit of information, and in some cases we have sent Giving What We Can information that has led to removal of other charities from its recommendations. I believe GWWC-2010s recommendations were SCI, DtWI, AMF, GAIN and Stop TB partnership; the latter two were later removed.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the dynamic is one in which (a) charities on our list, but not GWWC-2010s, can receive enough funding to start bringing on scaling issues and thus lead us to de-recommend them; (b) charities on GWWCs list that
               <em>
                dont
               </em>
               meet our criteria eventually leave GWWCs list. Played out over enough time, this dynamic should (all else equal) lead to some degree of convergence.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, the question remains re: what to make of the fact that the two charities recommended
               <em>
                most highly
               </em>
               by GWWC both eventually engaged with our process and did well in it (while charities ranked lower-down were removed).
              </p>
              <p>
               I think a major part of the answer is that
               <em>
                deworming
               </em>
               is simultaneously:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                An intervention that does well by GWWC-2010s criteria. Note that our cost-effectiveness analysis for deworming (correcting errors made in DCPP and making other updates based on literature not considered by DCPP and based on the specific conditions the charities in question work in) still shows it as reasonably strong compared to other interventions, though would not justify ranking it #1 by the logic GWWC-2010 uses. (Simply correcting mistakes in the DCPP would have left deworming with extremely poor cost-effectiveness; we believe that if the DCPP had not made such errors, deworming charities would not have been recommended by GWWC-2010.)
               </li>
               <li>
                An unusually simple intervention (the simplest health intervention were aware of), thus lowering the bar to demonstrating impact.
               </li>
               <li>
                An intervention whose evidence base is relatively
                <em>
                 recent
                </em>

                 room for more funding
                </a>
                than most other proven cost-effective interventions. We have written about the difficulty of combining proven cost-effective with room for more funding
                <a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/" rel="nofollow">

                </a>
                and will be writing about it more in the next week or so. Room for more funding likely contributes both to a charitys (a) likelihood of doing well in our process, which considers this as a criterion; (b) likelihood of engaging in our process.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               As of 2010, we werent aware of either of the significance of either of the second two points. In large part, I regard the fact that they turned out to be the case as a coincidence, since I dont believe either factored into GWWC-2010s ranking (at least not as a primary factor, as opposed to sanity check), and I do believe GWWC-2010 would not have recommended these charities were it not for errors in the DCPP. But the coincidence is much less striking when put as Within the small set of interventions eligible for both organizations recommendations, the one that did best by GWWC-2010s criteria is also one that has a recent evidence base and unusual simplicity, qualities that make it a strong contender for a GiveWell recommendation, as opposed to Within the large number of charities, the two that did best by GWWC-2010s criteria are also among the three strongest by GiveWells.
              </p>
              <p>
               A final note is that we believe the GWWC-2010 recommendation of SCI may have
               <em>
                caused
               </em>
               SCI to be more interested in engaging in our process, since SCI came to tangibly see the benefits of being recommended and became interested in what it could do to obtain more benefits along these lines. Its also possible that this dynamic occurred with DtWI, though we dont think so (we have seen DtWI as a promising organization and been engaging with it for a long time, and its increased engagement in our process coincided with a change in leadership).
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                What can we learn?
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               I think its worth observing that the reputable organizations with good surface signs (as identified by GWWC-2010) have turned out to be organizations that did well in our process. It suggests that the former may be a good enough proxy for the latter to save a great deal of time. This is something that we recognized was possible, but werent willing to stake our recommendations on at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
               With that said, I think this connection is still far from established. As mentioned above, deworming is an unusually simple intervention with unusual (given the evidence base) room for more funding. We wouldnt be confident extrapolating from reputability/good surface signs to strong and effective execution of a more challenging program (such as one requiring behavior change), and wed be even less confident assuming room for more funding (were confident that at least one of the organizations recommended by GWWC-2010 should have been eliminated on this basis; this organization was also recommended by us in 2010, but it still serves as a counterpoint to the idea that surface signs of reputability are sufficient to assume room for more funding).
              </p>
              <p>
               Still, we recognize it as a strong possibility that there are some basic heuristics about an organization that can tell us with reasonable confidence that it will be able to demonstrate a basic validity to its claims. Its partly in recognition of this possibility that were now providing
               <a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/process#Findingeligiblecharities" rel="nofollow">
                a full list of charities focusing on proven cost-effective programs
               </a>
               for donors consideration.
              </p>
              <p>
               Generally, I would say that GWWC-2010 overestimated how much information can be gained by cost-effectiveness estimates (particularly the opaque and flawed estimates provided by DCPP), and we have in the past overestimated how much information can be gained via a charitys willingness to engage in our process. This has led to some convergence. With that said, while we are providing a list of non-vetted charities for donors consideration, we plan to continue reserving our recommendations for charities that participate in our process, for reasons discussed in the next section.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another possible lesson learned here relates to SCIs growing interest in our recommendation after some initial money moved by Giving What We Can. We are now considering recommending some moderate-sized grants to possible future top charities, in order to create a similar effect.

              <p>
               <strong>
                On the value of deep dives
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Weve long recognized the possibility that our full deep-dive process is not needed in order to get the most important information about a charity. We now weigh this possibility more highly than we did previously, and we think it could even be defensible to believe that other reputable organizations can be assumed to be roughly accurate in their claims of impact (though we arent ready to stake our recommendations on such an assumption).
              </p>
              <p>
               With that said, we feel the benefits of our investigations go well beyond identifying which charities are successfully executing priority programs:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                They help us to deepen our cost-effectiveness analysis. For example, we believe that the deworming executed by DtWI accomplishes substantially less good per dollar spent than that executing by SCI, though DtWIs leveraging of government funds may (more than) compensate for this.
               </li>
               <li>
                They help us identify strengths and weaknesses (such as those discussed in this post) that can lead donors to more informed decisions.
               </li>
               <li>
                They help us understand the nature of different charities funding gaps, which is particularly important when moving large amounts of money.
               </li>
               <li>
                Being able to write and speak thoroughly and knowledgeably about our top charities appears (intuitively, to us) to be important in mobilizing large amounts of donations.
               </li>
               <li>
                Most importantly, the investigations
                <em>
                 and updates
                </em>
                we do on top charities (both of which require full participation in our process) have led, and (we think) will continue to lead, to a great deal of learning  learning about which aspects of the deep-dive process are most useful and which are questionable, about common obstacles to scale-up and delivery, and more.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               By recommending charities based partly on their participation in our process, were trying to create incentives for charities to participate, and thus eventually end up in a place where we have far more access to information than otherwise  information that helps us (in ways that are hard to foresee) to maximize the impact of future giving. We believe that this setup has worked as intended so far: we believe we have far more information about all of our top charities than we ever could have obtained if we had not made our recommendations conditional on deep investigations. This is particularly true of SCI (which initially engaged very little in our process) and of DtWI (which had a leadership transition this year that may have been less likely if we had already been moving it substantial amounts of money).
              </p>
              <p>
               As we proceed on
               <a href="http://www.givewell.org/about/labs" rel="nofollow">
                GiveWell Labs
               </a>
               , we plan to recommend many grants unaccompanied by deep dives. If we came across a charity whose estimated cost-effectiveness was (verifiably, not opaquely) so relatively strong as to outweigh the above considerations, we would likely recommend  or at least highlight  it without requiring a deep investigation. (We would have to be mindful of the implications for our brand, but would likely find a way to manage this.)
              </p>
              <p>
               But looking at the full set of charities eligible for our recommendations by our traditional criteria today, we dont see a compelling case along these lines, and we believe that the incentives were creating and the information were eliciting ought to be major factors in determining which charities to support.

               Peter, on your other question: it could take several years to arrive at concrete recommendations on the Labs side, and it could take less time than that.
              </p>
              <p>
               We dont feel it would be helpful to self-impose a deadline given the size of the challenge and the size of our uncertainty at this time. We feel that that we will maximize the quality of our work if we are patient. Individual donors are free to choose not to support us if they dont like the progress they are seeing or arent comfortable with such an open-ended project.

               Jonah, we have found a few appealing giving opportunities via our work on GiveWell Labs, and Good Ventures has funded these or is considering funding them (we will be writing more about them later). Those aside, we havent found giving opportunities that we think are better than our current top charities, when taking into account our confidence in our understanding of the opportunities, but we expect to. My current (not necessarily stable or confident) view is that the degree of superiority to future giving opportunities will more than compensate for a few years of delay.

               hi.  can you guys rate the parsemus foundation?  theyre working on getting a world-changing male contraceptive (called vasalgel, one-time application, may work for 10+ years and can be easily reversed any time) through FDA approval, but they lack funding. (before vasalgel came on the scene, they gave their money to alzheimers and breast cancer research, and other alternative contraceptive options, and now they dont have enough left for vasalgel.  we (the grassroots who wholeheartedly believe in them) are trying to reach out to people, but skepticism is getting in the way.  if it were recommended by you guys, that might help so much!
              </p>
              <p>
               looking at their 990s, the director doesnt pay herself anything, in fact she gave a huge portion of the foundation its funding from her own money. i feel so bad that theyre not getting any money from big donators.

               even worse, being underfunded means this world-changing contraceptive is being stalled when it should be fast-tracked. (a version of the same stuff had been studied in india for about 20 years. some men have had it applied for 15 years, so we know its effective. its the FDA requirements that are holding it back.)  its so heartbreaking.  please help if you can.  i would be ever so grateful.

               Ive never seen people complicate the act of giving as much as those middle-men who like to take a huge cut of all donations made. Stop giving and start creating an even playing field so people can have access to adequate resources instead of excluding people from economic options.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to give, give. All this intellectual masturbation around giving is a waste of time, just as ongoing studies on poverty are a waste. Common sense tells us what needs to be done  stop stacking the decks against poor people, and they will thrive on their own, not needing to rely on charitable handouts. Just do it. Stop being so damn greedy and make it possible for other people to be able to feed their families on family-supporting wages and access to equal opportunity based on peoples skills and education.
