In addition to departmental work, each Tuesday interns participate in professional development activities designed to increase understanding of the Museum's various collections, exhibitions, and departments. The Museum hosts approximately 30 interns per season in just about every

        </h2>
        <p>
         Full-time, 12-Month internships with stipends are offered for recent college graduates interested in pursuing a museum career. The focused departmental training is integrated with the fall, spring, and summer lecture series and complemented with financial provisions for the interns to attend an international art event related to their field of interest. 12-Month internships provide training in specific museum fields through close work with a professional staff member, familiarity with modern and contemporary art through seminars and discussions, and an educational program that exposes interns to the workings of the Museum as a whole and considers the role of museums in the broader cultural context. 12-Month interns will also be given the opportunity to develop and regularly deliver public gallery talks about the Museum's collection.
        </p>

              </strong>
              The intern will participate in the essential activities of a curatorial department, which may include assisting the staff in the following areas: collection management, acquisitions, loans, exhibition research and catalogue production, and administration. The collection of prints and illustrated books, numbering some 55,000 objects, is housed within the department offices, so the intern has the opportunity to work directly with art objects, after requisite conservation training. In addition, the intern will work in the departments Study Center, which services approximately 1,000 visitors per year (including classes), and is integral to its curatorial mission. In general, the intern will be involved with various aspects of the department programs, under the guidance of the curatorial and administrative staff, with hopes of fostering his or her future involvement in the field of prints and illustrated books. This internship is named in honor of artist Louise Bourgeois, whose extensive work in printmaking comprises an archive within the Museums collection.

         We do our best to match an interns experience and skill with departmental needs.

If your portfolio is not accessible online, send two copies of a CD-ROM containing these samples with your other application materials. (We wont be able to return these CDs.)

It is not necessary to order a transcript from your college/university if you can access and print an unofficial transcript and include it with your materials. If you do not have access to an unofficial transcript, please allow ample time to order a transcript from your institution so that you will be able to send this with your letter of recommendation by the application deadline.

        Eligibility
       </h2>
       <p class="headroom">
        <strong>
         Who can participate in the MoMA Internship Program?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Our Internship Program is open to: current students with at least two years of college completed at the time the specific internship begins, recent college graduates, graduate students, and beginning museum professionals.
       </p>
       <p>
        We encourage candidates from diverse backgrounds and academic disciplines to apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        High School students and recent high school graduates should visit our Teens section. (There is currently no High School Internship Program.)
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Do I have to be currently enrolled as a student to be eligible for an internship?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. Our Internship Program is open to recent graduates and beginning museum professionals, as well as to college students.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Can international students participate in the Internship Program?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Yes, many international students participate in the Internship Program. All interns are expected to be proficient in speaking, reading and writing the English language (but you do not need to submit your TOEFL scores).
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are accepted into the program, MoMA will sponsor your J-1 training visa. U.S. State Department policy varies depending on your country of origin. For questions regarding visa eligibility, contact your countrys embassy. Note that the process of acquiring a J-1 training visa takes approximately four to six weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        International interns are responsible for obtaining health insurance for the duration of their stay.

        Applications
       </h2>
       <p class="headroom">
        <strong>
         How long should my essays be?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Essays should be no longer than 750 words.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Is there a specific format for letters of recommendation that my recommender should follow?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. We do not have a required recommendation form. However, if your recommender has professional stationary, the letter should be written or typed on letterhead. Letters should state the relation between the candidate (you) and the recommender, who may be your professor, advisor, employer, former employer, or internship coordinator. The letter should explain how long the recommender has known you and why they believe you are you qualified for an internship at MoMA; the letter should describe your strengths, talents, and level of experience, as the recommender sees them. We are looking for the demonstration of responsibility, intelligence, certain skills, and maturity. The recommender should be honest and help us assess whether candidates will be a good fit for, and get something out of, an internship at MoMA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Letters can be as short as a paragraph or as long as several pages. Recommendation letters should be addressed to the Internship Coordinator; this title is sufficient. Many recommenders prefer to seal the envelope across the back and sign it, but this is not required.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are an international applicant, you may send a letter of recommendation that is not written in English, but it is helpful to include a translation of the letter.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         What is a transcript?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        A transcript is a list of the courses you have taken in college and/or graduate school, and the grades or marks you received. A transcript can be obtained by contacting the registrar or the Office of Student Records at your university. Some transcripts may also be obtained online, depending on your universitys policy. You may send an official or an unofficial transcript; photocopies of originals are also acceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Can transcripts and letters of recommendation be sent separately from the application?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Please see the specific application instructions for the seasonal and 12-Month Internship Programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Should I submit additional materials with my application, such as writing samples, slides, or exhibition catalogues?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. You should only submit the materials listed in the How to Apply section. The only exception applies to applicants to the 1) Graphic Design and/or 2) Retail, Creative and Marketing departments. These applicants must submit five design samples on CD-ROM (2 CD copies) that do not need to be returned. The department will review these samples with your application.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         May I submit my application by e-mail or fax?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Please see the specific application instructions for the seasonal and 12-Month Internship Programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         May I submit my application before the deadline?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Yes. You may submit your application before the deadline. However, MoMA will not review your application until after the application deadline.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Is the application deadline the date by which the application must be received or the date by which the application must be postmarked?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The application deadline refers to the date by which your application must be postmarked. It is not necessary to submit your application via express mail.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Can I apply for more than one internship term at the same time (i.e. Spring and Fall internships simultaneously)?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. Because we do not review applications before their submission date, we will only consider you for one internship term at a time.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, you may apply for the fall and Twelve-Month Internship programs at the same time. As the application form and requirements for each program are different, you must submit two separate applications.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Can I do an internship at MoMA during alternate dates, for example during winter break in January?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. The Internship Program only hires interns for set terms  for our Fall, Spring, Summer, and Twelve-Month Internships. We can only accommodate interns who are able to work during our program times.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         If I am accepted into a program, may I defer my acceptance to a future date?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. We only hire interns for specific projects that change from term to term.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to the large quantity of applications we receive, we cant hold onto a copy of your application in our files. You are welcome to send it in again if and when you wish to re-apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         If I am not accepted into the Internship program, can I reapply?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Yes. To reapply, you will need to resubmit a complete application. Due to extremely high volume, we are no longer keeping past applications on file.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         May I participate in more than one internship at MoMA?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        One may only participate in one seasonal internship. However, former seasonal interns may apply for the 12-Month Internship Program.

        The Selection Process
       </h2>
       <p class="headroom">
        <strong>
         How many interns do you accept into each program?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Typically, we hire about ten Twelve-Month Interns each year and 40 interns for each of the Spring, Fall, and Summer terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Do you conduct interviews before accepting applicants into the program?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Yes. We contact select candidates to set up an interview, which may be conducted either in person or over the telephone, depending on your proximity to New York. We interview all of the candidates who will be accepted into the Internship Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Do you conduct informational interviews?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. Because of the volume of internship applications and the number of people interested in the Internship Program, we dont have time to meet with people until they have been selected for interviews. If we decide to schedule an interview with you, we will contact you and ask you about your availability.

        About the Internship Program
       </h2>
       <p class="headroom">
        <strong>
         What types of projects will I be working on?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Internship projects are based on MoMAs needs and requirements, and are assigned to interns with the appropriate skills and interests. All of the internships have an administrative component.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Do you offer internships in the General Counsel and Finance departments?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. Neither of these departments offers internships, and they dont plan to do so in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Is it possible to receive academic credit for participating in the Internship Program?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Yes. We provide letters of reference and necessary documentation so that interns may arrange for academic credit through their schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         If I am accepted into the program, does MoMA provide intern housing?
        </strong>
        <br/>
        No. The Internship Department has a list of suggested housing, which consists primarily of hostels and student housing. Once you are accepted into the program, we are happy to send you a copy of a suggested housing list, but its up to you to arrange accommodations.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Are there volunteer opportunities at MoMA independent of the Internship Program?
