      In the constellation, one, the eastern fish, faces east and swims 
			upward, vertically, north from the ecliptic, while the other, the western 
			fish, swims west horizontally along the plane of the ecliptic. The Vernal 
			Equinox Point, through the precession of the equinoxes (backward motion), 
			conjoined the alpha fixed star of Pisces,
      <a href="../stars/Alrisha.html">
       Alrisha

      , around 122 B.C. (according 
			to Solarfire program, although others think it to be 111 B.C.). Alrisha 
			(now at Aries 29 degrees 28 minutes longitude), is positioned on the 
			knot in the cord that joins the two fishes, and is the nearest star 
			to Aries and the first star of Pisces that the vernal equinox conjuncted. 
			The vernal equinox then precessed along the cord (maybe two degrees, 
			or less) until it aligned with the figure of the first fish which might 
			have been at that time of the birth of Jesus as some people think. It 
			is difficult to pinpoint exactly when this occurred because of how the

      </em>
      Maggie Hyde explains:
     </p>
     <p class="tab">
      The eastern Fish suggesting an upward ascent or a heavenly/spiritual 
			disposition and is associated with Christ; the western Fish, a mundane/earthly 
			alignment and is associated with the Antichrist. Around the time of 
			Christ, the Spring Equinox Point lay between the constellations of
      <a href="Aries.html">
       Aries
      </a>
      and Pisces, moving backwards out of Aries 
			the Ram and into Pisces the Fish at the knot in the cord -
      <a href="../stars/Alrisha.html">
       Alrisha
      </a>
      (Al Rischa). Hence Christ 
			is associated with the closing of the Arian Age and the dawn of the 
			Piscean Age. ... At the time of Christ, the Spring Point lay at the 
			beginning of the first fish. ... As the Equinox Point moved through 
			the constellation, passing through the first fish, the Church was founded 
			and Christianity developed. It flourished as the Spring Point moved 
			along the cord uniting the fishes but then, as the Spring Point arrived 
			mid-way between the fish, the challenge to the Church and the predictions 
			of Antichrist began. From this time on, during the scientific revolution 
			of 1500-1700, an 'enantiodromian' or mirror image process set in as 
			the Spring Point began to creep along the cord towards the second fish. 
			In contrast to the first fish swimming upward in a 'Gothic' striving 
			towards the heights, this second fish swims horizontally outwards. The 
			Spring Point reached the first star in the second fish's tail, Omega 
			Piscium, around 1817. Although this is the fish of Antichrist, its manifestations 
			are not embodied in any one person or messiah. Rather, they are revealed 
			in philosophies, 'damnable sects', and an 'evil and magical law', which 
			is "utterly contrary and inimical to the law of Christ"...
     </p>
     <p>
      We are now in the closing era of the Age of Pisces, on, or 
			near the cusp of the age of
      <a href="Aquarius.html">
       Aquarius
      </a>
      . The 
			figure of Aquarius is positioned below the ecliptic and the stream of 
			water from the jar overlaps some of the stars of the second fish that 
			swims along the ecliptic. Various dates have been given for Vernal Equinox's 
			entry into the constellation of Aquarius; from 2012-2150.
     </p>
     <p>
      The two fishes of Pisces are bound by a cord and swim in different 
			directions. The story goes that to escape Typhon (can also mean a typhoon) 
			both Venus/Aphrodite and Cupid/Eros changed into fishes and disappeared 
			into the the sea. In order not to lose each other in the dark waters 
			of the Euphrates, they tied their tails together with a long cord, the 
			alpha star,
      <a href="../stars/Alrisha.html">
       Alrisha
      </a>
      , representing 
			the knot of the cord. Or, alternatively, Pisces is the two fishes that 
			carried Venus and Cupid to safety. This escape is commemorated in Pisces. 
			The Romans knew them as '
      <strong>
       Venus et Cupido
      </strong>
      '. [A number 
			of other constellations arise from the attack of the great beast Typhon, 
			sent by the Titans to crush the Olympians in their epic war for heavenly 
			supremacy.]

     <p>
      The streamlined fishes depicted in Pisces evolved in the Devonian 
			geologic period which is known as the Age of Fishes, about 400 million 
			years ago. Named after Devon, England, where rocks from this period 
			were first studied. Also during the Devonian Period the first fish evolved 
			feet from fish fins (see
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik">
       Tiktaalik
      </a>
      ) and 
			started to walk on land (before legs evolved; the word leg is cognate 
			with
      <a href="Lacerta.htm">
       Lacerta
      </a>
      , lizard). The feet of human embryos 
			taking shape in the womb reveal links to prehistoric fish [

       2
      </a>
      ]. 
			Feet evolved from fish and traditional astrology says that Pisces rules 
			the feet, and shoes hold a special attraction to Pisceans (perhaps suggesting 
			this particular area of the feet enclosed by the shoe is ruled by Pisces).

      The folk engendered by the two Fishes, the last of the 
			signs, will possess a love of the sea; they will entrust their lives 
			to the deep, will provide ships or gear for ships and everything that 
			the sea requires for activity connected with it. The consequent skills 
			are numberless: so many are the components of even a small ship that 
			there are scarcely enough names for things. There is also the art of 
			navigation, which has reached out to the stars and binds the sea to 
			heaven. The pilot must have sound knowledge of the earth, its rivers 
			and havens, its climate and winds; how on the one hand to ply the mobile 
			helm this way and that, and brake the ship and spread apart the waves, 
			and how on the other to drive the ship by rowing and to feather the 
			lingering blades. The Fishes further impart to their son the desire 
			to sweep tranquil waters with dragnets and to display on shores which 
			are their own the captive peoples of the deep, either by hiding the 
			hook within the bait or the guile within the weel. Naval warfare too 
			is of their gift, battles afloat, and blood-stained waves at sea. The 
			children of this sign are endowed with fertile offspring, a friendly 
			disposition, swiftness of movement, and lives in which everything is 
			ever apt to change. [

      Miss Clerke thinks that the dual form of this constellation recalls 
			the additional month which every six years was inserted into the Babylonian 
			calendar of 360 days; and Sayce, agreeing in this opinion, translates 
			the early title for these stars as the
      <b>

       Zib
      </b>
      , of 
			the later Graeco-Babylonian astronomy; although this last word may mean 
			"Boundary" as being at the end of the zodiac. Another signification

      Al Biruni asserted that "the name of the sign in all languages signifies

			supposed derivation of this word from Adir and Dag (Great and' Fish) 
			it was drawn with a woman's head upon a huge fish's body. In this manner

      ; 
			Grotius correcting the error in orthography to
      <b>
       Bambycii
      </b>
      , as Derke 
			was worshiped at Bambyce,  the Mabog of Mesopotamia, or Hierapolis, 
			 on the borders of Syria. Thus, too, it was
      <b>

      <b>
       Syrii
      </b>
      .

      But the Greeks confounded this divinity with another Syrian goddess, 
			Astarte, identified with Aphrodite (Venus), who precipitated herself, 
			with her son Eros (Cupid), into the Euphrates when frightened by the 
			attack of the monster Typhon; these becoming two fishes that afterwards 
			were placed in the zodiac. Latin classical authors, with the same groundwork 
			of the story, made Pisces the fishes that carried Venus and her boy 
			out of danger, so that, as Manilius said,
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Venus owed her Safety to their Shape.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      The constellation was thus known as
      <b>
       Venus

      </strong>
      and
      <b>
       Urania
      </b>
      , the Sarmatian 
			Aphrodite. All this, perhaps, was the foundation of the Syrians' idea 
			that fish were divine, so that they abstained from them as an article 
			of food; Ovid repeating this in the
      <em>
       Fasti
      </em>
      , in Gower's rendering:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       Hence Syrians hate to eat that kind of fishes;
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor is it fit to make their gods their dishes.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      But Xenophon limited this restriction to the fish of the river Chalos.

      A scholiast on Aratos, commented on by Grotius, said that the "Chaldaeans"

			The Greek word, however, was common for a Tunny (tuna), so that there 
			is reason enough for its application to either of the Pisces in their 
			normal shape. This northern Fish has sometimes been considered as representing 
			the monster sent to devour
      <a href="Andromeda.htm">
       Andromeda
      </a>
      , and 
			its proximity to the latter would render this more appropriate than 
			the comparatively distant
      <a href="Cetus.html">
       Cetus
      </a>
      ; in fact,
      <em>
       ketos
      </em>
      , was as often used by the Greeks for the Tunny (tuna) 
			as it was for the Whale.

      Some of the Jews ascribed the joint constellation to the joint tribes 
			of Simeon and Levi, whose sanguinary character Jacob on his death-bed 
			so vividly portrayed; others, to Gad the Marauder. Perhaps it was from 
			{Page 340} this that Pisces was considered of such malignant influence 
			in human affairs,  "a dull, treacherous, and phlegmatic sign"; yet 
			this opinion, doubtless, was anterior to the patriarch's time, for the 
			Egyptians, the instructors of the Hebrews in astrology, are said to 
			have abstained from eating sea-fish out of dread and abhorrence; and 
			when they would express anything odious, represented a fish in their 
			hieroglyphics. Pliny, too, asserted that the appearance of a comet here 
			indicated great trouble from religious differences besides war and pestilence; 
			but this became the common reputation of comets wherever they showed 
			themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      In early astrology the constellation appropriately was under the 
			care of the sea-god Neptune, and so the
      <b>
       Neptuni

      <b>

      which Sir Thomas Browne, the author-physician of the 17th century, 
			thus commented upon:
     </p>
     <blockquote>

       Who will not commend the wit of astrology ? Venus, born out of 
				the sea, hath her exaltation in Pisces.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Thus it naturally ruled the Euphrates, Tigris, and the Red Sea, and 
			Parthia; but in later days was assigned to the guardianship of Jupiter, 
			whose House it was, reigning over Egypt, Calabria, Galicia, Normandy, 
			Portugal, Spain, and Ratisbon. It was predominant in influence with 
			mariners, and had charge of the human feet; the designated color being 
			a glistening white, as of fish just out of the water; and it was fruitful, 
			like its namesakes, for, according to Manilius. "
      <em>
       Pisces

			the Flood."
     </p>
     <p>
      Ptolemy distinguished the members of the constellation as
      <em>
       epomenos
      </em>
      ," 
			the rear or eastern," and
      <em>
       egoumenos
      </em>
      , "the front or western 
			"; the Southern Fish being his
      <em>
       notios
      </em>
      ; a precaution rendered 
			necessary by the frequent confounding of these three by classical writers. 
			A notable instance of this is seen in the
      <em>
       Poeticon
      </em>
      <em>
       Astronomicon
      </em>
      , 
			where our Pisces are made to receive the water from the Urn. In Humboldt's
      <em>
       Cosmos

      they are
      <b>

      .

      The constellation is popularly thought to have taken its name from 
			its coincidence with the sun during the rainy season; and the symbol 
			for the sign,
      <img alt="" height="14" src="../images/gpisces.jpg" width="14"/>
      , to 
			represent the two Fishes joined; but Sayce thinks it the Hittite determinative 
			affix of plurality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Postellus asserted that the Fishes represented those with which Christ 
			fed "about five thousand men, beside women and children"; and Caesius, 
			that they were the
      <em>
       Iesous Khristos Theou Huios Soter
      </em>
      : ["Jesus 
			Christ (of) God (the) Son, Saviour"], a fish {Page 341} always being 
			the symbol of the early Christians' faith; but when the old twelve figures 
			were turned into those of the apostles, these became
      <b>
       Saint
      </b>
      <b>
       Matthias
      </b>
      , successor to the traitor Judas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fishes were changed to a
      <b>
       Dolphin
      </b>
      in the zodiac sculptured 
			on the wall of Merton College, taken from the armorial bearings of Fitz 
			James, bishop of London, and warden of the college from 1482 to 1508; 
			a dolphin being of as sacred significance among pagans as a fish was 
			among Christians.

      Within their boundaries took place the three distinct conjunctions 
			of Jupiter and Saturn in the year 747 of Rome,  the year to which for 
			a long time was assigned Christ's birth; these phenomena strikingly 
			agreeing in some of their details with Saint Matthew's account of the 
			Star of Bethlehem. The opinion that these appearances guided the Magi 
			in their visit to Judaea was first advanced and advocated by the celebrated 
			Kepler, and worked out in 1826 by Ideler, and in 1831 by Encke. [Allen 
			notes at bottom of page 341: More recent determinations, by the late 
			Reverend Mr. Charles Pritchard of Oxford, have somewhat altered the 
			previous conclusions, while our chronologists, meanwhile, have changed 
			the date of the Nativity, so that the time-honored identification of 
			the Star of the Magi with these planetary conjunctions now seems to 
			be discarded. ] It is noticeable that the Rabbis held the tradition, 
			recorded by Abrabanel in the 15th century, that a similar conjunction 
			took place in Pisces three years previous to the birth of Moses, and 
			they anticipated another at their Messiah's advent. Thus the Fishes 
			were considered the national constellation of the Jews, as well as a 
			tribal symbol. Jupiter and Saturn were again together here in February, 
			1881, Venus being added to the group,  a well remembered and most beautiful 
			sight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here, too, was the seat of the predicted conjunction of three planets 
			that Stoffler said would cause another Deluge in 1524,  an announcement 
			that created universal consternation; but, unfortunately for the prophet's 
			reputation, the season was unusually dry.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was in Pisces, on the 2nd of September, 1804, that Harding, of 
			Lilienthal in Hanover, discovered the minor planet Juno.

      <em>

      for November, 
			Edmund Spenser thus described the constellation's place in the sky:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       But nowe sadde Winter welked hath the day,
      </p>
      <p>
       And Phoebus, weary of his yerely taske,
      </p>
      <p>
       Ystabled hath his steedes in lowly laye,
      </p>
      <p>
       And taken up his ynne in Fishes haske.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      La Lande, quoting indirectly from Firmicus, mentioned as from the 
			Egyptian sphere of Petosiris:
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       au nord des Poissons, il place Ie Cerf, &amp; une autre constellation 
				du Lievre;
      </p>
     </blockquote>

      I cannot trace, although Bayer 
			had Cerva as a title for Cassiopeia "north of the Fishes."

      There is a sprinkling of indistinct stars between the Fishes and 
			the Whale (Cetus) that Vitruvius called
      <em>
       Ermedone
      </em>
      , explained 
			by Hesychios as the Stream of Faint Stars, but by some French commentator 
			as
      <em>

      <em>

      <em>
       Mercure
      </em>
      , whatever 
			that may be. Riccioli, calling it
      <b>
       Hermidone
      </b>
      , said that it was
      <em>
       effusio
      </em>
      <em>
       Aquarii
      </em>
      , the classical designation for the 
			Stream from the Urn; but Baldus, with Scaliger, said that the word was
      <em>
       Arpedone
      </em>
      , the Cord, although this seems equally inapplicable 
			here. These stars may be the proposed new
      <b>

      noted under 
			beta Ceti.
