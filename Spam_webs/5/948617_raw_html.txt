        We here at Bullz-Eye always knew that we wanted to run a piece in conjunction with the release of "
        <a href="/mguide/reviews_2009/harry_potter_6.htm">
         Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince
        </a>
        ," but what we didn't know was what kind of piece it would be. We considered the matter, and we came to the conclusion that it would've been a little too easy to whip up a list of our favorite Hollywood wizards. In the midst of the discussion, however, an observation was raised about the film itself: what's going to happen to these kids  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson  after the last of the "Harry Potter" books has been adapted for the silver screen? Will they be able to rise above their roles and find work elsewhere, or are they destined to be remembered solely as Harry, Ron and Hermione? From there, we quickly began to bandy about the names of other folks who have and haven't been able to score success in other cinematic identities, and the piece began to write itself. Ultimately, only one of our selections seemed impossible to pigeonhole as either "Forever Typecast" or "Escaped Typecasting," and when you see that actor's name, we think you'll nod your head knowingly and understand exactly why we had that problem.

        There are worse roles one can be remembered for than the Man of Steel, but as  Kirk Alyn and George Reeves would tell you, once you've worn the cape and the  big red S, it's damned hard to get people to see you without it. In Reeve's  case, much of the problem stemmed from being a virtual unknown when he scored  the break of a lifetime and got hired to play the universe's most famous  Kryptonian. Although time has, appropriately enough, been very good to his first  post-"Superman" film ("Somewhere in Time"), it certainly wasn't a box-office  smash. Those who were aware of Reeve's status as a Juilliard-trained actor were  likely unsurprised by his decision to spend his time between "Superman" sequels  pursuing parts in such commercially-questionable films as "Monsignor," set  during World War II, "The Bostonians," the Merchant-Ivory film based on the  Henry James novel, and "The Aviator," George Miller's tale of a 1920's mail  pilot. To everyone else, however, it probably just looked like he was trying  desperately to distance himself from the role that had established him. In  truth, that didn't really start until after the last of the "Superman" films,  with 1988's "Switching Channels," but people just didn't buy the guy in a  romantic comedyor in horror films, either, as the 1995 remake of "Village of  the Damned" proved. The great acting continued  see "Remains of the Day" for  proof  but nothing seemed to supplant Superman. Reeve, who died in 2004,  obviously ended up carving a new legacy for himself, with his efforts to  increase funding for research toward treatments and cures for paralysis caused  by spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders. But if he hadn't had  that fateful horseback-riding accident in 1995, would he have escaped from his  most famous role? We'll never know.

        Unlike his primary predecessor, once Roger Moore was cast as superspy 007, it was a part he found nearly impossible to escape. It didn't help matters that Moore's acting range was always pretty limited, or that prior to stepping into the role of Bond, he was largely known for playing characters that were somewhat similar to Bond in the TV series "The Saint" and "The Persuaders." But from '73 to '85 he
        <em>

        James Bond, and following

        </a>
        so successfully was no mean feat  just ask George Lazenby. By the time Moore left Bond, he was 58, and the roles pretty much dried up, although he's always seemingly embraced his most famous part, and managed to play Bond types in bad movies like "Boat Trip" and "Spice World." Indeed, he seems to have nothing but fond memories of that time in his life, as is evidenced by the full set of commentary tracks he provided for his Bond films on the most recent DVD releases of his 007 tenure. His humility is perhaps his greatest asset, and these days he devotes nearly all of his time to UNICEF.

        As a member of the famous Groundlings comedy troupe in Los Angeles,  Paul Reubens had created scores of characters, but one of them would prove to  be both his meal ticket and his albatross. Reubens was knocking around ideas  about a guy who loves to do stand-up comedy but isn't terribly good at it. With  the help of fellow Groundling Phil Hartman, Reubens eventually found the voice  (squeaky) and look (suit, bow tie, pants about four inches too short) for  Pee-wee Herman. Pee-Wee was a huge hit, serving as the basis for a hit play, a  beloved television show, and two movies of, well, varying degrees of quality.  The problem was that when it came to securing work, Pee-wee had much better  luck than Reubens did, something Reubens only exacerbated by making numerous  appearances on sitcoms in character as Pee-wee, pretending that he was real and  Reubens didn't exist. After "Pee-wee's Playhouse" went off the air in 1990,  Reubens attempted to prove that he had more to offer, as both a comedic actor  (his death scene in the original "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" remains a favorite  of ours) and a dramatic one (one word: "Blow"), but thanks to an ill-advised  arrest at a Sarasota movie theater in 1991  not to mention another charge in  2002 for child pornography  Reubens' post-Pee-wee existence has been a  troubled one. It appears that Reubens has finally come to terms with this,  though, as he is currently working on two different "Pee-Wee" scripts. Hey, if  it ain't broke

        As  Nosferatu, Max Schreck may have been cinema's first iconic vampire, but when  push comes to shove, the only vampire that really matters is Count Draculaand  the only Count Dracula that really matters is the one portrayed by Bela Lugosi  in 1931. Although Lugosi  who, believe it or not, really was born within  spitting distance of the Transylvania border  had been an actor for years in  his native Hungary as well as Germany, it wasn't until making the move to  America in the early 1920s that he truly embarked on his path to Hollywood.  There's no question that Lugosi's performance as Dracula is the most iconic of  all time (as our own Mr. Westal said, "If someone says, "Talk like a  vampire," you don't launch into a Gary Oldman or Christopher Lee  impression"), but what do you do when your performance is
        <em>
         too
        </em>
        iconic? In  Lugosi's case, he wasn't exactly thrilled that he'd been forced into the niche  of playing "the boogey man"  his phrase  almost exclusively, but he did the  best he could with the situation. Still, it must've hurt when he turned in a  perfectly fine performance alongside Greta Garbo in the comedy "Ninotchka,"  only to find no change in his fortunes. As those who've seen Tim Burton's "Ed  Wood" know, Lugosi's later years found him suffering through a stream of  grade-B (and lower) films, and when the grim reaper finally came to callyes,  Bauhaus fans, Bela Lugosi's deadhe was laid to rest wearing one of his Dracula  outfits. Now that's some

        Here's a guy who genuinely could have been one of the great character actors, if only Hitchcock hadn't come along and cast him as one of the most iconic movie characters of the '60s. These days, a cross-dressing killer with mother issues may seem old hat, but it's easy to forget that in 1960, everything about Norman Bates was revolutionary. He was the monster living next door, and it scared the hell out of people. Afterwards, he continued to work, but in projects that were never as memorable as "

         <strong>
          Psycho

        </a>
        ." The bulk of his other film work was eventually forgotten by most, but Bates was permanently lodged in people's minds. He finally, after 23 years, agreed to play the part once again in 1983's "Psycho II," a move the led to him getting cast in Norman Bates-type roles in movies such as "Crimes of Passion" and "Edge of Sanity." Clearly he was riding the gravy train by this point, as he also returned to the role another two times: "Psycho III" (which he also directed) came out in '86, and 1990 featured his final Bates outing, the TV movie "Psycho IV: The Beginning," in which Henry Thomas played the teenage Bates while Perkins reminisced on a radio talk show. Mother would not be happy.

        We're included both of these gentlemen in one listing  because it's almost impossible to think of them separately. As the story goes,  Kevin Smith had intended to play the role of Randal Graves in "
        <a href="http://www.bullz-eye.com/mguide/reviews_1994/clerks.htm">
         Clerks
        </a>
        " (he has  said that this is why Randal has the best lines in the film), but when it  became apparent that helming the film was going to take up too much of his  time, he deferred to Jeff Anderson in the role and took on the lesser part of  Silent Bob. As for Jason Mewes, however, one gets the impression that he pretty  much
        <em>
         is
        </em>
        Jay, so there wasn't a great deal of acting involved there.  Since the View Askew-niverse wrapped up with "Clerks II," Mewes has still  managed to work steadily, but trying to escape from playing a drug dealer by  appearing in "High Hopes," a film revolving around a bunch of guys trying to  steal government marijuana, isn't exactly what you'd call stretching one's  wings, and when Mewes appeared alongside

Even in his other roles (most of  which have been in films that have gone straight to video), it's hard to get  past his inherent Jay-ness. As for Smith, his regular behind-the-camera gigs  have kept him from working very hard to get away from the role of Silent Bob,  but while we'll give him credit for his performances in "Catch and Release" and  "

Though he revived the character of the  smart-mouthed, chainsaw-wielding Ash for two more sequels, Campbell spent a  lifetime trying to distance himself from the iconic role  so much so that he's  been known to sign autographs as Bruce "Don't Call Me Ash" Campbell. When he  finally did put the character to rest in 1992's "Army of Darkness," the  Michigan-born actor found it difficult to find any sort of decent work. Two  failed (but relatively good) TV series later, and the only thing Campbell had  to show for himself was a recurring stint on the Raimi-produced "Hercules: The  Legendary Journeys" and a handful of generic hero-type roles in a slew of  made-for-TV movies. Campbell came awfully close to reinventing himself as an  elderly Elvis Presley in 2002's

The actor eventually embraced his notoriety as a B-movie action hero in  the horror/comedy send-up, "My Name Is Bruce," and has even carved out a nice  role for himself in the USA spy drama, "Burn Notice," but don't think for a  second that it's quelled the cries for another "Evil Dead" film. The good news?  Raimi and Campbell have hinted that something's in the works.

        You can't help but think that when Judd Nelson  read the script for "The Breakfast Club," he triumphantly pumped his fist in  the air in the same manner as his character John Bender in that movie's iconic  final scene. Bender provided Nelson with a showcase to display the actor's  versatility; he's funny yet insightful, tough yet cowardly, and most  importantly he's eminently quotable. It's the kind of role that few grown-up  actors ever get the chance to play, and Nelson, then a mere 25 and with only  two movies to his credit at the time of its release, knocked it out of the  park. His star seemed destined to rise even higher with the release of the Brat  Pack dramedy "St. Elmo's Fire" a mere four months after "Breakfast Club," but  alas, only John Parr managed to score a hit with that one. Nelson continued to  stay busy in the ensuing years, trying his hand at anything from broad comedy ("From  the Hip") to crime dramas ("Blue City," "New Jack City") and even provided the  voice of Rodimus Prime in the original animated "Transformers" movie. However,  most of those projects did poorly  Nelson even received Razzie nominations for  his work in "Blue City" and "From the Hip"  or in the case of "New Jack City,"  succeeded for reasons other than Nelson's involvement. He had a three-season  stint as Brooke Shields' almost-brother-in-law (and boss) on "Suddenly Susan,"  but when he made an appearance on a 2007 episode of "Family Guy," it was, you  guessed it, as John Bender. Fortunately for Nelson, he never seems to have  trouble finding work; that next Bender-esque role, however, continues to elude  him.

        Its easy to imagine Ralph Macchio sitting at home, drinking Scotch in his boxers and watching The Outsiders over and over again, wondering what his career wouldve been like if his next movie hadnt been The Karate Kid. Its not that the decision to appear in a film about a teenager who learns to defend himself with the aid of a wizened Japanese karate instructor was a bad move. Its just thatwell, have you looked at the cast of The Outsiders? Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Diane Lane, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevezgeez, even C. Thomas Howell is remembered for more than one role! At first, Macchio tried to expand his palate, tackling the Robert Johnson inspired Crossroads, but when he dared to play Daniel-San for two Karate Kid sequels as well, it became hard to think of him as anyone else. But heres the thing: Macchio really wasnt that memorable an actor to begin with. This is perhaps most evident with his lone high-profile role of his post-Kid career, playing Billy Gambini in My Cousin Vinny. Be honest, now: how often have you come across the film on cable and found yourself thinking, Oh, thats right: I forgot Ralph Macchio was in this? If you look at his credits for the past several years, theyre rather paltry, and two of the most high-profile gigs  Entourage and Head Case  have found him playing himself.  Dare we suggest that this may be where his greatest strength as an actor lies?

        One of the greatest yet ultimately saddest moments in the recorded history of actor Jim Varney came with a segment that the NBC Nightly News did about him in 1984. At the time, Varney had yet to do a single one of his famed Ernest movies, but hed done a plethora of commercials which had earned him considerable regional fame, and during the segment (which you can see for yourself

Unfortunately, the world rarely saw him outside of his Ernest guise, and if truth be told, Varney didnt try all that hard to get away from it, doing nine Ernest movies, a TV series, and more commercials than youd ever want to try and count. He popped up in several other films during his career, but the only one of real note was his performance as Jed Clampett in The  Beverly Hillbillies, and even that was ultimately playing to the Southern stereotype that hed already perfected. Wed be remiss if we didnt also remember him for his voiceover work as Slinky Dog in the Toy Story films (though were already sad at the thought of the 3rd film without him), but thats but a slight recollection. To virtually everyone, Jim Varney was Ernest P. Worrelland always will be. Know what I mean, Vern?

In the days before he portrayed the child-murdering, claw-wielding  Freddy Krueger, he'd narrated the classic surfing flick, "Big Wednesday," and  done a fair amount of movie and TV work, most notably as the Visitor named  Willie in "V." After the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" flick, however, it  appeared that Englund had finally found his wheelhouse: the horror industry.  His is an interesting case, since it seems pretty clear that he never really

Englund hasn't  played Mr. Krueger since 2003's "Freddy vs. Jason," but nor has he dared to  step outside of the realm of the macabre. We don't anticipate that will change  anytime soon.

After that, the movies beckoned, but he's never really been able to do much of anything outside of play Kermit the Frog. It's the one role he cannot escape, and it's not for a lack of trying. While he embraced his most famous persona in the first few Muppet movies, he attempted to tackle more serious roles such as Bob Cratchit in "The Muppet Christmas Carol," Captain Abraham Smollett in "Muppet Treasure Island," and the Scarecrow in the utterly dire "The Muppets' Wizard of Oz." It seemed the harder that Kermit tried to break away from his own personality, the less successful the results, and people became disenchanted with the franchise. He's not been seen too often as of late, but let's all hope that he hasn't turned to alcohol and drugs, like many a frustrated performer before him. It ain't easy bein' green, indeed.

        "Alien" wasn't Sigourney Weaver's first film, but for all practical  purposes, it might as well have been. To look at her IMDb listing, the only other  credits to her name at the time were as one of Alvy Singer's unnamed dates in "Annie  Hall" and aswell, actually, her role in the 1978 film "Madmen" was apparently  so small as to not even have a character name. (That, or no one who works for  IMDb has ever seen it, a theory which seems more probable when you realize that  almost no one else in the film is listed with a character name.) The fact that  she's since done three sequels to "Alien," even earning an Academy Award  nomination for her performance in the second film of the quadrilogy, makes it  all the more surprising that she's not more consistently referred to as  Sigourney "Ripley" Weaver. Her solution? She mixed it up. A

By the  time she got around to making "Aliens," she'd already done a comedy with Chevy  Chase ("Deal of the Century"), worked alongside Mel Gibson in Peter Weir's "The  Year of Living Dangerously," and participated in the stellar ensemble of Peter  Yates' "Eyewitness." (Never seen it? It also stars William Hurt, Christopher  Plummer, James Woods, and Morgan Freeman!) Of course, it also didn't hurt that  she found herself playing a part in the multi-million dollar success story of "Ghostbusters"  during that pre-"Aliens" time frame. Looking at her credits, it's clear that  Weaver has never been afraid to switch from one genre to the next, providing  top-notch dramatic and comedic performances at the drop of a hat. Yes, we're  always happy to see her fighting back against her acid-blooded alien nemeses,  but she's such a strong actress that, really, we're happy to see her anywhere.

        By all counts, playing cinema's most famous singing and dancing cross-dressing alien should have kept Tim Curry from ever working again. It was the perfect fusion of actor and character, and he's so well known for the role, that to this day it seems impossible for anyone else to play the part without falling short somewhere along the way. It remains the role for which he is most famous. But Curry defied the odds by being a damn fine actor, and transforming himself into a wide variety of different characters over the years, and proving just how versatile he really was. He can sing and dance obviously, but he can also tackle serious drama when it comes his way. Look no further than his role as Darkness in Ridley Scott's "Legend," a part that required him to act from beneath mounds of makeup and costume, and yet he does a fantastic job in a role that most actors would've been overwhelmed by. In the very same year he brought the Devil to life, he also gave us Wadsworth, the butler in "Clue," who, in an unusual move for a butler, was arguably the film's lead. In the '90s Curry often played smaller character roles in a wide variety of films ranging from "The Hunt for Red October" to "The Shadow" to "Oscar." One of the great roles of his long career was that of the sleazy Rev. Ray Porter in 1988's rarely seen "Pass the Ammo," a movie for which a DVD release is long overdue. These days he can mostly be found doing loads of voice work for all manner of animation. The multitalented Curry doesn't appear to show any signs of slowing down, and for that we should all be grateful.

        There was a time when Julie Andrews was sugary, syrupy sweet   the virgin queen of the silver screen. It was around the time she starred in  two hugely popular musicals, "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music." She made  one movie in between them, the criminally underrated and nearly forgotten "The  Americanization of Emily," and afterwards starred in stuff like "Hawaii" and "Star!,"  but never really broke the sudsy stereotype until she married director Blake  Edwards and he started casting her in his movies. The two that really helped  her shed her '60s screen personas were "10," in which she played the girlfriend  of a philandering Dudley Moore, and most especially "S.O.B.," which echoed her  frustrations with her career, and in which she bared her breasts for the world  to see  a hugely bold maneuver for someone of her standing at that time of her  life. Of course, perhaps the greatest role of her career was that of Victoria  Grant, in Edwards' gender-bending musical comedy "Victor/Victoria," a movie  that pretty much wrapped up everything Andrews was good at into one hilariously  entertaining package. In recent years she's found another outlet for her  talents: providing a voice for the Queen in the "Shrek' movies.

        You know  how James Bond can be put in the most impossible situation and still escape? By  the time the third Bond film, "Goldfinger," launched a worldwide spy craze in  1965, Connery had gone from a little-known television actor to a level of  recognition rivaling Mickey Mouse in the space of three years, and his chances  of transcending 007 seemed about as likely as Mickey taking the lead in "Macbeth."  (A part Connery had actually played on TV.) He turned in strong performances in  Alfred Hitchcock's 1964 romantic thriller, "Marnie," and Sidney Lumet's  ultra-gritty 1965 military prison drama, "The Hill," but the actor who had once  personally disarmed Hollywood gangster Johnny Stompanato was stymied by his own  skill at embodying the role of the suave super-assassin. Still, by 1972 Connery  had left Bondage  apparently for good  after six films. He began  experimenting with facial hair onscreen. He donned a turban for a role as an  Arab chieftain in "The Wind and the Lion." He allowed his balding head to  appear onscreen for his role in John Huston's "The Man Who Would Be King." The  hair grew even thinner when he played a disillusioned Robin Hood opposite  Audrey Hepburn in Richard Lester's "Robin and Marian." By 1983 he was a hugely  bankable, fully bald star in his own right and far enough away from typecasting  that he was ready to shave and re-don his toupee in the appropriately titled  non-canonical Bond film, "

         Never Say Never Again
        </a>
        ." The movie wasn't so hot, but  it was cool. The toupee came off. The mustaches and beards returned, and so did  Connery's aging tough-guy roles with megahits like "The Untouchables." In  movies, image may not be everything, but it's a lot.

        When the idea for this list first started being bandied about amongst the Bullz-Eye writers, one of the first names I threw out as a candidate was Peter Sellers, and while everyone seemed to agree he was a worthwhile candidate, we couldn't really decide on whether or not he'd been Forever Typecast, or if he'd escaped typecasting. The truth is somewhere in between. Ask most any Joe on the street who Peter Sellers played, and you'll likely 9 times out of 10 hear the same answer: Inspector Jacques Clouseau. There's something to be said for that public perception, and no doubt the fact that he played the role five times (six of you count the posthumous release of "Trail of the Pink Panther," in which his performance was comprised of outtakes and flashbacks from the previous films) contributes to the stigma. Nevertheless, many either haven't seen or they've forgotten the cache of work he amassed before, during and after the times he played Clouseau. Who can forget his Clare Quilty in Kubrick's "Lolita," or all three roles he played Stanley's next film, "

        ?" The '60s also saw him in fare like "What's New Pussycat?," "The Party" (in which he played a bumbling Indian), "The Magic Christian," in which he co-starred with Ringo Starr, and the counter-culture comedy "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas." The '70s clearly weren't an easy ride for Sellers, which is no doubt why he kept returning to the safety of Clouseau, although he still managed to find other things to do such as "Murder By Death" and a comedy take on "The Prisoner of Zenda." Finally, in '79, he seemingly beat Clouseau with his Oscar-nominated performance in Hal Ashby's sublime comedy, "

        </a>
        ," and he passed away shortly after. While many may only remember Sellers for one part, there's an entire subculture of fans devoted to every role of his
