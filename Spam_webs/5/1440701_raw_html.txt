         So many articles about narcissists are written by experts and in some ways they should be. Psychologists and psychiatrists are uniquely trained to deal with all kinds of mental illnesses and disorders. The flip side of that head knowledge and heart knowledge are two different things. Knowing about something and really knowing something are not the same. I know about Paris, France because its interesting to me and Ive researched it. I even learned French pretty fluently in my younger years. You know what? I know about it but I dont know it. I dont know how it smells on an April morning or where the best place to watch the sunset is. I dont know where to get the best

         Experts Can Give You Averages
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        An expert can tell you how an average narcissist acts. He can tell you what their pattern may be but since everything they know is based on study and some non-intimate experience there is much that they dont know about your situation. In fact, you can sit in a counselors office with your mate and the counselor can totally miss the narcissistic factor.
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        The ex and I went to counseling with two different counselors. I remember having my ex tell me one thing and then say something completely different in the counselors office. Not just once but over and over again. Do you know that trust game where you fall backwards and someone catches you? Well every time he twisted the truth or, for lack of a better word, double-crossed me I felt like I had fallen backwards and he stepped aside and laughed as I fell.
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        I looked like an idiot to the counselors  an idiot, a liar, and a bully.

         Lets Talk Red Flags
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="p7">
        I have read so many articles that talk about red flags and they honestly make me want to throw my computer at the wall. According to experts red flags look something like this:
       </p>
       <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li2">
         Hes too charming.
        </li>
        <li class="li2">
         He understands your pain and is empathetic.
        </li>
        <li class="li2">
         He treats you like a princess.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="p2">
        Oh yeah. OK, yall when you meet someone who is perfect you need to run. So, does that mean that you should choose the guy that acts like a jerk? Do either of those statements make sense?
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        Nope.
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        Narcissists do not have a neon sign that proclaims their narcissism, nor do they have red flags that they carry like banners. They are kind, sweet, romantic, and just the kind of guys that your mom wants to make her famous apple pie for. They play catch with your nephew and buy you little sister a gallon of ice cream and a chick flick when she gets dumped. They are the kind of guys that you want to marry for all of the right reasons. Sometimes there just arent any red flags. Sometimes the red flags dont go up until after the wedding and by then its too late.
       </p>

        <strong>
         When We Get Behind Closed Doors
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        At some point youll find out that you are married to a narcissist who really doesnt care about you as much as he cares about what you represent or can do for him. Some women find out on their wedding night while others are unaware of it for a long time. I think that sometimes there are people whose narcissism is latent until some defining moment that wakes up the sleeping giant. In any case, if you were unaware of it for decades and then it suddenly smacked you in the face you arent the only person that has ever happened to. If your new husband bared his narcissistic tendency to you on your wedding night then you arent the only person that has experienced narcissism from the moment that you were caught. Some narcissists just really like that game.
       </p>
       <p class="p6">
        <strong>
         Not Seeing Red Flags Does Not Make It Your Fault
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        Just because you didnt know, didnt realize, or didnt see any red flags proclaiming his narcissism doesnt mean that you are flawed. It merely means that he is a better shape changer than many of the other narcissists in the world.
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        While it is good to make sure people know what red flags too look for more articles need to be written about the fact that sometimes you cant tell. Sometimes, no matter how perceptive you are you wont know what you are getting into. Its important that you understand that its not your fault. You didnt get yourself into this situation. You didnt make poor choices.
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        You are not the problem. The problem is not your fault. Most of all, you dont have to stick with the life you have chosen no matter what anyone says.

         Hell Have Groomed an Assistant
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="p2">
        During your relationship he will have been grooming an assistant  someone who will invariably convince you that he truly adores you and you should give him one more chance. Often this will be someone close to you like your mother or best friend. This assistant is unaware that he has chosen them to keep you from noticing red flags as they get more and more obvious. This person will get you to look at everything other than those flags.
       </p>
       <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li2">
         He loves you so much.
        </li>
        <li class="li2">
         You two are going through a rough patch.

         You are the perfect couple.

       </ul>
       <p class="p2">
        If you leave him this person will try to arbitrate, to try to be the go-between, and to try to keep you from making changes. They do that because the narcissist is carefully creating a scene where he is the broken-hearted victim who is misunderstood. The assistant will feel sorry for him and try to fix things for him. Its win-win for the narcissist. Hes

        No one can promise that you will never again get into a relationship with a narcissist. You might open yourself up to a new relationship and find the man of your dreams or you may find that you are in the same situation again. The best you can do is to build yourself up so that you can learn to set boundaries and protect them from narcissistic encroachment. That usually stops them in their tracks.

         Bingo. I was reading an article about red flags and reflecting back on my 25 years of marriage and the 6 years of dating before that (during high school &amp; college). Hindsight is always more clear. I began to write - "Sometimes the red flags are not easy to see." It was only after 12 years of marriage that I got a serious pange of the heart, knowing that something had changed. My husband was now different. Where as I had been able to discuss concerns with him and we had always taken our relationship seriously and we had studied rules for working on conflict and differences as well as how to fight without damaging our marriage and how to love each other, even in ways that were not natural  or easy to us. Now, I was shut down, told "this is the way it's going to be." If I brought any criticsm I would pay - of course this wasnt constant or I maybe would've opened my eyes sooner. Other things began to change. I became depressed. I lost myself. I felt used and dishonored. He was worried about me - actually he had become disgusted in my behavior and in his narcissistic mind developed the idea that I hated him (well I think he was projecting there...). He encouraged me to get help. I did. 6 months of counseling. Then 6 years after that, I was  still getting better but he was getting worse. There was an inadvertant email sent where my mother n law expressed her apparent true feelings about me. I was crushed. He defended her. (Why am I still here?) There was a huge blowout with his sister. He defended her and accused me. (Again, Why am I still here?) My eyes opened more and more. His alcohol use worsened and that amplified everything. I thought the problems were all alcohol poisoning, long time use changing his brain. Maybe it is. I don't know yet. However, I found that even in extended periods of sobriety, the rages continued to flare, more often.  I have finally told him that his behavior is abusive and I didn't want to go on a family vacation with him. He was devastated for about 3 days. Then he went back to work after that weekend and began to gain his "strenght" back. by the next weekend he was blaming me for his anger again. sigh. For a few moments, i saw my original husband. Has anyone had any luck exposing this abuse? I mean, they are so charming to the outside world and so perfect and model citizens and church members, involved beloved fathers, blah blah blah... Even my counselor and pastor didn't get it, didn't see the red flags... Everyone is his assistant.

         Such a relief to read this as I have been blaming myself for being so stupid...but initially there were no signs, he made himself into the perfect person for me including changing his car to a family model. He did everything I could wish for but as soon as I became seriously ill (i.e. No use), he abandoned me.

         Nope, not my fault.  There are different kinds of Narcissists out there.  The blue lettering link "experts says" was very excellent, but her red flags would not have worked for me because she had a traditional Narcissist and I had a cerebral Narcissist.  My red flags looked different. She and I both slept with hammers just the same.  Nope, not my fault.  I had only one red flag before I married him, and I was too young to know it was a red flag.  Looking back is everything. It took many years to figure out his motives.  Did he give me flowers because he loves me and thinks I'm so wonderful? OR did he give me flowers because he is loves himself and he is so wonderful for giving me flowers even though I didn't deserve it?  Kind of looks the same.  But one leaves you happy and one leaves you depressed.  Since when is flowers a red flag? Great blog, thank you. Well Said.
