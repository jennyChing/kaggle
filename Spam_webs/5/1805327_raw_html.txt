    <p>
     The Capitol Steps began as a group of Senate
staffers who set out to satirize the very people
and places that employed them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group was born in December, 1981 when some staffers for 
Senator Charles Percy were planning entertainment for a Christmas party.  
Their first idea was to stage a nativity play, but in the whole Congress they 
couldn't find three wise men or a virgin.
So, they decided to dig into the 
headlines of the day, and they created song parodies &amp; skits which conveyed a 
special brand of satirical humor.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the years that
followed, many of the Steps ignored the
conventional wisdom ("Don't quit your day job!"),
and although not all of the current members of the
Steps are former Capitol Hill staffers, taken
together the performers have worked in a total of
eighteen Congressional offices and represent 62
years of collective House and Senate staff
experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since they began,
the Capitol Steps
have recorded over 30 albums, including their latest,
     <a href="/albums/">
      <em>
       Mock the Vote
      </em>
     </a>
     .
They've been featured on NBC, CBS, ABC, and PBS, and can
be heard twice a year on National Public Radio
stations nationwide during their
     <a href="/radio/">
      <i>
       Politics Takes a Holiday
      </i>
     </a>

     <h3>
      Brian  Ash
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     "Once more into the cow suit!" will be the title of Brian Ash's autobiography, since his career as a Capitol Step has often required that he wear one (on stage, that is).  It was all a logical extension of his bucolic childhood in Wisconsin where he was often seen wearing only a cheesehead.  Brian graduated from Brandeis University in 1987 and worked for an online database covering Congressional activities before deciding impersonating Dick Cheney was the correct career path for him.
    </p>
    <p>
     When not performing, Brian handles production details for all performances of the Capitol Steps from inside Capitol Steps World Headquarters. If you think it's fun to coordinate the flight plans of four touring casts in an election year...then maybe you should consider applying for his position.  Big shout out to his wife Darlene, daughter Perrin, and dog Zoe.
    </p>
    <a name="Bell">
     <h3>
      Jon Bell
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     Jon Bell is proud to live in a country where every schoolchild is told he can someday grow up to impersonate the nation's first African-American President in a comedy show.  After all, his background has prepared him for anything. He's performed all over the Washington area in shows such as
     <i>
      Dreamgirls, Crazy for You, Sugar, Finian's Rainbow
     </i>
     , and
     <i>
      Jesus Christ, Superstar
     </i>
     .  He's been Bernardo in
     <i>
      West Side Story
     </i>
     , an educational body puppet, a troll, a pig, Aladdin, a priest, a King, a hare, a giant, and a baby bear. Jon was a lead singer for several seasons at Busch Gardens (not to be confused with George Bush Gardens, which doesn't exist!) and you might have seen him as "screaming fan" in a national Pepsi commercial. Or not. Either way, he's very, very, very, very excited to be in the Steps!

     <h3>
      Bari  Biern
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     Bari Biern has been Stepping since 1993 and has appeared in several Capitol Steps off-Broadway runs. A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Bari has done both feature and training films, narrated audiobooks, reviewed theatre/films for WAMU-FM and freelanced as an off-camera announcer for C-SPAN. You may recall her breathtaking interpretation the announcement, "The Senate will now stand in recess for party lunches." Fans of the video game
     <em>
      Star Trek: Legacy
     </em>
     will recognize Bari as the voice of T'Uerell, the evil Vulcan scientist. She is a two-time Helen Hayes Award nominee as a playwright/lyricist and also writes opera librettos. She's had five successful productions in DC and Philadelphia, including a recent sold-out run of her English adaptation of
     <em>
      Abduction from the Seraglio
     </em>
     , in which she shifted the story from 18th century Turkey to 19th century Texas. Yee-hah! Someday, Bari hopes to create an opera with a living composer, but she adores collaborating with Mozart, who loves everything she does and never asks for a rewrite!

      Howard  Breitbart
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     Following a brief stint as Arnold Schwarzenegger's body double (this was back when Arnold was in shape), Howard joined the Capitol Steps as staff disciplinarian and pianist.  During his tenure with the Steps, he has become particularly adept at laughing heartily at routines he has heard hundreds of times, and, even more spectacularly, not falling asleep during the spoken bits.  He is currently working on a book entitled
     <i>
      Gyms of Small Town America
     </i>
     based on his travels with the Steps. Oh and by the way, he has also been musical director/pianist for Washington, D.C. productions of
     <i>
      The Last Five Years, Closer Than Ever, Romance, Romance, A Broadway Christmas Carol
     </i>
     and dozens of concerts for the Smithsonian Institution and Everyman Theater in Baltimore.

     <h3>
      Mike  Carruthers
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     Mike, or "Mr. Carruthers, sir" as he's known to his friends, was spawned in Detroit and schooled at the Univ. of Maryland in Law Enforcement. He then took the next logical step in any civil force career, and dabbled in musical theatre, also calling on his years of classical training at the "Ivan Bedenov Institute of Russian Ballet." A frustrated dancer turned frustrated actor, he performed many national tours, as well as
     <em>
      Hysterium
     </em>
     opposite Nipsey Russel in
     <em>
      A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum
     </em>
     , at Harrah's in Atlantic City. Other favorite roles include "Tilford the Slug" in
     <em>
      PUPA! The Metamorphosis Musical!
     </em>
     and in Fats Wallers' lesser known musical,
     <em>
      Actually, I AM Misbehavin'
     </em>
     . At home, Mike relaxes by staring at bricks and mumbling quietly to himself.

    </a>
    <p>
     Evan Casey is happy to be a member of the Capitol Steps. Of course, he's also happy for a nice nap, a news segment that involves puppies, and any good anti-itch cream. In addition to giving himself back-handed compliments, he is a surprisingly good actor. You may have seen his halfway-decent work at such DC-area theatres as The Kennedy Center, Ford's Theatre, The Shakespeare Theatre Company, Signature Theatre, Round House Theatre, and Olney Theatre Center, among others. What's that? No, you haven't? Well perhaps you've seen him in your own living room on such successful TV programs as TruTV's
     <i>
      Missing Persons Unit
     </i>
     ? Nothing? OK, back to the impressive stuff  he is a graduate of Catholic University, a certified personal trainer, a Helen Hayes Award nominee, and he is skilled in stage combat, which is definitely useful when traveling with the Steps.

&lt;p&gt; 
Andy joined the Steps in 1996, and has spent many years trying to keep his frightening portrayal of President George W. Bush from rubbing off in real life. He appeared Off-Broadway in the Steps productions of &lt;i&gt;Unzippin' My Doo-Dah&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;It Ain't Over 'Til the First Lady Sings&lt;/i&gt;, for which he was described as "ready for prime-time" by &lt;i&gt;Variety&lt;/i&gt; magazine. Previous roles include Tony Whitcomb in The Kennedy Center's &lt;i&gt;Shear Madness&lt;/i&gt;, Young Scrooge in &lt;i&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/i&gt; (Ford's Theatre), John Proctor in &lt;i&gt;The Crucible&lt;/i&gt; (Patuxent Theatre), and Arnold Epstein in &lt;i&gt;Biloxi Blues&lt;/i&gt; (Petrucci's Main Street Theatre). Andy holds a Fine Arts degree in Acting from Catholic University and began his career on tour with the National Players.  If you watch the Discovery Channel, you've most likely heard his voice on many of their documentaries and specials.  And if you watch the Sci-Fi Channel, you might see him running from something terrifying.

     Jenny Corbett moved to DC from Chicago, where she studied improv and comedy at the Players Workshop of The Second City and did endless children's theatre productions, including  but not limited to  every single fairytale known to humanity. DC has given her the privilege of working as an actor and a teaching artist with several local theatres such as Rorschach Theatre, Round House Theatre, Imagination Stage, Cherry Red Productions, Alden Theatre and Madcap Players. Jenny currently makes an uproarious living mocking our political leaders (and stupid people in general) in the Capitol Steps.

      Kevin  Corbett
     </h3>
    </a>
    <p>
     Kevin is a performer with a considerable reputation around the Washington, DC area.  Despite that reputation, the Capitol Steps hired him anyway.  His uncanny abilities, expert comic timing, and knack for impersonation were a perfect fit for Capitol Steps (it should be noted that Kevin humbly wrote this bio).  He began his career performing in a variety of theatrical productions (
     <em>
      Wait Until Dark
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      Forever Plaid
     </em>
     ) and films (nothing you would have seen).  He loved performing in comedies (
     <em>
      Santaland Diaries
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      Complete Works of William Shakespeare  Abridged
     </em>
     ).  Joining Capitol Steps was his destiny.  Since 2000, he's been happily lampooning the people who try to run our country.  Kevin has also worked as a teacher of improvisation and physical comedy at DC area theatres.  He is a two-time Helen Hayes Awards watcher.  The love/wife of his life is Capitol Steps performer Jenny Corbett.  Together, they have two wonderful little comedians/children, Lucy and Malcolm.

     And, as if that weren't enough, she graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in Broadcast Journalism and boasts such skills as rollerblading, gymnastics, and ZFX flying.  All of which qualifies her very nicely for a career in the Capitol Steps.

     Corey Harris is one of the newest members of the Capitol Steps, despite the suggestion of many of his friends that he should pursue a movie career as Denzel Washington's better-looking younger brother. He completed his B.A. in Vocal Performance at Hampton University in 2004, and since then he has performed throughout the Washington DC area as well as Paramount Kings Dominion and Busch Gardens Europe, which is actually in Virginia. Corey is trained in Hapkido and Taekwondo, which is very useful whenever the cast is invited to an after-show buffet.

Anne received her Bachelor's and Master's in Vocal Performance from Temple University's College of Music. She began her career on Capitol Hill in 1981 working for Sen. Lawton Chiles (D-FL) on the Senate Committee on Aging(!), the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee(!), and the Senate Budget Committee (!) Anne retired herself temporarily from the Hill in 1995 and returned in 2007. Anne is the rare Capitol Step who has been able to cling with dignity to her day job.

     Attorney by day.  Performer by night.  No, that's not the plot of another failed NBC musical television series.  It's actually the real-life existence of Steps performer Yasir Latifi.  Yasir first perfected his Barack Obama impression with the Steps back in 2010, and took his job impersonating Obama so seriously that he actually went to law school so that his resume would resemble the President's.  Oddly, he was also playing Tiger Woods at the time but did not take up golf or inappropriate texting.  Throughout his time at the University of Virginia and at the University of North Carolina School of Law, Yasir kept his feet wet in the performing arts  be it a cappella singing, theatrical productions, or parody shows poking fun at the legal profession.  A former political consultant and fluent in Urdu, Yasir also has a deep knowledge of the internal politics of various countries.  Fortunately, he is able to suspend his insightful analysis of the facts and perform Capitol Steps songs anyway!

     A founding member of the Capitol Steps, Elaina has been with the group since 1981 (for those of you trying to figure out her age, she began as an ovum). Elaina worked for seven years on Capitol Hill as a Legislative Assistant to Senator Charles Percy and then, after his untimely defeat, for Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who was also defeated.  Although she has worked for two Republicans, Elaina considers herself an extreme moderate, and although she is married to a former Clinton appointee, she denies responsibility for having caused any of the scandals which later became song material.

He is a graduate of Howard University and the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, and before joining the Steps he was nominated for a Helen Hayes Award for his role in a children's show where he impersonated a snail.

     Richard Paul started hanging around with the Capitol Steps in 1982, about 45 minutes after they got started.  He joined the group in 1985, back before you had to, like, audition for a job.  At the time, he worked for the Senate Labor and Human Resources Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism, and was therefore able to brag of having the biggest and longest business card in Congress.  He performed all the great Capitol Steps roles of the early 1980's like ... oh, go check Wikipedia, they're all there.  Today he is an author (with a book coming out in early 2013) and a documentary producer and still manages to drag his geriatric butt over to Capitol Steps shows where he likes to regale the young wipper-snappers with stories of his glory days.  He still can't figure out where they all go when he does that.

Despite a resume which is quite impressive and includes performing at the Kennedy Center, the White House, Signature Theater, Arena Stage, and Constitution Hall, as well as TV credits on "All My Children" and "Broetry," Matt joined the Capitol Steps in 2011.   During his first few months as a Step, he became famous for never dropping a line, even when he got a song on short notice.   It was rumored he once learned both a Barack Obama song and a Herman Cain song at the same time by simultaneously holding the lyrics, one in each hand, and looking at one with his right eye and one with his left.  Matt was a Capitol Hill reporter for Pacifica Radio from 2008-2010.  He has a degree in theater from Northwestern University and is also able to do a yoga headstand.  Which has not been incorporated into a Capitol Steps song...yet.
