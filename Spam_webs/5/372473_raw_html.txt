     <h3>
      Executive  Summary
     </h3>
     <p>
      This bulletin  examines the role of information technology, citizen journalists, and bloggers  in Burma  and presents a technical analysis of the abrupt shutdown of Internet  connectivity by the Burmese government on September 29, 2007, following its  violent crackdown on protesters there.  Completely cutting international Internet links is rare. Nepal, which severed all  international Internet connections when the King declared martial law in  February 2005, is the only other state to take such drastic action. Although  extreme, the measures taken by the Burmese government to limit citizens use of  the Internet during this crisis are consistent with previous OpenNet Initiative  (ONI) findings in Kyrgyzstan,  Belarus, and Tajikistan,  where authorities controlled access to communication technologies as a way to  limit social mobilization around key political events. What makes the Burmese junta stand out,  however, is its apparent goal of also preventing information from reaching a  wider international audience.
     </p>
     <p>
      The shutdown of  Internet connectivity was precipitated by its use by citizens to send  photographs, updates and videos that documented the violent suppression of  protests in Burma,  information that contributed to widespread international condemnation of the  Burmese military rulers gross violations of human rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      We examine the  impact of communication technology in shaping these key political events in Burma, the  limitations of these tools, and the prospects for the next round of information  wars.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Introduction
     </h3>
     <p>
      A sudden sharp  increase in fuel prices in Burma  precipitated rallies in Rangoon  on August 19, 2007. Burmese spend up to  70 percent of their monthly income on food alone,
      <a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1" title="">
       (1)
      </a>
      making the fuel price hikes amidst chronic inflation untenable. Over the next  month, leadership of the protests passed from former student leaders and a  number of female activists to Buddhist monks,
      <a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
       (2)
      </a>
      with participation swelling to an estimated crowd of 100,000 protesters on  September 23. Throughout the crisis, citizen journalists and bloggers continued  to feed raw, graphic footage and witness accounts to the outside world via the  Internet, even through the first days of a violent crackdown beginning on  September 26 that left up to 200 dead.
      <a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3" name="_ftnref3" title="">
       (3)
      </a>
      These citizen journalists have been described invariably as tech-savvy  university students and youth.
      <a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4" name="_ftnref4" title="">
       (4)
      </a>
      However, through  trusted-contact blogging, multiple generations of Burmese became involved in  circulating valuable information not obtainable by traditional means to the  rest of the world. Photographs and videos taken with cell phones and digital  cameras were dispatched outside the country by way of the Internet and  assembled into a patchwork of powerful images.
     </p>
     <p>
      On September 29,  2007, the Burmese military junta, governing as the State Peace and Development  Council (SPDC), raised the stakes of this information warfare by employing a  tactic much cruder and more drastic than a firewall. The SPDC made use of its  complete control over the countrys Internet gateways to shut down Internet  access altogether, and reportedly terminated the majority of cell phone  services.
      <a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5" name="_ftnref5" title="">
       (5)
      </a>
      It has yet to  publicly acknowledge these acts. This was the governments attempt to  immobilize and disarm the essential communication tools used by citizen  journalists: cell phones and the Internet.
     </p>
     <p>
      This bulletin  presents the results of ONI monitoring research as well as a technical  investigation into the role of bloggers and the Internet during the saffron  revolution and the ensuing violent crackdown in Burma in September and October  2007.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Internet, and  correspondingly, information technology, has been credited as the  transformative platform that sets the saffron revolution apart from the  8.8.88 movement. In 1988, a student-led democratic movement was met with a  brutal crackdown in which 3,000 Burmese were killed.
      <a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6" name="_ftnref6" title="">
       (6)
      </a>
      However, in the recent events of 2007, a  relatively small group of Burmese citizens achieved a disproportionate impact  on the global awareness and understanding of this current crisis, despite operating  in a very limited online space where information is severely controlled. As a  result, the extraordinary applications of technology over the past few months  have quickly become a target for expanded government surveillance,
      <a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7" name="_ftnref7" title="">
       (7)
      </a>
      so that future  protests may take place in a much more constrained context.

     <h3>
      Internet in Burma
     </h3>
     <p>
      People from Burma are  always asking for information as well as requesting for help and assistance  from [the] outside world but very little of their voices reach the world and  most are lost in the endless state of the government vacuum.  Burmese blogger
     </p>
     <p>
      By the time the  protests began, the SPDC had already established one of the worlds most  restrictive systems of information control, and had been extending its reach  into the Internet despite less than 1 percent of the population having online  access.
      <a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8" name="_ftnref8" title="">
       (8)
      </a>
      ONI testing conducted  in late 2006 demonstrated that the two Burmese Internet service providers  (ISPs), Myanmar Posts and Telecom (MPT) and BaganNet/Myanmar Teleport (formerly  Bagan Cybertech), filtered extensively. They focused overwhelmingly on  independent media, political reform, and human rights sites relating to  domestic issues.
      <a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9" name="_ftnref9" title="">
       (9)
      </a>
      This confirms  filtering trends first documented by ONI in 2005, finding that the state  heavily filters political opposition sites, human rights organizations, and  e-mail service providers.
      <a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10" name="_ftnref10" title="">
       (10)
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Until it shut down  Internet access on September 29, the Burmese government did not take an  entirely systematic approach to filtering. Of the sites found to be blocked, less  than a third were blocked on both ISPs. The remaining blocked sites were  blocked on one ISP or the other, but not both.
      <a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11" name="_ftnref11" title="">
       (11)
      </a>
      Other significant  variations among the ISPs, including the inconsistent blocking of pornography  and gambling sites, suggested that distinct filtering methods were being used.
     </p>
     <h3>
      Crackdown on  Internet use continues
     </h3>
     <p>
      The effort to bring  the Internet under tight control intensified in the past few months and  culminated in the complete shutdown of access on September 29. Intermittent  blackouts in Internet and telephone access were reported in August amid  mounting arrests of fuel hike protesters and increased harassment of  journalists.
      <a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12" name="_ftnref12" title="">
       (12)
      </a>
      However, because it  was focused mainly on constricting incoming political information from  overseas, the government was unprepared for the outflow of information over the  Internet.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the shutdown,  outside observers were likely to have more information related to the  developing situation than people inside Burma.
      <a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13" name="_ftnref13" title="">
       (13)
      </a>
      According to one blogger based in Burma, the local news was  unreliable and a bit biased, while rumors were widespread and became a source  of confusion.
      <a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14" name="_ftnref14" title="">
       (14)
      </a>
      Unsurprisingly, even  non-political or personal blogs have been stalled by the Internet shutdown and  the additional filtering enacted by the government.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the  shutdown of the Internet, the number of sites being filtered had increased,  including YouTube and Blogspot,
      <a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15" name="_ftnref15" title="">
       (15)
      </a>
      which were both  available (along with all search engines) at time of testing in late 2006. On  October 11, 2007, during a break in the regulated outages, an Internet user in Rangoon reported that  many international news sites were blocked, including CNN and Reuters. As of  late 2006, Radio Free Asia and OhmyNews were the only international news sites  blocked by both BaganNet and MPT. However, many of the major overseas news  sites gathering the stream of images and updates as the protests escalated,  including Mizzima News (
      <a href="http://www.mizzima.com" title="www.mizzima.com">
       www.mizzima.com

      ), the Democratic Voice of Burma  (
      <a href="http://www.dvb.no" title="www.dvb.no">

      ), and Irawaddy (
      <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org" title="www.irrawaddy.org">
       www.irrawaddy.org
      </a>
      ) have been blocked since at least  2005.
      <a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" name="_ftnref16" title="">
       (16)
      </a>
      Both ISPs block many  other independent news sites focusing on Burmese issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to ONI  sources, Internet cafs in Rangoon  were open on October 11 but speeds were slow. Internet speed, controlled with  proxy caching servers,
      <a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17" name="_ftnref17" title="">
       (17)
      </a>
      had been slowed down  to 256 Kbps, likely to prevent or diminish the uploading of videos and photos.

      The government is  just beginning to investigate Internet users who were involved in political  activities and transferring information to news agencies.
      <a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19" name="_ftnref19" title="">
       (19)
      </a>
      Along with Internet related services such as travel and Web sites, Internet  cafs are still being closed and their computers confiscated, with the  government claiming that they illegally used freedom software.
      <a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20" name="_ftnref20" title="">

      </a>
      According to another  source, UN offices and other organizations based in the Traders Hotel and the  Sakura tower in Rangoon  were raided by military forces, as many photos were taken from the height of  those buildings.

      In search of  free expression: the G-lite revolution
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Burmese  government has near-complete control over broadcast and print media. All  domestic radio and television stations are state-owned and controlled.
      <a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23" name="_ftnref23" title="">
       (23)
      </a>
      While more than 100  print publications are now privately-owned,
      <a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24" name="_ftnref24" title="">
       (24)
      </a>
      the Ministry of Information limits licensing to media outlets that agree to  print only approved material and submit to vigorous advance censorship by its  Press Scrutiny and Registration Division.
      <a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25" name="_ftnref25" title="">
       (25)
      </a>
      The Printers and Publishers Registration Law is prodigious in scope,  prohibiting the printing of anything detrimental to the state, any  descriptions which though factually correct, are unsuitable because of the time  or circumstances of their writing, and any criticism of a non-constructive  type of the work of government departments.
      <a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26" name="_ftnref26" title="">
       (26)
      </a>
      According to the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma, journalists seeking to write  about a government ministry must name their source and obtain a letter of  authorization from the ministry concerned before publication.
      <a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27" name="_ftnref27" title="">
       (27)
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Within this heavily controlled traditional media environment, the Internet has provided a limited  means for free expression. With an upper estimate of just under 300,000  Internet users in 2005,
      <a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28" name="_ftnref28" title="">
       (28)
      </a>
      Burma is one of  thirty countries that has less than 1 percent Internet penetration.
      <a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29" name="_ftnref29" title="">
       (29)
      </a>
      Nonetheless, the  Internet had begun to enhance a bi-directional flow information and  communication for many Burmese, especially the educated, urban elite. In recent  years, Burmese have begun receiving information from overseas via basic  Internet services such as blogs, chat, forums, and email. As a relatively cheap  communication tool, much of the value of Internet is based on the availability  of overseas Web sites and Internet services. These internationally hosted  services also offer a means to communicate more securely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most users access  the Internet at Internet cafs,
      <a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30" name="_ftnref30" title="">
       (30)
      </a>
      which have witnessed  an explosion of usage, especially in Rangoon.
      <a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31" name="_ftnref31" title="">
       (31)
      </a>
      Anecdotally, it  appears that nearly all Internet cafs have installed foreign-hosted proxy  sites or servers and other circumvention tools.
      <a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32" name="_ftnref32" title="">
       (32)
      </a>
      The G-lite revolution, one of the names for the incipient movement of citizen  journalists feeding information overseas, is coined after a proxy site for  accessing Gmail (glite.sayni.net) that is reportedly ubiquitous in Burmese  cyber cafs and resides on hundreds of servers inside Burma.
      <a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33" name="_ftnref33" title="">
       (33)
      </a>
      Citizen journalists  and bloggers were actively uploading images and updates in the approximately  200 Internet cafs still open in the days before the Internet was shut down  completely.
      <a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34" name="_ftnref34" title="">
       (34)
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      The G-lite  revolution depended on small-scale technologies in order for Burmese to be  able to circumvent the firewall and gain access to the most basic of Internet  services. ONI confirmed that both Burmese ISPs have blocked many of the more  prominent circumvention tools, including Proxify, Guardster, and Anonymizer.
      <a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35" name="_ftnref35" title="">
       (35)
      </a>
      Gmail, Yahoo! Mail,  Hushmail, and mail2web were blocked by both ISPs, while MPT took the precaution  of blocking thirteen additional e-mail sites, including Hotmail and Fastmail.
     </p>
     <h3>
      A growing  role for bloggers and citizen journalists
     </h3>
     <p>
      Nearly all Burmese  bloggers, both local and overseas, are users of Googles Blogspot. A  significant number of bloggers posted about the fuel hike protests, with lively  commentary and discussions. According to ONI sources, some political blogs have  been banned since mid-2007 and rumors circulated that the rest would be banned if  this trend continued, spurring many local bloggers to self-monitor their  postings in the hope that their blogs would not be added to the blacklist.
      <a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36" name="_ftnref36" title="">
       (36)
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      Until the Internet  shutdown on September 29, citizen journalists inside Burma maintained contact with overseas  bloggers through the use of email, chat, proxies, and free hosting pages.
      <a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37" name="_ftnref37" title="">
       (37)
      </a>
      These bloggers were  often organized in small networks of less than a dozen individuals, including  both local and overseas bloggers. Overseas Burmese bloggers sent back local  proxy server links and other tools via email and chats.
      <a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38" name="_ftnref38" title="">
       (38)
      </a>
      Through this form of trusted contact blogging, photos, updates and news links  were transmitted to an overseas web of Burmese who were able to post them to  the wider world.
     </p>
     <p>
      The profile of  Burmese bloggers varied considerably across locations, interests, and  experience. During the protests, a few new blogs emerged to become among the  most active of Burmese blogs, including ko-htike.blogspot.com,  myochitmyanmar.blogspot.com and drlunswe.blogspot.com. Other established blogs  previously serving as personal journals with a non-political focus turned their  attention to providing news and updates, including the Rangoon-based bloggers  Dathana (dathana.blogspot.com) and Dawn (

      ). Bloggers with  a dedicated focus to political issues, including Niknayman  (niknayman.blogspot.com), continue to update regularly.
     </p>
     <p>
      While those who  could use the Internet had access to blogs and overseas sites, most Burmese  continued to get their news from satellite TV (e.g. CAN) and overseas radio  broadcasts (e.g. BBC and VOA). The state mouthpiece, through television and  newspapers, directly addressed this fact when it blamed international news  organizations for the unrest, labeling foreign media as destructionists and  spies.

      Emerging  technical details of the Internet shutdown
     </h3>
     <p>
      On September 27 and  28, 2007, reports emerged that the Internet had been completely shut down in Burma. ONI  researchers have documented the details of the outage. Control over the  Internet in Burma is  facilitated by the fact that the only two ISPs in Burma are both state-controlled.  State-owned telecom Myanmar Posts and Telecom (MPT) is currently the only  source of new Internet services.
      <a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43" name="_ftnref43" title="">

     <p>
      - Shutdown times
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      ONI researchers were  able to determine the outage periods using router paths advertised by the  Autonomous Systems (AS) corresponding to these ISPs, recorded by Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP) monitors of the RIPE project.
      <a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44" name="_ftnref44" title="">
       (44)
      </a>
      The times reported here are in local Burma time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outage on MPT,  the main government ISP, can be divided in two phases. Phase 1 of the outage  was a complete shutdown from September 29 to October 4. The sole exception was  one brief period of connectivity on October 1 for 6 hours starting at 18:35.  Phase 2 consisted of a regulated outage lasting all day except during the  period between approximately 22:00 and 4:00 each night from October 4 through  October 12. On October 7, MPT had one extra period of connectivity from 9:40 to  15:37. In addition to Internet connectivity coinciding approximately with the  curfew period,
      <a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45" name="_ftnref45" title="">
       (45)
      </a>
      we see evidence,  from October 9 to October 12, that the Internet was also available from around  noon (starting anywhere between 11:00 and 13:00) until approximately 16:00 of  each day. As of noon on October 13, MPT appears to have resumed a stable  network with few changes in routing paths.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outage on  BaganNet follows a similar pattern, with Phase 1 comprising a complete shutdown  from 19:00 on September 29 until 22:24 on the evening of October 4, also with  one exception (discussed in the next paragraph). Phase 2 comprises a regulated  shutdown all day from October 4 until October 9, except during the curfew  period from 22:00 to 4:00. As BaganNets Internet connectivity is established  via MPT, it was also up from October 9 through October 12 during the  approximate curfew period as well as for a period starting between 12:00 and  13:30 for a few hours daily. Two long periods of connectivity thereafter, the  first from 22:00 on October 12 to 4:04 on the 13th and the second from 12:05 on  October 13 to 22:40 on the 15th, were followed by one long outage, from 20:40  on October 15 to 9:00 on the morning of October 16.
     </p>
     <p>
      - BaganNet users  get accidental connectivity
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      BaganNet, which  serves only civilian users and is the smaller of the two ISPs, peers with MPT  for international connectivity.
      <a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46" name="_ftnref46" title="">
       (46)
      </a>
      This gives MPT a  monitoring capability on BaganNet and explains the correspondence in outages.  However, a significant exception to this peering arrangement occurred during  the recent Internet outage; BaganNet border routers peered with ST Teleport Pte  Ltd, a Singapore-based telecom company, for a 6 hour period beginning  mid-morning on October 1, allowing BaganNet users to connect to the Internet  during that period even though MPT routers had been shut down for almost 36  hours by then. The ramifications of this accidental connectivity were perhaps  not lost on the Burmese authorities or BaganNet, which promptly shut down its  border router that same afternoon (by 16:15 on October 1).
     </p>
     <p>
      - Gradual shutdown
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      ONI also looked for  signs of how the infrastructure was turned off during these outages. The  Burmese Autonomous System (AS), which, like any other AS, is composed of  several hierarchies of routers and provides the Internet infrastructure  in-country. A switch off could therefore be conducted at the top by shutting off  the border router(s), or a bottom up approach could be followed by first  shutting down routers located a few hops deeper inside the AS.
     </p>
     <p>
      A high-level traffic  analysis of the logs of NTP (Network Time Protocol) servers indicates that the  border routers corresponding to the two ISPs were not turned off suddenly.  Rather, our analysis indicates that this was a gradual process: traffic fell to  14 percent of the previous weeks average on September 28, going down to 7  percent of the average on September 29 and zero traffic on September 30. This  matches with the BGP data coming from AS 9988 and AS 18399 belonging to MPT and  BaganNet respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      - Intranet  unaffected
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although certain  press reports indicated otherwise, the complete technical shutdown of both MPT and  BaganNet makes it highly unlikely that MPT was providing Internet connectivity  to military offices and high-level officials between September 29 and October  4.

      Some international  organizations and corporations continued to connect to the Internet via satellite,  though it is unclear whether the government also had satellite access.

      Perceptions  of surveillance

      identified the  opportunity for improved surveillance as the rationale behind the governments  policy originally limiting Internet access to the curfew hours of 21:00 and  5:00. Not only would the late hours allotted for access significantly reduce  the number of users (as most Burmese users do not have home access), but it  would also make the task of identifying targeted users easier for a government  without much experience in tracking and investigating Internet usage.  Government email services are also believed to be under surveillance, with  delays of up to 24 hours between the sending and receipt of emails.

      Surveillance methods  are more effective when there are fewer targets, and a possible strategy of the  Burmese regime may be to keep more people offline. The government appears to be  pursuing a combination of methods, including the limiting of access, increased  filtering, and intimidation and harassment.

      Information  Wars 2.0
     </h3>
     <p>
      Despite the lack of  sophistication displayed by the junta in shutting down the Internet, the recent  events in Burma  mark a pronounced escalation in the information wars between governments and  their critics. Burma  provides a rare example of a government also taking extreme measures to keep information  from escaping its borders. In pulling the plug on the Internet Burma became  only the second country to resort to such drastic action; in 2005 King  Gyanendra of Nepal  declared martial law and briefly shut down the Internet, along with international  telephone lines and cellular communication networks.
      <a href="#_ftn55" id="_ftnref55" name="_ftnref55" title="">
       (55)
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the mainstays  of the Burmese governments strategy for restricting information flows in Burma had been  Internet filtering, which prevented access to information offered up outside  the country. Websites and blogs are  easily blocked as they tend to occupy a distinct, persistent location on the  Internet. In this case, however, the junta attempted to sever the  bi-directional flow of information so that the picture of reality for people on  both sides of the Burmese border would remain distorted. As a result, the  targets for censorship expanded exponentially from Web sites that are critical  of the junta to any individual with a camera or cell phone and direct or  indirect access to the Internet. Moreover, the raw footage coming out of Burma provided  a striking narrative of the unfolding events, including some unforgivable and  unforgettable photos,
      <a href="#_ftn56" id="_ftnref56" name="_ftnref56" title="">
       (56)
      </a>
      from views of  cheering protesters and protective human chains to the fatal shooting of a  Japanese journalist caught on film. This was citizen media in its simplest  form, utilizing the cheap sensors and network that have helped to spawn the  information revolution without the need for additional editorial input or  elaborate post-production work.
      <a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57" name="_ftnref57" title="">
       (57)
      </a>
      This distributed  form of reporting is, in practical terms, impossible to block completely,  prompting the extreme measures taken by the Burmese regime.
     </p>
     <p>
      Burma joins the growing  list of countries that have increased Internet censorship in line with key  political events. This event-based filtering has been documented by the ONI during the March 2005 Kyrgyzstan parliamentary elections,

      continue,  bi-directional technologies are put to many uses. Reports are emerging about  information technology being used effectively to assist authorities in  identifying and targeting citizens. According to the Sunday Times, security  forces in Mandalay  used Chinese counter-terrorist technology to check the registrations of motorcycles  against numbers captured from digital images in the protests.

      While citizens were  capturing protests on video, so were security forces.
     </p>
     <p>
      The impacts and  reverberations of these events are now unfolding for those who engage in civil  disobedience as well as for those who seek to suppress dissent. Many Burmese  citizens who helped to document the uprising could be implicated by the  electronic footprints left behind, while others will remain anonymous by virtue  of the numerous existing holes in the Burmese surveillance network. It is not  difficult to envision increasingly tighter controls over the Internet and  communication infrastructure in Burma,  with the rapid deployment of additional surveillance tools, reinforced  filtering, and stronger policies to link all Internet-based communication with  real identification. Similarly, we may  expect a surge of analogous restrictions in other countries that harbor fears  and insecurities mirroring those displayed by the Burmese junta.
     </p>

      While the SPDC has  exacerbated its legacy of massive human rights violations through this  crackdown, many believe that the breakthrough uses of the Internet over this  period have enabled some irreversible gains. Multiple generations of Burmese  living locally and abroad have found linkages to each other as blogging became  increasingly recognized as a valuable source of information.
      <a href="#_ftn68" id="_ftnref68" name="_ftnref68" title="">
       (68)

      One Burmese leader  characterizes this gain as the forging of a link between the leaders of the  generation that participated in 8.8.88, many of whom were jailed or exiled,

      Burmese netizens,  operating in a constrained and challenging space in a country with especially  low Internet penetration rates, have demonstrated that the tools of information  technology can have a strong impact on the global coverage of events as they  are unfolding, and sometimes on the events themselves. The events in Burma also  provide a chilling example of the limitations of the Internet, access to which  was ultimately vulnerable to the unilateral choices of a repressive regime.  However, even the vast majority of Burmese without access to or knowledge of  the Internet may have benefited from the enduring achievement of a small band  of citizen bloggers and journaliststhe uploading of vital, relevant  information to the Internet was broadcast back in via television and radio and  spread through personal networks and communities throughout the country.
