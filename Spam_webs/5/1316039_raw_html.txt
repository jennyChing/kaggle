   STEVEN SPIELBERG PRESENTS FREAKAZOID!
  </a>
  <p>
  </p>
  <pre>
   Super-teen extraordinaire
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
Runs around in underwear
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
 
Rescues Washington D.C.
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
Unless something better's on TV
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
 
His brain's overloading
It has a chocolate coating
Textbook case for Sigmund Freud
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
 
Check out Dexter Douglas
Nerd computer ace
Went surfing on the internet
And was zapped to cyberspace
 
He turned into the Freakazoid
He's strong and super-quick
He drives the villains crazy
'Cause he's a lunatic
 
His home base is the Freakalair
Freakazoid! Fricassee!
Floyd the Barber cuts his hair
Freakazoid! Chimpanzee!
 
Rides around in the Freakmobile
Freakazoid! Freakazoo!
Hopes to make a movie deal
Freaka me! Freaka you!
 
He's here to save the nation
So stay tuned to this station
If not, we'll be unemployed
Freakazoid! Freakazoid!
Freakazoid!!!

  <pre>
   It's time for Freakazoid and friends
Where the insanity never ends
Justice he defends
You're sure to get the bends
From Freakazoid and friends!
 
When Dexter becomes Freakazoid, he shows his super stuff
He battles Lobe and Booger Beast and villains who are tough
Like Candle Jack and Cobra Queen
Cave Guy can be rough
There's Fanboy, Mo-Ron, Eye of Newt
And that's about enough!
 
It's Freakazoid and friends
It's what your dentist recommends
To patients who chew gum
This show is really dumb
It's Freakazoid and friends!
 
Meet Dexter's girlfriend, Steff
And his mentor, named MacStew
Lord Bravery and Fanboy
The Gnomes are quite a crew
Cosgrove and the Huntsman
Toby Danger too
And don't forget; there's Freakazette
A lovely shade of blue!
 
It's Freakazoid and friends
A show that no one comprehends
Our longevity depends
On our demographic trends
It's totally freaky
Dexter's geeky
The plots are weaky
We're up the creeky
We've sprung a leaky
Freakazoid and friends!
Now our song ends!

   intro

  </p>
  <pre>
   He feels no pain
He can fly quite fast
In feats of strength
He is unsurpassed
His grip is firm
Never quavery
Britannia's superhero
He's Lord Bravery.
Lord Bravery!
Lord Bravery!
Lord Bra - ver - y!!!

    ODE TO LEONARD NIMOY

  <pre>
   Leonard Nimoy, Leonard Nimoy
Dear Mister Spock, oh golly gee boy
It sure would make me smile and laugh
If I could have your autograph
If I don't get it, I'll be blue
But then I know what I will do
I'll call you up on the telephone
And bother you when you're at home
You hang up, the line goes dead
But then a new idea pops in my head
I'll visit you right where you live
I'll ring on the doorbell and ask if you'll give
That autograph I've been waiting for
You give it to me, and so much more

(BOOM!)

Oh thank you, thank you, Mister Spock
Now please call Bones; I need a doc.

   (sung by Longhorn unless otherwise indicated)

Jammin' gears and eatin' pie
In my big rig in the sky
Since the day I crashed into a banjo shop
 
(later)
 
Her name was Molinda
She'd be 56 today
But she fell out of my truck
On Highway 5 near San Jose
 
(later)
 
LH &amp; Turk : Take me out to the ball game
            Take me out to the crowd
Freakazoid: Bind me with rope and a sailor's knot
            Send me to jail where I'll sleep on a cot
            'Cause you broke, broke broke the law
            Off you go to the can
            For it's one, two, three years away
            I'll send you Spam!

    THE HUNTSMAN
   </a>
   intro
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <pre>
   Hunt, hunt, hunt
He's the Huntsman
"Into action" is his cry
From the forest to the city
He will run there in a jiffy
To sock evil in the eye
 
Marty Feeb was a poor hunter
Hungry without dough
'Til the day he saved a chunky elf
From being eaten by a crow
The elf rewarded Marty Feeb
With a magic sack of corn
He gained strength and speed and shiny teeth
And as the Huntsman was reborn
 
Hunt, hunt, hunt
He's the Huntsman
He'll whip the pants off the bad guys
If there's an emergency
Sound the Horn of Urgency
And summon the Huntsman
"Into action" is his cry!
Hunt.
