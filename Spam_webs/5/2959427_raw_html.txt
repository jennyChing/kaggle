      When I first started working in fair housing advocacy in January 2013, I had no idea the directional shift that was just ahead of me. My boss asked, based on my prior political experiences, if I would assist the Intermountain Fair Housing Council on behalf of the Boise refugee community. Not being sure of the details, I hesitated for more than a brief moment. Ultimately, I was unsure of her definition of outreach, which was being used quite often in the details of her vision. Choosing my own words carefully, I explained my understanding of the archetypal activist reaching out to poor people of color.
     </p>
     <p align="center" style="text-align: left">
      Ive always maintained that communities and individuals hold keys to their own liberation. The next step is collectivizing the efforts  to grab each others arms and pull towards the surface in harmony. Action becomes liberating, non-hierarchical, and generative effort if it begins by each individual acknowledging their own truths and positionality. Steps cannot be skipped for the sake of efficiency or urgency, as we see from the failures of the charity model, gift giver economy studies, and of course, intentionally constructed mass movements that further marginalize the same people they claim to be helping.
     </p>
     <p>
      It turned out that the job description was pretty straightforward. My task was to call all of the refugee families who had open cases and interview them for damages. I agreed to help, as it was the refugees themselves who were initiating the lawsuits. Everything seemed consensual, and I was more of a logistical facilitator for a service the families themselves were requesting. Even with my analysis of the justice system being what it is, I put my own politics aside. Of course taking landlords to court would not solve the housing crisis in Boise; but several thousand dollars in damages goes a long way when you have next to nothing, or have had everything taken from you. Winning these cases might never solve the whole problem, but it would help put food on the table.
     </p>
     <p>
      For months, I listened. My job was to listen to people talk about their experiences; to hear their difficult stories of resettlement. The situation, of course, is violent and grave. Many people described unfair evictions, neglectful practices, ableist programs, bigoted undertones, intentional segregation, mysterious debts, downright financial exploitation, and much more than can be included here. All of these issues became illuminated for me within the span of a few weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      My boss had been continuously asking me what I thought we should do, or if there were any ideas to take things a step further. If I was hearing needs, then I should feel welcome to give my input on fulfilling them. But the needs were constant and deep rooted in systemic neglect and exploitation. I was hearing needs  but not only was there no real way to take care of those needs, it didnt fit within my political analysis to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      After a bit of though, I presented an idea that was a bit more aligned with my understandings and politics. Rather than assume communities in need are not empowered to help solve their own situation, I prefer strategizing around amplification or provide assistance for pre-existing support structures. For example, as the child of an immigrant, I felt very aware that intra-community support was necessary for survival. There was no way that tearing down those networks or replacing them with more formalized solutions would be empowering for anyone. In its most damaging, that kind of organizing carries assimilationist tones, as well as structural resonance with the same oppressive dynamics we were seeking to combat.
     </p>
     <p>
      It didnt take long to pinpoint the existing networks of mutual aid that the refugees created and utilized on a daily basis. The fact that refugees were reaching out to the Fair Housing Council in the first place was as a result of word of mouth and mutual aid. When a family was in need, and receiving little to no assistance (or being severely abused) by the agencies, it was their neighbors vigilance that helped alert the necessary services. Often, a neighbor or relatives car helped a family to move, get to work, and go to the doctor  not the refugee agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mutual aid is currently, and always has been, the key to our survival. There would be no way to survive without voluntary association and the free exchange of goods, services, and care. My family (chosen and otherwise) is the reason I am alive. They are my mutually functioning community, we give freely to each other. But no structure is inherently liberated or liberating in this society.
     </p>
     <p>
      The scope of our mutually functioning communities has been strictly distilled and defined into idealized nuclear, heterosexual family units to serve the larger mechanisms of the state. Beyond these certain pre-set structures, all other services of survival are functionally determined by capital (i.e. the exchange of money for food and shelter). From the perspective of capitalism, our communities take care of all my needs for free, leaving my place of employment to simply exploit my labor without too much concern for how I am to survive otherwise.The exploitative nature of capitalism
      <i>
       depends
      </i>
      on our ability to help each other get by.In the case of Boises refugee community, families were left to fill in the gaps of left by a neglectful system. The system was able to continue exploiting them more efficiently because of the strong community bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is only through rhizomatic networks of care that direct support for the refugee community became possible. In short, the work of fulfilling needs was already being done. The question became:
      <i>
       how do we politicize these actions responsibly, with respect to these networks as authentic, endogenously generated solutions for massive failures on the part of the system?
      </i>
      By politicize, I mean make public and accessible; by responsibly, I mean without destroying their authenticity, integrity, and their original purpose, which is to serve direct needs through self-determination and voluntary association. The process of harnessing this power began with open forum meetings and months of coordination.But there are deeper questions, larger in scope, that appear once we figure out how to harness a communitys power.
     </p>
     <p>
      Can a mutual aid based relationship take care of a need that was previously only available by means of capital or the state  while also ensuring that the state is functionally deconstructed beyond repair?Building more family style collectives is a necessity, but cannot be the only solution. We must envision ways in which mutually beneficial relationships can disrupt the flow of capital or subvert the state, rather than just help us survive within violent structures. In the case of Boises refugees, is there any way to use a mutual aid network to radically shift the power away from the state-sponsored agencies, rather than just filling in the gaps of an exploitative relationship? With the
