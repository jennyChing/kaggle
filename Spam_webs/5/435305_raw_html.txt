  <meta content="Gardening can be a great way to relax and improve the air quality. You can even grow your own fruits and veggies and shrink your food expenses. However, the people who have gardens and back yard are outnumbered by the ones who live in small apartments. Indoor gardening can be a great solution to this problem. You live in a really tiny apartment and dont have enough space for containers and plants? Dont worry, we can solve this with these adorable tiny gardens! 1.Salt shaker terrarium - Terrariums are the latest craze among indoor gardeners. They are easy to make and easy to maintain. Even you  can make this micro ecosystem. All you need is a glass container with a lid or an old aquarium, gravel, soil, moss and plants. If you think this is too ordinary, you can use salt shakers. They are perfect for terrariums because they have holes on the lids that provide air circulation and keep your plants fresh. 2.Pocket watch garden - If you follow the fashion trends, youd know that its really popular to wear an old pocket watch as a necklace. If you want to be a fashionista and express your love for plants at the same time, this is the perfect choice. You can buy a cheap vintage-looking pocket watch, take out the clock parts and replace them with a succulent or moss. Its always gardening time somewhere! 3.Succulent birdhouse garden - As mentioned above, in-home gardening has a lot of benefits. However, some people cant seem to get the hang of it. Others just dont have the time to do it. If you are one of them, but still want to admire beautiful flowers, heres a solution for you. You can set up a birdhouse on your balcony and decorate it with plants. Even birds deserve to live under a green roof, right? 4.Kokedama - Now this is something exotic and different. Its called the poor mans bonsai and can be a great gardening solution for small apartments. You can place it on a ceramic tray or hang it on a thread. It looks amazing and you can grow almost any flower in these moss balls. You can even plant a bonsai tree! If you have a kokedama, all of your friends will want one too after they see yours. 5.Eggshell garden - This is an all-time favourite for organic gardeners! You can use eggshells as seed starters or cute containers. You can paint them in different colours and plant miniature flowers in them. When you get enough of them you can just plant them directly in the ground. Gardeners around Reading say that eggshells provide  much needed nutrients and calcium. How can you not love them? 6.Teacup garden - You have this beautiful china tea set, but its too old and some of the cups are chipped or cracked. You think of throwing it away, yet you dont have the heart to do it.  Heres a great idea how to use them - as plant containers. You can plant succulents or other flowers in them, or start your own indoor herb garden. Just be careful when you make drainage holes. You dont want to break your new pots, right? 7.Thimble garden - This might seem impossible to do but believe me, its not. Thimbles protect your fingers when you sew but they can also be used for gardening. You can use them as planters or as tiny succulent containers. They can be a great decoration for miniature fairy gardens or you can just place them next to a window with southern exposure. This will make it look like some thumbnail-sized people have their own garden in your home. 8.Snail shells garden - You can forget about buying expensive and boring ceramic pots. You can stroll at the park and find a lot of empty snail shells. You can use them as tiny plant containers. Paint them with nail polish ot just add a little shine with a clear top coat nail polish. They will look like they came straight out of a fairy tale or some distant magical land. 9.Wine cork garden - Wine corks can be used for a lot of DIY projects. One of them can be for gardening. Yes, thats right. Make holes in them, fill them with soil and plant tiny succulents. You can attach them to a board and hang them on your wall like a painting.  Next time someone says you drink too much wine, you can tell them that youre starting a garden. Oh, and you can use the empty wine bottles as vases." property="og:description"/>

        Our current subject is 24 Hours In and the goal is to use your photos to create a story that expresses the theme of 24 hours spent...somewhere! Stories could be about taking a short trip, a visual diary of a day-in-the-life, a mini city-guide to somewhere youve travelled, or your own interpretation of the theme.
