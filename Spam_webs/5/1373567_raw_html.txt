          Entrance to the Non-Revenue Containment Area at So Paulos international airport

          4:15pm
         </strong>
          Arrive at So Paulos international airport for your 11:55pm flight to Miami. The standby list opens four hours before departure time and you get there seven hours early so you can be #1, having learned the hard way. Its a Thursday and youve left work early, hoping to beat the weekend rush. And you are #1 for your departure time  theoretically  , but youre really #6, behind five people who didnt make the morning flight.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4:20pm
         </strong>
          Easy conversation starts to flow between you and your fellow non-revs (i.e. relatives and friends of airline employees whove paid a ridiculously reduced fare in order to fly on a space-available basis and are therefore non-revenue passengers), and you find out where theyre from (Cuiab, Goinia, Fortaleza) and how long theyve been waiting for a seat (48 hours, 24 hours, 16 hours).
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4:25pm
         </strong>
          A rowdy bunch from tropical beach town Recife pulls up six-deep, excited and, well, loud. Bless em, you all think. Theyre insane if they think theyll all get on the flight together. Everyone signs The List, securing their place according to arrival time, which will be used as a quasi-legally-binding document (because if you disrespect The List, thas yo
         <em>
          ass
         </em>
         ) once the standby list officially opens.

         <strong>
          4:30pm
         </strong>
          The Non-Rev Containment Area on the ground level of the airport quickly descends into chaos as flights from other parts of Brazil arrive, depositing eager, already-tired folks into the confined space with the low ceiling and the soul-sucking fluorescent lighting. The horror stories start to circulate: a woman and her son have been trying since Sunday to get to Paris. 25 seats were available on the last flight to Milan but no non-revs were boarded. Usually, its the Orlando flights that are booked solid; this is the worst Ive ever seen for Miami. Aw shit.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4:31pm
         </strong>
          Light-hearted, enjoyable conversations ensue about culture, prices, shopping (EVERYone was flying with an empty suitcase and one clean pair of draws), and seu portugus  timo, cara. Brazilians are hard-wired for unfailing affability and youll have 18 Facebook friend invites before you get outta there.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          6:53pm
         </strong>
          Word works its way through the Miami folks that the ominous-looking redhead who just arrived is an employee  The Employee  who will automatically have priority over everyone else, no matter how long theyve waited. Word is, shes also traveling with husband and teenager. She can smell the ire.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          6:55pm
         </strong>
          Haunches up, everyone queues (love that word) hastily next to their luggage, which has already been queuing silently for a few hours, and the Miami flight opens; 21 non-revs list for a flight with zero seats un-purchased, but that also isnt overbooked, so theres hope for a few. Hunger descends like a sledgehammer.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          7:25pm
         </strong>
          You follow #s 2 and 3 through the labyrinth of hallways in the employees only area of the airport to the Employees Only Snack Bar, which has a limited selection of eats priced at near-real world levels (though still one or two reals more than what youd pay at the corner snack stand). You flirt with a couple of the check-in agents who ask where you work. You laugh nervously, then walk away before they call sekurrity.
        </p>

A list is organized by the passengers, as its not the airlines responsibility, to keep things as civilized as possible; youre still #6.

          Shift #3 takes over and the manager gets yelled at by the disgruntled non-revs regarding last nights Orlando debacle. He tells some kind of lie about jumpseats and whatnot, but he says it so commandingly, people believe him. You, of course, dont and yell Im somebodys son, too!

          Listed #3. No sign of The Employee, though two random old ladies try to Bogart their way up to the front, talkin bout they stayed at the airport for the last three days. Yet no one from the last day seems to remember these people, lyin-ass old ladies.

          You and the thick-accented gacho businessman go for some McDonalds: youre craving meat and its the cheapest thing in the airport, after the Employees Only Snack Bar. You bond over crazy regional accents in Brazil and the States, him teaching you a few gauchisms and you teaching him how to say Pahk yo kah aht in na yahd the way you say it in Nawf Flah-da.

          A few people make the Milan flight, but theres shade because the dancing couple from Belm dont make it, though they were slated to. Something about people in the line behind them knowing someone who knows the captains cousins sisters best friends former roommate. Frowns all around.

          In a somewhat botched attempt to quell the swelling angst among the masses, one of the ground staff members says, basically, if a captain comes down and chooses his cousins sisters best friends former roommate over the 15 people ahead of her in line, she will indeed get to board and there is nothing you can do about it, bwa-ha-ha-haaaaaaaaaa!!!!!

          Saying goodbye to six or seven of your newly-minted friends does indeed suck, but all good things must come to an end; onward and upward, literally.

          You help the cool-ass couple from Cuiab change their rental car plans upon arrival at MIA, switching from Portuguese to English to Spanish and screwing it all up. They give you a ride to meet your peeps up in Fort Lauderdale. Thats what friends are for!
