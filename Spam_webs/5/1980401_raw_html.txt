      <p>
       <strong>
        It is likely no surprise to you that God has wired women and men differently.
       </strong>
       We all recognize some of these differences, but others often hide in plain sight. Shaunti Feldhahn, a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist, author and speaker recently wrote a fantastic book,
       <em>
        For Women Only: What You Need to Know About the Inner Lives of Men
       </em>
       . In it, she recounts the surprising truths she learned about men after interviewing more than one thousand of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not long ago, I had the opportunity to interview Shaunti for our radio broadcast, HomeWord with Jim Burns. In our discussion,
       <strong>
        we spoke about ten things guys wish women knew about men.
       </strong>
       I think youll find these ten things fascinating! Even more, I believe that in understanding these issues, youll be equipped to lead your marriage to a better place!
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men would rather feel unloved than inadequate and disrespected.
        </strong>
        Husbands need to know that their wives respect them both privately and publicly. Men thrive when they know that their wives trust them, admire them and believe in them. Shaunti Feldhahns research indicated that men would rather sense the loss of loving feelings from their wives than to be disrespected by them.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         A mans anger is often a response to feeling disrespected by his wife.
        </strong>
        When a husband becomes angry with his wife, he may not come out and say, Youre disrespecting me! But, there is a good likelihood that he is feeling stung by something his wife has done which he considers disrespectful and humiliating.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men are insecure.
        </strong>
        Men are afraid that they arent cutting it in life  not just at work, but at home, in their role as a husband. They may never vocalize this, but inwardly, they are secretly vulnerable. The antidote? Affirmation. To men, affirmation from their wives is everything! If they dont receive this affirmation from their wives, theyll seek it elsewhere. When they receive regular and genuine affirmation from their wives (not flattery, by the way), they become much more secure and confident in all areas of their lives.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men feel the burden of being the provider for their family.
        </strong>
        Intellectually, it doesnt matter how much or little a man makes, or whether or not his wife makes more or less money in her career. Men simply bear the emotional burden of providing for their family. Its not a burden theyve chosen to bear. Men are simply wired with this burden. As such, it is never far from their minds and can result in the feeling of being trapped. While wives cannot release their husbands from this burden, they can relieve it through a healthy dose of appreciation, encouragement and support.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men want more sex.
        </strong>
        Everyones natural response to this is probably, Duh! But, that response is probably for the wrong reason. We primarily assume that men want more sex with their wives due to their physical wiring (their needs). But, surprisingly, Shaunti Feldhahns research showed that the reason men want more sex is because of their strong need to be desired by their wives. Men simply need to be wanted. Regular, fulfilling sex is critical to a mans sense of feeling loved and desired.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Sex means more than sex.
        </strong>
        When men feel their wives desire them sexually, it has a profound effect on the rest of their lives. It gives them an increasing sense of confidence and well-being that carries over into every other area of his life. The flipside of this coin also carries a profoundly negative affect. When a husband feels rejected sexually, he not only feels his wife is rejecting him physically, but that she is somehow rejecting his life as a husband, provider and man. This is why making sex a priority in marriage is so incredibly important!
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men struggle with visual temptation.
        </strong>
        This means the vast majority of men respond to visual images when it comes to women. And, this doesnt just mean the guys with wandering eyes. Even the most godly husband cannot avoid noticing a woman who dresses in a way that draws attention to her body. Even if it is just a glance, these visual images are stored away in the male brain as a sort of visual rolodex that will reappear without any warning. Men can choose whether to dwell on these images and memories or dismiss them, but they cant control when these images appear.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men enjoy romance, but doubt their skills to be romantic.
        </strong>
        True, many men appear to be unromantic clods, but it doesnt mean that they want to be that way! Men want to be romantic, but they just doubt their ability to pull it off. They are plagued by internal hesitations, perceiving the risk of humiliation and failure as too high. Wives can do a great deal to increase their husbands confidence in their romantic skills through encouragement and redefining what romance looks like. For example, a wife may balk when her husband asks her to go along to the hardware store, but its likely that hes asking because he sees it as a time they can get away as a couple and hang out together. Whats not romantic about that?
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men care about their wifes appearance.
        </strong>
        This isnt saying that all men want their wives to look like the latest supermodel. What men really want is to know that their wives are making an effort to take care of themselves (and not letting themselves go) because it matters to them (the husbands!). Husbands appreciate the efforts their wives make to maintain their attractiveness.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Men want their wives to know how much they love them
        </strong>
        . This was the number one response of men. Men arent confident in their ability to express this, but they love their wives dearly. Men want to show how much they love their wives and long for them to understand this fact.

           The conversation is free, confidential and non-judgmental. You can keep talking to your mentor as long as you like and there is never a fee. Talking about ideas, decisions and fears is better than not talking about them.

           Hi Bustet, thanks for leaving a comment. You said #9 Men care about their wifes appearance. This isnt saying that all men want their wives to look like the latest supermodel. What men really want is to know that their wives are making an effort to take care of themselves (and not letting themselves go) because it matters to them (the husbands!). Husbands appreciate the efforts their wives make to maintain their attractiveness. Really hit home with you. However, it more or less backfired when you talked to your wife about it. I wonder if maybe it was the way that you spoke to her about the situation that offended her. Perhaps trying to approach her in a more gentle way about taking care of herself and her appearance may help. If it is a weight concern you might approach it more about living a healthy lifestyle instead of focusing on the appearance part of it. What do you think?

          <p>
           #9 really hits home with me. Taking care of ones self is so important (it goes for both men and women). The problem is,  if you tell a man to straighten up (get in better shape, dont be such a slob),  generally they acknowledge it and either do or dont comply.  Ask a woman to do this and your name is Mudd for eternity.  I know because Im living it.

           I agree that women need respect just as men do. Men dont have the rights to respect.

           Tre, there is an important aspect to Biblical submission we cannot overlook.
          </p>
          <p>
           First Corinthians 11:3 says Christ is  the head of man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ. In other words, the Father is the final authority in the Trinity. To understand this authority, we must understand the biblical idea of authority and submission. The word submitting, is translated and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. The submitting is a mutual submission, each person submitting to one another. It is the same heart motive as is found in Philippians 2:3-4, Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is the spirit of mutual submission. However, while that is the spirit every Christian is to have toward others, there are, nevertheless, roles that Christians are to play toward others, even while having that spirit. For example, the instruction to be subject to one another in Ephesians 5 is followed by a description of three sets of relationships: husband/wife, parent/child, and master/slave. Paul describes how a husband is to submit to his wife and how his wife is to submit to her husband; how the parents are to submit to their children and how their children are to submit to their parents; how a master is to submit to his slave, and how the slave is to submit to his master.
          </p>
          <p>
           The principle is laid down very clearly: in each relationship, the one in authority is to be submissive to the needs of the one under him, and the one under authority is to be submissive to the authority of the one over him. If this relationship exists, it results in peace, love, and harmony.
          </p>
          <p>
           Throughout the Bible, whenever authority is given to anyone, that authority is to be used for the good of the one under authority, whether it is government to citizens, elders to congregations, husbands to wives, parents to children or masters to slaves. God gives no one authority to do mischief.
          </p>

           I guess telling the truth is foreign. We cant even submit to Gods word so how can we ever submit to people. We are equal but in marriage in order for it to work A man must have headship over a woman. A woman must submit to her husband. When I wasnt a christian women use to run over me. When I got saved God showed me I am a man and I am called to be a leader. People just want the scripture to say what they want. A wife should never have authority over her husband. My mom is a Christian and she submits to her husband and she does not go over his head about anything. Unless its wrong but usually its not.

           Really, I hear you and feel your frustration about our men! It just pains me when people keep saying men are visual, I mean , are women blind??? I get to the point of complete frustration with churches, Bible studies and pastors always toting the men are visual  sound byte. It never seems to stop either, on You Tube, there are one video after another about this, and mostly coming from Christian pastors. It makes me really wonder about my faith, is God hearing me or just ignoring my frustrations with Christian men.
          </p>
          <p>
           Also the whole thing about respect, well women need the same equal respect, but the churches ignore this, thinking women are love junkies aching for love, not me! in fact I have gotten a lot of flack from church Bible study groups about womens needs, they really believe women are love sick puppies, always in need of a father like husband lording over them.
          </p>
          <p>
           They also think women dont need sex, and women are just there to  please their husband. Its so annoying, I never want to marry, I dont need some man telling le what to so 24/7. Unless a man can see me as a full adult, I mean a Christian man, I will look elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
           My self made friend, found a nice foreign man. He is proud of her, respects her as a full human adult, and hes from Kuwait. He doesnt lord over her, they have an equal relationship, they are happy, which I dont see coming from the Christian community. I have met her husband, and hes the nicest man ever, its a blessing to know him. I dont see real respect of women, coming from our churches, I dont see the men respecting us as adults, they view us as having minds of children.

           I wrote privately about a subject, but anyway, as a woman I find it annoying about men being the more visual gender. There are countless sites online that have debunked this notion. Its certainly not in the Bible. I have looked and to no avail have found anything about it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Im not even married yet, and certainty not to a Christian man, because I find many of them to be unable to view women as a full adult. They also hold on to these myths and stereotypes, more than secular men do, they are controlling and overly protective.
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont need anyone hovering over me, protecting me, guiding me like Im a child and telling me he has such a fragile ego, that he feels hurt that I work. My female cousin went to Iraq some years ago, and the Christian man I was seeing at the time, was constantly telling me women dont belong in the army. He said very disparaging things about women, anything to make a woman feel like a nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
           This thing about men needing respect more, well what about women? We would like the same respect, not just the old fashioned inane nonsense about men  respecting women as the  weaker sex. not just physically , but our men seem to think we are different and inferior in every way possible.
          </p>
          <p>
           Christianity has been plagued by gender stereotypes for years. Its really time for our churches to view all people as individuals , because God does.

           Amarie, I hear what you are saying about your marriage and sadly it is true in many instances. Ephesians 5 teaches us that in order to develop successful marriages or friendships, both must love sacrificially. A marriage that grows out of selfishness or dependency will die as soon as the other person tires of the lopsided arrangement. But two individuals committed to giving without expecting anything in return will develop a mutually beneficial marriage. They serve one another gladly, valuing the others desires and needs above personal wants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Only by modeling Christ in our life can we truly commit to a mates spiritual growth. As we practice Biblical principles, we will be able to encourage our mate to pray and meditate on the Word of God. The commitment to love, forgive, and motivate him results in a wise and joyous marriage.  That honors God and satisfies your innermost needs and desires.

           Amarie. .Jesus put all men as equal. Men and women are equal in Gods eyes. But even then God made men different  than women. While women are more sensitive and focus on family, relationships, love and security
           <br/>
           , men are more focus on job, and respect. Its true that men are more selfish and think about themselves more but God made men and women for purpose. We can learn from each other and make unity in one in marriage.

           While there is some good advice in this article, I dont care for how its implied that everything is up to the woman so thean doesnt act out.  This article should be addressed to men, not women.  I personally doubt at this point in my life (Im 35, married, 2 children) that men are truly capable of real love.  They are too selfish.  Yes, Ive been cheated on and he dated while I was pregnant and worse.  Unfortunately it has colored how I think of all men, and I really dont like men at all
           <br/>
           Of course men will read this comment and think the worst of me
           <br/>
           But no. I take care of how I look. Im Lind and patient. If ever I wasnt married, I would never want anything to Dowith men again.  In fact, Im quite sure I would sadly get great pleasure in rejecting them.

           I have read the book and can see it all makes sense, its pretty much a guide to what men want and feel generally.
           <br/>
           BUT I cant move past this visual ogling nature thing men have. I feel in competition with other females now and my marriage happiness level for me has gone from 10/10 to 2/10.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am utterly miserable now that I notice who my husband is drawn to and I dont look like them. My confidence especially sexually has bottomed out and he misses the wife he had. Sadly the truth doesnt always help and this part could have been left out. In fact the author in the first book cried about this a lot and one finally accepted the horrible truth about her husband THEN removed her experience from the later edition as I can imagine its caused some problems. What to do? Ive prayed about it, tried to be reasonable and objective but romantic and erotic love can be diminished easily and when its gone its so missed.

           Hi Really, (Not your real name I know)  I can sort of understand where you are coming from as it appears that you have recently been let down in your own relationship. You know, I do believe that there is a definite satanic attack on marriage in general and Christian marriage in particular. It is obviously not what our creator God intended when He instituted marriage and said it was good.  I believe that the media, new, very liberal laws and the whole idea of everything being relative and that there are no longer norms which have been accepted for generations as good for stabilising society, are the main ways that this rapid fall in so many standards has come about and right under our noses. My sincere wish and prayer is that we all come to our senses and realise what is going on and change. It begins with learning how to communicate and with the famous words so often used at weddings from 1 Corinthians 13.v 4  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
           <br/>
           8 Love never fails.  This is valuable counsel and wise advice for all men and women.

           Well guess what? Women look at men too and think thoughts like you men do. How do you men like that? If we feel love and appreciated our eyes wouldnt wander but you men are so selfish and only care about your desires that you go out and cheat on a loving wife. Well guess what else? Women upgrade after leaving a cheating spouse and men downgrade and become slobs/alcoholics, etc. Women need respect and love and sex. Men just use it as an excuse to cheat.

           Leigha,
           <br/>
           Sounds like you are not only a wise woman but also very observant about the needs of others. Unfortunately, not everyone is wired that way so we need all the help we can get in articles such as this.
          </p>
          <p>
           You make a great point when you said that Being married and having kids together is not a free license to start ignoring your relationship, thats how you end up alone. Relationships take work, and when we get lazy they dont grow but fall apart instead. The key to any long, rewarding marriage is work, hard work and lots of it. Learning, listening, loving through the hard times.and its all worth it!(I can say that because we have been married 39 years and still going strong)

           Its sad that an article actually has to be written to tell women what they should be able to figure out on their own if they were paying attention. Of course men want the woman they care most about to respect them and not emasculate them, and of course they need emotional support from their partner and intimacy. Basically they want to be looked up to the same way most women desire their partner to put them on a pedestal and theres nothing wrong with that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Theres also nothing wrong with wanting your partner to take the time to look good (this goes for both men and women), it means they actually care about what you think. Its only a problem if they criticize when you dont look perfect and/or cant accept that sometimes you have your period and a stomach virus at the same time and look like death.
          </p>
          <p>
           Men dont express this stuff usually because society trains them not to, but common sense should tell women they want those things.
          </p>
          <p>
           My partner after many months of having been together expressed gratitude for the fact that while I will give advice in areas where he seems conflicted especially when he asks, I will ultimately support whatever life decisions he makes. I take care to never say things that could be perceived as emasculating and I absolutely respect him because he deserves it, why would I stay with someone who I cant trust or respect? And when you give these things, surprise surprise, it tends to be reciprocated as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           They basically just want the same things that most women do and while the blame ultimately Always lies with the cheater, when men and women do not regularly tend to their partners emotional and physical needs then they have helped create an environment in which cheating is more likely to occur. Being married and having kids together is not a free license to start ignoring your relationship, thats how you end up alone.

           The intimacy thing Im not sure I will be comfortable with. Im 22 and no man has touch my cookies but the idea of a guy touching me intimately or even kissing me creeps me out. Now Im not a lesbian  , i like guys and i know the birds and the bees but the idea just makes me feel highly uncomfortable.

           Interesting article, but what is more interesting to me is how men act out when their needs arent getting met, instead of dealing with them head-on with their wives. Perhaps if they did, there would be no need for this article. It is sad that men dont adequately communicate with their wives, but all seem to be saying the same things to an interviewer. Men regularly turn to porn when (a) they arent getting enough sex, (b) when they feel inadequate or insecure, (c) they feel disrespected, (d) they cant control their urges, and so on and so on.  In other words, there really is nothing wives can do about being disrespected in this way. I sometimes question whether men are really capable of real love, and what love really means to them. I highly doubt men would be so accepting of their wives if they behaved the way men often do.

           Hi Dana, I am saddened to read your response.  You must have had some very bad experiences in relationships to paint the whole gender in such a negative light.  I know there are guys who do not handle relationships well and there is a lot of aspects of our society that nurture selfish attitudes in both men and women rather than challenging us to set aside our own needs to serve the needs of those we love.  I love the way that the Bible encourages husbands to love their wives in the same self-sacrificing way that Jesus loved us and gave up His life for us.   I would invite you to talk to one of our online mentors and explore how Jesus can make a greater difference in relationships.  Just fill out the Mentor Request Form at
           <a href="http://powertochange.com/discover/talk-to-a-mentor" rel="nofollow">
            http://powertochange.com/discover/talk-to-a-mentor
           </a>
           and one of our mentors will get in touch with you be email.

           All this men described sound like wimps.  I am so sick and tired of articles about what men want and need to feed their wimpishly fragile egos.
          </p>
          <p>
           A real man stays faithful to his wife out of respect for himself. If hes worried about how his wife feels about him, he opens a dialog about it or seeks counseling.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are no real men out there anymore.  They are all selfish mamas boys who need their fragile egos stroked.
          </p>
          <p>
           No wonder women are cheating on their husbands and higher and higher rates.

           As a man Ive read this article and it is absolutely correct and hits the nail on the head. I was surprised to read the responses by women who essentially read it as a critique about them??? It was not. In fact it wasnt about wives, it was about what effects husbands. The statements about the value of respect to husbands are so important. I want to say thank you to the writer.
           <br/>
           In fact all 10 points hit the nail on the head. These things will never go out of date because they are not based on cultural values with change. They are almost biological.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the writer said, a woman doesnt have to be a super model, but everyone likes it when someone makes an effort for them, it makes people feel valued.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its not a competition  Well man want this, but look at all the things women go through!. You can never know what someone else goes through unless you are in their shoes, saying things like that is childish and spoilt.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you read these points from the point of view of a normal average Joe, you will walk away with something that will help you be a blessing to your marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you read these points as though they were a critique, you have disqualified yourself from learning anything from them.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you read these points as though they were some sort of an excuse for male misbehavior, you have missed the value of them as well because they are not those either, its telling wives HOW they can bless their husbands in a way their husbands can appreciate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Have you ever wondered why in the Bible it says women respect your husbands and husbands love your wives? And not the other way round? There is a reason. Women find it often easier to love than respect (they are not the same thing). Men find it easier to respect than love. Women need respect of course, but its love they need to feel. Whereas  just as this article points out, and NOT ITS CERTAINLY NOT OUTDATED! Men want love absolutely! But they need to feel the respect in a normal marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
           These things do not apply with abnormal personalities. It would be unfair to compare them to such.

           Hi Mia, you are right about the distorted concept of beauty that often pervades our society.  It can be very detrimental to young womens self-image and health as they try to fit that unrealistic mold.  It is good to hear that you have a man whose love goes much farther than skin deep.  I think the author here was not suggesting that women try to match that air-brushed perfection that finds its way into commercials and things but that she takes time to fix her hair, wear nice clothes and things like that.  I dont think that is an outdated idea but is true no matter what the time, place or culture.

           I found the article rather sexist and outdated.  Women have enough pressure being pregnant, going through child birth, dealing with major anatomical changes to their bodies, playing super mum, being super wife and then the stress of returning to work, without the added pressure of vanity.  Our bodies never return to what they were before motherhood, even with all the fad diets and exercise.  Yet having curves and a bit of extra weight means weve let ourselves go!  No wonder so many women are dealing with depression and eating disorders if the concept of beauty as discussed in this article is being supported.  Personally, I found becoming a mother was the most feminine, most beautiful time of my womanhood thus far-so does my otherhalf.  He loves me more now and accepts that my body has changed.  Thankfully he is an educated, contemporary Christian and not living in 1930.

           Actually Lilith, God did design us to be more compatible but we have chosen to go our own way and ignore His plans and purposes for our lives.  It would be nice if we could blame someone for the mess we are in but the blame all falls to us.  The wonderful thing is that God loves us so much that He has paid the ultimate price so that we could be healed of the brokenness and receive from Him the guidance we need to have healthy relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now as you pointed out, being a Christian doesnt guarantee a perfect marriage but again, the issue is not that God has let us down but that we have not followed His leading and guiding but instead have followed our own desires and priorities.  But when a husband and wife follow Jesus leading in their relationship amazing things happen that can only be explained by the work of God in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can have that for your life and your marriage.  God wants to create a beautiful love between you and your husband.  It is what you were made for and what your children need.  Let me encourage you to look to Him for help and healing.

           Marriage is sacrifice and laborousmostly for women.  Humans arent wired for monogamy at all. If we were, the divorce rate wouldnt be as high. In addition to that both men &amp; women have unrealistic expectations for the opposite sex. The only reason to ever marry is if you want children. If you do, then stay in the marriage until the kids are raised and out on their own.  My parents are divorcing after 43 years of marriage. It was initiated by my mother who was tired of being married. She was tired of waiting on, cleaning up after and babying a grown man.  I wanted to avoid this so I married much later in life to a man nothing like my father. After 3 years of marriage, he became just like my father. Now, Im stuck in a marriage in my forties with two young children. Ill be 60 before the youngest is old enough to fend for himself before I can leave.  My girlfriends my age whose children are out of the house have filed for divorce all citing that their too tired to take care of anyone anymore other than themselves, they want to make their own decisions and do what they want and when they want it without the incessant griping.  I think men &amp; women want control over their own lives and destinies. Being a christian does not exempt you from divorce. Christian divorce rates are as high as anyone elses. People live longer. They no longer live on farms where families labored together or died. Women have control over their lives instead of every aspect being controlled. People dont want to live the rest of their lives in misery and I dont blame them. Marriage is great for the people it works for and not so great for the people it doesnt. Divorce has leveled off. I think that people are reevaluating what they want out of life and many are chosing to go it single. Nothing wrong with that. Love doesnt last. Desire doesnt last. If marriage was gods design, then god should have designed us to be a lot more compatible. Women will never want sex as much as men  most of us get very little out of it and it is an obligation &amp; a chore. Major design flaw if you ask me. So again, unless you just feel the urge to reproduce, youre better off going it alone.

           Hi, Kate!
          </p>
          <p>
           I do see what you are saying, and I definitely agree, it would be easy to find excuses to give up and not keep working if one is looking for them. One of the absolute tragedies of our modern age is that people enter into marriages without true commitment, prepared to bail out as soon as things get tough.
          </p>
          <p>
           That being said, Ive worked a lot of years with domestic abuse survivors, many of whom are very dedicated to trying their best to make things work, even when their partner is clearly not even concerned with keeping up his end of the bargain. The covenant is between two people, and one person cant make it work alone. What is a woman to do when she discovers that her husband represented his belief in maintaining a commitment he had no intention of honoring in the first place? Where does one draw the line and say, This is no longer a marriage, this is a prison? I assure you, the most Christian and loving of partners have found themselves in this exact position, and no amount of counseling or turning the other cheek or finding the good in their partner would counteract the evil they were confronting. What are they to do in such a situation?
          </p>
          <p>
           I suppose my real point here is that a loving partner still has both a right and an obligation to hold her partner to the covenant they have committed to. I am far from suggesting jumping ship at the first difficulty  marriage is a challenge for the reasons you mentioned  we are all flawed and can fall from the highest ethical standards of behavior. Forgiveness and understanding is critical to all successful relationships. But I do think it is absolutely necessary for both partners to work together, and much in this article seems to encourage the female to be subservient and to tolerate unreasonable expectations which can easily escalate into abusive behavior. The best antidote to this, I believe, is for both partners to be clear about their needs, feelings, and hopes, and create a space where such discussions are safe and where nobody gets to dominate or to expect behavior from a partner that the partner hasnt agreed is to be expected. If a man, for instance, wants to be respected, he needs to have the courage to be honest about what respected means to him and to negotiate with his partner to an acceptable agreement about how that can be accomplished. For him to be able to demand respect as whatever he decides that means (i.e. he is angry because he feels disrespected, even if he doesnt say so), without communicating explicitly about it, is to invite abuse, and also stops the process of evolution in a relationship that leads to a deepening commitment over time.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope thats clear. I know commitment is commitment, and not to be set aside lightly, but commitment needs to proceed in both directions. I think the article encourages more of a one-sided commitment, where the woman has to accommodate while the man gets to have things the way he wants them. To suggest that men are too insecure to have the courage to talk about these difficult issues diminishes both the man and the potential of the relationship to grow. Women are insecure, too. It needs to flow both ways.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thanks for your interesting and insightful comments! I always look forward to hearing what you have to say.

           Hi Steve,
          </p>
          <p>
           Well said. I see your point.
          </p>

           I guess what comes to mind is that this article is about husbands and wives, a covenant relationship that is never meant to be broken. Marriage is, of course, the most intimate and intense relationship any human experiences, and given our fallen nature, it is therefore extremely challenging. This is by Gods design. His desire is not to make us comfortable, but to make us holy, in the image of His Son.
          </p>
          <p>
           If we are not careful, then it seems to me that by saying these suggestions support abusive behaviour, then we might easily provide an excuse for a woman who wants to leave her marriage. Do you see what I mean? She might say, See, my husbands actions are abusive! I have a reason to divorce him! So, then we flip from seeing these suggestions as excuses for husbands to behave as they desire, to providing excuses for wives to behave as they desire.
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont mean to confuse the issue, but the article repeatedly mentions husbands and wives. If a wife thinks to herself My husband is not looking at my inner beauty, etc., etc. and then comes to the conclusion I dont think a really healthy relationship is possible  she will have an excuse to leave the marriage, and that is not Gods desire.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are creatures, God has given us bodies and declared our bodies are good. Issues of sex, attraction, appearance, insecurity and so on are related to our bodies, and it is not within Hebrew thought to spiritualize these issues as though they were separate from our bodies. So I go back to what I said earlier, We dont see into the hearts of our partners, and we are all very prone to self-justification and rationalization  women are very prone to think, My husband should look inside for the beauty that is in me and thereby make excuses, rather than make changes. This article calls us to question ourselves in front of the Lord, and be willing to CHANGE as He leads, admitting we arent wisest of all.
          </p>
          <p>
           I admit I am finding it difficult to articulate what I want to say, so as a last attempt: We all are what we are by the grace of God. If I can look beyond my husbands blemishes and flaws, to see the man that God has called him to be, it is only by the grace of God. I am not wise apart from the insight the Lord grants me; I am not able to see into my husbands heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Christ,

           And yet Jesus was not all-accepting, even as he is all-forgiving. He was very hard on the moneylenders, and assured the rich they would have a hard time getting into heaven, and critiqued the Pharisees for their hypocrisy. I agree we must give freely and love even our enemies, but it doesnt mean we have to tolerate bad behavior out of a sense of sacrifice. Sometimes the most loving thing to do is caringly confront bad behavior and insist that the person involved look at the impact they are having on others. And sometimes the most loving thing to do is to walk away from a bad situation. If we model on Jesuss behavior, we can see that tough love was a part of his approach and we should not hesitate to use it. There is a difference between being loving and giving and allowing oneself to be controlled or owned by another.
          </p>
          <p>
           A couple of these suggestions definitely support abusive behavior. For instance, men want their wives to look good. This encourages women to believe that their appearance is of paramount importance, and if they dont look good enough, they are letting their man down. But what would Jesus say about that? I am sure he would suggest that we look inside for the beauty that is in us all. God loves us all, not just the good looking ones.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is important not to judge our partners, but we have a right to set some reasonable expectations of respectful treatment. For me, this includes no double standards. Were all Gods children and none of us is better than another. Without this shared belief, I dont think a really healthy relationship is possible.

           Hi Nic,
          </p>
          <p>
           You mentioned youd like to know where the author got his resources, and that was in the first paragraph. The information came from Shaunti Feldhahn, who wrote a book and did an interview on his radio broadcast, HomeWord with Jim Burns.
          </p>
          <p>
           I didnt see this list as characteristics, nor as excuses for men, but as a perspective meant to encourage couples. We dont see into the hearts of our partners, and we are all very prone to self-justification and rationalization, so perhaps there is something here for each of us to learn, just as we can now learn from what youve experienced. So, thank you very much for posting!
          </p>
          <p>
           One thing that caught my eye about your post was the last sentence: There is a mutual commitment to see the others needs as greater than ones own, and until we can get over this thought that one partner needs to give more into the relationship than the other, there will continue to be an imbalance. I find myself reflecting on our relationship with Jesus. We are nowhere near as committed to Him as He is to us and we in no way approach giving Him as much as He gives us  there is an utter imbalance!!! It is His character to give first, give freely, give grace, give His very life  what do you think this means for us?
          </p>
          <p>
           Many blessings,
          </p>

           Dear Susan,
          </p>
          <p>
           As I read what you posted, I felt pain, and I can only imagine how you must feel, especially deep down, and after what you went through with your ex.
          </p>
          <p>
           I wonder, why did you say: I know he wont stop looking at women, or looking at porn and I kind of get that? Do you feel you should accept it (that it is the right thing to do) or that you must accept it (because your husband is not interested in changing)?
          </p>
          <p>
           To tell you the truth, after reading your report a couple times through, I do get the sense that actually you both would like to change. Your husband would like to have eyes only for you, and you only for him. I think, (for myself I know), that is the intimacy we all crave. Its intimacy we can never, never get from porn, naked women, or being attractive to random men  and so all those things will ultimately only frustrate, never satisfy. But, when we keep trying to mix them, a little marriage, a little porn, everything ends up poisoned. What do you think the remedy could be?
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
           Many blessings to you, in Jesus name,
          </p>

           I would be very interested to know where this man got his resources.  I dated a man such as was described in this article, and it was the most wretched experience.  He was controlling (I couldnt go to a chick flick with a girl friend without his anger), physically harmful if I ever stood up for myself, and I did not feel safe around him.  He exemplified all of the above characteristics.  He couldnt stand it when I acted like an independent, capable human being; he couldnt tolerate my ability to live without him at my side every minute of every day; he interpreted my need for personal space (Im an introvert, not an extrovert) as a threat to his manhood; he couldnt understand why after months I still did not want the relationship to be as physical as he wanted it to be.  He was upset that I wouldnt cake makeup on my face ever, and often went without makeup entirely.  I got out of that relationship.
          </p>
          <p>
           Two years later, I started a relationship with the man I am with now.  He respects me; he respects my identity as a human first and a woman second; he thinks a womans natural appearance  the way God made her  is far more beautiful than any amount of changing this can be (including the shaving of legs).  He cares about me, and has promised me he will never try to move the relationship faster than I am comfortable with.  I respect him as a human being, but that in no way, shape, or form means that I will support every decision he makes.  And if hes acting stupidly in public or showing more PDA than I am comfortable with, I will tell him, and he appreciates that.  He wants rather have me know how much he cares about me and know that I care about him.  He would rather that I tell him honestly how I feel about something than try to massage his pride.  He may feel the same urges as are described above, but he has realized that there are more important things in his life.
          </p>
          <p>
           In conclusion, it has been my experience that guys who take the above descriptions as excuses for their behavior are not worth the time or energy they require.  They do not treat their wives/girlfriends well, and they are not Godly men.  Guys who, on the other hand, recognize those tendencies and do not make their needs the central focus of the relationship are much more pleasant, humble, and kind.  I recognize that I, as the female partner, have responsibilities as well, and that my needs are not first and foremost, as well as that this article was not written with the intent of males reading it.  However, I feel that this article goes too far in excusing male behavior.  Luke thought women were pretty cool, and very capable.  Paul also chose to honor women with significant leadership roles (Priscila), trusted them with some of the most dangerous work (Phoebe delivering and reading his letter to the Romans  a letter that would have to travel through very unfriendly crowds), and honored one (Junia) as an apostle (read the Greek on that one: it is clearly a female name, not the male that is too often translated into English).  Most of Jesus followers were female; in fact, Mary Magdalene is often referred to as the apostle to the apostles.  Paul even goes so far in 1 Corinthians 7:4 to say For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.  There is a mutual commitment to see the others needs as greater than ones own, and until we can get over this thought that one partner needs to give more into the relationship than the other, there will continue to be an imbalance.

           Hi,Susan,
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont think an interest in porn means you are not enough. A lot of happily married men view porn from time to time, and it has little or nothing to do with their partner. That doesnt mean it has to be OK with you  how you feel about it is important. But I would not view it as meaning you are somehow not meeting his needs. It meets a different kind of need.
          </p>
          <p>
           That being said, he sounds like he uses it a lot, and is being secretive about it, which does suggest a possible addictive problem. He needs to come clean about it and to listen to your feelings, and look at his own behavior and see if it is a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am more concerned about his attitde toward other men looking at you. If hes allowed scope out other women, why cant you appreciate other mens looks and attention? It seems like a double standard, and double standards are not a healthy sign.
          </p>
          <p>
           You might be interested in visiting my website, Jerkradar.org, and taking the Jerk Radar Quiz. He definitely is showing some signs of jerkiness, and you might want to take a look at his motivations. But by no means should you blame yourself if he has issues. Its not about whether youre good enough for him  the question is, is HE good enough for you?
          </p>
          <p>
           Hope that helps.
          </p>

           I have been married for 3 months, with my husband for 2+ years. He is a great man, and he treats me like a queen. However, he is always looking at porn and naked womenhe tells me once in awhile he does it but history on every electronic he owns shows its a daily occurance. We have fought about this because my ex was addicted to porn in a bad way, our relationship suffered and I lost all of my self esteem and self worth due to it. He tells me its not fair to lump him in to the same category but I am trying to get him to see how much it hurts me when hes staring at photos of what I am not or ever will be (3 kids later, I dont have that perfect body). He said that he just looks, doesnt get off over it. I dont understand it.
          </p>
          <p>
           He gets up in arms when we are out and guys are staring at me, or rubber neck (I am an attractive woman and look great (with clothes on lol). I have told him that for every woman he is busy checking out (hes not overly stealthy) that I am getting attention too. He just says believe me I know this, I see it happening more often than you do. Is he happy with what he has? It sucks that it makes me feel like I am not good enough. I know he wont stop looking at women, or looking at porn and I kind of get thatI just dont understand the need.

           @Sonia I understand it is very difficult to live in a relationship with someone who wants nothing to do with you. I have myself been in very difficult situations and if I try to fix the problem myself it was impossible however when I asked Christ to give me wisdom he does.  I understand that you must feel alone on an island with no one to support you however if you reach out by contacting a church and asking for help they would direct you to a support group which would give you insights into how to deal with the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           The longer you suffer in silence the more deeper the poison of deep hurts will fester which will result in an extreme sadness which seems to be endless. There is hope not through the relationship with another woman but with reaching out to others to pray for you to give you wisdom as it is impossible to deal with the situation you are in without outside help.  God Bless

           Hi, Sonia!
          </p>
          <p>
           I deal with domestic abuse victims professionally, and I can assure you, this man fits the profile of a domestic abuser to a tee. He is initially charming and makes a lot of promises, but once he has you under his control, it becomes clear that he will make all the rules and you will simply be expected to put up with whatever crap he deals out. Im so sorry you have to experience this, but youre smart to see it for what it is right now. He feels entitled to screw around and spend all night out and lie to you, just because he makes some money?
          </p>
          <p>
           Its hard to acknowledge youve been had, but thats what happened. I dont think any kind of counseling or tips will help you out with this one. I think you will either have to live with him as he is or look for a way to get out. I know how much that hurts, but the hurt will heal that way, but staying with him will mean hurt upon hurt for as long as youre together.
          </p>
          <p>
           You may want to look for some domestic abuse sites to post on. I strongly suggest Rhiannon3.net  its a healthy community. Meanwhile, Ill pray for you and I suggest you get yourself centered and seek some guidance from the Higher Power. This is a very hard situation and it will take time to sort it out, but be assured, you do not need or deserve to put up with this!
          </p>
          <p>
           And for Pat, I cant agree with your percentages, but I do agree, there are a lot of Jerky guys out there. I even wrote a book about how to tell them apart from the decent ones. Its called Jerk Radar. You should pick up a copy  it might help.
          </p>

           Hi everyone, I neva thought i would be on this forum. i married in january 2012. first few weeks it was fine,then one day he came home with lipstick on his face which he had not realised was there, he apologised and assured me it was nothing to worry; time passed.now he is secretive on his phone, he keeps it locked and makes sure i am neva around his phone; also switches it off as soon as i am near him when he is using it. i has found out of his lock code and saw messages of a womne which implied that they were seeing each other. i texted this women who denied that she had slept with himthis was a lie, his messages clearly said things which suggested they were **** buddies. he is constantly on his mobile with her. this women is in care field also dealing with women who have undergone domestic violence. she is a shame to all us females out there. i dont know what to do, as i write this he sleeps next to me and i am not allowed to touch him unless he feels he wants to. i want him to be trueful to me, be intimate to me but its been a while that i have even heard him say he loves me. i am in a very bad wat emotionally, i feel low, dont have a clue how to deal with this.
           <br/>
           according to him he is a provider and my only concern should be that and not petty isues like other women and his text msgs. we had an arguemnet today and he says he feels bad that i check on him and that he cannot spend nights out, i told him he could go to his friends but come back at night..it had reached to a point where he has told me next week on is day off, he will  not come home. at the age of 40yrs, i feel i havent strenghth left to deal with unfaithful men so i think my next may b lesbiasim too.

           Thanks, Steve, for your kind comment.  I have yet to meet a truly decent man.  Im at a point where Id be more likely to find a unicorn.  Its funny that you mention it, but I have seriously been considering lesbianism  the problem is that I have yet to meet a single one!  If I could find myself a good lesbian  I would never bother with a member of the male sex again.  Maybe not all men are pigs  just 99%.  Take care.

           Come now, Pat. We arent ALL pigs! I admit, there are a lot of jerky guys out there, but there are nice ones who care about their wives and families, too. Sounds like youve had some awful ones, though, and Im sorry to hear that. Men are definitely allowed to be jerks by our culture and get away with it in ways that women are not. Ive often wondered why there werent more lesbians out there
          </p>
          <p>
           Take care, and I hope you encounter some decent men. We really DO exist!

           Hi, Karen!
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember, this is a survey. It doesnt necessarily reflect anyones individual reality. And it is, of course, very much impacted by cultural beliefs, including that men are supposed to want sex more than women.
          </p>
          <p>
           Is he able to see that maybe he has some work to do in this area? Has he had some hurts historically that hes dealing with? Or is he getting stuck in a safe alternative like internet porn?
          </p>
          <p>
           The article above definitely makes a lot of assumptions about men and women and I think reinforces a lot of stereotypes that arent true for everyone. It sounds like you need more affection and to feel attractive to him, and he needs to understand that, just as the author claims that men need above. My biggest objection to the article is that women in general need the same things men do, if expressed at times differently. Your need to feel wanted is very important and not to be ignored. I hope you can find a way to talk to your husband about this and that he will take the time to listen and help figure out a solution.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hang in there!
          </p>

           Hi Karen,
          </p>
          <p>
           My heart goes out to you, just as the Lords heart goes out to you. As I read your words, I got a deep impression of the Lord gazing upon you, speaking to you:
          </p>
          <p>
           My child, fret not. I see everything and know your heart, and the heart of your husband. I havent led you astray, do not lose faith. Your desires for a godly, fulfilling marriage are pleasing to Me. I have so much in store for you both, please trust Me. Please turn to Me, please count on Me, please rest on My word, I am who I say I am and I will do what I say I will do. Faint not!
          </p>
          <p>
           Karen, I can definitely identify with how you feel. I felt very much the same if men want sex so bad, what is wrong with me??? I will recommend some books, but above all, know that God is already answering your prayers, just not in the way you probably think you want. Trust Him anyway. Look at the cross the disciples were praying for a Messiah and they got Him, but then everything seemed to go totally wrong. He was hung on a cross and buried. It was a HUGE BLOW to their expectations. They must have been thinking a lot of thoughts like what youre thinking  God, how could you let this happen this way? Hurt. Anger. Resentment. Disappointment. Devastation. You see, God is no stranger to our desires and our sufferings, He doesnt disdain them or tell us to try to detach from them but He does say: What you feel isnt all there is to it I have a plan. Trust Me. I have a plan. I will not fail you. I will not fail you. I will not fail you. And He wont. Stand on that, stand on Him EVERY time you feel yourself being dragged down.
          </p>
          <p>
           The psalm that comes to mind is Psalm 37. The books Id recommend are Alone in Marriage by Susie Larson, Love &amp; Respect: The Love She Most Desires, The Respect He Desperately Needs by Emerson Eggerichs and Sacred Marriage by Gary Thomas. If you have the heart or head for WONDERFUL, dense theology, then definitely Drawn to Freedom: Christian Faith Today in Conversation with the Heidelberg Catechism by Eberhard Busch (Author) and translated by William H. Rader. I adored the last book!
          </p>
          <p>
           Many blessings, lifting you and your husband up in my prayers,
          </p>

          <p>
           This is so hurtful to me. We are in our first year of marriagemy husband has a lower sex drive and every article, book, blog I read to learn how to be a good wife makes the assumption that I will not enjoy sex and need to submit in this area of our relationship. I need to feel wanted and desired and definitely dontthis has damaged my self esteem deeply and is hurting my relationship with my husband and I am praying for God to help me through the hurt, anger and resentment Ive been feeling bc I love my husband. I want to enjoy this part of our lives and have fun and be intimate and connected. Even more hurtful is the fact that men are visual and think about and fantasize about women other than their wivesI wish men had even a simple understanding of how deeply devasting this is to a wife.
