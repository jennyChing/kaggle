If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasas cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

Her clients come to her with an issue, a question, a mystery, and she figures out the best way to find the answer &ndash; using whatever tools she can. &ldquo;I use a combination of new technology and old technology, because I have to solve a problem. So I&rsquo;ve used everything from geese and dogs to Roombas to drones to GPS.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright is a private investigator &ndash; and owner of the Wright Group &ndash; based in Anaheim, California. She&rsquo;s worked in the business for more than 40 years, and has seen the tools available to investigators change dramatically. Early on, stakeouts in vans were important. More recently new technology in the form of tiny cameras and social media has begun to play a role. And she&rsquo;s embraced those changes. Today, when the problem calls for it, she uses drones to do her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gives me a few examples. If two people are meeting in a public place, a drone can be a helpful way to discreetly watch them. &ldquo;We stay at about 50-75 feet [15-23 metres] above so nothing can be heard.&rdquo; Drones are also helpful for aerial surveillance of locations that are hard to access on foot. And if a school or church is worried someone might be stealing or vandalising property, drones or small off-road vehicles (&ldquo;Roombas on steroids&rdquo; as she calls them) can film the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yhk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Wright was asked to figure out whether or not a soda salesperson was crossing county lines and cheating on his contract. California is one of many states in which salespeople have regional contracts &ndash; for instance, Bob sells Pepsi in Los Angeles County and Nancy sells Pepsi in Orange County. If Nancy arrives at her usual businesses to sell her Pepsi and finds the soda supply has already been topped up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that someone (perhaps Bob) has crossed county lines and sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-tech toys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright was asked to figure out whether this was happening. To do so meant visiting every major soda wholesaler from San Luis Obispo to San Diego &ndash; about 300 miles (480km) of California coast &ndash; and checking whether any were selling soda from the wrong salesperson. When there was illegal soda on sale, she would use a drone to follow the soda delivery trucks back to their depots. In one case, the warehouse the truck led her back to was out in the desert and would have been impossible to approach by car or foot without being noticed. But the drone was able to spy on the trucks covertly. &ldquo;We could see between the warehouse door and the truck loading.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright gets her drones from high-end toy stores, for about $200 each. They&rsquo;re an expensive investment: not only do you have to buy the device, you also have to pay one or two people to pilot and spot the thing. And if you lose one during a mission, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of your budget. But it can be worth it, because for the cases in which they&rsquo;re useful, they can be very useful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yh4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright doesn&rsquo;t pilot the drones herself. &ldquo;I try to hire gamers. I go to the colleges and high schools and I find out who the geeks are, and then I hire them.&rdquo; She said that her pilots are more skilled than she would ever be &ndash; and they like the challenge. Some of them are working towards their own private investigator licences, and their hours piloting the little devices can count as hours towards their certification. (None of Wright&rsquo;s gamer pilots were willing to talk for this article. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re introverts,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Not shy, but introverts.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the idea of using drones to spy on people isn&rsquo;t something everybody is comfortable with. &lt;a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/05/chs-x-files-capitol-hill-drone-pilot-spotted-glowing-orbs-phone-thief-on-wheels/\"&gt;In a case in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a woman reported that someone was using a drone to spy on her. &ldquo;This afternoon, a stranger set an aerial drone into flight over my yard and beside my house near Miller Playfield,&rdquo; she told the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog. &ldquo;I initially mistook its noisy buzzing for a weed-whacker on this warm spring day. After several minutes, I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away.&rdquo; Her husband asked the drone operator, who was standing nearby, to move along &ndash; but the operator claimed to be acting within his legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening regulations&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t always clear. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx\"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 35 states considered adding drone bills to the books last year, and 10 states actually did add new laws. In Iowa, for example, it&rsquo;s now illegal for the state to use drones to enforce traffic laws. In North Carolina, no one can use a drone for surveillance of a person or private property. And Tennessee now specifies that it&rsquo;s a misdemeanour to use drones for surveillance of people who are hunting or fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&rsquo;s drone operations might soon become legally questionable too. Earlier this month, a California senator &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/calif-lawmakers-consider-drone-privacy-bill/31326004\"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would extend property rights into airspace, meaning that drones flying over private property would be considered trespassers. Just a few days before that, President Obama and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/15/a-brief-summary-of-the-faas-new-drone-regulations/\"&gt;announced new drone regulations&lt;/a&gt; as well, requiring &ndash; among other things &ndash; that drones must be under 55lb (25kg) and that operators must keep the flying vehicles in sight at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7xlr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the laws are murky, many private investigators steer clear of drones. &ldquo;The use of drones for surveillance is highly restricted by law,&rdquo; said Kelly Riddle, a private investigator in Texas. &ldquo;There are air space regulations as well as privacy laws that can easily be violated. Obtaining video using a drone has thus far been something that we have been advised is illegal.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because drones are often used to observe activities that can&rsquo;t be seen via a direct line of sight at ground level. Going out of your way to spy on such activities is considered an invasion of privacy, says Riddle. A lot of Wright&rsquo;s work sidesteps this privacy question, because it involves helping schools and churches monitor their own property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the use of drones will be restricted under a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations in the United States sooner than later. But in the meantime Wright will continue to use them when they can help with her work. But she also says that regardless of the legality, if someone thinks their privacy is being compromised, they&rsquo;re going to do something about it. That can mean shooting down drones &ndash; another activity that &lt;a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/man-shoots-down-drone-lawyers-scratch-their-heads\"&gt;may or may not be legal&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;I think a lot of my colleagues have lost them and realised that it is a tool, and if you invade someone&rsquo;s privacy, well, if they can hit it they will.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-18T11:27:45Z","HeadlineLong":"The private investigator who spies using drones","HeadlineShort":"I use a drone to spy on people","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Aerial vehicles are the latest tool for private detectives  but for how long?

The pair have been friends since childhood. Within the first year of their friendship, nerve damage inflicted by an inherited genetic condition robbed Haug of his sight and hearing. He was nine. But children are natural innovators. &ldquo;We started to invent languages and forms of communication just because we were kids and we wanted to play,&rdquo; says Schwengber. &ldquo;It was annoying that he couldn't hear me, and I couldn't write something down,&rdquo; she says. So the two invented their own tactile language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Haug and Schwengber grew older, they replaced their private language with one that is more widely understood: Lorm, a tactile alphabet spelled out with strokes to the hand. It was invented in the nineteenth century by Hieronymus Lorm &ndash; an anonymous pseudonym, for Austrian-born poet, journalist, and novelist &lt;a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12762.html\"&gt;Heinrich Landesmann&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; and is still used today by the deaf-blind community in German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv0k9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the importance of Lorm to Haug and Schwengber. But Lorm, and other forms of tactile signing, have their limits. A reliance on physical contact between communicators has historically constrained the social circles of the deaf-blind to those they can meet face-to-face (or more accurately hand-to-hand) on a regular basis &ndash; and even within this relatively small group of people, only those who take the time to learn and practice Lorm can really become part of a deaf-blind individual&rsquo;s social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Haug&rsquo;s social circle currently consists of about five people: his mother, Schwengber, teachers, and therapists. Once a year he spends about 10 days visiting relatives in Stuttgart in Southern Germany. &ldquo;The first five days they need to practice Lorming, so they can remember the letters, and by the tenth day when they are quite fast, it's time to go back home,&rdquo; explains Schwengber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these drawbacks might soon disappear, if a new invention by Tom Bieling is commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactile translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling, a researcher at the Design Lab in Berlin, has developed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.design-research-lab.org/projects/mobile-lorm-glove/\"&gt;glove kitted out with fabric pressure-sensors&lt;/a&gt;. By translating a tactile hand touch alphabet into digital text, the mobile glove could eliminate the necessity of hand-to-hand physical contact for deaf-blind communication. Even better, because a great deal of online communication is text-based, the glove could act as a translating device that allows people who are deaf-blind to communicate freely with anyone &ndash; and for anyone to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an invention reminiscent of the outlandish gadgets seen in James Bond movies, and it won Bieling first prize in the 2014 Falling Walls Lab competition &ndash; a kind of TED Talks meets Dragon&rsquo;s Den &ndash; held annually in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1kq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first prototype was made from Gore-Tex fabric and felt much like an ordinary glove, Bieling explains. It&rsquo;s embedded with small vibrating motors, and &ldquo;as soon as you receive an incoming message, it starts vibrating on those dots where the letters are positioned&rdquo;, he says. In the current version, users can adjust the intensity and speed of the incoming tactile messages according to their reading skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the whole hand area of the glove is now wired for sensory input, &ldquo;just like a tablet [computer]&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The system recognises both the position and pattern of the finger movement.&rdquo; So users can also spell out their own messages.If a sign isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;typed&rdquo; quite correctly, the Lorm glove system recognises the closest symbol &ndash; just like a spell checker on your smart phone. For example, a circle in the hand would be an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, explains Bieling, and even if you type a triangle or a square, the system is clever enough to recognise the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; as the closest correct symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enhancing independence&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking through Schwengber&rsquo;s translation, Haug describes the glove prototype as a bit slower than what he is used to in terms of receiving messages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his teacher or his mother Lorming,&rdquo; says Schwengber, compared with her own speedy pace. &ldquo;But he really likes it,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the glove, &ldquo;I can send and receive &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; says Haug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling&rsquo;s project is part of his doctoral studies exploring links between design and ability. He argues that feeling disabled is a question of design &ndash; a ramp, for instance, is easy for anyone to ascend, even if they are in a wheelchair. He hopes that his design will enable deaf-blind people to engage with a broader spectrum of their community and &ldquo;gain access to a broader range of information, thus enhancing their independence&rdquo;. But he also hopes that gaining knowledge about alternative communication systems can profit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1wv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haug, now 22, currently lives with his mother in Spreewald, about 100km south of Berlin. He is studying massage therapy in the hopes of pursuing it as a profession. He would like to move to Berlin, explains Schwengber, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that has thus far eluded him because of the lack of assistance available. The glove could expand Haug&rsquo;s ability to stay in close touch with those closest to him while living at a distance. But it could do more than that: it could allow him to expand his currently small social circle dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Haug, with help from Schwengber, has been having fun on Twitter, a medium enabling him to converse with people who need never know that he is deaf-blind. On social media, Haug is &ldquo;just a person behind the Twitter account saying something&rdquo;, explains Schwengber. Haug describes it as a bit like playing carnival, because &ldquo;you just mask up and say anything you want&rdquo;, translates Schwengber. &ldquo;Content matters, not the person,&rdquo; she explains. So Haug gets a kick out of the reaction from followers when he Tweets amusing things, something he&rsquo;d be able to do more easily and independently with his own Lorm glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the first thing he would say with a Lorm glove of his own, Haug says he would talk to his cousin in Stuttgart and ask him if he can remember the name of an interesting film they recently spoke about. (Schwengber and Haug often go to the cinema &ndash; where Schwengber simultaneously translates the movie for Haug via Lorm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted the digital revolution and the amazing new connections it has offered. For those constrained by a barrier of unseen sights and unheard sounds, it was once unexplored territory &ndash; but with the Lorm glove, they might just have that world in the palm of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-13T09:29:01Z","HeadlineLong":"The glove that transmits touch over the internet","HeadlineShort":"The glove turning touch into talk","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Blind-deaf people are often forced to live in a small and isolated world.

Those calls, which he believes may have come from a computer on a spacecraft, proved a seminal influence on his life and led him to pursue a career that combined mainstream physics with an enduring interest in UFOs and the far-out reaches of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who might dismiss Sarfatti as a crank, he is quick to point out that he is not interested in debating the reality of little green men, but rather whether the existence of UFOs might prove that the technology required for interstellar travel is possible. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the physics that interests me,&rdquo; says Sarfatti, who received his PhD in the subject from the University of California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That experience, and interest, also helped make Sarfatti one of the key figures invited last year to help formulate an unusual government programme: &lt;a href=\"http://www.100yss.org/\"&gt;the 100-Year Starship (100YSS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the US government&rsquo;s manned space programmes appear stuck in Earth&rsquo;s orbit, this audacious project aims to kickstart efforts towards interstellar space travel &ndash; journeys over vast distances to stars outside of our solar system. It is driven by ideas that range from ensuring the survival of the human species and searching for intelligent alien life to the desire to overhaul space propulsion and just pure academic endeavor. Science fiction favourites from wormholes and warp drives to light speed and lasers are all on the table, meaning parts of the project can end up sounding like the wish list for an episode of Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stellar pipedream?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 100YSS is not a fringe activity started by a bunch of dreamers. It has the backing of two high-profile US agencies &ndash; the space agency &lt;a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/\"&gt;Nasa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/\"&gt;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa)&lt;/a&gt;, the US military agency that helped create the internet and satellite-based navigation. Darpa has a track record for these kinds of seemingly impossible technologies: in recent years it has sponsored attempts to develop a hypersonic aircraft and driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even those might pale next to the goal of sending a manned spaceship to the stars. And the agency&rsquo;s willingness to embrace unconventional ideas and people &ndash; like Sarfatti &ndash; means the project divides opinion. For its backers it is a visionary blueprint for interstellar travel. For the naysayers, it is a crackpot idea with no hope of even getting off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who might consider a starship something of a pipedream, &lt;a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Personnel/Neyland.aspx\"&gt;David Neyland, the head of the Darpa office in charge of the 100YSS&lt;/a&gt;, points to the agency&rsquo;s ability to spur innovation in unexpected areas, an ability that has proven critical to its success.&lt;strong&gt; &ldquo;&lt;/strong&gt;The iPhone in your pocket is powered by cellular radio technology that came out of communications research Darpa did back in the 70s and 80s,&rdquo; says Neyland. &ldquo;So it is that unintended consequence of technology research that we are hoping to inspire.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, when it comes to spaceships, we have been here before. Serious study of interstellar travel has long attracted a coterie of dedicated followers spanning mainstream science and the outer fringes. &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3642362.stm\"&gt;Wernher von Braun, the famous rocket scientist&lt;/a&gt;, justified his work on military weapons as a way to further engineering that would lead mankind to space. &ldquo;I aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit London,&rdquo; became a satirical jab at von Braun, whose dreams of travel to Mars led him to build the &lt;a href=\"http://www.v2rocket.com/\"&gt;V2 rockets&lt;/a&gt; for Nazi Germany that rained down on England during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moon landings reinvigorated interest in manned space travel. In the 1970s, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bis-space.com/\"&gt;the British Interplanetary Society&lt;/a&gt; led &lt;a href=\"http://www.bisbos.com/rocketscience/spacecraft/daedalus/daedalus.html\"&gt;a five-year study called Project Daedalus&lt;/a&gt;, named for the mythological figure who crafted wings to fly. The group looked at building a nuclear-fusion powered starship to travel some six light years away to &lt;a href=\"http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/stars/barnardsstar.html\"&gt;Barnard's Star&lt;/a&gt;, a star reasonably close to Earth which was then thought to have orbiting planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest also grew in novel propulsion methods, driven in part by the idea that conventional rocket technology was just too slow to mount even a one-way trip to our closest stellar neighbour, &lt;a href=\"http://www.glyphweb.com/esky/stars/alphacentauri.html\"&gt;Alpha Centauri&lt;/a&gt;. Some estimates suggested it would take at least 80,000 years to travel the four light-years there, requiring multi-generation spaceflight and fuel demands that do not bear thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, interest grew in technologies such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10293284\"&gt;solar sails&lt;/a&gt;, blown along by streams of light particles. In the 1980s, physicist Robert L Forward even proposed a solar sail driven by a giant laser, which would push a spaceship at close to the speed of light (although some consider even that technology too slow for interstellar exploration).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risky thinking &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing about those ideas is one thing, but building them is another, says &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_J._Lewis\"&gt;Mark Lewis&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland and a former US Air Force chief scientist. The laser-powered light sail, for example, would require planet-sized optics as big as Jupiter. &ldquo;One can write the equations to demonstrate how it would be done, but the resources needed to actually build it would be enormous,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We know how to build them, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we could.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly three decades later, Forward&rsquo;s laser-powered light sail &ndash; as well as other ideas for interstellar travel &ndash; are still popular among space enthusiasts and science fiction writers, but they have gained little traction by way of funding or serious progress. In the 1990s Nasa briefly supported &lt;a href=\"http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/\"&gt;the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics programme&lt;/a&gt;, which funded scientific research in areas such as rocketless space drives and faster-than-light travel. However, that program lost its funding in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advancing these ideas, say experts, would require decades of research and billions of dollars, something that a government, particularly in a time of austerity, is unlikely to do. &ldquo;Right now the established aerospace community is reaching a stagnation point; it is trying to finish what was started in &lsquo;60s, rather than adapt,&rdquo; said Mark Millis, a former Nasa scientist who headed the Breakthrough Propulsion Physics programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millis, who left Nasa in 2010, now dedicates his time to &lt;a href=\"http://www.tauzero.aero/\"&gt;the Tau Zero Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an Ohio-based nonprofit he started to help further interstellar travel. &ldquo;I tried to keep doing cool, futuristic stuff, but it&rsquo;s just not going to happen in government,&rdquo; he said of his decision to leave Nasa. &ldquo;I realized I&rsquo;m going to have to go independent.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that same thinking is what motivated Darpa and Nasa to start the 100YSS. Neyland, the Darpa official, says the idea for the project came out of a meeting he had with the head of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html\"&gt;Nasa&rsquo;s Ames Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, Pete Worden, who has a reputation as an out-of-the-box thinker willing to take risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What we realised right off was that if you look at history, any major exploration, like crossing the oceans, crossing the continents, building telescopes for looking into space, those things have always been done outside of government circles,&rdquo; said Neyland last year. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been funded by patrons or non-government organisations.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their idea was to do for interstellar travel what the Medici court did for &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/galilei_galileo.shtml\"&gt;Galileo&lt;/a&gt;: provide long-term funding to encourage scientific breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, Darpa and Nasa convened a handful of people, including Sarfatti, to help shape the project. It was decided that the government would provide a modest seed fund of just $500,000 &ndash; a drop in the ocean compared to Darpa&rsquo;s annual budget of about $3 billion &ndash; to a foundation that could demonstrate its ability to advance thinking on interstellar travel. Darpa believes the chosen group will then find new sources of revenue, either through commercialising technologies or private donations. And, of course, if there are a few spin-off technologies that Darpa &ndash; whose main customer is the US Department of Defense &ndash; can exploit, then all the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 100-years part, according to Neyland, was merely an estimate of how long it would take to really move such an ambitious project forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;If you even look at our own space programme, if you look at how far we&rsquo;ve come, it&rsquo;s been 41 years since we first landed on the moon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So we thought a 100-year time horizon, not for the study, but 100 years of doing research and development, gave us some practicality of developing technologies that we couldn&rsquo;t foresee today.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Suicide mission' &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project had a rough start, however. The world first heard of the 100-year Starship from reports about a talk given by Worden at a conference. &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1324192/Hundred-Year-Starship-Mars-mission-leave-astronauts-planet-forever.html\"&gt;The talk spawned erroneous news reports that that the 100-year starship was a Nasa-sponsored one-way human mission to Mars&lt;/a&gt;, which didn't make any sense,&rdquo; says Creon Levit, a Nasa scientist who was the first programme manager for 100YSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a suicide mission was not quite what the two agencies had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasa has since stepped back, allowing Darpa &ndash; which has even hired a public relations firm to handle publicity for the project &ndash; to take the lead. Despite that initial misstep, a conference open to the public held late last year proved popular. At a panel on breakthrough propulsion, an audience eager to hear about warp drive and faster-than-light travel spilled out of the room and into the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And no wonder, since many of the ideas sounded like they had come straight out of a Hollywood script for going where no man has gone before. Sarfatti proposed a low-power warp drive (a faster-than light propulsion system) that involves the warping of spacetime around the starship. His idea involves using new meta-materials &ndash; which change how light is refracted &ndash; to slow the speed of light, while also creating a repulsive anti-gravity effect, creating a warp bubble surrounding the starship. This approach, Sarfatti anticipates, would break the space-time barrier, allowing the spaceship to travel beyond the speed of light in its own bubble. (A related Sarfatti proposal involves using a &ldquo;quantum entanglement communicator&rdquo;, which would allow the ship&rsquo;s crew to speak with people back on Earth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric W Davis, a physicist at the Texas-based Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin, an independent think tank, proposed &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4564477.stm\"&gt;a traversable wormhole&lt;/a&gt;, which would provide a hyperspace shortcut for a spaceship travelling to the stars. The idea would be to harness the energy found in free space - known as &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy\"&gt;negative vacuum energy&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp; - to shape the wormhole, allowing the spaceship to travel to Alpha Centauri in just a few days. The difficulty, however, is producing enough negative vacuum energy to create the wormhole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symposium also covered the ethical, medical, and even religious aspects of interstellar space travel. Adam Crowl, a board member of &lt;a href=\"http://www.icarusinterstellar.org/index.php\"&gt;Project Icarus&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation dedicated to interstellar travel, proposed a possible &ldquo;escape&rdquo; mission for a spaceship to ensure mankind&rsquo;s survival in case of a catastrophe on Earth. His proposal, with echoes of sci-fi like Battlestar Gallactica and Wall-E, involved sending embryos into space to be raised by androids. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a theoretical exercise in looking at the risks to humanity from our own inventions,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What we might do is to provide a fallback option.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who align themselves with 100YSS are well aware that talk of spacebound embryos and breaking the space-time barrier is open to ridicule. And at events like the symposium, there are efforts to keep discussion away from what many consider to be overly outlandish topics, like UFOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project has also tried to raise its credibility by including a range of skeptics, particularly on the propulsion ideas. Ken Olum, a physicist at &lt;a href=\"http://www.tufts.edu/\"&gt;Tufts University in Boston&lt;/a&gt;, who took part in a breakthrough propulsion panel at the Darpa symposium, says that schemes like wormholes and warp drive are interesting to discuss but they just are not practical: no one has any clue how to build them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Even though I think that there&rsquo;s not likely to be much future in exotic stuff, like wormholes, I think a little bit of funding should be given to them,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But they are not the answer to the problem of what we will do in the next 100 years to go to the stars.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Levit, the Nasa scientist, says these sorts of breakthrough propulsion ideas, however far-fetched, have to be considered, because they are the only way mankind could conceivably cover the vast distances to other stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Nuclear fusion, if you&rsquo;re willing to have a 1,000 year mission, is worth talking about,&rdquo; says Levit, although even this is also an unproven technology, despite decades of effort on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But I tend to agree with Jack [Sarfatti] on this: in order to do this, we have to have a breakthrough. We have to have a warp drive.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levit, who was the one who invited Sarfatti to the initial 100-Year Starship meeting, says unusual interests shouldn&rsquo;t make someone off-limits. Mainstream scientists are tied down, argues Levit, and someone like Sarfatti is free to talk about ideas like antigravity propulsion without fear of repercussions on his career. &ldquo;Although his interests and style are outside of the mainstream, he is a fully pedigreed physicist and he knows as much or more than mainstream physicists,&rdquo; Levit says. &ldquo;When he talks about warp drives, he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. He knows he&rsquo;s speculating.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2011, Darpa selected a team led by Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman to travel to space, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16427876\"&gt;as the winner of a $500,000 grant&lt;/a&gt;. Jemison, whose partners included the Icarus Foundation and the Foundation for Enterprise Development, won with a proposal called An Inclusive, Audacious Journey Transforms Life Here on Earth and Beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While details of what Jemison and her team intend to do are unclear, the news could spell the death of another interstellar travel foundation. Millis, the head of the Tau Zero Foundation, said that he would have to consider shutting down his operations. &ldquo;There are not enough revenues around to try to compete,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think that would be a disservice to the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarfatti sees it differently. After spending most of his career as an outsider pursuing faster-than-light travel, he is undaunted by the arrival of a government-backed competitor. Instead, he has shunned the 100YSS process and plans to continue work on his warp drive independently. The Darpa project, he say, is simply too little money to be taken seriously. &ldquo;I am in touch with people with considerable resources,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it on my own and do what I want to do.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may have to wait 100 years to see if he is proven right.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"100

That question is sure to prompt the geeks among us to pipe up with &ldquo;2.7K&rdquo;. For 2.7 Kelvin, or 2.7 degrees above absolute zero, is the temperature produced by the uniform background radiation or &ldquo;afterglow&rdquo; from the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But hang on. Evidently you don&rsquo;t hit temperatures that low the moment you step outside the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Heat is streaming from the Sun to warm the Earth, and it will also warm other objects exposed to its rays. Take the Moon, which has virtually no atmosphere to complicate things. On the sunlit side the Moon is hotter than the Sahara &ndash; it can top 120C (248F). But on the dark side it can drop to around minus 170C (&ndash;338F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So just how cold can it go in our own cosmic neighbourhood? This isn&rsquo;t an idle question. If you&rsquo;re thinking of sending spacecraft up there, let alone people, you need to know the answer. You also need to know the answer if you want to carry out low-temperature physics experiments in space precisely because you think it is that cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can do low-temperature physics experiments on Earth if you want to ,say, study particle behaviour at the atomic level &ndash; liquid-helium coolant sends temperatures below 4K (&ndash;269C/&ndash;452F) in the lab, and some experiments have come to within just a few billionths of a kelvin of absolute zero. But some planned studies also demand zero gravity. You can get that on Earth for a short time in freefall air flights, but for longer than a few seconds you need to go into space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such experiment, called MAQRO, hopes to test fundamental features of quantum theory and perhaps search for subtle effects in a quantum picture of gravity &ndash; something that physicists can so far see only in the haziest terms. So the &lt;a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1309.3234\"&gt;scientists behind MAQRO have now worked out&lt;/a&gt; whether it will in fact be possible to get cold enough, on a spacecraft carrying the equipment, for the tests to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAQRO &lt;a href=\"http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1567812:3/component/escidoc:1569305/4428.pdf\"&gt;was proposed last year&lt;/a&gt; by Rainer Kaltenbaek and Markus Aspelmeyer of the University of Vienna, and their collaborators. The experiment aims to study one of the most profound puzzles in quantum theory: how or why do the rules that govern fundamental particles like electrons and atoms, give way to the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; physics of the everyday world? Why do quantum particles sometimes behave like waves whereas footballs don&rsquo;t?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one fully understands this so-called quantum-to-classical transition. But one of the favourite explanations invokes an idea called decoherence, which means that in effect the quantum behaviour of a system gets jumbled and ultimately erased because of the disruptive effects of the environment. These effects become stronger the more particles the system contains, because then there are more options for the environment to interfere. For objects large enough to see, containing countless trillions of atoms, decoherence happens in an instant, washing out quantum effects in favour of classical behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this picture, it should be possible to preserve &ldquo;quantum-ness&rdquo; in any system, no matter how big, if you could isolate it perfectly from its environment. In principle, even footballs would then show wave-particle duality and could exist in two states, or two places, at once. But some theories, as yet still speculative and untested, insist that something else will prevent this weird behaviour in large, massive objects, perhaps because of effects that would disclose something about a still elusive quantum theory of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the stakes for MAQRO could be big. The experimental apparatus itself wouldn&rsquo;t be too exotic. Kaltenbaek and colleagues propose to use laser beams to place a &ldquo;big&rdquo; particle (about a tenth of a micrometre across) in two quantum states at once, called a superposition, and then to probe with the lasers how decoherence destroys this superposition (or not). The apparatus would have to be very cold because, as with most quantum effects, heat would disrupt a delicate superposition. And performing the experiment in zero gravity on a spacecraft could show whether gravity does indeed play a role in the quantum-to-classical transition. Putting it all on a spacecraft would be about as close to perfect isolation from the environment as one can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now Kaltenbaek and colleagues, in collaboration with researchers at leading European space-technology company Astrium Satellites in Friedrichshafen, Germany, have worked out just how cold the apparatus could really get. They imagine sticking a &ldquo;bench&rdquo; with all the experimental components on the back of a disk-shaped spacecraft, with the disk, and several further layers of thermal insulation, shielding it from the Sun. So while the main body of the spacecraft would be kept at about 300K (27C/80F), which its operating equipment would require, the bench could be much colder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much? The researchers calculate that, with three thermal shields between the main disk of the spacecraft and the bench, it should be possible to get the temperature of the bench itself down to 27K (&ndash;246C/&ndash;411F). Much of the warming would come through the struts holding the bench and shields to the main disk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s not really cold enough for the MAQRO experiment to work well. But the test particle itself would be held in free space above the bench, and this would be colder. On its own it could reach 8K (&ndash;265C/&ndash;445F), but with all the other experimental components around it, all radiating heat, it reaches 16K (&ndash;257C/&ndash;430F). This, they calculate, would be enough to test the decoherence rates predicted for all the major theories which currently propose that intrinsic mass (perhaps via gravity) will enforce decoherence in a large object. In other words, MAQRO should be cold enough to spot if these models are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the experiment discriminate between any theories that aren&rsquo;t ruled out? That&rsquo;s another matter, which remains to be seen. But simply knowing that size matters in quantum mechanics would be a major finding. The bigger question, of course, is whether anyone will consider MAQRO &ndash; a cheap experiment as space science goes &ndash; worth a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Uncovering todays unsung scientific discoveries.

It takes years, decades, centuries even to cross the vast expanses of space with our current propulsion technology &ndash; a realistic depiction of the tedium of space travel in entertainment would likely elicit the viewer equivalent of &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the OPERA announcement was bound to generate excitement, even if the neutrinos in question were only moving nanoseconds faster than light &ndash; hardly sufficient to outrun the Cylons, but nevertheless faster than c, the cosmic speed limit set &lt;a href=\"http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/\"&gt;by Albert Einstein back in 1905&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the euphoria was premature: the &lt;a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897v1\"&gt;OPERA results were incorrect&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a calibration error. The culprit: a faulty cable connection in the GPS system used to time the neutrinos along their journey. That killjoy Einstein wins again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the OPERA saga did tell us anything, it&rsquo;s that the idea of travelling faster than light continues to capture the imagination. As Hollywood screenwriter Zack Stentz (Thor, a.k.a. &ldquo;Vikings in Space&lt;em&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;) said recently at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i3r2lLArWk\"&gt;Los Angeles panel on the science of superheroes&lt;/a&gt;, &ldquo;Every science fiction writer who wants to get out of the solar system [within a human lifetime] gloms onto that. It&rsquo;s the leap of faith that lets you tell stories on this bigger canvas.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;You cannae change the laws of physics&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&ldquo;Leap of faith&rdquo; is a particularly relevant phrase to use here. The fact is we&rsquo;ll never be able to travel beyond the speed of light, at least based on our current understanding of established physics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As any object with mass accelerates &ndash; like a proton in the LHC &ndash; it gains energy, always needing just a little bit more energy to accelerate even further. The LHC, the largest and highest-energy particle accelerator we have, boosts protons as close to the speed of light as we can get, but they never quite hit the mark. If a proton did achieve that speed, it would need infinite energy to go any faster, and we don&rsquo;t have an infinite supply of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equations don&rsquo;t tend to lie, especially ones that have been tested and re-tested in countless experiments for over a century. For all practical intents and purposes, the speed of light is an insurmountable threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But physicists would never make any progress at all if they threw in the towel quite that easily, and nobody thinks Einstein will have the final word in perpetuity. Many scientists are happy to consider the possibility of violations of relativistic principles, even if none have yet been experimentally confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest proposed possibilities for FTL travel involved a hypothetical particle called a &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon\"&gt;tachyon&lt;/a&gt;, capable of tunnelling past the speed of light barrier. This turned out to be more of a mathematical artifact rather than an actual physical particle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, another reason for all the OPERA-tic excitement was that back in 1985, physicists proposed that some high-energy neutrinos &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370269385904605\"&gt;might really be tachyons&lt;/a&gt;, capable of interacting with an as-yet-known field, giving them just enough of an energy boost to break through the barrier. Such tachyon-like neutrinos would supersede photons as the fastest particles in the universe.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;OPERA&rsquo;s calibration error dashed those hopes, but there are still plenty of potential loopholes to be explored, such as the Star Trek-inspired warp drive mechanism first proposed by &lt;a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009013\"&gt;Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994&lt;/a&gt;. In general relativity, spacetime is dynamic, not static, warping and bending in response to the presence of mass or energy. Alcubierre suggested that it might be possible to encase a spaceship within a &ldquo;warp bubble&rdquo;, whereby space contracted in front of the craft and expanded behind it, enabling it to travel faster than light. But within that bubble, spacetime would remain essentially flat and the craft would technically &ldquo;obey&rdquo; the cosmic speed limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, once again we face an energy problem: achieving that degree of curvature would require enormous amounts of energy &ndash; and negative energy at that &ndash; equivalent to the mass of Jupiter. To propel a spacecraft across the Milky Way galaxy may require more energy than can be found in the mass of the entire universe. A more energy-efficient &lt;a href=\"http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive=possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html\"&gt;ring-shaped design&lt;/a&gt; for such a warp drive was described recently at a symposium on interstellar space flight, offering a meager shred of hope to diehard space acolytes that for future generations, warp drive will be a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, given what we know about general relativity and quantum field theory, &ldquo;It almost certainly can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; says Ken Olum, a cosmologist at Tufts. &ldquo;Of course, if we are talking about quantum gravity, it&rsquo;s hard to know, because we don&rsquo;t really know what that is.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nasa scientist &lt;a href=\"http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Kevin_Grazier\"&gt;Kevin Grazier&lt;/a&gt;, who was the technical consultant for Battlestar Galactica, says that a version of the Alcubierre warp drive inspired the &ldquo;jump drive&rdquo; used in that series. It was based on the assumption that, in this fictional world, the Colonials had merged theories of electromagnetism and gravity, such that if you could create a very intense electromagnetic field, it would be functionally equivalent to an intense gravitational field capable of warping spacetime. Turning that ingenious fiction into a viable reality is another matter altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brane gain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If we really want to get speculative, Olum suggests FTL travel would be possible if exotic concepts, like those that emerge from superstring theory, prove to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We inhabit four-dimensional spacetime, but various permutations of superstring theory suggest our universe is just one of many, co-existing within a bubble of five-dimensional spacetime called the &ldquo;bulk.&rdquo; Within that bulk, our universe lines up in parallel with all the others, just like the pages in a book. Olum explains that, hypothetically, one could take a shortcut through the bulk, thereby arriving at your destination sooner than if you had travelled along your four-dimensional surface, or brane (short for membrane) as it is known. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even then, there is a catch. &ldquo;In brane theories, only gravitons can travel through the bulk,&rdquo; says Olum. So one would need to invent a machine that could scan an object and transmit the information in the form of gravitons to a second machine on the other end which would then reconstruct that object &ndash; shades of teleportation, only with gravitons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering we have yet to observe gravitons in our most powerful accelerators, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLWO7YJ6H_index_0.html\"&gt;the current record for teleporting&lt;/a&gt; small clouds of atoms is the relatively non-Cylon-troubling distance of 143 kilometres (88 miles), this scenario must also remain firmly in the realm of science fiction, at least for now. Science advances, but it does so slowly, at a pace nowhere near the speed of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-10-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Will we ever travel faster than the speed of light?","HeadlineShort":"Can we travel faster than light?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Einstein said it is impossible, but as Jennifer Ouellette explains some scientists are still trying to break the cosmic speed limit  even if it means bending the laws of physics.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Einstein said it is impossible, but some scientists are still trying to break the cosmic speed limit  even if it means bending the laws of physics.","SummaryShort":"Possibly, but only if you bend the laws of physics","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"b9b46ad2-67d0-4239-8fb9-6c205e16ab9b","Id":"wwfuture/story/20121003-can-we-travel-faster-than-light","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20121003-can-we-travel-faster-than-light"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20121003-can-we-travel-faster-than-light","_id":"559a5ded157e584f77e20247"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;If Star Trek taught us one thing, it is that &ldquo;ye cannae change the laws of physics&rdquo;. That is certainly how scientists generally seem to regard their various laws and constants. No sooner has someone discovered a new &ldquo;law&rdquo; than it acquires quasi-legal status, with violations implicitly prohibited. No sooner has someone defined a &ldquo;constant&rdquo; than it is assumed to be just that, never varying at different times or places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, who says so? Why should we assume that a particular mass always exerts the same gravity, or that an atom always has the same mass anyway? After all, one of the most revelatory theories of modern physics, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_special_relativity\"&gt;special relativity&lt;/a&gt;, showed that the length of a centimetre and the duration of a second can change depending on how fast you are moving. And look at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15034414\"&gt;recent excitement&lt;/a&gt; about experiments hinting (and then dismissing due to &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17139635\"&gt;a faulty connection&lt;/a&gt;) that particles called neutrinos could travel &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15017484\"&gt;faster than the speed of light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no principle of physics that says physical laws or constants have to be the same everywhere and always. This could drive you a bit mad. How can you possibly do science if the rules keep changing? But if you are a scientist, you have to face up to that possibility &ndash; and you have a responsibility to check out if it is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the apparent Lewis Carroll absurdity of &lt;a href=\"http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v108/i11/e110801\"&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; setting out to test if a constant central to quantum physics, called &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant\"&gt;Planck&rsquo;s constant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;, is really as it says. The fact that it is, as far as we can tell &ndash; there does not seem much point in manufacturing suspense here &ndash; means that this is not likely to grab any headlines. It sounds a bit like proving that Paris has not moved to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precision timing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is an experiment that is significant not so much for what has been found as for the fact that it was done at all. After all, testing the constancy of a constant means going to extraordinary lengths in terms of precision measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether Planck&rsquo;s constant is really constant, Makan Mohageg and graduate student James Kentosh of California State University in Northridge turned to the same GPS systems that help drivers find their way home. GPS relies on the most accurate timing devices we currently possess: &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/atomic_clocks.aspx\"&gt;atomic clocks&lt;/a&gt;. These count the passage of time according to frequency of the radiation that atoms emit when their electrons jump between different energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why go to all this bother? The point is that the researchers did not just pick on a random constant. Planck&rsquo;s constant is in effect the number that launched the field of quantum physics. In 1900 the German scientist &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck\"&gt;Max Planck&lt;/a&gt; proposed &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; as a measure of the size of energy &ldquo;packets&rdquo;, or quanta, into which light is divided. Planck said that a light quantum has an amount of energy equal to the frequency of the light multiplied by &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;. Planck introduced this &ldquo;quantum&rdquo; hypothesis of light as a mathematical trick to get his equations to work out. But &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\"&gt;Albert Einstein&lt;/a&gt; argued five years later that the trick must be taken literally: light really is chopped up into these discrete packets of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disturbance in the universe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why Kentosh and Mohageg asked whether &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; is really constant, however, is not just because it is a central number for modern physics, but because &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; also appears in the expression for another fundamental constant, called the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant\"&gt;fine-structure constant&lt;/a&gt;. This measures the strength of interactions between light and matter, or equivalently, how strong electrical and magnetic forces are. It can be expressed as a combination of three constants: the charge on an electron, the speed of light, and &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here is the crux: some scientists have suggested that the fine structure constant might not be constant, but could &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1991223.stm\"&gt;vary over time and space&lt;/a&gt;. In 1999, a team of astronomers using a telescope in Hawaii reported that measurements of light absorbed by very distant galaxy-like objects in space called quasars &ndash; which are so far away that we see them today as they looked billions of years ago &ndash; suggest that the value of the fine-structure constant was once slightly different from what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That claim was controversial, and still unproven. But if true, it must mean that at least one of the three fundamental constants that constitute it must vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, location, location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kentosh and Mohageg fixed on &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;, and specifically on whether &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; depends on &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; (not &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;) you measure it. If &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; changes from place to place, so do the frequencies, and thus the &ldquo;ticking rate&rdquo;, of atomic clocks. And any dependence of &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; on location would translate as a tiny timing discrepancy between different GPS clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what did they discover? Well, if there is any difference in &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; it would have to be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; tiny. After careful analysis of the data from seven highly stable GPS satellites, Kentosh and Mohageg conclude that &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; is identical at different locations to an accuracy of seven parts in a thousand. In other words, if &lt;em&gt;h&lt;/em&gt; were a one-metre measuring stick, two sticks in different places anywhere in the world do not differ by more than seven millimetres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting this variation of less than 1% in measuring sticks might be easy, spotting this in an exceedingly tiny number like Planck&rsquo;s constant, which is &lt;em&gt;0.000000000000000000000000000000000662606957 joule seconds&lt;/em&gt;, demands the type of extreme accuracy of measurement that is most likely beyond the capabilities of our most accurate atomic clocks. At this point, however, we can feel reassured that there is no reason to suspect that this particular aspect of physics shifts between, say, London and Beijing &ndash; or indeed, between our galaxy and the next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-03-29T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can the laws of physics change?","HeadlineShort":"Can the laws of physics change?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Scientists have used GPS to search for variations in a constant that is at the heart of quantum physics.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Scientists have used GPS to find variations in a constant that is at the heart of quantum physics.","SummaryShort":"Dont tell Star Treks Scotty, but physics fundamental rules are under scrutiny","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"8c642ff1-6bef-4936-b460-67f00315675b","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120329-can-the-laws-of-physics-change","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120329-can-the-laws-of-physics-change"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120329-can-the-laws-of-physics-change","_id":"559a5ddf157e584f77e2003f"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics must be one of the most successful theories in science. Developed at the start of the twentieth century, it has been used to calculate with incredible precision how light and matter behave &ndash; how electrical currents pass through silicon transistors in computer circuits, say, or the shapes of molecules and how they absorb light. Much of today&rsquo;s information technology relies on quantum theory, as do some aspects of chemical processing, molecular biology, the discovery of new materials, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the weird thing is that no one actually understands quantum theory. The quote popularly attributed to physicist Richard Feynman is probably apocryphal, but still true: if you think you understand quantum mechanics, then you don&rsquo;t. That point was proved by &lt;a href=\"http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1301.1069\"&gt;a poll among 33 leading thinkers&lt;/a&gt; at a conference in Austria in 2011. This group of physicists, mathematicians and philosophers was given 16 multiple-choice questions about the meaning of the theory, and their answers displayed little consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s because quantum theory poses all sorts of strange questions that stretch the limits of our imagination &ndash; forcing us, for example, to conceive of objects like electrons that can, in different circumstances, be either waves or particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most controversial issues concerns the role of measurements. We&rsquo;re used to thinking that the world exists in a definite state, and that we can discover what that state is by making measurements and observations. But quantum theory (&ldquo;quantum mechanics&rdquo; is often regarded as a synonym, although strictly that refers to the mathematical methods developed to study quantum objects) suggests that, at least for tiny objects such as atoms and electrons, there may be no unique state before an observation is made: the object exists simultaneously in several states, called a superposition. Before measurement, all we can say is that there is a certain probability that the object is in state A, or B, or so on. Only during the measurement is a &ldquo;choice&rdquo; made about which of these possible states the object will possess: in quantum-speak, the superposition is &ldquo;collapsed by measurement&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not that, before measuring, we don&rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; which of these options is true &ndash; the fact is that the choice has not yet been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably the most unsettling of all the conundrums posed by quantum theory. It disturbed Albert Einstein so much that he refused to accept it all his life. Einstein was one of the first scientists to embrace the quantum world: in 1905 he proposed that light is not a continuous wave but comes in &ldquo;packets&rdquo;, or quanta, of energy, called photons, which are in effect &ldquo;particles of light&rdquo;. Yet as his contemporaries, such as Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger, devised a mathematical description of the quantum world in which certainties were replaced by probabilities, Einstein protested that the world could not really be so fuzzy. As he famously put it, &ldquo;God does not play dice.&rdquo; (Bohr&rsquo;s response is less famous, but deserves to be better known: &ldquo;Einstein, stop telling God what to do.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schrodinger figured out an equation that, he said, expressed all we can know about a quantum system. This knowledge is encapsulated in a so-called wavefunction, a mathematical expression from which we can deduce, for example, the chances of a quantum particle being &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;, or being in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; state. Measurement &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; the wavefunction so as to give a definite result. But Heisenberg showed that we can&rsquo;t answer every question about a quantum system exactly. This is Heisenberg&rsquo;s uncertainty principle: the more precisely you determine an electron&rsquo;s momentum (as measured by mass multiplied by velocity), the less you can know about its position in space, and vice versa. In other words, there are some pairs of properties for which an increasingly accurate measurement of one of them renders the other ever fuzzier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, no one really knows what a wavefunction is. It was long considered to be just a mathematical convenience, but now &lt;a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/1111.3328\"&gt;some researchers believe it is a real, physical thing&lt;/a&gt;. Some think that collapse of the wavefunction during measurement is also a real process, like the bursting of a bubble; others see it as just a mathematical device put into the theory &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; &ndash; a kind of trick. The Austrian poll showed that these questions about whether or not the act of measurement introduces some fundamental change to a quantum system still cause deep divisions among quantum thinkers, with opinions split quite evenly in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bohr, Heisenberg and their collaborators put together an interpretation of quantum mechanics in the 1920s that is now named after their workplace: the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation\"&gt;Copenhagen interpretation&lt;/a&gt;. This argued that all we can know about quantum systems is what we can measure, and this is all the theory prescribes &ndash; that it is meaningless to look for any &ldquo;deeper&rdquo; level of reality. Einstein rejected that, but nearly two-thirds of those polled in Austria were prepared to say that Einstein was definitely wrong. However, only 21% felt that Bohr was right, with 30% saying we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, their responses revealed the Copenhagen interpretation as still the favourite (42%). But there are other contenders, one of the strongest being the &lt;a href=\"http://frombob.to/many.html\"&gt;Many Worlds interpretation&lt;/a&gt; formulated by Hugh Everett in the 1950s. This proposes that every possibility expressed in a quantum wavefunction corresponds to a physical reality: a particular universe. So with every quantum event &ndash; two particles interacting, say &ndash; the universe splits into alternative realities, in each of which a different possible outcome is observed. That&rsquo;s certainly one way to interpret the maths, although it strikes some researchers as obscenely profligate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important point to note is that these debates over the meaning of quantum theory aren&rsquo;t quite the same as popular ideas about why it is weird. Many outsiders figure that they don&rsquo;t understand quantum theory because they can&rsquo;t see how an object can be in two places at once, or how a particle can also be a wave. But these things are hardly disputed among quantum theorists. It&rsquo;s been rightly said that, as a physicist, you don&rsquo;t ever come to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; them in any intuitive sense; you just get used to accepting them. After all, there&rsquo;s no reason at all to expect the quantum world to obey our everyday expectations. Once you accept this alleged weirdness, quantum theory becomes a fantastically useful tool, and many scientists just use it as such, like a computer whose inner workings we take for granted. That&rsquo;s why most scientists who use quantum theory never fret about its meaning &ndash; in the words of physicist David Mermin, they &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Mermin\"&gt;shut up and calculate&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, which is what he felt the Copenhagen interpretation was recommending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So will we ever get to the bottom of these questions? Some researchers feel that at least some of them are not really scientific questions that can be decided by experiment, but philosophical ones that may come down to personal preference. One of the most telling questions in the Austrian poll was whether there will still be conferences about the meaning of quantum theory in 50 years time. Forty-eight percent said &ldquo;probably yes&rdquo;, only 15% said &ldquo;probably no&rdquo;. Twelve percent said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll organize one no matter what&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s academics for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-01-25T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Will we ever understand quantum theory?","HeadlineShort":"Will we ever get quantum theory?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"If the baffling behaviour of subatomic particles leaves you scratching your head with confusion, dont worry.

Every planet is unique: Saturn has its spectacular rings; Venus has a toxic atmosphere; and Uranus and Neptune are grand icy giants. All in a neat order, from small rocky planets near the Sun to large gassy and icy planets further out. It was a picture that astronomers assumed would be represented elsewhere in the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these assumptions were shattered once we began to discover planets outside our Solar System in the early 1990s. When astronomers identified the first exoplanet to closely orbit a star like our Sun in 1995, they were in for a surprise. Big and gaseous, this planet looked more like Jupiter than any other example from our solar system, earning it the nickname &ldquo;hot Jupiter&rdquo; &ndash; a label that would apply to numerous similar discoveries to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds more exoplanets have been discovered over the years, and their strangeness continues to confound previously accepted theories about planets. Some exoplanets appear to be made of water, with small rocky cores. Others orbit a set of binary stars, reminiscent of the planet that was home to Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. Occasionally, exoplanets appear to move in the opposite direction to their parent star&rsquo;s rotation. And some hot Jupiters make it all the way around their parent star in just four days. Stranger still are the multi-planet systems, where as many as five planets can be packed so closely together that, were they in our solar system, they would squeeze their orbits inside the gap between Earth and Venus. &ldquo;These planets&rsquo; bulk densities suggest that they could be made from anything ranging from styrofoam to lead,&rdquo; says Dr David Sing, an exoplanet scientist at the University of Exeter, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls into question existing theories about how the solar system came to be. Over 450 years since Copernicus radically changed our view of the Universe by working out that the Earth is not at its centre, we are now learning that our solar system is not alone or particularly dramatic. In the words of the biologist JBS Haldane, &ldquo;the universe is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewrite the books&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In hindsight, the astronomy of twenty years ago seems quite conservative. &ldquo;We lacked imagination &ndash; you get very blinded by what you know, and think that determines what is out there,&rdquo; says Charles Beicham, Executive Director of Nasa&rsquo;s Exoplanet Science Institute. &ldquo;We have only seen the tip of the iceberg,&rdquo; adds Ben Oppenheimer, Assistant Curator at the American Museum of Natural History. &ldquo;There is huge diversity in [planets&rsquo;] properties.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that scientists have been so wrong-footed suggests that we might live in a somewhat atypical neighbourhood. It also clearly makes the case that more imaginative astronomical theories are needed. &ldquo;The oddballs help to tell us the most about any holes in our theories,&rdquo; says Heather Knutson, an associate professor at the California Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main theories about how planets form. The first, core accretion, states that planets originate as dust in a disc of gas around a young star, and gradually coagulate by collisions into rocks and then rocky planets. Further from the star, beyond a \"snow-line\" in the disc, solid ices can form as well as rock, and this helps the planets grow faster (becoming the ice giants like Neptune). The biggest of these can then suck up gas from the disc by gravitational attraction and become gas giant planets like Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second theory is known as the gravitational collapse model, where the gas disc around the young star fragments and collapses directly into giant planets through its own gravity. This should form only large gas planets, and probably far out from the star, although you might be able to form rocky planets by this method if the high energy radiation from the star can evaporate the gas from the planet and leave behind the heavier rocky material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Most people favour the core accretion method for the formation of most planets,&rdquo; says Dr Pete Wheatley at the University of Warwick, UK. However, many scientists now agree that the gravitational collapse model could be very important &ldquo;especially when explaining multiple large planets a long way out from the star&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to exoplanets the field is now paying more attention to other theories that have traditionally lacked widespread acceptance. One such idea is migration, in which Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune are possible candidate solar system immigrants. &ldquo;They probably formed at longer distance then moved in,&rdquo; says Adam Burrows at Princeton University, New Jersey. This would explain why hot Jupiters that are close to their parent star seem so odd to astronomers used to surveying our Solar System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possibilities involve an early violent phase in a solar system&rsquo;s formation, where planets start as unstable objects far from the parent star, and then settle in more stable orbits. Another theory to explain how rocky planets formed involves X-rays from a planet&rsquo;s parent star heating a gas planet&rsquo;s upper atmosphere so much that it evaporates, leaving behind the rocky core. &ldquo;There are one or two planets very close to stars where we know this is likely to have happened,&rdquo; says Wheatley, suggesting the event can be thought of like an extreme version of an aurora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the list of ideas considered plausible is only expanding. &ldquo;Discovering so many new exoplanets hasn&rsquo;t eliminated any theory of planet formation&rdquo;, admits Burrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin worlds&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Perhaps a more profound aspect of exoplanet hunting is the possibility of finding a planet with environmental conditions similar to our own: an &ldquo;Earth twin&rdquo;. The hunt has thrown up plenty of potential candidates, although definitions can be misleading. There is no reason why life would be more likely to exist on a planet that is similar to our own than one with different characteristics. &ldquo;Prejudices about our solar system slip into our terminology,&rdquo; notes Bruce Macintosh, an astronomer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in northern California. Of all the planets discovered so far, a quarter are known as &ldquo;super Earths&rdquo;, defined as those with a mass substantially bigger than our own planet, but much smaller than the gas giants of the solar system. It&rsquo;s unlikely that they bear much of a resemblance to our Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking clues from the available data about what these planets are made of is no simple matter. What astronomers know depends on what they can observe. Nasa&rsquo;s main planet-finding mission, Kepler, which launched in March 2009 is now defunct, leaving vast amounts of data still to be trawled. Direct imaging of exoplanets has only recently become possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several projects that should reveal the densities and the atmospheric characteristics of hundreds of exoplanets are on the horizon. Nasa has The American Gemini Direct Imager, to be based in Chile, and the Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite, due to launch in 2017. The UK has a Next Generation Transit Survey in the works, with a focus on discovering objects of Neptune&rsquo;s size and smaller around bright stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means we are entering an exciting time, according to Dr Mark Marley, a researcher who studies the atmospheres of other planets at Nasa Ames. &ldquo;In the next few years people will start to be able to identify the true Earth twins,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But compared to stars, planets are very hard to decipher in general, points out Burrows. Simply put, many more things can happen to them. Earth, for example, has a moon because it was hit by another object in its early life; Venus, although similar in size to Earth, has been left with a greenhouse effect caused by a toxic and thick atmosphere; and Saturn has its famous rings, which could have once been a moon. &ldquo;Each one seems to have its own unique story [of how it formed],&rdquo; says Marley, &ldquo;details matter a lot.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, theories will be adapted as more observations come in. While &ldquo;super Earths&rdquo; are currently the most common category of exoplanets, Beicham believes that the smaller rocky planets will soon overtake them in number, purely on the basis that it seems reasonable that smaller things may be more common in the Universe. Similarly, we will know more about whether our own solar system is atypical or commonplace. Just a quarter of 1% of the sky has been surveyed by planet hunters so far, which means there will almost certainly be many more outlandish discoveries to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burrows is philosophical about the point of all this effort. &ldquo;If you want to understand your origins, you have to understand them in the context of everything else,&rdquo; he offers. By that metric, the human species seems a very long way from an objective appreciation of its place in the Universe. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really say you understand Earth until you understand others like Earth.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-09-19T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why all we knew about planets is wrong","HeadlineShort":"The puzzle of planetary birth","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We thought we knew how planets form, but the discovery of hundreds outside our Solar System changed all that, even what type of world can house life like ours.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"slideshow","SummaryLong":"We thought we knew how planets form, but the discovery of hundreds outside our Solar System changed all that, even what type of world can house life like ours.","SummaryShort":"Why what we thought about them was wrong","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"94d208e4-670b-490c-9f38-9d7c1fefedea","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130919-solving-a-planet-sized-problem","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130919-solving-a-planet-sized-problem"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130919-solving-a-planet-sized-problem","_id":"559a5e10157e584f77e20697"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"LinkUrl":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22904141","Name":"Does gold come from outer space?","PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","SummaryLong":"The idea that gold came from outer space sounds like science fiction, but it has become well-established - it's pretty much received opinion in the field of earth sciences.

                 How cold can it get on Earth? How hot can hot truly get? And, perhaps more importantly, whats the ideal temperature a hazelnut souffle should be cooked at?
                </p>
                <p>
                 All important questions, and to find out the answers weve created the ultimate thermometer, which takes you from absolute zero to what scientists think is the absolute heat limit. Dress appropriately.
