    <h2>
     Format
    </h2>
    <p>
     To make the season more equitable and enjoyable for all levels of players 
    we have the following format:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Players will be divided into 2 seperate Divisions at the start of the year based on each players handicap or playing abilities.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Maximum score per hole will be double par for all individual stroke play events.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Maximum handicap for each player will be 32 for Men and 40 for Ladies.
     </li>
     <li>
      After each round all players will be split into Divisions 
      for the purpose of awarding each weeks points. All points will be determined 
      by the Net Scores of each player. All ties will receive the same points, 
      ie. if 2 players tie for low net they both will receive the 20 points allotted 
      for top spot. In a Team event all Members of a team will receive the same points.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Player of the Year Award for both Men and Ladies will be determined 
      by the total of their best 9 point getting weeks, starting with the April 
      12th tournament and ending on September 27th, a total of 14 tournaments.
     </li>
     <li>
      The Club Champions will be determined by a best 2 out of 3 event at the end of the season.
     </li>
     <li>
      The final week of the season will be a team "fun" format with prizes awarded, 
      no points for this tournament. The Awards Banquet will be held after the 
      round.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The league format will consist of 2 "Divisions", based on a players handicap. 
     Scoring will be based on both Metal play with handicaps and Team events with and without handicaps 
    the low net score will determine the winners. A point system will be used 
    to award all players with points at each tournament based on their final position. 
    The end of the year point totals will determine our "Player of the Year", 
    with a Mens and Ladies Champion crowned. To qualify for any of the end of 
    year Awards a Member must have competed in at least 9 tournaments throughout 
    the year. We also provide additional "side competitions" for all members to 
    enter each week at their own discretion. These competitions include KP's, 
    Skins and Dueces. Each one is awarded cash prizes.
    </p>
    <h2>
