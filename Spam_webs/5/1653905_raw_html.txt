            Do you have excellent credit? If so, banks are actively looking to win you as a new credit card customer by offering some unprecedented deals. Although banks have been more careful about acquiring customers with questionable credit since the 2008 Financial Crisis, they are now fighting harder than ever to win coveted customers with great credit. If you are in the excellent credit sweet spot, they are effectively giving you money (and a lot of it) to use their credit cards. These are the top 7 deals you can take advantage of today:

            : Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser)is such a great cash back card that I have one. Cardholders earn a spectacular 6% cash back at supermarkets (on up to $6K in purchases annually), 3% on gas and at department stores like JCP, Kohl's and Macy's, and 1% on everything else. Plus you'll get a $150 intro bonus after spending $1,000 on purchases with your new Card in the first three months  that's a 15% cash back bonus on the first $1,000 you spend! In addition you'll enjoy a 0% 15-month intro APR on purchases and balance transfers. There is a $75 annual fee, but depending upon your spending patterns this card should easily pay for itself and then some. If you want a similar card that has no annual fee, check out

            This card was designed with credit card balance consolidation in mind. It's the only card we've found with both a lengthy 0% introductory APR and no balance transfer fee.Its 15-month, 0% introductory APR on both balance transfers and purchases translates tointerest-free payments until 2016. Plus, there are no balance transfer fees during the first 60 days of card membership. This is a big deal, as depending upon how much you plan to transfer, balance transfer fees can really add up. In fact, a $0 intro balance transfer fee can save you hundreds of dollars in fees, and the $0 annual fee is also a money-saver. So if you have excellent credit, you absolutely should not be paying any credit card interest. Get this card and transfer your balances.

            Shopping for a special item for yourself or someone else? This card will let you make big purchases then carry that balance into 2017 without paying a dime of interest. Citi Simplicity (a NextAdvisor advertiser) features an incredibly lengthy 21-month 0% introductory APR for purchases and balance transfers. And there are no late fees, convenient if you sometimes forget to pay your bill on time, as well as no annual fee. The combination makes this card perfect for anyone looking to make a large purchase (or several purchases) or who is interested in transferring balances from other high-interest credit cards to this one. Either way it's a smart choice.

            The recently-launched Citi Double Cash Card features an effective 2% cash back on ALL purchases, the best we've seen for a card that offers a single cash back percentage on everything you buy. There are two steps two getting the full 2% cash back. Use your card to purchase the item(s) for the first 1% cash back. You'll receive the second 1% cash back after you've paid for your purchase(s), for a total of 2% effective cash back. As long as you're paying the minimum due each month you can take as long as you want to pay off your balance and get the additional 1% cash back (aka, 2% total effective cash back). In addition to this high cash back percentage, you'll also enjoy 15 months of a 0% APR on both purchases and balance transfers, giving you a little bit of a cushion to help pay items off. And to top it all off there's no annual fee and no caps on the amount cash back rewards you can earn.

            This is a rewards cards with lots of flexibility. It starts off by earning you 2 points for each dollar spent on travel and dining out, and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. That's followed up by a 40,000 point bonus after spending $4,000 in the 3 months  equal to $500 in travel rewards. Redeeming your earned points via Chase's Ultimate Rewards saves 20% off travel costs, enabling you to stretch 40,000 worth of points to $500 in travel. You can also redeem your points for cash back, gift cards and merchandise.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best part is that you can transfer your points 1:1 to many frequent travel programs with no transfer fees, including United MileagePlus, Southwest Rapid Rewards, Hyatt Gold Passport and Marriot Rewards. That means 1,000 points are equal to 1,000 partner miles/points, straightforward and simple. This feature is likely to appeal to road warriors who are members of various partner programs, as users aren't limited to spending their points via Chase's rewards program. There is a $95 annual fee, but it is waived the first year.

                Credit cards are an important part of the credit score.  They don't have to be used often, but occasional usage helps show that a person can use their credit wisely &amp; not get into to much debt.  Having too many credit cards is a risk &amp; lowers the credit score.  Managing each card's credit limit is wise as well, probably keeping total credit available under a years salary is a good idea.  Keep track of those balances to ensure that they can be paid off.  Credit card interest is expensive, which wipes out any cash back offer, so pay the entire balance off every month or freeze your accounts.  Literally, I had a friend show me how he manages his credit, in his freezer &amp; in a freezer bag filled with water &amp; his credit cards.  Credit cards are not evil, but used incorrectly they can become a waste of money.

                Also, I should throw out the caveat, I have this card only to have 'a card', and I've only used it 4 or 5 times so my account doesn't go dormant.  If you use credit cards, you are being fleeced.  I don't care how great the offer or agreement appears.  The companies always win, and win big. At your expense.  Use cash. If you have to charge it, you can't afford it.  Even if you pay off our balance each month.  You can't make any argument that you are somehow ending up on the positive end.  The banks win everytime.  You lose. Period.  Cash is King.

                Tasha, you omitted the Barclaycard Arrival MC which offers 2.2% cash back on everything. It's a great card without limitations or restrictions, and I've been using it for well over a year. It's easy to get the cash back rewards, as well as to earn additional points which effectively allows me to get a return greater than 2.2% back.

                Of course  you realize  the merchant pays a higher rate becuase of your reward cards / And thus YOU pay higher prices.

                How do i get the perfect fico score?  I know that by making payments on time, but  does a number of open  credit cards matter, balances, and  time as a credit card holder?  Any other idea?  My FICO  score right now is 756.  I want it better!  What do i have to do?

                I've got one,which i pay off every month.I would advise people to look farther down the road ,before using them too much!!! Rates may increase in the very near future.Do not carry a large unpaid balance every month.

                its not a matter of being able to pay cash. why would i do something as stupid as pay cash for something when I can use a card make 5% on the transaction then give the cash to my credit card company. If you dont use cards then you arent really good about making the most of your money.

                 These look good loan offers. This article just really helps me because he needed the cash because he wants to buy a new car.

                 I pay all my  bills via credit cards.  All have cash-back benefits. Payments of these charge cards are  paid when due directly by my checking account. No hassle about due date payments!  My credit score is excellent.  Have always paid bill when payment is due. So bill are paid, and besides receive cash-back.. Also have direct deposit.

                 If you have good credit and can competently manage your budget, you would be foolish not to use these cards.  I have made at least $5000.00 over the years by taking advantage of the introductory offers. (I currently use the double cash back mastercard, having just had $498.00 direct deposited into my checking from chase sapphire preferred).  I carry 0 balance and pay no annual fees, ever. Put your electric , phone, groceries, gas and anything else you can on the card!  Dummy!

                 Credit card spending is getting a rap here.  You HAVE to spend money, so you may as well get something for it. Do you buy groceries? utilities? Insurance?  How about Doctor's visits, gasoline, replacing an appliance.? You can live well within your means, and pay the balance in full each month. I watch what I spend, but I put everything I can on one credit card. I have redeemed points a few times, waiting until I get $500. I use it as a credit on my bill. You're really not smart if you aren't taking advantage of offers like these.

                 The highest return is not always the best when you don't charge enough to make up for the annual fee or dilute your charges by spreading them over several cards that give the highest returns in different specific categories.  Lack of a sign up bonus is significant negative also. It takes $20,000 in charges to make up for a difference of 0.5% in returns. Since many cards offer a big sign up bonus for spending around $500 to $1000 initially, $20,000 in charges could quickly earn many sign up bonuses by applying for several no-annual fee cards and stop using them after collecting the bonus.

                 When signed into law by President Obama in 2009, the Credit Card Act  sometimes called the "Credit Card Holder Bill of Rights"  was the most significant federal consumer financial reform in decades. The Credit Card Act went a long way towards curbing interest rate hikes, and banning the use of hair-trigger penalty fees rate, bait-and-switch tactics, and universal default. The terms of credit card contracts are clearer, and changes to them must be made in a timely fashion.

                 @KDW  The reason my credit score is near 800 is because I pay my bills on time.  I can't help that I'm responsible.  I have two credit cards and keep them both at a zero balance.  The reason I'm looking into another credit card is because I currently pay cash (debit from checking) for all of my groceries, shopping, and gas.  That's pretty stupid when there are credit cards out there that will pay me 2% cash back just for using them.  I'm not rich, by the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can tell you feel really smart because you just read a book about managing your money.  Just realize that there are several wise reasons for using credit cards.  Also, most people that have a high credit score don't strive for it.  It's just a side-effect of managing your money wisely.

                 People that worship at the altar of the Great FICO Score are delusional; there's absolutely no value in having a high score.  So what, you have a high FICO score?  That just means you're good at giving money to banks and lenders.  I seriously doubt if any legitimate millionaires even have a FICO score; years ago they learned to live within their means, paid cash, and invested (starting with small amounts) wisely.  It certainly isn't rocket science.

                 Nobody ever became rich by how they used their credit cards.  They became wealthy by NOT using credit cards.  If you're not spending less than you're earning today, what do you plan to live on when you retire?  Please don't say that you're going to rely entirely upon Social Security benefits; if it still exists in 20 years, it sure won't provide enough for you to live on with dignity.

                 Read Thomas Stanley's book, "The Millionaire Next Door" if you want legitimate insight into how succeed financially.  Spoiler:  It doesn't involve using credit cards or borrowing money from other people.

                 @Scott B  The Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express continues to offer 6% cash back at supermarkets (on up to $6K in purchases annually), 3% on gas and at department stores like JCP, Kohl's and Macy's, and 1% on everything else. You might have accidentally clicked on the link to the Blue Cash EVERYDAY Card from American Express, which only offers 3% cash back at supermarkets. Hope this helps.

                 Your story states, "Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express (a NextAdvisor advertiser) is such a great cash back card that I have one. Cardholders earn a spectacular 6% cash back at supermarkets "  BUTwhen you click on the link to the AMEX site, it states clearly that this number is THREE PERCENT (3%).   Is this an editorial oversightor did something change since April 1 (your posted revision date)?

                 Baymont Inn in anderson, Ca.. Spent a pleasant week there visiting our daughter. All staff went out of their way to keep us happy. The breakfast was free, plentiful, tasty and unlimited. The room was clean and airy. The Lcd led tv worked well. We had free wifi. We lost strength once and the sweet female at the desk reset it and all was well. What else can I say. The hotel is very clean and management is always on the premises. I was elated to find the owner working a shift. The hotel is located in a secluded, but major road accessible, near a shopping center and a Jack in the Box. We felt very safe there. As a retired State Investigator, security and being at ease is my first priority no matter the price!  As to the price it was most affordable. We considered staying at the casino but too many rift raff and yobs walking about. I would return there again. No problems and my wife will tell you, I look for them. Oh! And the owner is originally from Edison NJ!  I originally gave a 4 star but after re-reading my review and mindful this is not a 5 star hotel and since I could not complain about a single thing, I upgraded to 5*****!????????????????????????????????

                 I agree that using a 0% credit card to pay off major purchases or credit card or other loans that have interest charges is a good idea, but don't forget that a 0% credit card is still a loan and requires you to pay at least a minimum amount each month to maintain it's 0% interest status. Otherwise, it will end the promotion and begin charging the highest interest the card offers. Admittedly, some cards may offer a no payment feature until the end of the 0% period, but they are few and far between. Also, any card you hold or use is a mark against your credit and an indicator of how well you pay your bills. If you have a lot of credit cards and you pay them on time always, it shows the credit scoring companies that you can handle your debts well and that will increase your credit score. However, if you fall behind in any and you have a lot of cards that you use, your score may be seriously affected because it looks like you are "robbing Peter to pay Paul."
                </p>
                <p>
                 For all the above reasons, I use American Express because I pay all my debts in 30 days. I have been a debtor before and use debt to finance business expenses, but I always carefully review my cash flow to be sure I can payoff a debt before I sign-up for more debt. Credit is a long and poisonous snake. If you are not a careful user, it can bite you when and where you least expect with devastating results.

                 I'd be a better believer in C'cards if they wouldn't sit on the payment till the payment date expires, thus a late payment is tacked on.  when confronting them they'll tell me it's my banks fault.  hmmm my bank is prompt with everyone except American express.  mine is now shredded.  i'll stick to my debit card thank you.

                 Ginny's reply to Laurie (I think)  is similar to money wizard Suze Orman's recommendation for paying off balances.  Ginny's method is sound if paying off cards more quickly (pay down low balances first) is more important than saving money.  Suze's method concentrate extra money on the cards costing the highest rates first, then applying all freed-up money on the next highest rate, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 High postage costs to make the many payments can be avoided if you bank on-line, and the payments get there faster than snail mail.  Every personal check you send in the mail has your bank data and account number on it, making that method less safe than on-line transactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For consumers who have control over their spending, using a credit card instead of cash for most everything can earn a lot in cash rewards, and it is much more convenient, but one must be able to pay off all of the balances in full every month.  When you can do that, the rate charged is irrelevant, as you never have to pay it.  For those who can't make themselves do that, paying cash is better than high fees and repeated bankruptcy.

                 Laurie
                 <br/>
                 I had too many credit cards with balances on them and was given some great advise that worked for me so i will pass it on to you.
                 <br/>
                 Instead of paying a little over minimum on each credit card, pay only the minimum on the high balance ones and take all the rest of the money you would have put toward that and put it ALL on the lowest balance (if there is more than one that is low, choose the one with the highest interest first). Once that is paid off, put that card away and do not use again until you are out of debt. Then continue to pay off the lowest card and putting that away etc until you are down to the one card with the highest amount owed. Pay this one off before using any of the other cards.
                 <br/>
                 So if you have a card with $100  balance, one with $200 balance, one with $300 and one with $400 and you would normally pay $25 per month to each you would be paying $100/month in charges. if you pay only $10 on the on, $15 on the other, $20
                 <br/>
                 assuming those are the minimums, you could put  an extra $30 toward the $100 balance  which would bring that down to $45 balance ($30 +$25 usually paid)
                 <br/>
                 The next month that would be paid off and you would have an extra $25 to put toward card number 2 which would be paid off in 3 months. Card 3 then would be paid off in 4 months and the last card would be paid off in just 4 month because you could use the $100 for just that card.
                 <br/>
                 my math may be a bit off, but i hope you get the concept. after you have paid off your cards, don't use them again unless you have the money in the bank to pay off in full every month. Writing what you charge in your bank register and subtracting it from your balance will show you how much you have to spend. This also helps to watch for fraud since you would check off the charges that come in when you write the check to pay off your card. It's easy to forget what you charged and you could spend more that you think.
                 <br/>
                 this is not a lecture (though the length may seem otherwise) but i was in the same boat and i now have great credit and pay off everything each month.
                 <br/>
                 good luck

                 This is a reply to Mike Brink's comment above.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Are you serious, or, are you being facetious? I hope it is the latter, because there are a thousand reasons to have good credit.
                 <br/>
                 And, this article is actually VERY good information for people with good credit ratings.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let's say that you are going to make a huge purchase. To the tune of, lets say, $20,000. Why wouldn't you take a 0% (zero percent) loan for 15 months. You could keep your money in the bank, or money market funds earning you interest the whole time.
                 <br/>
                 Then pay off the free loan before the deal ends!
                 <br/>
                 So, you are using their money for free, and the whole time you are making money on your $20 grand cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, having good credit gets you MUCH lower interest rates when you are buying something like a car, boat, or your new home. Lets face it, VERY FEW people have hundreds of thousands in cash on hand to buy a house, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                 So if you buy a house with good credit, your payments will be way less. With a 30 year mortgage, that can save you $thousands of dollars.
                 <br/>
                 Not a bad deal when your only complaint is getting credit card offers in the mail. AND no one is forcing you to sign up for any of those offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would be curious to know if you have any feedback on what I said?

                 Quick and dirty answer to the interest rate issue  budget your money and don't use credit cards except to get the perks.  Credit cards are loans.  If you don't over spend then you don't need the credit cards, or at least you won't run a balance.  Don't buy what you don't have the $$$ for.

                 The point of these credit cards is to earn money.  The only way to earn money is to pay the balance in full each month or prior to the end of the 0% offer.  The APR of the card does not matter because you should never carry a balance.  If you consolidated other debt on a 0% card, divide the amount transferred by the number of months of 0% interest then pay that amount each month.  Any additional charges made to the card should be added to that monthly total and paid each month or you will still carry a balance at the end of the introductory interest rate period.  If you are unable to make that payment, you must reduce your spending or you will dig yourself farther into debt.

                 Why would anyone use cash over a credit card?  Pay it off every billing cycle and never pay interest. Time it right and you're using money that won't come due for two months.  Use your credit card in this manner and the rewards they give you is truly FREE money to use as you wish.

                 Forget good credit. I maintain a low score and I am better off with it.  High credit scores bring more credit card offers in the mail leading people to spend on credit producing more debt and heartache. This article is nonsense.  The banks are trying to look good but they are not. The bank is not a saint when it comes to money. They never were nor will they be in the future. This offer by the banks is a wolf in sheeps clothing.  Take a hike Mr, Banker.

                 I own and have owned over the years several varieties of rebate credit cards. I see and read many comments on the drawbacks of credit cards. Like any tool, it must be used for what it was intended. I have American Express Blue Cash and the card is accepted everywhere I have needed to use it. The card does exactly what they claim. The 6% on groceries is a true rebate. The posting claiming that credit cards are evil and are not preferred is not a completely true statement. Misuse and improper use of credit is what is bad. I do no use checks. This is just a tragedy waiting to happen. Unlike a credit card. You are not protected by issue someone a check.. Your check has everything on it for someone to commit fraud and empty your bank account. At the bottom of your check is your entire banking routing number and bank account number. A criminal just scans your check and begins printing counterfeit checks from your account. A credit card limits your loss to $25.00 for unauthorized purchases. On the issue of Cash.. To buy groceries.. fill the gas tank and pay with cash would require I have hundreds and hundreds of dollar of cash in my pocket and require constant visit to ATM or bank to replenish my wallet. The Credit card allow to purchase online and order items. I can hold/reserve a future purchase and I am able to cancel with ease. The fact a company gives a reward for the use of the card is good business sense. Vendors and store owners build the cost in the use of credit card. Sure, as an owner can offer a discount for use of cash. I find this more popular for stores who do not wish to sales tax and income tax purpose. With this all being said. If you can handle a credit card. American Express Blue is fantastic and web, mobile and customer support is superb and polished.

                 Who has time for all the restrictions? Blue Cash preferred from AE for example sounds great right? 6% back. Wow. But then you go to their site and realize they don't consider superstores or warehouse clubs a supermarket or gas stations. Thinking about itI get my gas at BJ's all the time and I do shop at superstores often so it really only benefits you if you are paying more to begin with by frequenting stand alone markets or gas stations.

                 I have a Capital One Sparks card that pays 2% on all purchases and no annual fee.  I never see this card listed as one of the best but I have never seen another card that offers more.  What do the "experts" that author these articles have to say about this card?

                 This note is about how bad American Express is. I had SPG card from American Express. Payment is always made on time and in full. One month I paid $15 (out of $3000+) less by mistake. I have a reading issue. I got charged $25 dollars in interest. I paid in full next month. I got charged another $14 in interest. I spoke to AE person name John and he refused to remove $14. I spoke to his supervisor in Fort Lauderdale she refused too. Not only she refused bust she put a block on any future credit. I wrote to CEO office they refused too. I also suppose to get 10,000 points after first purchase they didn't give. I spent $5000 which should have given me another 15,000 points. AE refused.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I told American Express to remove my family for all promotions. They are still sending me. My wife &amp; me cancelled our American Express cards. We will never have AE. Please note our Credit Score is 800+ and we always pay in full and on time.

                 Folks are just realizing that it is the small business that chooses to accept your card that is paying for all your card perks?   You want to be a bitter business owner because you believe you must take credit cards?  Maybe you like that immediate payment, chanting the same babble as you run the card, and are happy to turn over a percentage of your work to others to enjoy.  No?  Then, why do you participate and accept credit cards.  Never will I ever give even the best customer $75 of my hard-earned money.   I will share, pay it forward, give as I choose and can to those who need.  As a small business owner, we learned in the first six months in the mid-90's to stop harming ourselves for the convenience of others.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We do not want or need a relationship with your credit card company? Yes, we are one of those businesses who accepts only checks (who has a real checkbook anymore?) or cash.  (However, in our personal lives we use our one and only credit card that provides the finest perks.  All the gifts are purchased online using "points"gift-giving is zero.  Well, no.  Big businesses online and in real, life shopping are paying for the gifts.  Thank you, Macy's.  Thank you, Amazon.  Hypocritical?  Of course.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is ugly, and small businesses only harm themselves taking a cardor is a debit card safe?  Hmmm.  Maybe that is why our small business is by the grace of God successful and comfortably supporting uswe can charge less and still have a decent profit.  Grew up small town girl and now an older woman in a small town world.  We'll not become tycoons, returned to our home town and  here since mid-90's, no European vacationshell, no vacations since we began.  What beats self-employment and lots of time in yoga pants?   What trumps making your own choice, and embracing your decision.  (Hey, I carry a little old cell phone.  I know how to make a call for an emergency.  I like having the mortgage paid, good food to cook, a good old car to last my life, and owning my choices, our business, and our simple lives in undebtedness.  What is texting, tweeting, instagram.and, in our businesswho cares.)

                 A colleague likes Paypalall payments made as friends and family (a lie, I know) and it works for him.  Could it work for you?  When and where was it declared that if you establish a business, then you must accept a credit card?  Society expects it?  Their expectations are flexible with the right approach, attitude, explanation, and sharing a laugh.  If not, direct them to the next shop with a smile and virtual kick in the pants.  No, they really did not know it was from our pocket that they received that $75.  Yes, now they get it.  And, they will return for more.  Patience, honesty, and a smile work when your product, your talent is special.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you choose to take cardssuck it up.  Accept it, hush, unknit your brow, and move on.  If you want to try a change, create a plan, have an open house, call a local reporter, have your business featured and the wonderful work you doexplain how customers will appreciate and tresure your craftsmanship, talent, productsyour uniquenessand mention how you are simplifying and moving away from the losses endured accepting cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What good is "it" if "it" makes you crazy?
                 <br/>
                 Simplify.

                 A lot of "anger"  how can some of those who have posted be so angry about others of us getting a percentage of our hard earned dollars "back" based on how we spend our money?  Good credit has been earned by people like me  I am 46 years old and have NEVER as much as bounced a check  ever!  Never been late on a single payment, never defaulted on any debtwhy hate me?

                 The CREDIT CARD company doesn't give you ONE single penny.  It's the vendor (the place you spent your money at) that rewards you  using that credit card.  There is a higher swipe fee and a higher percentage rate for the vendor.  Hopefully soon, the vendor will be able to CHARGE the customer for using the cardeven it's only a paltry fee of a buck.

                 With grandchildren in distant states it is a must for us to travel.  Since we stay several weeks with our children at a time, we need to check luggage at the airport.  For that reason alone we save hundreds per year in luggage fees by having the airline card.  So ultimately it is ones' lifestyle that determines which card or no card is best for you.  I never have been tempted to overspend as some suggest the cards do.  I merely see them as a substitute for carrying a lot of cash I'd rather not and if I can get free checked luggage then so much the better.

                 I use an American Express Skymiles card and get enough miles to fly a couple times a year for free.  Plus I get two companion tickets so thats at least 4 tickets a year.  I pay the card off each month so there is no interest.  Just the annual fee.  I am very happy with it.  I will say that if you can't afford to pay your card off each month you probably should not have it.  Just use a debit card.  Debt is too dangerous to play around with.

                 So, all of these cards offer a rewards programs and that what makes them great, eh?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I suppose its great for the companies offering the cards because the more YOU spend, they more they make in transaction charges and account interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I suppose cardholders will argue they're great because the more THEY spend, the bigger the reward they receive.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It seems to me cash back reward programs are nothing more than a regressive sham, designed to deceive consumers who SHOULD know better into thinking they are  somehow receiving something for nothing and that these programs come free of       any other social or economic consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Given retailers will do what needs to be done to maintain profit margins, it makes sense that those participating in cash back programs are likely forced to raise prices across the board to cover the costs of that incentive program.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If so, that means EVERYONE, those who have cash back cards and use them as well as everyone else who either choose NOT to use a credit card or aren't able to  qualify for one of those cards pays HIGHER prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the "old days", some retailers offered discounts for cash but those days appear, at least for the most part to be gone now. I'd love to see those programs return!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why aren't there more consumer voices  calling attention to the inequity issue of why ALL consumers are being forced o pay more for almost everything we buy to fund cash back / rewards programs for a narrow and privileged  sub-section of the general population?

                 What this article doesn't address is with the use of RFID chips in credit cards, driver's licenses and passports is the fact that anyone can purchase a card reader which can then read the chip in these cards. Often referred to as "electronic pickpocketing", these card readers can read the info on the chip while it is still in your wallet. Thieves can simply walk by you with one of these card readers and take the info from the chip without anyone knowing. The only way to protect our info embedded in these new cards we will be getting, is to get RFID protected wallets which blocks the card readers from scanning the info on the chips. It seems with every new development technology makes, there are people out there one step ahead of  it and the consumer needs to be made aware of potential problems, even if the technology is suppose to help protect us.

                 I use the Citi Double Cash Master Card to receive 2% cash back on everything I purchase on the card (even routine monthly insurance &amp; utility bills).  But, I use the Chase AARP Visa Card to receive 3% cash back on Auto Gas &amp; Restaurants (1% on everything else).  With these two cards, I received the most cash back on everything that I buy :)

                 Fidelity American Express beats all these.  No annual fee, 2% cash back deposited directly into a Fidelity Account.   All the benefits of AMEX too.

                 Not at all excited about these cards.  For regular people, Discover is a better deal.  First, get a card holder to get you a referral  you both get $50.  Then open a FREE Discover checking account to get ANOTHER $50.  Check Discover Deals for cash back from just about everyone  typically 5%, but 20% on flowers.  Use your cash back to buy gift cards at a discount  typically 20%.  I buy Staples gift cards for 20% off their best deals.  Sign up for 5% cash back ON TOP OF Discover Deals each quarter.  Generally, they run 5% off retailers during the Christmas shopping season which will get you 10% back at all the big stores.  Almost forgot extended warranties, price protection, and free credit reports.

                 To Cheryl L.
                 <br/>
                 Instead of (or in addition to) a 4.4 % card, try to find an offer for 0% for a year (or the longest time you can find.)  The one mentioned in the article has no transfer fees so that would be a good choice. Then divide what you owe by the number of months the 0% lasts. Say you owe $3600. That would be $300/month.  You can pay it off at $300/month at 0% interest, providing you don't use it to buy more, or if you do, you have to add the amount spent in one month to the $300 payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you are very disciplined, you can do it this way instead:
                 <br/>
                 Pay the minimum on the 0% interest card, but put the difference in a savings or Money Market account if the minimum due is $40, you would deposit $260 in the bank if we use the example above)  I know interest rates are pathetic, but you might as well earn a little on the money. By the time the year is up, you'll have enough in the bank to pay it off (providing you don't spend it that's where the discipline comes in) and you can keep the interest you earned.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I did this for the last $3600 I owed on a cc back when they weren't charging transfer fees.  At the end of my year of 0% I found a 0% card for another 18 months. So I kept paying the minimum and socking away the difference between that and $300, even though I had enough to pay it off.  Then I found another 0% card and another. I always paid online, so I didn't even pay postage. I had enough to pay it off after a year, but since I didn't have to pay interest, I kept paying the minimum and putting money in the bank. At the end of 6 years, it was paid in full, and I had socked away about $250/month, plus interest.  I had more than $18,000 in a MM account and that became our emergency fund which, luckily, we've never had to use, but it's there if we need it and, of course, has grown with additional deposits and interest. We've invested some and paid off our house with some of it, but there is still enough to get us through most emergencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Everyone's goal should be to get out of debt.  I hear people say you shouldn't put anything into savings until you pay  off your credit cards.  I disagree. If you have no savings, if an emergency arises, you will end up going into debt again.  I hear people say that you shouldn't pay off the house if you can invest your money at a higher rate than your mortgage interest.  But, I know several people who lost there jobs, sometimes both adults in the household in 2008 or 2009.  Those that didn't pay ahead lost their houses.  Others had paid so far in advance on the mortgage that they didn't have to worry about losing the house in addition to losing their jobs. Remember that the economy will plummet again sometime.  It always does.

                 Someone asked why, if you have enough money and can pay your debts, why you would want a credit card.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Besides the fact that it's almost impossible to make an airline or hotel reservation or rent a car without a credit card, there is one great reason to use one.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For the cash back of course.  I pay for just about everything with credit cards. I'm not a compulsive shopper in fact I hate to shop.  If you are a compulsive shopper, this probably won't work. And it only works if you will pay in full every single month.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have several cards which I use to get the most cash back on the things I use.  I pay for groceries, utilities, and any other bill that will accept cc.   And I know which card to use to get the best rewards for various products.  It also cuts down on paperwork most bill are set to be paid automatically with a credit card and I set up all my cards for automatic payment in full. so I never pay a finance charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I got rid of all debt, including my mortgage by paying a $100 extra every month, no matter what, and using bonuses or overtime to pay even more. I'm not even close to being wealthy (now retired on a fixed income) so I can use the extra cash back even if it's only a few $hundred in cash rewards each year.

                 Re: GM card
                </p>
                <p>
                 The GM card is avail to anyone.  I think all rewards have to be used to buy GM vehicles.  At least that's the way it used to be.  (You should search for the GM card site to see the current details.) If you will most-likely buy GM sometime in the future, then it is surely worth it, because the rewards don't expire..  If that's not the case, then look for a different card.

                 First, please do not sell or give my e-mail to anyone. Question: I have been told &amp; heard from several cc authorities that if you have premium credit and decide to reduce the number of cc's that your credit score will drop. It seems illogical to me. I have zero on all my cards but more cards than I need. If I close some of the accounts logically, my score should go up. Can someone explain how to reduce the number of cc's &amp; escalate a current very good credit score to an even better score?

                 in articles re credit cards no one seems to include the gm card.  there is no annual fee,
                 <br/>
                 it pays you 5% on all charges, and  you can accumulate $500. in credits for a maximum
                 <br/>
                 of 7 years.  (that should read $500 a year).  so far, i've used over $8400 in credits when
                 <br/>
                 purchasing new gm vehicles.

                 IF you have sufficient income and no problems paying debt, why would you WANT a CC?
                 <br/>
                 In order to get excellent credit you have to have the above.  If you do you can live life happy and do what ever you want without a CC.  CC companies and credit reporting agencies are in league together to rope you into debt by offering you CC deals that seem too good for a short time then saddle you with hostile contracts that make you walk a razor's edge, virtually controlling your life.  I've lived the last ten years and have done everything I wanted without a CC.

                 I looked at Dr. Ken's comment.  You say you dropped all but 3 cards.  Did you close these accounts?  Because I have always been told if you pay off a card and then cancel it, that you credit score would drop.  If you are trying to get a score back up say to a 700 score it would not be easy if you get points deleted for doing the right thing of paying off and closing accounts.

                 I've considered several of these cards, but when it comes right down to it, my Capital One Venture wins  hands down.  Instead of worrying about how to maximize your points, you get a cosistent 2% back no matter what kind of transaction it is.  Annual fee is low at $60 (which I can often waive just by calling and asking), and I earn enough points for a free roundtrip ticket from San Francisco to Seattle just for paying most of my living expenses on it.  I've had the card for 23 years and see no reason to change it.

                 in all of the descriptions of the cards, I don't see any APRs listed. That is important to me because I often make large purchases on the one cash-back card I have. So far, my cash back and interest charges are about neck and neck. Another card has only 4.4% APR.

                 What no one seems to realize is that every new credit card you take lowers your credit score.  One of the components of your credit score is the average length of time you've had your credit cards.  Everyone is trying to entice you into getting their card whether its via money back or discounts (e.g. retail credit cards).  Folks struggling to make ends meet are taking store credit cards to help them lower their monthly expenses.  Then when they go for a mortgage or auto loan they are either denied or get a higher rate because of their low credit card score.  I dropped all but the oldest credit cards I have ( one VISA &amp; one MasterCard &amp; one Discover) and saw my credit score rise dramatically.  And when I saw an ad for a Discover card with a higher rate of money return I simply called Discover and had that card changed to that plan, getting me more money back without dropping my credit score.  My advice is to not fall prey to marketing schemes and forget retail vendor cards and simply change the plan of your bank credit card when a new higher-yielding plan becomes available.

                 I have at least 6 credit cards, excellent credit, and carry zero balances. As someone who chooses cards based on their travel benefits, none of the cards on your list interest me. I could care less about annual fees; for example, when I get a free night every year on my Marriott card, I've justified the annual fee. A low interest rate is also of no concern to me; more important are the sign up bonuses and the category multipliers.  I typically get 50000  70000 points or miles for signing up  if it's less, wait for the better deals to come around, which they always do. My Chase Ink Plus gets me 5X points on office supply, phone, cable, and internet purchases. So naturally my phone and cable bills are auto-pay on that one. And it's also 1:1 transferable to United miles. Both Marriott and IHG cards are 5X for purchases on their hotels and get me automatic membership in their elite programs. The United Explorer card gets me an additional 10K miles per year if I spend a certain amount, plus lounge passes. My best card is the United Select, which is no longer offered: 3X on United purchases and 5000 annual PQM miles.

                 I have the Citi double cash for most things, Sams mastercard for gas and eating out, Discover IT for rotating categories, and Capital one Spark for business.    2% is the minimum I receive on any purchase and it equates to over $2400 a year in total cash back.

                 Discover!  They are patriotic.  Even though it would be cheaper for them to do so, THEY DO NOT OUTSOURCE!  Even if u call them at 2 A.M., u will Speak to an American agent!  They are willing to invest in American jobs, at the risk of receiving lower Profit.  Kudos to them!

                 Sam's Club MasterCard gives you 5% back on gas, 3% on travel &amp; dining, and 1% on everything else. You need a membership, but that's the only "fee." In my mind, it blows these out of the water.

                 I like the comment "People with excellent credit are not worried about balance transfers or interest rates".  It is so true.  The only thing I care about is 1. is there zero annual fee 2. how much cash back does the card offer?  Also, I keep at least one credit card with zero foreign transaction fee.  People with excellent credit don't carry balances on their credit cards, so balance transfers and interest rates are irrelevant to them.

                 As to the comment about DISCOVERbeing from a military family I'd just like everyone out there to know that the "wonderful" DISCOVER card was the ONLY company that gave me a hard time when my husband was deployed to Saudi Arabia  during desert storm. According to the Soldiers and Sailors Act, should the activated service-person lose regular income (i.e.,their job) and/or be paid substantially less from the military they do not have to pay on the account until their tour of duty is over. This is the law. And DISCOVER was the ONLY company that gave me grief about this and made threats. They are horrible. So all militaty people (those on reserve esp.) beware of them. Needless to say I paid them over and shredded the cardI will NEVER do business with them again. Great card? I think not.

                 It's easy to SAY, "don't spend more than you make or can afford", (in this "I want, I want" society), Safe Housebut the REALITY is that most people don't have the financial skills  needed to know how to set up even a simple budget, (which is something folks like "Dave Ramsey &amp; his clones" assist thousands of people with daily)!  As a retired, widow, who just paid off my house mortgage, I'm glad I read "The Total Money Makeover".  I paid off my mortgage 4 years earlier because of it &amp; I have NO DEBT!  I also agree with the others who touted the virtues of the Discover Card.  I use it for EVERYTHING &amp; pay it off monthly.  Herb is right, their customer service IS stellar &amp; I just purchased a new MacBook Pro with my CashBack, (plus I bought all 11 of my grandchildren's Christmas gifts)!  None of the cards mentioned can hold a candle to Discover!

                 None of these cards are worth having. Explain to me why all these cards have 12-23% interest rates variable when the 10 year note  is below 2% and has been between 1.7 and 2.5% for the past 7 years.n  I have my CC through my credit union. My interest rate is more than half the lowest rate of any of these and its fixed.

                 People with excellent credit are not worried about balance transfers or interest rates.

                <p>
                 That said, if you are trying to get out of debt, getting that balance on a "no-interest on balance transfers" card is imperitive.

                 Hey "you're broke", you clearly are not qualified to give anyone financial advice. I use credit cards for nearly every purchase ($60K annual credit card spend). I do not pay a lick of interest as I pay all cards in full each month. My credit rating is also well into the 800's. The biggest difference? I get either several free airline tickets or a thousand or so dollars each year in rewards. I also get enhanced rental car insurance, extended warranties and many other benefits provided by the CC companies. Also, why pay cash for a car when you can get 0% or nearly 0% financing? Do you like giving away money? Your money should be making you 7% annually. I'd rather make money on that $40K than let the car dealers hold it. $40K is a heck of a lot more money all at once in 2015 than it is spread out over 5 years. That last $600 payment is not as much in 2020 dollars.

                 I don't need Dave Ramsey or one of his clones telling me not to spend more money than I make, really ?  Thats personal finance 101 .  There is nothing wrong with using credit wisely, just don't spend more than you make or can afford .

                 No need for CC's here. I pay cash for everything.  Go ahead get those anchors of debt. My credit is in the 800's and I have no CC. If I want a car I pay cash!!! If I want anything it's paid in cash. I owe all this too following Dave Ramsey. I suggest you do it as well. Quit drinking the Credit card Cool-Aid suckers.

                 The Bankamericard is a good card but beware a hidden scam:  If you take advantage of the balance-transfer option, there is an initial 2% fee (effectively the interest rate, which is OK at today's rates).  However, what then happens is that, if you use the card at all during the time the "loan" is outstanding, they sock you with at least a $1.50 charge (effectively hiking the interest rate of the loan).
                </p>
                <p>
                 The only way to avoid the interest hike is to not use the card, which can cost in terms of the generous cash-back.

                 The problem with this kind of evaluation is that it does not take into account how users are treated. I bought (on line) a standard retail boxed version of a Microsoft product.  unfortunately I was sent a disk which could not be used even if I wanted to, as it would be both illegal and non functional for my application. They even sent the product in an envelope which the could not possibly contain the Microsoft retail box. They refused to exchange for the correct product.
                 <br/>
                 No refund could be negotiated by the Credit card company, so they (Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express) approved the charge and refused to recognize the blatant scam!  So in a sense they are accomplices to an illegal operation.

                 Doesn't that give you confidence in their security on large transactions.?   And why the nominal benefits listed are not the real story.

                 You can take advantage of the programs of credit cards if you just make sure to pay off the last month's balance each month.  I must get 3 or 4 free airline tix every year because of it

                 If I get a new/different credit card.how will that affect my credit rating?  I would want to cancel my AmEx gold in exchange for the AmEx blue but I don't want to hurt my credit (which is excellent).  I am assuming from this article that the blue card is better than the AmEx gold?  Thank you for any insight you can give me.

                 you don't need credit cards for good credit. Cash in the bank will cover 99% of most emergencies.

                 Thank goodness credit cards were available when my car blew apart, kids were born, water heaters took a dump, etc.  Since I have never been able to catch up, my only alternative is to cap myself and call it a day.  Been a fun ride!!  later

                 Points and cash back will not cause me to abdicate my ethics.  I stopped using my Chase Sapphire card because of Chase's ongoing involvement in unscrupulous lending and subsequent evictions of families. We taxpayers pick up the tab for all the services a homeless family requires.

                 No AmEx products for me, either. My AmEx card was cancelled when I divorced, in spite of the fact that my income as a single was higher than the combined income of my spouse and I.

                 Higher interest rates + cash back vs. lower interest rates and nothing back.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look at it this way: All those cash back cards are doing one thing  using your money to make them money. You are basically loaning the issuing bank/card issuer your money, be it 1%, 2%, whatever, that they will use to earn interest that they keep. If, for whatever reason, you do not pay off your balance every month, that is a bonus for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sorry, but I will always go for a lower interest rate, no annual fee, no "rewards" card.

                 I pay everything with my BOA or Capitol One Cash Rewards cards. I get 1% on the BOA and an additional 1/2% because of an account at Merrill Lynch and I get 2% on everything at Capitol One. Just sent in yesterday for my Capiton One Rebate of $8007.00. The last one several months ago was over $12000.00. Over $20000.00 in 2014 and no interest paid. Not bad.

                 I use cash back credit cards and recommend them.
                 <br/>
                 It's free money because there's no annual fee for the BofA and Citibank cards I use. It's crazy not to use cash back credit for everything so long as you pay off the balance before interest charges are applied.

                 As a financial advisor I read most of these comments cringing. It's amazing how the average person does not understand credit and how it's necessary in today's world. Cash and cash transactions are certainly not king. Percentage rebates while clearing balances monthly is very smart and can make you a lot of money doing purchases you would normally do. Having a fee credit cards with excellent payment history will help you when you go to purchase a home, car or business . Don't be naivethe world isn't out to get you if you're a responsible adult.

                 I most certainly get something for nothing. I don't carry a balance, I pay the cards off each month, and enjoy the rewards (cash back).

                 Why is it when you use these card to earn extra money or lower interest rates you get a hit on you credit score??? That FICO score is just another way of screwing the public, it does not show how you pay your bills it is just a score to screw you on things you need a good score on.

                 A note to "Ben" about "The point is, if you use the card for all routine purchases, you get the % back for money you would spend anyway. It has nothing to do with net worth or wealth accumulation. It,s just a case of something for nothing.".
                </p>

                 This of course is not true the "nothing" is actually paid for by every merchant from whom you buy something.  Our Bed &amp; Breakfast alone paid $8,637.25 in Credit Card fees last year, and just like the cost of food, the cost of sheets, the repairs, the housekeeping costs it all has to be taken into account when we set our prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The net effect of all of these Rewards cards is that you end up paying more for the things that you buy.  And the kicker is, you are paying more for all your CASH purchases as well, because the card rewards have to be paid for somehow.

                 I didn't get past the first card on the list and I was in another browser window opening an Amex Blue Cash Preferred card account. I do not carry credit card balances. Getting 6% back on all my family's grocery purchases will be huge, as well as 3% on all our gasoline. I have a Chase Ink Visa card that pays me back 5% on all my phone, internet and cable / satellite TV bills. That card alone gives me back $15 a month, $180 a year, and also gave me back $219 for out-of-warranty repairs on my iPhone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You can play the credit card game to win, if you don't carry a balance. I'm not rich but my cards are paid down to zero every month.

                 The point is, if you use the card for all routine purchases, you get the % back for money you would spend anyway. It has nothing to do with net worth or wealth accumulation. It,s just a case of something for nothing. If you are unable to manage your finances, you'll probably mess up no matter what you do.
                 <br/>
                 Obviously, you must pay the full balance every month or it doesn't make sense.

                 @richard  the card you speak of, that I have, is 3% gas and 6% groceries, and has a 15 month 0% APR, as stated in the article.  Not sure where you got your info. BTW, Purchases at Costco and other warehouse clubs are not included in the 6% offer.

                 @JO  I guessing your Masters had nothing to do with the English language. You can have education, wealth management and an excellent FICO. By using cash you are leaving considerable money on the table. In the form of cash back or mileage rewards. For instance, I pay my necessary bills every month like everybody else. If I pay my bills through one of our travel friendly cards our yearly trip to fill-in-the-blank is already paid for. Do you get a free trip using cash to pay your monthly bills? And this is apples to apples, because we do not carry a balance on our cards. If we do it is on a card at 0%, i.e. same as cash. What's good for the goose does not appear to be good for the gander in your case. Maybe you should have studied Finance.

                 I have nothing against a credit score or credit card, but I know way to many people who get caught up in their credit score rather than their net worth. I have a bunch of friends and family who would always come around me and talk about how great their credit score was, and when I asked if they knew their net worth plus how long they could survive in their current lifestyle if they lost their job, none of them knew. So I took the luxury in showing them what my wife and I had accomplished slowly, because at the time we lived in a cheap apartment they was reluctant to listen to us because were considered "broke to them." So, one day I showed them I don't have a great credit score cause I don't use credit all that much my wife and I have 1 credit card we used 2x in 10 years for a rental car with a 2k limit. I also showed them because my wife and I are vets both our Masters degrees were paid for, we have no student loan debts. I also showed them we both are in careers and hold jobs that pay 100K plus, and had been saving for a house for 10 yrs and paid cash for a house worth 250k. Now, it is valued at 309K. I also showed them in our savings and investment portfolio we could survive 7 years and still live our life style if we lost our jobs, I'm sure that would give us plenty of time to find another job, unless we have a depression then we are all screwed lol. The point I'm making credit scores and credit cards are great, but make sure you know you are more focus on your wealth accumulation more than an electronic score. The minute a credit bureau file bankruptcy, well there went your credit score and a new company can come right a long and change the formula/algorithm that determines your credit score.

                 @JO, you really think the credit bureaus are going to go bankrupt? You're apparently not aware of their profit margins

                 I just visited the AmEx site this morning. The Blue cash card gives 3% not 6% on groceries, has no annual fee and is interest free for only 6 months , not 15. A rather different story than given here.

                 who cares what your credit score is the important number is what is your credit balance. . In my life it is like the national debt.  When you have a great credit score and a zero balance than you can say hah look at me.

                 Most 0% balance transfer offers come with about a 4% initiation fee, so beware.

                 I have a credit score of 375 and have transferred $42,000 worth of credit card debt to a MBNA Iammorespecialthanyou Card that pays me back 1% of every dollar in excess of $5,000 for each purchase and 17.99 APR. The key is to be a smart consumer.

                 IDK why people are publishing that they have a 800 plus credit score,first of all nobody knows you,second  of all no need to try to bullshit readers.You wanna impress me,put what your credit score really is.

                 Rebecca, having a spare card is nice in case their is a security breach on your card and the bank cuts it off/cancels it and its a week or so to get the replacement card. I had a friend with one card and while on vacation for 2 weeks his card got cancelled.

                 I have excellent credit (800+), but I will only use a CC that has no annual fee and pays me back for using it on things that are useful to me. Annual fee = no way for me.

                 Why have more than 1 card?  MAny reasons! The reason I have more than 1. I use Discover as my primary card. Some companies don not take Discover, so I use my Chase Visa on those occasions. Different cards may have different rewards for different quarters. So, you can use a specific card to maximize rewards.

                 Currently, I have 5 credit cards and I use them all every month. Most of them have 5% categories and I typically get 5% back on gas, restaurants, groceries and Internet purchases year round. I also get a minimum of 2% back in all purchases I make (citi double rewards card mentioned above). It doesn't sound like much, but it adds up quickly and I always pay the balances off each month. My gf has student loans and  she just got the chase slate card. We immediately transferred her 6.8% interest student loans to the card and it doesn't have to be paid for 15 months. This is significant savings and she even has some tie. To pay down even more student loan debt before paying the card back. It's all in planning and remember these savings are net.no taxes (if you're in the 25% tax bracket $1,000 cash back in 1 year is equivalent to $1,250 gross earnings.I think people forget this sometimes and it's also significant.) Don't listen to people who tell you to use cash.cash is no longer king and it's only hurting you. A lot of these cards are very beneficial if you pay your balance each month. If you have bad credit, work on making it better so you can take advantage of these great deals and further enhance your standard of living. I am a CPA, too, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to finances :)

                 Can someone tell my why more than one card is needed?  I have excellent credit, pay my balance every month, and have had one card for the last 15 years.  It is BOA by the way and I've never had an issue.

                 Hello, Folks!
                 <br/>
                 I asked Wellsfargo for a credit card for about five years. They always said no to me because I did not have a Credit History. To apply for a Government job, they told me I needed a credit card. I had been getting letters from Capital One offering it to me. I gave it a try and I was approved in five minutes. I have never had an account with this bank. Now that my credit is "excellent", my main bank, since 2005, Wellsfargo,  sends me pre-approved applications every week. But No! I am very happy with Capital One since they gave me this card I use so well since 2011 ? I pay the whole amount every month. One credit card is more than enough for me.

                 I had the pleasure of dealing with BOA goof ups, they messed up my credit for 3 years. I stopped doing business with them. I am not rich nor do I have money on hand to get prepaid cards. How ever I have managed to keep my credit in the 800 range.
                 <br/>
                 People there is no secret to this. I have at least 10  cards. I pay my cards on time and at least the minimum if I don't have funds to pay it off and when I do have money I pay them off. Don't use your cards to buy things you cant afford.Do use them for things you can.
                 <br/>
                 I rarely carry any more than $10. in my wallet. I use my cards to buy everything. that way I can keep up with my expenses, and I think twice before taking out that plastic.

                 I'd have no credit card if I ever had to have another BOA card.  They are the most dreadful people to do business with.  I had to deal with losing some credit score points but I dumped them anyway.  Best thing ever.

                 i'd rather do business with a DOG, than BOA. and why pay a FEE to own a piece of plastic that others will make money on anyway? that is total GREED. its a definitive no-brainer NOT to do business with people like this.

                 Keep one card, take installment credit and pay it off as required.

                 Applied pre-paid card knowledge.
                 <br/>
                 1) Make sure you have pre-paid cards with each of the wanted logo's.  While an American Express Blue Bird card is great, it does not work for vendors that do not accept American Express.
                 <br/>
                 2) Consider physically locking up your core bank cards and put strong alerts on these, for unusual transactions.
                 <br/>
                 3) Sort the vendors you do business with and keep track of which pre-paid bank card does business with which pre-paid card.  This will help you identify the source of data breaches, hacks, unwanted data sales, and telemarketing schemes by the vendor responsible.
                 <br/>
                 4) If you really want to extend the protective effect, get a few free email accounts and pre-paid cell phones.  Then, by the address of the email, phone number called and pre-paid card used, you can totally identify the source vendor for any transaction, call, telemarketing gimmick, spam email.  The data will be so good, you can even engage a lawyer and hunt the firm that abused your trust.

                <p>
                 People with excellent credit should be getting pre-paid bank cards.  These should take the risk of internet transactions and identity theft while your core cards only transfer cash to your at risk pre-paid cards.  Then, an attack on your excellent credit, bank cards, online accounts will have lower attack surfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Consider a Target grade breach.  Only the pre-paid care balance is at risk.  The core bank card that transferred money into the pre-paid card would require a second data breach to harm you.  If the prepaid card gets messed up; cut it up and get a new prepaid card.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Your core cards will have no mystery vendors and any transfer not initiated by you is bogus by definition. A vendor with unwanted renewal charges cannot get beyond the pre-paid card balance without telling you.  (The card would bounce for a unapproved charge  that is fraud and you would win any legal contest every time.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 The same would happen if a bank made the fee.  Heaven help the hacker in that case.

                 Beware of Chase Credit Cards.  They added a $75.00 charge to my bill from some company they thought I would be interested in, without telling me.  They were banking on the idea that I wouldn't review the charges on my monthly billing statement.  I called to get the charge removed.  The associate transferred me to a supervisor who told me this was standard practice and to improve customer satisfaction.  So apparently this wasn't some minor mistake.  After they removed the charged, I immediately cancelled my card.  They are dirty, never again will I do business with them.

                 Its obvious that all the credit card holders arent as uneducated as the banks would like to belive.  Its a fact that people try to live beyond their means and thats what keeps the machine well oiled and the pockets of the top %1 filled. These same pockets fund political campanges, own tv &amp; radio stations and we dont need to mention the internet and its directed marketing , abuses and privacy violations.  Nothing is sacred,  privacy in an illusion and security is just a worduntil it is not.

                 This is a terrible article!  No mention of fees or interest rates for any of these cards.  I have the Citi Simplicity card, and it has the highest interest rate of any card I've ever carried.  And you only get these sweet bonuses if you spend 3, 4, 5 thousand dollars in 3 months?  Good way to take that fine credit rating and grind it into dust.  I got my excellent credit rating by being smarter than this.

                 I have to agree with the comments about the banks being able to easily afford these deals.  It's just simple business mathematics.  The banks wouldn't offer any of these deals if they actually had to put money out of pocket.  They are in the business of making money and these are just another shrewd tool to lure in more clients.  The reality is that most credit card holders do not pay their balances off every month, and the banks are counting on this.  Interest charges are quite lucrative and fill the banks' coffers each and every month.  Afterall, when was the last time you heard of a bank having zero profits in a quarter?
                 <br/>
                 Having said that, if you can pay your balance every month, some of these cards offer excellent rewards so why wouldn't you take advantage of them???

                 I have a small business and accept plastic.  I'll gladly pay the 2% fee over taking checks as I'm assured of getting paid unlike a check which are easily forged.  I don't take American Express as they want to charge 3.5%.  I also buy product via credit cards getting points for travel / hotel.  I always pay off my cards so do not have to pay interest.  For me it's a wash, pay 2% for transactions but get points when buying product that I use for air fare and hotels.  The one's getting hosed are those who can't afford to pay off their cards and pay high monthly interest.  For others, credit cards let you borrow bank money at no interest for up to 45 days (depending on when the item was charged), and, can take free trips on occasion.   Last month I was reimbursed a hotel bill and just yesterday I booked two airline tickets for $1300 which I'll be reimbursed fully on using credit card points.

                 Seems there is a lot of concern about who pays for these.  IMO, I could care less who pays for them.  I'm taking advantage of an opportunity that is available to meand everyone else.  Call me naive if you will, but I don't see where this is a problem.  A side thought, if I go out and get a degree that is more desirable and pays more than others, is it my fault that I accept the potentially greater pay that goes with it?  I say smart money management will prevail, the rest will fall behind.  This isn't greed, this is plain smart.

                 I am far from being rich and I have a top of the line credit score. I never purchase  anything  that I can't  pay back within two billing cycles.  You just have to be responsible and know your limits. Don't live outside your means. It's that simple.

                 I have been a Capitol One User for a long time.  I have purchased plane tickets, hotels, and used their eraser system.  Hands down no other credit card comes close.  I had blackouts and restriction on other cards.  Not Capitol One, they are my last credit card company Best around !

                 this article is so stupid.  Yes I have AmEx Blue Cash Preferred Card.

                <p>
                 Let's face it, if  you have great credit, then you pay off your credit card balance fully every month.  that means no one cares about APR or balance transfer crap.  half of those cards he listed up there is worthless.  If you are going to pay off your balance in full every month, it's all about the cash rewards.  AmEx Blue cash preferred and Citi double points cards are nice but others are pretty crappy.

                 I don't get what all the arguing is about. I had (still have them but don't use them) a Bank of America Wold Points &amp; a Citi Thank you Rewards. I'd talk to friends that were actually getting something from using the CC's &amp; thought, Why aren't I? I realized its mainly because I don't travel much so the World Points was pretty much a waste. I primarily used my Citi Thank You card &amp; didn't pay attention to the rewards. I ended up switching, which I'll get to in a minute. When I looked at the Citi Rewards and how many points I had accrued, I realized I could get some pretty decent stuff, or wasn't far away from having enough points to get something I wanted. I don't think the points expire (at least I hope not soon), &amp; when I have the time will see what I want on Citi Rewards and either get it, or start using the card again to get the points I need for what I want.
                 <br/>
                 Here's the good part, when I was sitting down with an employee at Bank of America, as a Preferred or Platinum client (I forget which, I think it depends on where you are and I moved between states &amp; back again.) They suggested the BOA Signature Visa which has cash back (&amp; then some!), which I applied for, when I first got it I was a little surprised that I didn't get a Platinum (or something like that) card. I was told by BOA that the Signature Visa (Sig Visa) was actually a higher level card then a Platinum, at least at BOA. I like to have plenty of available credit but not an outrageous amount. I was a little surprised when the cards limit was only in the mid-4 digits (I don't feel the need to go into detail, lets just say $3-7,000), I asked for an increase right when I got my card &amp; they took me to 5 digits ($11-$15,000), which is what I wanted. I still don't understand why they won't just tell you how much your approved for &amp; instead you have to ask for an amount &amp; they say yes or no, I've found this with all CC's. Anyway, as I said, I don't like having huge cards &amp; with the various cards I have, besides the Citi, &amp; the still open 5 digit BOA World Points, so I have with BOA alone a decent amount of credit between the 2 cards I have with them. I usually only charge around $1,200-$1,800 per month, with the rare $2-4,000 in a month, so I feel comfortable with the available credit I have if I should need it. I'm actually surprised how low it is considering I rarely use cash &amp; charge everything to the Sig Visa card, even my $1.75 cup of coffee.
                 <br/>
                 My Sig Visa has no annual fee, &amp; (I believe these numbers are correct), I get 3% on gas, 2% on Groceries, &amp; 1% on everything else.
                 <br/>
                 I pay off my entire previous months balance so I pay no interest.
                 <br/>
                 Here's a little trick I learned that may be helpful. To avoid, what I see people complaining about, hidden fees, or late fees, etc, as soon as my statement comes out I'd transfer the minimum due from my Checking, that way there was no chance of late fees, &amp; the only possible hit I could take was if I forgot to pay off the entire balance before the due date. I realized, Why am I paying it now instead of right before its due, so being able to set up transfers in advance, when I get my statement, right away I setup a Transfer for $25 or $50 (the minimum is $25, but for some reason I like setting it up for $50). I then put in my phone's calendar a reminder to pay the balance before the due date. But for those complaining about "Hidden Fees" I'm not sure what your referring to as if you do like I do &amp; setup a transfer of the minimum for the day before or the day it's due, there won't be any "Hidden Fees, Late Fees, etc." &amp; the way I look at it, if I don't have $25 or $50 in my Checking account, I have a lot bigger problems then paying my CC bill! I have yet to forget to pay off the balance before the due date due to the daily reminders I get from my phone the week before the balance to avoid interest is due. So I'm not paying any "Annual Fees" or any Interest on my card &amp; I'm earning cash back on my purchases which is why I use it for everything. As I mentioned way back, the Sig Visa has even more. The even more is that if you transfer your earned cash back into your Checking or Savings, as opposed to using it to pay your CC, they match 50% of it! So when I transfer $50 in cash back to my Checking, I have $75 deposited into my account ($50+50%=$75). Talk about free money! Usually by paying my statement balance my card is left with a low amount of used credit, however, I like to keep it at under 10% of my credit (on this card) utilized, so if I charged a lot after the statement closed, I'll send more then the entire statement balance to get the card back below around 10%.
                 <br/>
                 I'm not sure this whole long post was necessary, as my point is simple, spend what you can afford! If you can do that, it really doesn't matter how you spend it, whether in cash, a check, or a credit card. But, if your spending what you can afford, you might as well make the most of it. Of course the Banks want us "Deadbeats to pay Interest", but as two things that have been mentioned numerous times come into play. 1. Us "Deadbeats" that can pay off our balances every month are usually spending more than the average person that can't, &amp; their getting fees from the Merchant. 2. is it the Bank paying the extra or the Merchant so they charge more? Yes, it is mostly, if not all the Merchant that is paying it so is charging more, but we might as well take advantage to minimise this cost. Is it fair? No! But who said life is fair? Yes the people with the lowest incomes &amp;/or poor credit  pay the most, &amp; the middle class pay less then the poor, but still pay, &amp; the Deadbeats pay the least, whether by getting cash back or through other means, it's called Capitalism! Sure I could of sat around &amp; did nothing and be making $10-$15/hr, &amp; my wife could of too, but we worked, tried to be smart about it, and yes it is a different world from the person before that mentioned they're making $16/hr &amp; living week to week, which I fully respect anyone that works, when together my wife and I make around $80/hr in a 40 hr week. Am I loving my new Infiniti I got last week? Sure. Can I afford it? Yup. Sure I could just spend it in cash, but I'd get nothing in return. So I use my CC to not only earn cash back, but get another 50% added to my cash back! I'm not great with math, but if you include that 50% they match, in reality I must be earning a lot more than 1,2, &amp; 3% cash back, maybe someone that knows math can figure it out for us.

                 p.s. To "Sherman" that said it took months to get their BOA cash back, I'm not sure where your going, but if you log-on to BOA's website &amp; go to your CC &amp; click on Earned, you can enter an amount (with a 50% bonus for me if into Checking or Savings), and click Redeem. It usually takes 1-2 business days for that money to show up in my account.

                 The author needs to do more research.  There are much better deals than this out there.  For example, my primary card has no annual fee, 1.5% cash back, and an interest rate of 7.9%.  In addition, I get 5% back on gas (although that is not much anymore!)

                 Using credit cards its just like buying something on payments but instead of paying  to the company you brought it yoyre paying it to the bank. If you cant affort the monthly payments just simply dont buy it you'll end up losing by the end of the day.

                 Wellif I pay by cash, I pay exactly the same amount of money as(in any grocery store or gas station)  if I pay by credit card, with the disadvantage of that by paying cash it does not give me anything back, credit cards are giving me, cash back, rewards, miles etc. I been able to buy gifts for my kids and grand-kids with just the accumulated rewards in credit card, while I had no more money to spend, I am very responsible and I have an excellent credit 850+ because I used them wisely, I never spend more of what I could buy with cash, but I chose to use credit cards and use the cash to pay it back, to take advantage of the rewards or cash back that I would not get if I pay by cash in the stores, those stores or gas station charge the same amount of money for the same product to people who pay cash or to those who pay by credit cards then why not to chose to use the credit card if I am going to get some money back, some how..

                 A major point of difference between the green American Express card and this Blue Cash Preferred card from AMX is the green card does not have a spending limit and the blue card does. That is why I decided to stay with my green card. I actually bought a car with my green card once. Paid it off when I financed it but that was a time I was glad I had no spending limit (other than AMX deciding they are OK with).

                 What's funny to me is that a few years ago when I still worked for a living, I was at a place waiting for things to take place so I could continue on with my job, I was sitting in a break-room reading a sort of financial magazine when I came across an article that was pretty much put out by the credit card  complex saying that people like me were considered "deadbeats". That peaked my interest so I read their justification for that theory. People like me pay off their credit card statements every month and pay NO interest.  What a horrible thing to do!!  Their contention was that "People like me just "use" the system and don't pay for it". Well, they do have a point there, but, I didn't force them to issue me the cards. I know that they want me to just pay the minimums so they can make lots more money on interest charges, but I choose to use credit cards for MY convenience and advantages. I have excellent credit scores, I don't demand they issue me a card, I know they don't really want me to pay it in full every month, but at the same time, NONE of them have ever cancelled a card from me because of it.  So, I guess I'll just go on being a "deadbeat" in their eyes.

                 I'm surprised no one has mentioned this issue so I will. I had to deal with fraud and someone thought they could charge a plane ticket to my card. I was able to go through and check to see how the rewards on my cash back card were tallied but after I confirmed the fraud the credit card company had taken away the ability to view the way the points/rewards/cash are tallied. This is the new norm on some other cards as well. I'm looking to dump one card and get another for travel only. Has anyone else seen this?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Does this not freak anyone else out? How can I know without a doubt that I'm not getting ripped off? Sure I can do the math but taking out the option to go over the transaction itself in more detail is making my skin crawl. I'm also one of the few who goes over the credit card agreements with a magnifying glass and opts out of their annoying marketing garbage. They love to sneak in little things and hope no one notices small changes to accounts that work only in their favor.

                 I also have student loans and have thought about transferring one loan to a credit card and paying 0% interest for 18 months and getting rid of that loan. Why don't colleges allow students to pay their tuition through credit cards? Those greedy "educational institutions" don't have the kind of leverage or profits they've grown addicted to. That's why! They don't want to lose money to all those transaction fees or argue about a student's right to question the validity of a course in relation to their degree.

                 I have a Bank of America card that says they give 3% cash back on gasoline purchases, but I  almost always get only 1% back because of the fine print that excludes gas purchase at many merchants. These merchants are often the low price leader (on purpose, I strongly suspect). Please just release the lock against merchants discounting for cash, and I'll pay cash if it is a fair discount!

                 Tim,  Yes, the card companies/banks  charge the merchants a fee for the transactions.  This fee is rolled into the cost of doing retail business, which is included in prices.  But guess what  every other form of payment has a cost also.  When accepting cash payments, merchants can expect to spend upfront to establish a supply of change (cost of money, assets tied up.)  There is the risk of theft at the register, from robbers, employees, and short change con men.  There is a small counterfeit risk.  Do you think those Brinks trucks and guards provide a free service?  What does the safe cost, to buy and maintain?  What does insurance and bonding of employees cost  is it more if you handle lots of cash?  You betcha.  And don't get me started on the grief  involved in accepting checks or private credit accounts.  The convenience for customers is not the only reason merchants choose to accept credit and debit cards.

                 Citi Double Cash Card: "As long as you're paying the minimum due each month you can take as long as you want to pay off your balance and get the additional 1% cash back (aka, 2% total effective cash back)."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Problems, if you pay only the minimum required every month, you A) will NEVER pay off this debt which increases the amount the bank makes on their relationship with you making the 1 or 2% they give back TO you a monumentally small fraction of what they are getting FROM you and B) you will not maintain your lofty credit score so that means that not necessarily everyone with that card has excellent credit if they abide by this 'requirement'. Do the people who wrote this article even think before putting together such a pile of drivel? Not to mention that in addition to any interest, fees, etc that they are getting from you are only part of their benefit from you, any place you shop with their card is paying a percentage of your purchase to the bank. I wish that this type of article would not be published, as it's basically a cheering section for the banks that are making money hand over fist at our expense, and can cripple cardholders in the end.

                 I have the Chase preferred sapphire and have found that it works great with my chase freedom. As I can transfer my freedom points and take advantage of the 20% bump on travel. Also, no foreign transaction fees is nice.

                 What about Capital one?  For my card I pay a measly $39 per year and get 2% on every purchase by applying the credits to anything related to travel within the past 90 days.  Also, no extra charge for purchases in foreign countries.

                 Great discourse because reading the variety of opinions gave me better insight into the diversity of thinkingespecially how we absorb the ideas of other citizens through our own filters. In my opinion, I think Tim is right. Many of you miss the point. By the way, I pay my monthly credit card bill down to zero monthly. Yes, that is the best way to get something back. However, the problem is not all about me and my realization that it's best to maintain control over spending. Folks, we have a systemic problem that will eventually lead to another economic meltdown. A situation that will probably be worse than 2008 and 1933. This is like trying to explain to my mother that the new company she just signed up with is another pyramid scheme. America, whenever you have a market where there are whole sectors of the population not understanding a system they are participating in, we all lose. If you think it's alright to have neighbors on the way to hell while you remain silent collecting "smart money", think about having another time where whole neighborhoods become desolate wastelands. The credit card industry needs people who don't care about others, people who can't get beyond their own selfish thinking. We need regulations to control fraud or we will all drown when the next storm arrives. Understand that fraud happens through the actions of low life individuals as well as organizations that are allowed to run arbitrarily. Not factoring in the fraud of the credit card industry will be our greatest downfall.

                 What this article doesn't tell you is that people with "great credit" don't need to spend $75-100 a year simply to have the card, even if the fee is "waived the first year."   I wonder if this is much more than a kind of snobbery to flatter those who need never pay interest rates anyway because they pay their bills in full  then sock it to them by imposing such high maintenance fees?

                 I got the Blue Cash Preferred American Express card recently, set up automatic monthly payment of entire statement amoumt, charged $1000 in the first month, and got $150 reduced from my statement as noted here.  That pays for 2 years $75 annual fees and  one of which was charged at the same time as the $150 bonus!
                 <br/>
                 But because of the limitations on what's considered a "supermarket" or a "department store," I think I would have been better off with the Costco American Express Card.   The 6% cash back doesn't apply to Walmart (1% cash back), Target (1%), Costco (1% including gasoline), and other "warehouse stores" that aren't considered supermarkets or department stores. You get get 3% cashback at only 16 specific name departments stores.
                 <br/>
                 If you shop a lot at the relatively expensive supermarkets, where prices are often 10% or more higher than the warehouse or discount stores, the 6% cashback doesn't help.  I shop at supermarkets for things like milk in wax cartons (usually 1 month expiration dates), certain fresh veggies, fresh local kielbasa (REAL Polish sausage), etc.
                 <br/>
                 So I am using the card and I used it on a $1000 expense when I first got it to insure I'd get the $150 bonus.  But it's mostly for gasoline (3% cashback), small grocery purchases, and occasional department store visits (Macy's, etc.).
                 <br/>
                 I have  an Amazon Visa that gives me 3% cashback at Amazon.com, 2% on drugstores, restaurants, and gas stations, and 1% everywhere else that's more handy.
                 <br/>
                 I'm going to see how this card works out for several months and then probably switch to the Costco American Express Card.

                 So in protest against all things financial, you would boycott getting a deal on a credit card.  You can feel smug in knowing that you have given a philisophical finger to the "man" .   Meanwhile the world keeps turning and others keep saving money and bettering themselves.  Good for you.

                 The Andrews Federal Credit Union currently offers the Globe Trek no fee, no foreign transaction fee Visa chip card with pin. I have used this card in Canada with no problem. There is even no cash advance fee and if you qualify, a 9 month 1.90% interest rate on outstanding balances such as from cash advances. There are restrictions such as a military association to qualify to join the Credit Union. However, non-military can join  the  American Consumer Council (ACC) to qualify which has a small fee of $5 or $15. I believe by the end of 2015, most cards will have the chip + PIN capability.

                 So the first credit card recommended is American Express.  My last statement from AMX listed Walmart as a "DISCOUNT STORE" and gave me 1% instead of the percentage it pays for Department Stores.  I will be cancelling this card when my next statement arrives.

                 An excellent article written by someone who makes thou$and$ more than I do.  Credit cards exist to live on interest.  Please run up a large balance that carries over to next months/years.  The card companies hope you stay swamped, but not declare bankruptcy.  NO card company cares about you or your happiness.

                 What a great set of thoughtful and intelligent comments.  I would only like to add a couple of thoughts.  First, the concept of "greed" is so riddled with emotion as to necessarily produce some distorted conclusions.  I have always believed that everyone is greedy insofar as everyone wants a bit more than they already have.  If a person is greedy and unsuccessful, we overlook his greed as is the case with the person standing on line for hours to collect welfare, but if he is successful, then we can see his "greed."  It is as if we automatically consider any successful person to be greedy while the unsuccessful are only needy.  That just doesn't make sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My second observation is that as the use of credit cards is voluntary to the consumer, so is the acceptance of credit cards voluntary to the merchant.  So even though accepting credit cards adds to the merchant's cost of doing business, necessitating his charging higher prices, it apparently adds enough gross sales volume to justify that increased cost of doing business.  Those who use the credit cards, if they only buy what they could afford to buy for cash (this is the key criterion) benefit, by virtue of both the rewards programs and the convenience of easily establishing records and audit trails of their purchases.  In other words, they save by using credit cards.  The merchant may indeed have to charge higher prices to cover the costs of the credit cards, but consumers paying cash also must bear the burden unless the merchant offers a cash discount (prohibited by the merchant agreement, by the way).  So those costs are passed on to all consumers, just as the Corporate Income Tax, Employer paid Payroll Taxes and the almost incalculable cost of regulations as well, get passed on to the consumer.

                 We, just like every other country, have a Capitalist/Socialist hybrid kind of economy, where the government steps into just about everything with their plan to make things somehow more fair, usually with less than satisfactory results (the so called "War on Poverty").  Once we understand that abilities vary from person to person, just like levels of determination vary, it becomes clear that you cannot have "equal opportunity" AND "equal outcomes."  If you want equal opportunity and you accept that there are unequal abilities, outcomes must be dramatically unequal.  If you want more equal outcomes and you accept that abilities vary, you must give up "equal opportunity."  Read "Harrison Bergeron."

                 @ron: Tim can complain about capitalism all he wants, without moving to another country.  That's half the point of living in this country, we can complain all we want about whatever we want and maybe enough complaints will affect some kind of meaningful change.  If you have a problem with people complaining, perhaps you should move elsewhere?

                 Banks and oil companies provide services that people need.  Businesses can pay a monthly fee for accepting credit cards, which is practical if they do enough business, and they're not really losing anything or passing that cost along to the consumer because the convenience of accepting debit or credit brings them more business.  If you don't accept debit or credit in this day and age, you're dumb, and i'll just take my business elsewhere.

                 Credit card rewards programs are great "IF" and this is a big "IF"- you pay off your balance at the end of every month.  I charge up all my bills on mine every month and then pay that one card off.  Excellent way to earn rewards AND stay out of debt. This is not for the undisciplined.

                 This report is another attempt to get you on the debt train. BE SMART about all aspects of credit. Your credit rating will improve if you limit the use of cardsRESEARCH the TRUTH behind the fico score. Use credit cards (and not debit cards) for large purchases; you are protected if the product or service becomes an issue later on. Then focus on gas and groceries for the card that pays the highest reward (keep in mind LIMITS of these purchases). PAY CASH for all incidentals! If you TRAVEL, ensure your card covers you or get travel insurance. The most important factor is knowing what are your NEEDS and absolutely use it RESPONSIBLYit is easy to understand your debt to income ration, credit report, FICO scores (all three), credit balance versus total credit available, and most importantly checking the FINE PRINT on these offers.  Cards described in this article are good, but not without a thorough UNDERSTANDING of credit and WHAT THE BANKS GET out of it all.

                 @ Think for Yourself September 21, 2014
                </p>
                <p>
                 The avatar name you chose for yourself is quite ironic, considering how you belch and fart out tiresome and divisive right wing Fox News talking points.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Corporations do not pay 35% + tax rates.  Most peopleincluding those at Fox News dont understand the difference between marginal and effective tax rates let alone corporate
                 <br/>
                 gimmicks such inversions and loopholes that allow them to pay FAR LESS (if anything) than 35%.
                </p>
                <p>
                 See, when you hear dead beat, freeloader corporations and 2 percenters squeal like banshees about taxes, they are talking about MARGINAL rates. Your comment is case in point. 35%and you squealed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The tax code  is full of exemptions, deductions, credits, etc.particularly for corporations and the very rich.  Calling a yacht a "second home" and then getting break on the tax bill?  Yes, that is just one of them.  We have all heard of the subsidies paid to oil companies and corn farmers.  That is through the tax code.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The effective rate, that is the rate actually paid, for corporations is often 0%.  The faux rich Romney 47% people that oink about paying too muchyelling that they are in the 25% brackettypically pay about 8.4% after credits, deductions, and exemptions.  Those are the things reduce your taxable income.  Many people, pay less than that, if at all.  I imagine that you are in this group.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, please educate yourself  before you spout off about things you can't understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lastly, I would like to point out a fact about your "enjoy your free phone".  The FCC the crated the Lifeline benefit program for income-eligible consumers in 1984. 1984.  Wait?  Who was president?  Oh yes, St. Reagan.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Lifeline program originated in 1984, during the administration of Ronald Reagan; it was expanded in 1996, during the administration of Bill Clinton; and its first cellular provider service (SafeLink Wireless) was launched by TracFone in 2008, during the administration of George W. Bush. All of these milestones were passed prior to the advent of the Obama.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, when you reference these free cell phones, you are actually referring to a Bush phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Wait!  Is that Obama blaming Bush??
                </p>
                <p>
                 The most glaring part of your ignorance and your world view education obtained through chain emails is that the Lifeline program is not directly subsidized by taxpayer money (not that you pay taxes anyway).
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is paid for out of the federal Universal Service Fund (USF) through a fee assessed against telecommunications service providers, who may or may not pass those costs along to their customers.

                 Dagnabbit!  Liberal bashing of the job cretaters done makes me sick.  This here agument bout bad banks and evil credit cards is dern foolish!  These here entitties is the job creator!  Bank can do what they want coz they job creator.  They should be able to do whats they want, whens they want, to who they want.  They should be able to make the laws bout fiskal policy and such, not no libral democrat and the Obama agenda. Someday, if I keep playing the lottery the way I do, I gonna win and be rich. Then I gonna be glad I supported republicans.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Right now, I know how to budgit and such.  Now I cant work on account of my diabeetus and back, but every month my disability gets deposited and then I dont spend what I dont have.  No money== no lottery tickets that week.  I make sure my EBT last me the month.  I make sure I leve enough in the bank for my $1 Meddycaid copays. I just sick and tired of the lazy demorats moochin' on the system and takin big goverment bennifits.
                </p>
                <p>
                 WHY KINT OBAMA AND DEMORATS DONE BUDGET LIKE I DO!!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I mean running the country aint no differnt than how I manage my personal finances.  I even got me a "military" part of my budget when I holds aside a little each month to buy ammo in case the revolution comes.  I dont keep no bank account, which mean I dont have no book to balance.  I just bury my money in Mason jars out back.  Sometimes I have enough to buy some of them there gold coins Glenn Beck talks about. But, the financial coolapse was coused by too much regulation on banks and other job cretaters.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Its there fault the financial meltdown happen.  If they didnt git us into Iraq and Afghannystan, then Bush woodn't had to give us our first  trillion dollar deffycit or raise the national debt by 75%.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I jest so sick of these here demorats ruin this here country.  That why us here republicans have to make sure minorities can't vote.  They take all the big goverment bennyfits.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Damn librals need to get jobs, get off big goverment's teet, and pay there own way!!

                <p>
                 I think the part you're missing is that credit card usage and acceptance is voluntary.
                 <br/>
                 ++That is legally true; however how much of a "choice" does an unemployed single mom with 5 children have when she needs to buy food if there's no cash in the bank? Not everybody is born into economic privilege
                </p>
                <p>
                 Good for Winco foods that they've chosen not to accept credit cardsthat is their absolute right. It is also my right to patronize businesses that accept my cards. I am more than willing to pay a slightly higher price for the convenience of using my card. I carry almost no cash and use my credit card for everything. In addition to convenience, I have flown all over the world with miles which is a real perk. I also harbor no ill will towards the banks for making moneythere is nothing wrong with making a profit, even huge profits, as long as the activities are legal and ethical.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The isssue is not as you suggest.  There *is* something terribly wrong when massive profits by banks exist side-by-side with the massive poverty of some of their customers.  Whether something is legal not has no bearing on whether it's right or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lastly, I'll point out to you that the higher prices we pay to cover hidden credit card fees absolutely pales in comparison to the price we pay for onerous regulations and taxation by the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How so?  Federal income tax rates are the lowest they've been since the later 1940s.  We are not over-taxed;  we're grossly under-taxed because we are irrresponsible enough to believe that bills can be paid indefinitely by borrowing from others with no plan as to how we might ever be able to pay them back.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Credit card transaction fees range from 2 to 4% while the federal corporate income tax is a world leading 35%!
                 <br/>
                 ***Again, this is factually true but disenguous because no large US corporation pays 35%  many pay little or no taxes at all because our tax laws have been written by legislators who have prostituted themselves into serving corporations over citizens.  There are so many loopholes and deductions in our tax code that the nominal 35% is meaningless.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Tack on state and local taxes and we're up to 50% in some areas before we've started talking about regulation expenses.
                 <br/>
                 So? War is expensive.  If you dont' want to pay such taxes, you're saying that you dont' want to pay your bills.  This is irresponsible.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And unlike credit cards, the governments piece of the action is anything but voluntary.
                 <br/>
                 ++Thank goodness it isn't voluntary or we'd have people like you not paying their bills and the country would be in even worse shape than it is now.

                 yes, pay your credit card balance monthly. . until you lose a job, get seriously ill or seriously injured in an auto accident. . .and then you can 't pay.  I had superb credit until my early 50's. Now I have no credit cards, lousy credit, and my credit score prevents me from getting a home or work. Life happens to even the most responsible.

                 Ultimately businesses pick up the tab for the fees. Not the consumers. It is the cost they pay to offer being able to accept credit/debit. They don't have to accept it, but don't expect me to buy from them.
                 <br/>
                 Now businesses can pass the fees on to the customer, but by law they must state this to the customer before hand and guess what? No business does cause they would be out of business in a heart beat.
                 <br/>
                 My only disagreement with this article is why pay an annual fee when there are so many great options that are free.

                 Who is WinCo Foods??? Never mind, I know why I've never heard of them. Yep, they have stores in Texas  exactly three of them! And soon to be two because they don't accept credit cards!"
                </p>
                <p>
                 Pat, are you being silly?  WINCO stands for: Washington, Idaho, Nevada, California, and Oregonthe states where WINCO originated and does a booming business.  I'm only guessing, but if there WERE a store in Texas, it would do quite well.  And I'm sure if there were three stores, once peeps found out about them, they'd expand to several more in the high-density areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just like COSTCO and WalMart, WINCO has its niche in the grocery business.  If you don't like cash or debit cards, that is fine with me.  Don't shop there.  It is already crowded enough at our two local stores and I'd just as soon NOT have any whiners clogging up the check-out lines!

                 Tim mentioned WINCO at the beginning of this thread and Sam said he wouldn't shop there if they didn't accept his credit cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What was MISSING, and no one else picked up on it, was that WINCO does not accept credit cards BECAUSE the banks make the profit and the shoppers PAY the difference in food prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Obviously, Sam can afford to pay more, and that is his right.  (A wise lady once pointed out to us: "why pay less when you can pay more?"  while referring to people who buy only 'name brand' merchandise.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 ATTENTION!  Not everyone wants to pay more!   That is the reason you'll find LOTS of people shopping at WINCO (they are open 24 hours) because they WANT to save those few precious 'extra' grocery dollars each month.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You don't have to be poor to shop there, although poor people do shop there.  If you have a frugal mindset and want to stretch your dollars, you'll quickly learn that WINCO is a great place to shopeven though you must bag your own groceries!

                 I pay our cards off monthly and get plenty of kickback so I can't complain. Several people here did not understand what it meant to say the bank is making 500-700% profit. They are likely making far more than that. Profit is calculated against their expenses not the bill you paid (which would be ludicrous). What is the banks expense? 1) cost of processing the transaction (probably a micro-penny since these costs are amortized over many millions of transactions), 2) the outlay of the funds for a period of time at BANK interest rates before you pay them back. 3) the risk that you will not pay them. In return they get: 1) a few percent from the seller, 2) Interest from the buyer at CONSUMER interest rates if they delay paying. 3) fees for a couple of things like late payments and balance transfers (which should be illegal as far as I'm concerned. They should just charge interest from day 1 on balance transfers.).
                </p>
                <p>
                 So, let's say you charge $100 and pay it off on time. The bank gets $3 from the seller. Let's say they outlay the money to the seller 30 days in advance of your paying (the gap is probably MUCH shorter). Their own interest rates are bank rates. Say 1% APR. So 30 days at 1% APR for $93. Comes to 8 cents. Yes that transaction cost them about 8 cents and they got $3 but they do take on the risk that you won't pay. While I like the convenience, it seems like quite a profitable business for the banks and sellers do pass these costs on to consumers. This is an area I wish the government would step in. That 3% transaction fee is arguably a 30 day interest rate and seems like it should be illegal.

                 There is no such thing as  PERFECT credit card for everybody.
                 <br/>
                 To me, credit card is not for everybody.
                 <br/>
                 I threat my credit card as a privilege that comes with responsibility similar to how I threat my driver's license.  At 25,  forty-fice years ago,  I did not used my credit cards prudently, thus, paid interest payment through the nose. Luckily, I wised-up within two years and have never paid a single penny for interest since 1970.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now retired,  I only have to worry about paying my real estate property taxes and Uncle Sam by April 15 every year.  While I am financially secured for life by building my retirement wealth plus retirement pension and Social Security, I still do NOT buy what I cannot afford.  For the most part, we buy what we need.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Because my wife enjoys travel both domestic and abroad, we find it unsafe and impractical to carry huge cash.  Before a trip,  we notify our credit card provider our destination and itinerary.  We each have the credit card company phone number in case of theft and other emergencies.  While I see lots of negative post against Chase,  our experience is nothing but positive.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We have Sapphire Card since 2006. The $95 annual fee more than pays for itself in perks, SECURITY and PEACE OF MIND.  In Greece, one merchant submitted a charge of $3,000 three days after we left Greece.  In Venice,  a merchant doctored the statement from $860 some to $1,860.  In January this year,  a Merchant in Machu Picchu, Peru charged my credit card $1,600 the day I was in Lima.   In all instances, I took about 20 seconds to connect live with Chase representative who identified his or her FULLNAME.  Another 10 to 15 minutes for me to supply details.  Within 3-days, we receive phone call from Chase of the reversal of charges followed by letter of confirmation within 10 business days.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have used AmEx primarily since 1976,  now, I only use my AmEx at Costco, which is required for membership.  Why?  Because I was frustrated by the endless automated phone menu that take at least 5 minutes to get to a live person.  Moreover, the AmEx representative asked endless question to verify my identity BUT refuse to give their full name citing company policy to protect their safety.  That means that if the call was disconnected, I have to go through the gaunlet again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No doubt there maybe other bank cards that maybe better than Chase Sapphire.  For me, it is the best for my needs.

                 In November last year Sam wrote a long reply to Tim, including "I have flown all over the world with miles which is a real perk".

                 I'm surprised no one has pointed out that, like merchant fees, the cost of his tickets doesn't come out of thin air either. Good on him that he gets these "perks", but they come at the cost of higher costs passed on to ALL of the customers of the merchants he frequents  those who have cards, and for whatever reason can't  travel, and those who would never qualify  for a credit card. From all of those people, we say to Sam: "You're welcome!"

                 I don't have any of these cards and I have never applied for them and quite possibly I have trashed the "approved to apply" mailers I get therefore I do not have excellent credit?  I'm okay with that.  I have only 2 CC and they are through my credit uni0n.  notice: Before you post, please prove you are a human being. my question: What is 2 multiplied by 4?  8 I say 8, I'm damn lucky they didn't go over 10 as I can't count past my fingers. :)

                 People with excellent credit really have no use for credit cards to build MORE credit. These are people that have money, and don't have a have to finance to get what they need. Key word 'NEED'. I have mediocre credit myself, and honestly have no interest in credit cardsit only means more debt. I own my car, which is safe and practical. ..and I own my own home and small piece of land,  and that along with paying my bills us all I NEED.  Our society has beaten into our brains that we NEED more, capitalism at its best. Those of us that have less than excellent credit should keep in mind the difference between need &amp; want, we can't afford to go finance that new Acura just to have it taken away the moment comes when we may lose our job in this unstable economy,  furthermore killing our credit score. No wonder other countries and cultures think so lowly of Americans. We are the most superficial, materialistic bunch of idiots the world has ever known. I just thank God for running water, electricity and a safe, running vehicle. The health and happiness of my family is #1, and our happiness is not based on the newest gadget on the market. So f*** credit, the economy, and 'keeping up with the Jones". We're just fine with what we have

                 Because every time one uses a credit card, the risk of ID theft increases.  Also, unless one monitors the bills exceedingly carefully, there is a risk of bogus charges appearing on a bill.  For that reason, many of us prefer to pay cash.  Unfortunately, when we pay cash, we are subsidizing those who use credit cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is not fair!!  Those of us who prefer to pay cash should not be forced to subsidize those who use credit cards.

                 Do the math.  To earn $400 in travel credits, you must spend $20,000 first.  10% interest on 20k is $2,000, assuming you don't immediately pay off your card.  Even reward cards with "good deals" are terrible deals.  Don't even get me started on leasing vehicles or rent to own homes.  This country is obsessed with education   just not intelligence.

                 The US Government is the primary cause of inflection with their wealth transfers and no one seems to be concerned. We continue to elect these scabs back into office to continue increasing our debt, so what's your point? At lease we have a choice with credit cards. I haven't paid any interest on my credit cards in 8 years because of my credit history and I string some out as long as 18 months with no interest.  FICO, FICO, you have to know how to use them!!!

                 A follow-up to my last comment. I talked with Amex customer service. They sent me to a non-existent website to find the list of grocery stores that qualify as supermarkets. As of now, I will not apply until I get the information I need.
                 <br/>
                 Do you have any suggestions? The CS person at Amex was unwilling to transfer me to another agent or supervisor. They kept trying to sell me a card without answering my questions. It was an unpleasant experience to say the least.

                 It is almost impossible to get the actual list of supermarkets to see if my grocery store is on the list. The criteria are very convoluted. Be aware that the customer service rep I chatted with today noted that Walmart identifies itself as a mass merchandiser; therefore, if you purchase groceries at Walmart you would receive back only 1% even if all you buy is food. They are unable to tell me if Harmon's Grocery in Utah qualifies for the 6%. Amex states that it depends on how the store "Codes" the purchase. No one can tell me the code. I have a call in to Harmon's but I am not too hopeful. Perhaps you could find out for me and email me or reply here.
                 <br/>
                 Thanks.
                 <br/>
                 Buyer Beware!!!! Be sure you know what you are getting when you pay a fee for a credit card.

                 One other benefit of the Chase Sapphire Preferred card is that there is no foreign transaction fee charged.  Some cards charge as much as 3% for foreign transactions.  The Bank of America card mentioned above seems to offer the next lowest foreign transaction fee at just 1%.  (I have both of these cards.)

                 Why would they be?  Are you on their side? No, you're on your own side.  You want them to provide services for free, they want to make money.  You're no less "greedy" than they are.

                 Do you work for free?  Guess what, no one else wants to either.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you don't want to use credit cards, then don't.  I haven't paid fees in 20 years.

                 Tim ..tell me something I don't know.  Pay your cc bill on time and you don't pay any interest. The people who don't pay their bill on time is who pays for these little bonuses.  So use your cc the right way and pay on time and forget about the interest and at the same time get little extra's.  Is that plain enough?

                 credit  cards are the greatest thing ever  as long as the annual  fee is none,  cause they give you  free money  every month for 30 days and they extend  any product  you buy for 1 ty warranty , they also pay the car  rental  extra ins,  that they try to force you to buy  and much more.  The whole key  is just pay it off every month  and if  you cant do that then  they are not for you..

                 Back when credit was flowing fast and furious, we used to get calls from people wanting to know what interest rate we were paying on our credit cards, since they were confident they could improve upon it.  Our reply:  "Minus 2%.  Can you beat that?"  We get 2% back on our three credit cards and pay off the balances every single month.   American Express is our preferred card because they have always, always gone to bat for us when there was a question or complaint about a purchase.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The first time a card provider tries to penalize us for being what is called a "convenience user" (someone who never pays interest) we'll drop them like rock.  In the meantime, the money that would have come out of our checking account if we paid cash is earning 3% at our bank, not so shabby these days.

                 All I care about is a low-fixed interest rate. I currently have a 6.99 fixed rate VISA card through my credit union. I will never have a variable rate card, and 99.9% of card offerings are variable rate cards. I could care less about points, cash back gimmicks.

                 I've made about $1000 off of my credit cards in the last year  $500 in signing bonus from Chase on the Sapphire Preferred and the cash back on the Chase Preferred and Freedom Cards. I pay them off each month. I've paid no fees because when the $100 fee came up on the Sapphire, I closed it. You have to use these cards to buy the things you normally buy and watch your spending. If you carry a balance, you start whittling away at your cash back and that's what they want. But, if you pay it off each month, it's free money. Credit cards aren't evil. Being stupid with your credit is evil. Be smart.

                 I have a BankAmerica Rewards Card. As a recent grad with no loans, I wanted a card to help build credit. So as mentioned afore, proper usage and making full payments on time is rewarding. Furthermore, most apartments and houses will require some type of credit. No need for one of those super heavy Chase cards

                 Those are good offers,  depending on the interest at the end of the offer. I have 3 cards, Visa, Amex, &amp; Mastercard and that is plenty.  One thing to keep in mind, should you have a card that you have using for sometime and decide to go to another card, DO NOT cancel the card you are chnging from. You have maintained excellent credit and you have a good time frame on that card. If you cancel it, you lose it and you have nothing on the new card. This will hurt your credit to some extent. Best to keep the card snd just not use it.

                 Retailers acceptance of credit cards is a component of their CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Any customer service is a component of Cost of goods/services sold. Stores accept this additional cost, because consumers want that convenience, and retailers would rather sell at 3% less gross margin than lose a customer. It's a simple business decision on a retailer's part, not blackmail by the CC companies.  Any computer maker (Dell, HP, Samsung) will tell you that they would rather charge consumers hundreds extra for more RAM, bigger disk drives, and more features, but they would lose customers in a heartbeat to competitors, so they accept razor-thin margins and opt for volume instead.  Ditto grocery stores, home goods retailers, consumer electronics makers, automakers, and virtually every other industry.   Consumers, likewise, pay for the convenience of carrying a CC loan balance (yes, it's a loan) each month in the form of interest. Just as they have been doing with private and banking loans for thousands of years.  Retailers who don't accept cards are providing LESS customer service, and enjoy higher margins (are they greedy, too?). While CC companies make fees on each transaction, they often lose money (literally) on customers who pay balances in full, because they eat the float on the cash they advance to retailers, hoping that they will make it back if the cardholder decides to carry a balance for a few months. Are CC execs greedy and profit-minded? Sure.  So are the consumers who enjoy the convenience of no-fee credit.  Good for them both.  Are there bad apples in both camps- execs who defraud their company, customers, and regulators?  Yes.  Are there consumers who run up charges on cards they know they will never repay?  Yes.  But the credit card business is neither criminal nor conspiracy; it's simply a brilliant business model that allows CC companies to make money from both sides of a transaction. Wish I had thought of it first!

                 There is one gas station in my area that has a cash price for gas but their cash price is the same as the cheapest gas station gegular price so they make it look like they are saving you money if you go to them.   I would use cash more often if places did have a cash price. say i went out to dinner with my wife bill was 100 dollars with a credit card or cash price was 95 i probably would use cash more often

                 So, how much business does Winco lose by not accepting credit cards?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, the first time a business charges me extra to use a credit card will also be the last time, as I simply will never buy from them again.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fact that people will often spend more when using a credit card certainly makes up for the processing fee. This is just common sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, I think debit cards are much more risky to use than credit cards.

                 "Credit card transaction fees range from 2 to 4% while the federal corporate income tax is a world leading 35%!"
                 <br/>
                 Incorrect!  it is 40% + the state.  But hey lets be ignorant and blame the corporations that actually produce instead of the BLOOD sucking Government monster the illiterate US population enabled.

                 well, it's true we all need to be more aware of the scam but as commenters have pointed out, we ARE paying for the fees associated with the credit card usage. fees are usually imbedded in the cost of doing business/prices for customers and then there are the exorbitant fees each of us pay directly to the banks in terms of interest, late fees, over limit fees.  Businesses benefit from increased sales when we use our cards because it's been proven that people purchase more and more often when using their cards which in turn stimulates the economy financially, which in turn creates more money available for loans, etc.  I do agree there is a level of greed on the Banks part throughout history in all modern nations &amp; especially rampant in the United States given the lack of legislation forcing a lower level of greed.  I think Banks will always find a way to get their profits because they hold the most money, which equals power.  Money &amp; property ownership = power.  I hope our nation can become more aware &amp; come around to having large business pay more of the fees &amp; taxes instead of small  business owners &amp; individuals as of now, they don't pay their share in terms of the percentage of wealth they hold and use for power.  I guess only time will tell the story.

                 If you have good credit, it usually means that you're in control of your spending and responsible with your money. Why would anyone like that (if they chose to use a credit card in the first place) choose a credit card with an annual fee? I don't know if they are still offering it to new customers, but our Discover card version (as Discover has several) offers 5% cash back on both gas and grocery store, and 1% on everything else. We pay the balance off every month, and there is NO annual fee. We've been doing this for almost fifteen years. An annual fee may seem like a small amount, but as all "financially aware" people know, it's those small monetary amounts, both spent and saved, that add up. -Lann

                 I could care less about all these services that are being offered-they cost the bank money, you can bet they will reap that from the person who uses their cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Instead, interest rates are what interest me. My credit union has their Visa Platinum Rewards card at 7.99% for a credit score above 740. Simmons Bank offers theirs also at 7.99% for excellent credit scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So really, you can pay higher rates for these "services" but in the end-are they really worth it?

                 Wow there are a lot of oeanut gallery commenters here.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These offers are going only to people who have a great credit history.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Credit is not all bad, it's managing credit that's important. Banks are not evil, they are corporations made up of human beings who want to feed their families. True, there are unscrupulous people everywhere, but blaming banks for the financial crisis is populist nonsense. Blame banks, regulators, realtors and buyers equally.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These offers are financed primarily by merchant fees in the case of % spending rewards, or by hotel or airline partners in the case of signup bonus points. Merchants who object are free to charge a credit card surcharge (the card act of 2010 guaranteed that) but merchants should also realize that cash management actually costs more than managing credit cards. Merchants can also give a debit discount that rewards people for paying with their ATM card.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But people should realize that most of these reward cards are funded by airlines and hotel partners as a way to incentivize people to fly delta instead of united, stay at hilton instead of marriott, etc. they are given only to high earners with good credit, who typically travel on business, so it's good business to offer them loyalty ..
                </p>
                <p>
                 Believe me,these top offers are not going to people who can't handle credit.

                 Who would ever do business with Chase Bank? Have you ever read the terms for Chase Credit Cards?  If you are late paying they will raise the interest rate to 29.99% forever on all products you have with Chase bank, like mortgages, car loans, credit cards etc.   I also own a mail order business and I pay my processor  more than the standard rate for cards with rewards.

                 We The People need to unite and repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. We The People lost the greatest president ever on November 22, 1963 because he signed Executive Order 01111 returning the authority to print United States Constitutional money back to the U.S. Treasury. America Wake Up! The Federal Reserve Bank is not a federal agency and is unconstitutional. Federal Reserve Notes are unconstitutional. Until We The People regain our authority to print U.S. Treasury Notes, which are interest free, back to our U.S. Government, We The People will have to endure the unconstitutional interest charges that the Federal Reserve Bank charges on loans to the U.S. Government. The Congress talks about the National Debt. The National Debt has been brought about because of the interest that is charged on loans to the U.S. Government from the Federal Reserve Bank. If the Federal Reserve Bank is a Federal Agency why does it charge interest on loans to the U.S. Government. Overturn and repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Until this happens We The People will never be able to state that We The People are in charge of our government and are truly free. For Freedom and the preservation of our future. Unite and demand that our elected officials do something about the greatest robbery happening to We The People. Ask yourselves this one question. What happens to the money that is collected by the Social Security Administration on Social Security Accounts, Why isn't interest paid on these accounts. Who collects this money and retains it interest free. If interest were paid on these Social Security Accounts, the Social Security Account Trust would be solvent until forever. The Money collected by the Social Security Administration should be invested in U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds and allowed to earn interest. Repeal of the U.S. Federal Act is necessary in order to restore faith in government free the people. Respectfully,

                 Wake up people! DONT USE CREDIT CARDS!!  Stop living in excessive debt. Ever notice the people with the "best" credit scores have the highest debt? Don't get fooled by credit scores either, because all they are is a way for banks to gauge how profitable you are to them. It's a scam that has been run by banks for years and you are all victims to it. WAKE UP NOW. Stop using your credit cards, pay off your debts, and watch how fast your score drops! Credit cards are evil and the benefits never outweigh the negatives.

                 Not going to get involved in discussion of good vs evil in credit card issuers, though I agree with a lot of what has been said here.  I use credit cards because they are convenient and I can delay  payment for ca. 30 days.  However, I always pay them off, on time, when due, so I never generate any finance charges (credit card companies do not like this).

                 With respect to the "7 best deals" mentioned above, I think the new Sam's Club Master cash back card should be included.  This card gives you 5% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on travel and restaurant purchases, and 1% on everything else.  Honorable mention should go to Lowes.  Their card gives you an INSTANT 5 % off of all purchases made at Lowes, so if you use that store frequently, it helps.

                 Yeesh, calm down bank haters.  Credit cards aren't going anywhere so what should you do?  MAXIMIZE YOUR RETURN!!!  Businesses know they have to pay the credit card fees for the majority of their customers that are using cards, so the cost of the fee is built into the price of the goods you're buying.  What happens when you pay cash or use a debit card?  You're overpaying for your purchase! You're paying for the fees either way, so your best move is to get as much of that fee back as you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm an average suburban professional family of 4 so my credit card bill looks like this:
                 <br/>
                 10-15% monthly bills
                 <br/>
                 60% Gas and Groceries
                 <br/>
                 20-25% Other- clothes, home goods, eating out, amazon, travel, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The setup I use to Maximize my Return:
                </p>
                <p>
                 The AMEX Blue Cash Preferred  maximizes my return on gas and groceries which is the bulk of my monthly bills.  HERE'S THE TRICK: Buy gift cards for Amazon, Home Depot, and Target at the grocery store.  All of a sudden you're getting 6% back on  a larger portion of your bill.  This way you should easily max out the $6,000 annual limit for the 6% return.  If you're married and you find you can max this out before the last quarter of the year, consider getting your spouse to get their own card in their name.  If you max out the 6% return the annual fee easily pays for itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Captial One Quicksilver  I use this for everything that is not gas and groceries to get maximum return (1.5%) for those purchases.  Where is Quicksilver on this list?!?!?!  All the travel cards get you about 2%, the Barclay does look to be the best at about 2.2% but it has an $89 fee, so you'll need to spend about $12,000 a year on the Barclay card to get a better return than the Quicksilver.  Since I'm using the AMEX for the bulk of my purchases it doesn't make sense to go for the travel cards.

                 Why they lost the home , THEY. Used it as their bank , by cashing in the equity

                 I never had a new boat , or 12 motorcycles , but I still have my home ( paid off  )

                 This is an interesting thread, I scrolled through much of it but got the gist. I say, beware of credit cards. I say this based on personal experience which might be other peoples too. We've used our business and personal credit cards correctly (paying off the balances early, no fees, cash rewards) for a couple of decades and were always the worse-than-deadbeat customers since we ended up getting some pretty good cash payments back while paying nothing to Chase and Bank of America. Then the recession hit and our income leapt off a cliff. We're better now but we've had to borrow from family members to pay off credit card debt and I'm thinking about cutting them up. Especially after reading some of these comments. Thanks Tim and Sam for starting an excellent debate.

                 Anyone who overlays for something only to get something in return is a moron. Can you imagine paying $20 for a soda and then waiting at the mailbox for your $19 "cash back" check? What a joke. Seems like the higher the credit score the lower the IQ. Wake up.

                 If you know how to use credit cards well, then it's useful. I took that 18 month offer from citibank and after the offer I'm paying 12.99% apr.  That's not a bad deal compared to slate or bank of america's aprs.  With 0% interest for 18 months, I'm almost paid off all my other cards and can now concentrate on a balance that is not being charged an arm and a leg, maybe a finger but definitely not an arm.  Then if I really want to bother, I can finance it with low (under 5%) personal long term loans from federal credit unions which normally feature some of the lowest interest rates around and which I can easily get with my near 800 credit score and good annual income.  It's useful if you want through a bad patch and now doing your best to pay down all your debts asap and as cheap as possible.

                 As a professional having a credit score around 800 I had most of the cards above. While I wouldn't wish it on anyone I was pervasively hacked that the FTC upgraded my complaint from personal I'D theft to unfair business practices act. Bottom line it has been ongoing for over a year. I could not make a payment, I had to deal with non native English speakers, I had to send notarized ID &amp; SS copies to PO Boxes which I did not feel secure. If I wanted to set up automatic payments it could only be done on the Internet. (Did they even think ?). Then they couldn't deal with me as the Target Scandal hit. In short I am almost 2 years out, 5 complete cleans etc. My credit score is now around 400 . While I tried to rectify all issues, no one else was interested including the government to help me. Bank of America and Barclay were completely indifferent. Capitol One and Chase worked with me.  FYI.

                 What do we pay for the privilege of having cash in our pockets?  I think it costs us a lot more than we realize to print or mint our cash.   The Treasury wants to eliminate the penny because it costs more to make than its worth.   I think the same might apply to the $1.00 bill if you consider that a bill lasts about 18 months to a coin's 20 years.

                 I agree EXCEPT,. taking advantage means that you have to be very savvy in card use. I do not agree that Barclay is a good risk.  They change rates VERY, VERY, quickly. They should be on the watch list.

                 @Neil: It's Barney Frank's fault! A Reublican majority in the  Senate,   another majority in the House; a Republican in the White House and the Supreme Court stacked with Republicans. And Barney Frank  forced them all to pass those laws. What a powerful powerful man !  In the face of such awesome power, it's a miracle that the GOP could manage to pass all those tax breaks for Donald Trump! I'm surprised the all-powerful Barney didn't veto those.

                 Credit cards are for those who are financially responsible for their convenience and flexibility. Of course, banks have to make profits by charging the merchants who accept the use of credit cards. As a user, one should and could treat them as cash you takes in monthly and pays off the balance each month. There is nothing tricky here to understand. Please remember all the goodies offered by banks are traps that you don't wish to fall in. I have been very careful to play with the games of credit cards, so far I only fell into the trap once. I have taken advantage of mileages cards, hotel awards cards for many years. I have taken the first class flight to Asia for three times with Citi AA Advantage Master Cards, stayed at Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt for many days free of charge thanks to the goodies offered by both Citi and Chase. I will continue taking advantage of using them but I constantly remind myself not to be late for the payments.

                 American Express unfortunately is not a loyal "business partner" with their customers. They will drop you quickly if you fall out of their credit criteria despite your actual credit history with them. I had their card for five years, never late once. Went through a divorce, my ex wife refused to pay the mortgage on one of our properties that she lived in, and hurt my credit. American Express didn't even notify me. I had to get turned down at point of purchase one day by surprise to find out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've since recovered from the divorce. But I use other cash back credit cards now. Amex has lost me as a customer.

                 "This is the final financial truth regarding communication through terms and conditions of contracts. Whether, verbal, written, electronic, silent, drawn or broadcast through a special means of messaging, all human beings will be created equal. Happiness and freedom will be found among those who find their own personal perspective, rich with integrity, authenticity and  service. This final truth is that money cannot offer stability but will usually offer a warmer outer layer and lessen anxiety. Therefore, the truly rich have come to believe that comfort and stability can only be achieved with a purposeful perspective, a heightened awareness and a desire to only make assumptions based on his or her own inventories. The commonwealth of men and women can only be determined by the common efforts of restoring equilibrium to mutual understanding."  My Final Financial Truth Blog Comment featuring Gin Sing

                 This is the first financial truth that must be addressed in all contracts set between two or more individuals. All of which, must have an equal say and understanding of what the terms of the contract are. Small print is not an acceptable way of updating or acquainting a customer with terms of  services being offered, as most readers cannot see the letters properly to form words.  So large companies that are somehow turning into powerful bundled monopolies, have a long way to go. However,  I can already tell from this article alone, that we're heading in the right direction. And actually, if a majority of the population would open up their minds a little more and try to trust in the good will of others, even just a little, they might find that they too are being bailed out right at this or that very moment."  -My First Financial Blog Comment Signing featuring Gin Sing

                 Used responsibly, credit cards are great financial tools.  Take advantage of every deal you can find.  Of course banks are making money off of them.  If they weren't, they wouldn't give them out.

                 I have (in the past 20 years) bought 3 houses and 4 cars with NO money down, and NO co-signer and POOR credit (300-450). The credit score is a huge lie and you CAN make major purchases WITHOUT it. MANY ways to do business in this country (legally mind you) WITHOUT credit. just sayin..

                 All credit is bad, it encourages people to spend money they do not have.  This is irresponsible at best.  If you want something, save up for it, you save money in the long run, and often, when paying cash, you get better deals too.

                 I will also add that cash has its drawbacks as well.  You can lose it or get robbed.  You generally cannot dispute a transaction and business checking accounts are charged for depositing cash so it does carry costs to use it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Writing checks is not really secure anymore.  With mobile deposit you can give someone a check and they take a picture of the check with their mobile phone and then who knows what they will do with the actual check that has your account information at the bottom.  I now use electronic transfers (Popmoney, Paypal, etc) to pay an individual.  For someone who insists on a check, I insist that they deposit it with their phone in front of me and then return my original document.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The best way to avoid those credit card fees for the merchant and to stick it to the bank, is to use your Debit card as a "debit" transaction and enter your pin.  A handful of banks charge the customer a fee for PIN transactions but most don't.  In this case, you don't get the credit card protections but I do this for the smaller purchases.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One way for a savvy consumer to get back at the banking industry is to take them up on the cash offer to open a new checking account.  You have to be really careful and definitely use a calendar to schedule your deposits, etc.  You also have to make sure you close out the account correctly and give them some bs story about not having enough ATM's or Drive up branches.  Most HR offices allow employees to change direct deposit information at will online.  You can even split your paycheck between several banks.
                </p>

                 A couple of years ago I took up every major bank on their offer.  I avoided community banks and credit unions, though.  I wound up making nearly $1000 cash.  The only thing is don't forget that you have to pay taxes on this money when you file your return.  So I had to pay like $300 additional taxes.  But at least you played the bank's game and won.

                 <br/>
                 Why do people think you can only "over-spend" with credit cards but not cash?"
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm curious as to how one can over-spend with cash.  Once you run out, you're through.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I still write checks for most things.  It works quite well and keeps my penmanship skills up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I've had a B of A checking account for over 30 years and have never had a problem with them.  They have lots of ATMs including in companies I have worked for.   Credit unions aren't nearly as convenient and don't pay any real interest on checking or savings accounts either, so I dropped my CU account when they decided to start charging $7/month if one's balance was below a certain amount.

                 My husband once owned AARP Chase credit card, we followed the term ie, interest free offer and the 5% reward on every purchase during promotion.  Turn out Chase cancelled all my husband Chase credit cards because of AARP card without notifying us or any explanation.  After our investigation,  the rep financially admitted that they did not like the fact the 5% reward that we have earned.  The reason Chase put in my husband's record is "unsatisfactory customer relation".  What a suck offer, they offered you than they trick you and ruin my husband credit history.
                 <br/>
                 Filing a complaint with AARP three years ago, got no response up to this date.  Much time has been wasted. Chase has violated good faith law, but fight was in vain.
                </p>
                <p>
                 SO BE CAREFUL WITH THOSE SWEET OFFER MAY END UP HURTING YOUR CREDIT.  YEAH, BANKS ARE GREEDY AND  TRICKY.

                 I owned three of above cards.  I pay minimum payment monthly when interest free period expired, I pay them off.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For Slate card, you do not earn any reward but you can transfer balance with no fee.  While Blue Cash card will earn reward, so does BOA credit card.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I take advantage of  the interest free promotion and only need to pay min payment monthly to help get by with cash flow problem.  The bottom line is not to pay interest.  Not easy, but this is the way to be money smart.

                 Also with the BankAmericard Cash RewardsTM Credit Card you get an additional 10% if you deposit the cash back you have earned into a Bank of America bank account.  So far this year I have earned $600 just for spending what I would normally spend.  Plus this money is tucked away in a Savings account that I don't use for anything else, so the money will just keep accumulating.  I love this card!

                 I  live  in  a  rural area  where  the bank  is open  3  days  a week , having  ready  access  to  cash  is  not  always  easy, .  I  have  found  traveling  with  credit  cards  is  safer  ,  I  can  keep  it close  to  my  body   , not  in  a  wallet , and  thus  avoid  carrying  an  obvious  purse  and  thus  feel  more  relaxed  and  safer  than  if  I  had  to carry  100s in  cash  when  traveling  in  Europe , South  america ,  it  even  makes  swimming  possible in  unguarded places   because   they  could  be   put in  wrist  security  bands.    Electronics  do  have  a  costs   but so  does  cash,  cash  can  not  help  fight  back  when  the  company  has  defrauded  you, the  credit  card  company  does.  Cash  does  not  increase  the  guarantee  time.   Oh  well  just  some  thoughts.  I  have  a  small business  and  it is the  cost  of  doing business in  this  age.

                 The more I read some of the remarks make me think that people that uses credit cards make people who are brain dead more intelligent then you.
                 <br/>
                 Think of it !The central bank a private institution not run by or under any government who runs the financial banking system and sole purpose is to keep people in debt and who does not to pay any taxes.
                 <br/>
                 You people use money that don't exsist in the first place, use their cards/debt to pay for something with money you don't have and they are willing to give you some back to keep you in debt. Hum

                 In my experience USAA MasterCard is the best credit card. I've had bad experiences with others, especially JPMorganChase.

                 Question for those who say have no cards: Last time I travelled I arrived and found I could not rent a car and could not even rent a hotel room! I had a miserable time sleeping outside. They didn't mention this on the phone when I called initially. I'd like to get a credit card, but nobody will give me one since I have no credit -the free credit score places say "they have no record of me". I live entirely cash because that's all I can do. Advice?
                 <br/>
                 p.s. A question: do No Annual Fee cards stay that way or is that just for the first year?

                 These "new" cards still do not address the European travel needs of any USA customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Without a compatible chip and pin American cards are useless in many critical travel situations  such as getting out of a parking lot, paying for gas and many restaurants and hotels.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You end up having to use a debit card at an ATM in the middle of a busy street where you then have to fumble several hundred Euros onto your purse. Not comfortable!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                 When are we going to get compatible cards so that we can stop being wealthy targets for any pickpocket?

                 You might want to check your facts on the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card  they recently came out with a new program where the 7% back will be discontinued, as well as a number of other changes.

                 Well, you are absolutely right. BUT, as a business man, I HAVE to charge my card, so I can prove to the IRS that I had legit expenses.
                 <br/>
                 There are many of us (businessman) that have to do just that, even in a supermarket.

                 Simply cash is the best way to go.. but If you do need to use your card  WATCH OUT! I noticed lately banks are  charging HIGH INTEREST Rates on cards that claimed low interest or NO interest for a year.. and they are chargin unncessary LATE FEES  when you are paid on time. I attribute this to online account bank hacking and alteration o f the account terms from online hackers..IF you are seeing this. KEEP YOUR OLDER STATEMENTS AND MAKE COPIEs.. then NOTIFY THE BANK.. DISCOVER CARD has an issue with a phony bill payment address in CAROL STREAM IL . where as there is no such bill collection center in IL AT all.. Persons will find tampering with the account and terms.. and DISCOVER IS UNWILLING TO INVESTIGATE OR RECTIFY. I Drove to the PO BOX location its a DEAD LETTER OFFICE In the back of the post office.. NOT AN ASSIGNED PO BOX..
                 <br/>
                 IM serious. I cant get them to correct this after five years.. of pestering them

                 I got the Hyatt credit card. New member bonus  two nights at any Hyatt in the world. Stayed two nights at the Park Hyatt in Paris. 700 euro a night rooms. Also picked up the American Airlines credit card. Sign on bonus 100,000 miles. Granted this card is $450 a year. But on the first swipe I got a $200 statement credit. Pair that with Admrials Club access it is an amazing deal. I pay my balances to zero every month. These credit card companies send me offers for free money and I take them up on it.

                 My fico scores are all north of 775. At first I was apprehensive about getting credit cards because it might damage my credit score. After getting six in the space of a year my credit has not dropped one point. Granted I do have a lot of hard inquiries. But I am not house shopping so I don't mind.

                 Beware of the BALANCE TRANSFER, PROMOTIONAL CHECK or CASH ADVANCE FEES!! No credit card, that I know of, is currently offering NO FEE transfers or advances. The fee is up to 5% (&amp; it can be much more for straight cash advances). It is written somewhere on the offer in large, bold, clear print  by law. (I wonder why it has to be BY LAW?? Have supposedly "honest" lenders EVER taken advantage of a borrower?!?) So you are actually paying "interest" up front &amp; it is added to the balance that you must eventually pay off.
                 <br/>
                 It is probably not written anywhere in a bank's policy, but they WANT you to let your promotional rate expire &amp; pay upwards of 30%. That is why bankruptcies got to be so easy to do, to offset unscrupulous lending practices that had many people trapped. They have tightened up since 2008, though.
                 <br/>
                 Bankers would tell you those high interest rates, fees &amp; penalties are deterrents to customers defaulting on their debts. That is not entirely true &amp; they are knowingly committing usury. Many of the major financial institutions are "working with" Title &amp; Payday Loan Companies. NEVER EVER EVER NEVER NEVER use a PAYDAY LOAN, TITLE LOAN or EMERGENCY LOAN of any kind!! They are allowed BY LAW (who allowed this?!?!) to charge upwards of 400% APR   that's FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE!!!! Before you do something this desperate, get a job as a banker.

                 I have 10 credit cards with 0% introductory APR for 15 months.  My total credit limit is 16000$ . I try to put all expenses on these credit cards and transfer the money to my home country where I earn 10% interest on this which comes around 2000$ in 15 months. I only pay the minimum amount due.  Also I earn cash back of around 3% which amounts to around 500$. And on top of these there are offers on these cards which gives me introductory bonus and referal bonus. I have earned 600$ through them. So , I basically earned 3100$ by using my credit card in a year. Who would give you so much for free? So whoever the credit card compannies may be robbing , I am gaining a lot from it.

                 credit worthiness is an important part of life weather we like it or not. I personally gave up all credit and live spending cash I would cash my check and pay the $4 fee at Wal-Mart, these fees however also added up after time so I got a checking account and then after the first year they said there was a fee for that too if I did not use my check card or have automatic deposits so I did that then I got a prepaid card for hotel and car reservations, then they check your credit when renting a car and I had none! so then I got a real card and so on. things are much easier done when you have the plastic card, I pay it off every month and have maintained no interest now for more than 2 years so I always have the money available, it is like carrying cash without the risks of carrying cash!
                 <br/>
                 I get not wanting to go down that path but be responsible and your credit may become your best asset!

                 I think you may be lumping people together too much. For me, and my wife, we're retired, travel a lot, carry no balances on any card. We like the Hyatt card which gives us 2 free nights a year (we have 2 separate cards) at most any Hyatt property, a benefit worth perhaps $500-1,000, and they have no foreign transaction fee, which, for us, is worth an additional $500-1,000. And they do this for some $75/card/year. Pretty sweet deal, as far as I'm concerned.

                 Most credit card companies call the people who pay off their balances every month "deadbeats,"  because they don't make as much money off them as people who carry a balance, or pay late, or make minimum payments.

                 Credit cards are tools.  Use them incorrectly and you can hurt yourself.  I have great credit because I know how to use credit.  A few years ago I was in the process of buying a house for 70k with 20% down.  2 weeks before closing, the lender told me they would not do the loan because the ac/heater was missing.  I explained that I had money set aside to put a new one on after closing.  I was told too bad.  Not wanting to lose the deal, I used convenience checks from 3 different cards with 0% apr deals to cover 56k.   I used a different 0% card to spend about 10k more fixing the place up and rented it out for 1100/mo.  I worked my ass off to save and budget to pay off each card before the interest rates jumped.  So, now I own this home free and clear, which provides me 1100 each month.  The best part is that if I decided to sell, it's worth about 150k now.  When the mortgage company turned its back on me, I used my plastic tools. Thank you credit cards!

                 Lol at the people bragging that credit cards love them because they pay their balance off monthly. Newsflash  credit card companies don't even think about you, because far more of your fellow americans are keeping them laughing all the way to multiple banks. so, good for you, but you're the proverbial drop in the bucket.

                 Rich people don't need credit cards, they have many times more money in bank accounts they can tap into anytime.  So this is just a convenience for them.  Middle class on the other hand need credit cards but they are systematically destroyed by the same banks themselves.

                 I'm a former employee of a major financial services company. My name matched that of someone else (at the "top of the food chain level" ) in the company, and I sometimes got e-mails intended for him. One of those e-mails detailed communications regarding the fees that might be paid for conducting a plastic card transaction between our company and another company. The writer complained that the other company would not budge on a 1/4 cent (yes, $.0025) difference for the processing fee they wanted. The annual total of the 1/4 cent difference? Ready?
                 <br/>
                 $14,ooo,ooo. Seriously. Do the math. Every single company that touches these transactions gets a cut. Every. Single. One. And THAT is where the serious daily money isthe transaction fees.

                 Banks want your business with them. That's all. When you transact with them they are getting a cut and not their competitor. They're trying to build a relationship with you. The onus is on you, not the banks, to spend within your means and live within a budget, not theirs. No one's fault but yours. Just because the Bank extends credit doesn't mean you have to take it. No one makes you eat those M&amp;Ms, eat those Pringles, etc. Gosh, have some self control and take some personal responsibility.

                 The problem with the me generation is they "have to have" the newest and best of everything to have self esteem, like they had to have a pat on the head in school for this.  I was taught a long time ago, if you can't pay for it, i.e. afford it, don't buy it.  If everyone would live by this, besides putting aside a little money each month, America would be a much better place and we would not have the "ME, ME, ME'S" so unhappy.  What ever happened to self responsibility?  I could go on and on about working your way up, like millions of Americans have over the history of this great country and being financially responsible for yourself but who's listening anyway?  Just a thought.

                 O my god.  What a thread.  Credit cards are simple as long as you manage them.   I have credit cards and pay NO FEE'S unlike that post about the 100% fee's, really?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I use an American Express Card that charges me nothing,  I pay if off every month.   Someone mentioned not being able to pay it off every month, then guess what,  you're spending too much money.   I use it to purchase airline tickets.   When I do, I get a credit of $250.00 for incidentals while I am on that trip, and  I don't pay for checking luggage and I get into crown rooms at airports at no fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I bank with Bank of America,  not my favorite bank, however I pay NO fee's to bank there.  I have a Bank of America Platinum Card with an interest rate of 7.99%, if I use the card, I pay it off monthly.   I also have my checking account there,  I don't pay a monthly fee for checking,  and I don't pay for checks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My company uses E*Trade for employees stock options and grants.   With that there's a free checking account which is great so if you need money from the work related account,  all you have to do is write a check and there are no fee's.  There's also a debit card.   If I use it at any ATM, no matter what bank, E*Trade doesn't charge and ATM fee at all, ever.  Anyone can bank with E*Trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's not that difficult,  spend what you can afford,  if you can't pay a card off at the end of a month, you can't afford it.  If you're having to pay monthly fees for your regular checking,  you should consider another bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's not that hard, it's just something you've got to manage, and when rates or fee's change,  then you might have to make change.

                 Besides the use of credit cards helps with credit scores I have made money by using interest free to make large purchases &amp; paying off on time before the due date &amp; earning interest .84% in the bank on the money put &amp; held aside to make those payments.  I also switched from check to credit card because using a check to buy anything takes, and has for a long time, a long time to check out at the register.

                 Any miles collected on the credit card's bank  where you have to use their travel agency to book a ticket is the biggest scam there is.  I tried to book a flight in BC as buy a coach ticket and upgrade using miles, the quoted price and miles were so rediculous. You could get the same BC ticket from any discount travel agent muc cheaper than the price quoted by the credit card travel agent. You don't even need to spend any miles. This is what I found out on the American Express card miles. Other cards won't be any different. The only exception is the Chase Sapphire card where you can transfer miles 1:1 to any airline FF program. You buy the tickets cheaper from the airlines, and they will give you buy with cash and upgrade with miles.

                 I do not understand what all the hullabaloo is all about. I am a temp. worker.  I live pay-check to pay-check (I also earn less than $16/hr). I give money every month to my church; I send money to my 2 kids and pay their expenses. I also pay my expenses here and still manage to put away about $200 every month. I have 2 credit cards  1 from bank and 1 store card; i just obtained another one making it three. I have never paid my balances late or in part. They are always paid in full each month. How do I do it? I make sure I buy ONLY what I absolutely NEED. I want a lot of things but I usually ask myself, do I really NEED this? How will my life change for the better if I purchase it? I do not follow the latest fashion craze; drink or smoke and rarely eat out. I vacation with friends to save costs.  I spend cash most times than CC. I make a list of things and don't just walk into a store and buy anything that catches my fancy. I am not cheap or greedy. I believe in buying durable goods even if expensive but take my time before I make that purchase even if it is a pair of shoes. The day I got my student CC 2yrs ago, the bank clerk told me not to make any purchase if I know I cannot pay for it at the end of the month and I took that advice to heart. It has guided all my purchases till date (I could have chosen to ignore it). Oh, I forgot; I just realized something! that it was not my wisdom that guided me but God who stretched my meager income and gave me the wisdom to do this. HE always makes a way. My Cr. score? = 800+

                 Best deal I ever got was a 2.99% lifetime rate on transferred balances. So long as I was never late with a single payment, the rate would and has continued unchanged.  However, if I'm one day late, they'll raise my 2.99% rate to 34.99%.  LOL!  The balance I transferred is low enough now I can just pay it off if I wanted but where can you get 2.99% financing that doesn't change with interest rates?

                 Clem's post of December 2013, is on target.  Banks are greedy and that greed is costing them today.  AMEX gave me a Blue card with a balance transfer offer when I was in grad school, about a decade ago.  The offer was 0.9% forever, and 21% on purchases carried. Seemed like a good deal since my bank was paying 4.5% on savings then.   I used the card for the transfer, as this was a far lower rate than gov't student loans (6.5%), and religiously made the payments of 1.5x the minimum.  Wasn't good enough for AMEX.  In '09, they decided I wasn't making enough progress toward paying off the transfer, despite the fact I was paying double the minimum payment.  They cut the obscenely high credit limit to $5 over what I then owed them, just at the time I'd completed grad school, took a job paying a good wage, because, I "wasn't paying off the balance transfer fast enough."  Each month, they lowered the credit limit by precisely the amount going to principle, despite the fact that my income was many times what it was when they gave me the card.  To this day, AMEX now pleads for me to return.  To this day, the Blue card sits in a drawer gathering dust.  They reported on my credit report "pays as agreed" with a credit limit of $500.  I'm sure if I asked them, they'd raise it today, but since their competition has and continues to treat me well, why bother?  I use cash these days for many things.  AMEX, on the other hand, made a short term decision to attempt to escape their bad deal  (and very good deal for me) which didn't work, cost them my business forever, and now that they want my business, they are paying the price.  Are you listening, Mr. Chenault?

                 A credit card in itself is not a bad thing-it's a tool to buy goods and services without cash.  Paper money and checks are being used less and less today, and many vendors use debit/credit cards as their primary way to receive and transfer funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That being said, credit cards are dangerous in the hands of irresponsible and nave individuals who don't understand the concept of compound interest.  That $100 widget will cost you $400-$500 and take years to pay off if you only make the minimum payment each month.  In addition, late payments will really damage your credit score and increase interest rate for most card vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I view a credit card kind of like a gun. It's not a bad thing in itself unless used irresponsibly.

                 Since when has being successful, or a winner become a crime? Those who hold bank stocks in their portfolios are doing so because they earn a profit. Do you bank where they give you interest on your savings? Money Market funds? IRA's? CD's? Where do you think that money comes from?
                 <br/>
                 Since when has it been a person's right to purchase things they can't afford, and then demonize the people who lent them the money to buy it? If you borrow money from me, I expect you to repay itat whatever the terms are that YOU agreed to when you borrowed it. Don't like the terms? Go elsewhere, or don't borrow money. Save up until you can pay cash. Unheard of these days. Everybody wants everything right now.
                 <br/>
                 I spent many years (40+) in real estate and related businesses. Real property prices escalate when cheap money becomes available. People borrow more than they can realistically expect to repay, then bitch about banks charging interest. That interest makes money available for more loans. Are they making a profit? You bet they areIT'S A BUSINESS. Does your business make a profit?  If not, you go out of business. They make a lot of money because PEOPLE are greedy. They all want to live in houses they can't afford; drive cars they can't afford; everyone is entitled to everything. This is a recipe for disaster. If you don't like banks and credit cards  pay CASH, and quit bitching.

                 If any store wants to go "cash only"  AND it's actually reflected in their prices, sounds great!! I would go there. I would go anywhere with those conditions as long as its well known in advance.

                 <br/>
                 After reading your column about credit cards for people with excellent credit, I contacted Citibank regarding their card you recommended.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Unfortunately, Citibank's credit card application would only allow one to list an income of $99,000 while I have an income of over $1 Mil.   DUH!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why don't you write a column for people do actually have "excellent credit"?

                 This piece should be marked with huge red flags, rather than simply disclosing in tiny print "This site may be compensated through the credit card issuers' Affiliate Program." By touting cards with no credit on balance transfers for a limited time, it implies that carrying credit card balances and managing them as the author suggests is sound financial management. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Persons carrying credit card debt should be doing everything in their power to pay that debt down as soon as humanly responsible. Any other course is gross financial mismanagement, and this article is completely irresponsible and unethical.

                 You would have more credibility with me if you went on to explain some of the caveats of these credit cards eg. some require a minimum spending per month, some require signing in every month for the "deals", etc. If they really where sincere in wanting to help their clients, they would not make it difficult to obtain the reward.  How many times have I missed my Discover discount because i failed to sign in on time !

                 Why do people think you can only "over-spend" with credit cards but not cash?  Irresponsible people will spend every dime of their cash income leaving them short for bills, food and emergency money.  Irresponsible people will also spend on credit cards in excess of what they can afford.  What is the difference?  And, if credit card companies give irresponsible people credit (which they do), the banks take the loss  as they should for poor decisions.

                 I find the comments to this "FLUFF-PIECE" article for the credit card business rather amusing.  Most of the commenters know that credit cards are a convenient scam to easily extract cash from people that use them.  None are fooled.  But, in the final analysis, we are all fooled.  We still use them.  It's the American Way to  be financially over your head and ruined.

                 Tim. There are plenty of people that can afford their credit cards (delinquency is on the order of 1-2%).  Those that can are able to benefit from the competition by strategically gaining the most free points/rewards. Don't act like the problem is greater than it is, Chief.

                 credit cards are for short term loans , people like tim think they are for living on , pay as you go and credit cards will work in your favor , i have 5 cash back cards use them every month pay them off every month , each pays a max of $250 cash back a year most have a service fee of 35-45 per year but you can still make a profit if you play the game right .

                 I use my credit cards/debit cards for just about everything. I pay no annual fees and I pay off the balances every month. This has earned me many a free airline trip to points across the US. Want to get away? Businesses consider the bank fees as a part of doing business (as I do with my business) and adjust to them accordingly. If you don't want to use credit cards, fine. Those who do should pay off the balance every month to keep from going over their heads.

                 By the way, RB, you are also an idiot.

                 My Dad had a strawberry farm and made his profit selling U-pick to the public. They only paid by cash and did all the work of harvesting. It wasn't uncommon to make over $30,000 in one week during berry season back in 1965.  The only dealings we had with the bank was depositing the money.

                 As noted, these cards are for people with excellent credit and take personal responsibility for their actions. Enough with blaming the banks. They are a resource for people to us and of course they do not have your best interest in mind. They are in it to make money just as you are in it to save money.

                 How is dealing with a slimy bank like Chase or Bank of America any better with "perfect credit"? They'll still going to screw you no matter what your credit is like.

                 I've used my credit card for three years and never paid a dime in fees or interest.  It's convenient and has made me about $500 a year in cash back bonus.  So, not really end of story.

                 Merchants pay for credit card acceptance not because banks are forcing their way in but because consumers demand the convenience.

                 I am a retailer and am fed up with credit card companies and their endless fees.  They are causing inflation every time they offer points.  No one wins except for the credit companies. On top of that, I am expected to purchase security for my  point of sale terminals.  That is ridiculous.  I have far less resources to provide optimal security than the billions that are earned through credit card transaction fees.  Visa, MC, Amex and Discover ought to be responsible for providing state of the art security for their transactions.  They make more than enough profit!
                 <br/>
                 Better yet, consumers, STOP using credit cards and pay with cash.  You'll end up saving money.

                 Reading comments is fun! Not sure if any commenters are business owners but people who own businesses will understand that there are fees associated with accepting payments of all types. Businesses who accept only cash pay fees to handle that cash and fees to deposit that cash because it takes labor to deal with the cash at the bank. It nice that people think if they don't accept cards for payment then they don't have to pay the card fee but that doesn't mean they have a fee-free business. Many businesses also do not want the hassle of dealing with loads of cash on hand. It's dangerous and cumbersome and ripe for the pickens. While business owners should have more room to negotiate their fee structures it is not unreasonable for the bank or the merchant provider to earn a fee for the service they provide JUST LIKE the business earns a fee for the service or goods they provide.

                 I just wanted to say how sorry I feel for Tim and some of the others.  I know that all of the cash back rewards I am getting (onacounta I don't carry a balance) is being stolen from them at 21.75% interest.  I feel terrible.

                 As a user of two cards on your list, I'd call these credit cards one the biggest winners out there for the average guy who takes care of his money and his credit score.  These cash back deals are AMAZING!  To think B of A actually paid me in real cash nearly the amount I pay annually for our car insurance is proof this is REAL money.  Better yet, I know 7/24 exactly how much I'm spending and on what.  I'd be lost without these credit cards but I never owe more on credit than I can pay off tomorrow.  Buying less was my way path for a LOT less stress yet thanks to these deals.  Meanwhile I've never seen my money go further:)

                 I have excellent credit and that's why I'm not interested in a credit card.  I do have a credit card from my local credit union that charges 8.9% interest IF I carry a balance, which I rarely do.  And if there's a problem, I pick up the phone and I'm talking to one of a couple dozen people, many of whom have known me for twenty years, know I'm not a crook and are eager to get things resolved.

                 The Hook. The deal is a come on and will change after a year. The fee goes up and the miles go away. They figure most people are too lazy to give the card up.

                 Many years ago we got tired of paying on a balance, paid it off and never looked back. Now I use my card like a debit. I write any charged amount in my checkbook deduct the amount, add it back at end of the month and pay in full. Interest rates  mean nothing to me, its what's the deal. Be cautious my friends, one year its a deal the next it aint: AM Ex just went from 150 to 195 per year no additional bennies.

                 My credit score has always been very high.  A certain credit card (has a number in its name) offered me a 0 percent transfer opportunity. I had a very large credit line with them and I maxed it to make the transfer. I was working to pay the balance quickly, and I always paid more than the minimum. One month, I made a payment at the first and last of the same month. I was more than shocked to see that my 0 interest rate jumped to 27.99 percent the following month, because they said I "missed" a payment. I talked with them several timesworking my way up through supervisors and managers, but they would not  budge off that 27.99 percent gouge. I got a loan from a bank, paid the balance, and cut up their card. Customer Service is not in a credit card company's vocabulary.

                 The reality is that credit cards are like casino chips. People would bet a lot less if they had to put cash on the blackjack table. But those colored chips desensitize your normally rational mind and you find yourself betting more. Similarly, fewer things would be purchased if cash were required. The credit card allows you the freedom (even subliminally) to pull that purchase trigger. Having said that, and despite all the admonitions to postpone purchases until you can afford to pay cashor pay the card off the next monthI would rather buy the new TV on credit and pay over time, even though the interest is substantial, rather than wait a year and save up to pay with cash. There is a significant value in being able to enjoy that product earlier.  You have to weigh that value in light of its extra cost. I'm happy to pay it.

                 There is one over-riding reason a merchant accepts a credit card.  BUSINESS!  It has been proven that a consumer will spend more if they pay with a credit card than if they pay with cash.  If the consumer has to pay with cash, not only will they spend less, there is a good chance they will not purchase the product at all.  So, a merchant should determine how much more sales they do with a credit card than they do with cash and determine if accepting credit cards is a good business decision, or not.

                 Complaining about credit card fees vs. benefits reminds me of a long time ago, when stores offered S&amp;H Green Stamps (I'm going back to the 60's now). Some people saw it as a scam and refused to accept the stamps. What they failed to understand is that by shoping in those stores they have already paid for the stamps. The same is true here. You might as well enjoy the perks. You've already paid for them!

                 Have you tried to rent a car or book a room without plastic?  If you can not afford to pay for it (monthly) do not buy it.  Save up for it.  Live in the present, not the future.

                 The problem is not the credit card  I use my United MileagePlus for everything and PAY THE CARD IN FULL AT THE END OF EACH MONTH.  I earn the miles and DO NOT PAY ANY INTEREST.

                 The Chase Sapphire Preferred is probably the best travel card of the bunch, since they have about ten transfer partners you can transfer the points to, such as British Airways, United, Southwest, Hyatt and Marriott.  For cash back, you can't beat the 6% cash back on groceries with the Amex Blue Cash Preferred.  Even with the $6,000 a year cap for the 6% on groceries, you can really haul in the cash back.  Plus the unlimited 3% cash back on department stores and gas is great too.
                 <br/>
                 Also, I wouldn't say the Chase Slate is for those with excellent credit  those with good credit can obtain this one too.

                 For me I think is it reasonable for credit cards companies to charge people small amount of fee because we use their money in the first place  its like their loaning us and you have the option not to get charged interest if you pay it off within a month. :)

                 Tim is absolutely right.  I have a rewards card but there is a store which is a combination  liqour  store and deli that has great food and a wide selection of wines and spirits that I  go to fairly often.  You pay 5% less with cash or debit and I've notice that you almost never see anyone say "credit" at the register.  When merchants don't hide the true cost of accepting  credit cards from their customers it's a totally  different ballgame.

                 I agree with J Smooth from December 22th. Use the credit card companies. I have a Visa and American Express card with no annual fees. I charge everything I can because I pay off my cards in full every month. Right now combined I have $1800 in free money for my next good vacation. I also have a General Motors Master Card that I was able to take an extra $3500 off my final best price on my 2012 Malibu last year from points a saved up from the last 7 years. Can you beat that? Point your thoughts on our government from stealing us blind and we really don't have a voice anymore. Just ask President Obama. He said if Congress doesn't agree with him he will use his Executive Power to do what he wants. Unless you like Socialism.

                 Merchants want one to use debit as a means to pay but are seldom willing to give any discount for doing so. Why should I help them make more money for nothing in return?

                 All of the banter is interesting BUT we have had a Capital One Venture card that provides double points for each dollar spent, regardless of the category, day of the week,  full or half moon, etc. These other cards that provide different points for different uses are a waste of time which I have no extra supply of.  The Capital One points can be used to pay off ANY charge on your Capital One statement..groceries, travel, gas, toys.whatever. No blackout dates, etc. No card beats that! And no I don't work for or hold Capital One stock.

                 The reward of Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card is very difficult to claim. We spent months exploring and haven't been able to make the claim. You may want to double check before making the recommendation.

                 I run a small business we repair, upgrade, advise, and install computers networks etc for small businesses and residential customers primarily. In general we accept cash, credit, or debit cards as well. However; we also charge about 50 percent of what all bigbox providers charge, we work out of one location, and if you use a card both tax and a fee are charged automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The customer is advised of this prior to and at time of purchase so if they want to use this convenience they knowingly pay for it 100%. The thing here is if you use the big business you pay considerably more, the technician/engineers know less in general, and are also required to use a corporate pricing scheme that truly rips the customer off and does almost nothing for them. Just to let you know about a quarter of my repairs that are caused by a third party are when people thought they were going to an establishment where there BUY would be the BEST. Little did they know the geeks that work there (that know what they're told to know)  versus the geeks that work here (that know what they know personally ) are a much better bet for the best buy, plus any company that makes any component provides a warranty. The place where you think your Buy is going to be the Best uses these warranties as well they just do not tell you they do and they have stock to offset it. So they change out your part and then do a bulk return from all their stores quarterly and long after the fact where  you paid them roughly 400% what that part cost them for it's replacement then there reimbursed through company to company credits.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also use credit and debit cards but on my credit cards that balance is paid 100% every month on all 3 and I pay no interest but get the benefits of coverage if there is an issue or return situation and get my points on each of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also use debit so I do not have any payment due on things like groceries. On my debits the transactions come straight out of my account (I have 2 debits 1 for personal and 1 for business) and then 3 credit cards, 1 with my personal credit union and then a Chase platinum visa and one platinum discover, I will also be  getting a platinum mastercard soon and maybe a American Express affiliated with COSTCO, I get all my gas if possible at COSTCO (which is generally 3 cents to 11 cents cheaper per gallon than anywhere else( SAM'S and BJ's Wholesale do this as well).

                 My reasoning for these other cards are simple I will receive further discounts at COSTCO  through exclusive points these cards offer only on purchases there giving me more back on my gas as well as quantity items I buy for home and business through them. With the Mastercard I will have one from each Major credit card system's thereby further raising my credit.

                <p>
                 The other thing on my credit cards I use each for a small purchase each month and if I am buying anything (such as the Vacuum I just bought  and had to return) if I think in any way there could be a return or a rental car hotel room etc (something it would cover me on if the need arises), I also as many on here have said do not buy it if I cannot cover it and when I get home from doing so I send the payment in electronically through my credit union.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I also have used my credit union for most of my adult life (I am 43 so 20 years pretty much I did use Bank of America for 3 years) and they have offered online (9 years) or over the phone account management/confirmation etc. With no fee for it the whole time. Whereas Bank of America, Chase etc and all the other banks offer it now for a "Minimal" fee (no fee is minimal as it is still a fee), I pay my credit card charges when I get home with that purchase or I do not purchase it unless it is a very special item which I pay off in three payments 1/3rd upon arriving home (this has never happened but would be my plan if it did).
                </p>
                <p>
                 My credit cards are for nothing but points, coverage, and my credit rating period.

                 @CJ dude you are smart. And down to the electric companies who charge the  merchant for electricity! Down to the greedy landlords that charge merchants rent! Down to the city for charging merchants for water! If merchants weren't charged these things they could make more money! CJ you are so smart!

                 What?  You people keep mixing different points. Bank don't give you money back on your purchase from their own money. They charge the business the higher amount. If your bank is touting the new card giving you 4% back! it is not giving the 4% from their profits. It just charges the merchant  higher rate plus swipe fees.  They make their money regardless. It is the merchant who can't even distinguish between higher charging card that ends up paying for your rebate.
                 <br/>
                 This profit made by banks is seperate from profit they make by charge for carrying a balance. It doesn't matter if you carry balance or not. Doesn't matter if you payoff your bill each month. It makes me mad just reading posts after posts from people comparing paying off their monthly bill vs credit card company making profit both ways .  It is just the lowly merchant who can't win with tiny margins to start with. Then you arrogant people who wouldn't do business with merchant who dare to charge for extra cost [credit cards can impose these coats without notice] complain about someone willing bring the issue forward.
                 <br/>
                 For all those who think it is ok for credit card companies to make Hugh profit as long as it legal:WAKE THE HELL UP.  Do you even know that any bank. For ex Bank of America. Who's new card 321 being adversited on TV lately is such a card. So you think that B O A is paying those percentages. No. It is the merchant.  Do you even know the merchant can't refuse those cards. It is in contract. When the merchant sign a contract they tell them oh your rate is going to be 2% with 20 cent per swipe. But the customers who wants cash rebate come and swipes the B O A at the restaurant for example, the restaurant is on the hook for that 3% plus the swipe.
                 <br/>
                 You arrogant people don't even realize that if you have bad credit merchant gets to pay higher swipe rate. It is call mid qualified. There is nonqualified transactions also. That is even higher cost the Merchant.
                 <br/>
                 All you idiots who keep saying I pay my bill and make my money. It is not coming from the bank. It is coming from the merchant. It doesn't matter if you carry balance or not. If you do carry balance then they make 27% on top of all these profits. Got it. Shut up

                 I've made  1400$ in 9 months tax free signing up for and meeting the minimum spend on about 7 credit cards. I pay off my cards online weekly. I'm basically paying 20% less for everything and only buy what I need (food, ,gas, car insurance, etc) there are tons of credit card offers that provide 20% bonus so why dilly dally with 5% cash back. If I won't meet the minimum I buy gift cards for food on discount gift card websites making my meals a total of 30% off. I am Neo in the credit card Matrix.

                 We have used credit cards exclusively for 30 years  Never paid a dime in interest nor fees .  As noted in the introduction to this article   these cards are for the people that have good credit, no the ones that wish the did.  Over the years we have received thousands of dollars in cash , good  or services

                 I almost exclusively use my Amex Plantinum Card, why because Amex service to customers is the best.  I pay my bill every month, no interest, no late fees.  If there is an issue with a purchase they are always there to help.  Yearly fee, $450, so what!

                 The original point is well made. In short the cost of these fees and the rewards they generate for a segment of the consumer market is spread over the entire market. The cost associated with the use of credit and debit cards is not paid in full by the user, but rather by the entire population, and this is inherently unfair. In many countries every store has two prices listed. One for credit and one for cash. This puts the financial burden of using the cards on the person who actually uses it. This is a much fairer practice as it allows those that are willing to pay more for convenience to do so, without forcing everyone else to pay a part of the cost of services rendered to a stranger.

                 Credit cards are useful if they are used like a check book and all bills covered at the end of the month.  But it is interesting to think that the people who wrote that these cards provide money back or double miles are not really taken out of you own spending.  Now if you pay for gas with a credit card a stations charges you more than the 3% to use it.  If the rebates keep going up, most stores who are charged those fees will need to increase their prices to cover the cost or start to price thing in their store "Cash Price   Credit card price!  Simple there is no free lunch!

                 The part of the whole mess that I don't like is that much of our economy is based on consumer debt. Those banks are loaning money at a markup of sometimes 1,500 %. They borrow money at about 2% and loan to us at 25% and we are banging the doors down to get it. That's outrageous. No other product in the world that I can think of is marked up like that. Even illicit drugs don't have that kind of markup. I don't like when a restaurant marks up a bottle of wine more than 200%. At 250% I won't buy it. And yet my credit card at 9.9% fixed is a great deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It all makes me wonder where it ends. The U.S. as a whole owes roughly 870 BILLION dollars in credit card debt. Divide that by the population of 300,000,000 and you have an average credit card debt of $2750 for every man, woman, AND CHILD. At 3.5 people per household, it's $9600 per household. Unsecured debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I believe if this great country ever falls, it will be an economic collapse. That's where we are most vulnerable.

                 I received a Platinum American Express card from Fidelity with no annual fee and 2% back on all purchases. This has served me well over the years and I have never carried a balance, so I have no idea what the APR is. The catch is that you need a Fidelity Brokerage account, which I opened with $10. The cash back for the month is deposited into the Fidelity account. The day it is deposited, I electronically transfer it to my credit union checking account. At times the monthly cash back has been over $450. It is probably too good to last.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Previously I had a Platinum Visa from Schwab with the same conditions, but Schwab ended it and is now using the one mentioned above with 1% back on everything, 2% gas, etc. I don't use it because it is easier with the Amex, unless someone doesn't take Amex.

                 On the surface these offers look great. It's like a wet spot in the sand in the vast desert. You've been walking for so long in the heat you're thirsty and upon gazing at the wet spot you think there is water there. Only to find it was only camel piss. Same with these card offers; just camel piss.

                 Wow. Some crazy posts here.

                 If you have a credit card, you should only use it if you can pay off the bull every month. If you cannot do that, don't have one, or limit your usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As for the CC fees credit cards are the 21st century. When was the last time you saw someone write out a check at the checkout line? True, businesses jack up their prices to cover the 2% in fees, but they do that REGARDLESS of whether or not you pay by cash, credit, or check; because they EXPECT most people to pay by credit, because they do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I know a few restaurants that will give a discount if you pay by cash, but only if you ASK. Otherwise, they still charge full price.

                 Tim,
                </p>
                <p>
                 You articulated it very well.
                 <br/>
                 All other commenters who don't keep a balance: Tim's point is not about that at all!  It is all about the fees that are charged to the businesses at the *transaction* point, regardless of when you decide to pay your balance of your credit card to the bank.   The math is simple.  The bank charges the business say 2%, and give you back 1%.  The business has to mark up its merchandise/service by 2%.  So, we end up paying 102% and get back 1%  still paying 1% extra for the merchandise or service AFTER getting back the 1% several months later.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In our economy, one way or another the banks are involved in every transaction we make.  However, their fees charged for credit card purchases are WAY more than their other fees.

                 I have a credit card that I use to pay most of my bills every month, and I get 2% rewards on it.  It's enough to get me a round-trip ticket to the city I visit every year, and I always pay it off immediately and haven't paid any interest on it in years.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Incidentally, if you don't own a house your credit rating can only go so high no matter how responsible you are.  I'm a renter and despite using my cards regularly and paying my balances immediately all the time, my rating has never been higher than 757.  It usually fluctuates between 730 and 757, depending on my activity.

                 Wife I have two cards for auto fuel, repairs, food, monthly overhead, etc that are paid off each month.  The two cards repay over $200 cash per year and one accumulates cash to be applied to hotel/travel purchases.
                 <br/>
                 We will use a 3rd card  Citi 18 month APR in place of a heating oil budget plan.   Buy 500 + gallons at lowest cost during summer. Then we'll pay off before next fuillup less than  year. We feel the low price plus avoiding a oil delivery budget cost saves up to 200 a year.  It is important to pay on this card each month remembering when the Zero apr expires and never use the cash advance feature on any card.

                 I always pay my cc off when the time comes. At one time I had a balance over 1000.00 so I called and asked if my interest rate could be lowered and it was, to 9.99  A great rate if I say so myself.
                 <br/>
                 Not only do I get cash back I dont have an annual fee.
                 <br/>
                 I can choose to get a deposit into my checking, or a credit on my balance or gift cards.
                 <br/>
                 I've done all 3 .
                 <br/>
                 I  am going to try to wait till the end of the year to see what the total will be.  Maybe it will be enough to buy a TV  for my guest room.
                 <br/>
                 I have 2 cc and they both have great features.

                 I am retired I have a home that is paid for and 5 credit cards. I am comfortable but far from rich. I use all of the cards and they are all paid in full every month,. The last time I looked at my credit report my FICO score was 810. I don't pay any fees .  Credit and credit cards are not bad. Banks are not evil. There seem to be a lot of uneducated people out there, many of the posting right here who feelm that you should not have to repay your debts and that somehow the bank asking you to do so just makes them "greedy."

                 Well, if you don't like credit cards, don't apply for any.  Then you won't have to worry about fees.  But let's remember  banks are  a business and nobody goes into business to lose money.  The federal government regulates banks to death  and to pay for all of the monitoring of controls, audits and the business of making sure that they comply with all the regulations, they have to charge fees.  Soif you don't want to pay fees  stick your money in a mattress and pay all your bills in cash!

                 Well! This is the longest damn thread I've ever seen for basically an ad for credit cards. It could be said that the participation in this thread is feeding the frenzy of greed, somehowsomewhere . Nonetheless, the small exchange fees banks make have been whittled down by the Gubment. They still make the big money pushing CDO's, carry trades, and libor, chibor, and buymore. Feel comfy carrying cash? Walk around with a pocket full of $100 bills next time you look for a TV. If you lose it or somebody takes it, it's gone, brother.  Unless you still trust checks (Ha!). We pay for safety and security. WE ALSO pay for the deadbeats than run up bills and never plan on paying them

                 These are the 5 greatest cards. They are issued by the best of the best banks. I personally carry all 5 of them and couldn't imagine how it could be any better. I want to personally Thank the banks of the United States of America.

                 so, for those of who pay our balances in full every month and don't travel, none of these cards are for us because frankly, I won't pay fees for having the card either

                 As a small business owner and a consumer I agree and disagree. You cannot just add 2.75% to cover card fees and to t0 put that into perspective 2.75% of a million is $27,500 profit you lose as a business owner. This is why as a service company we do not accept credit cards unless customer pays the 2.75%  fee we are charged. A million in sales is not profit.
                 <br/>
                 As a consumer I use my card for cash back . I get 2% back and charge all business purchases on it. This equates to up to $10,000 a year. I understand both sides but feel you should never use a credit card if you do not have the money to pay it off EVERY month in full

                 I have a Sapphire and it's really nice.  We never carry a balance.  Sure, there is an annual fee but for every $100 I charge, I get $10 back.  And no, we don't freely spend; we watch our spending.

                 I read all these postings and the thing I remember from my youth is that credit cards were started for a specific reasonto obtain money from the holder. Point and cash back are just the carrots in front of you.  The large merchants do not absorb costs they pass them on to you so you are paying a double whammy of the interest rate and the added merchants costs including the fraudulent target charges, save us from our enemiesthey are us.

                 Tim, up above at the top, please sell all of your earthly belongings and give the cash to the poor. Do that, and I, in turn, will not use credit cards that are in my own financial interest. Seriously though, I appreciate your altruism; but it is, after all, off topic. As it is, by paying off the balance (religiously) on my rebate cards every month, I get free use of the money for the billing period, and I earn a percentage of every purchase.

                 After recent news reports about cyber theft such as the recent issue with Target stores we have decided to minimize our credit card use.  We pay cash at eateries and write checks when possible.  We still have credit cards and use them when we have no other option but until credit cards become much safer we minimize their use.  I have only 2 in my wallet and my wife only uses one.  We have been hacked 3 times and been made whole by our card issuer each time but still we are convinced credit cards are dangerous.

                 Credit Cards are good but only for those who know how to manage their expenses. By this I mean using the card(s) only to the point where you will pay it/them off when the bill comes in. Carrying a balance is for suckers. What ever you purchased, regardless if it was a great deal or not, you just increased the rice by the interest charged by your card company.  If you cannot pay it off do not use it.

                 The best credit card is one that is cut up into little tiny pieces and thrown in the trash.  Live without debt.  Yes, it is possible.  Studies have proven that you make the more impulsive purchases when using a credit card, somewhat fewer when using a debit card, and the least when paying cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Credit scores are simply another scam by the banking industry.  I no longer worry about my credit score because I have no intentions of ever borrowing money again.

                 The BOTTOM LINE here is education, starting as young as possible. Far too many people do NOT know how to create a budget, much less live within one. Too many people follow the lead of our Federal, State &amp; local governments by not living within a budget.
                 <br/>
                 The interest rate charged by banks on credit cards, is the choice of the consumer to pay or not to pay. Debit cards should only be used at the issuing bank. Otherwise, leave them at home because if you happen to drop it on the ground &amp; a dishonest person finds it, they will use it as fast as possible draining your account &amp; if you have overdraft protection they will continue until no longer accepted. How often does a cashier ask you for ID when swiping a card?
                 <br/>
                 Credit unions, along with local Mutual banks &amp; S&amp;L's (which are owned by the depositors, YOU) is the place to keep your money. This was mentioned earlier by a long time banker. They usually pay a higher rate on your depository accounts, while offering lower interest rate loans &amp; credit cards &amp; do not increase the rate if you a payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Someone mentioned paying 25%+ on a Chase Slate, all they need to do is make 6 months of prompt payments &amp; the rate will be lowered. They forgot to mention the high rate was due to late payment(s). My Chase Slate rate is 7.99%, but I am what is known in the banking industry as a "deadbeat". This isn't from non-payment but for paying off the balance the day I receive the bill, so they make NO money from me. I own stock in several major banks, so I am a "greedy" banker &amp; believe any American based publically traded corporation should have a zero tax rate, because I am not so stupid as to think any expenses are not passed along to the consumers. My Grand father told me, upon graduating college &amp; starting a job with General Electric Credit Corporation to "pay myself 1st, especially when the company offers matching savings". That is FREE money &amp; because it is automatically withdrawn from my pay before I deposit in the bank, I never missed it. Add to that dividend reinvestment &amp; you can build a very nice nest egg. I did the same when I went to work at Westinghouse Credit Corporation &amp; Fleet Bank. Upon starting my own commercial financial consulting firm, I set-up a SEP program which allowed me to stash up to 20% of my annual income "Tax Free". I retired 2 years ago at 55. My wife retired earlier this year at 62 obtaining pensions from General Electric &amp; International Paper. Along with an annuity. We are covered under her insurance from IP &amp; in addition to the pensions &amp; annuities, we obtain monthly dividends, bond  &amp; savings interest. We live very comfortably, but not extravagant. I often ask retailers if they offer discount for cash &amp; the small business mentioned above, quite often offer discounts for cash. AARP membership for anyone over 50 is a "must have", as discounts, offers &amp; access to free financial planning &amp; calculators is well worth the small fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have several credit cards. one was used for my business expenses only, one is used for any medical expenses &amp; the rewards card is used for large purchases &amp; travel. I did this for easier tax reporting &amp; budgeting. Anymore, a credit card is necessary for airline, hotel, rental car &amp; travel. Early in my career &amp; buying our 1st home having a credit card for emergencies, helped preserve savings. The key is knowing what is a true emergency, like a new hot water heater or auto repair, not replacing a working cell phone because Apple came out with a new iPhone. Never buy new technology (unless you can pay for it), especially if the item is replacing a working item.
                 <br/>
                 Credit cards, offer charge dispute, free extended warranties, returns, travel insurance, ZERO liability on unauthorized charges, even Citi offers a 60 day "rewind" offer which when you go buy a new TV or other item, you simply register the purchase with them &amp; if they find the product within the next 60 days at a price $25 to $250 lower, they send me a check. NONE of my credit cards have an annual fee.
                 <br/>
                 Several years ago the credit cards offered 0% cash, without today's 3% to 5% transaction fee. I used that free money to invest. Paying the balance off BEFORE any interest fee's started. Wake-up people, you are responsible for your own finances. If you are simply overwhelmed by the time &amp; effort to budget &amp; save, then there are many free resources to help you. Pull you own Credit report for free,  requesting one from each of the major 3 reporting agencies, every 4 months &amp; correct any incorrect information. Don't waste money paying for credit reports or identity theft protection, unless you can afford it &amp; do not have the time or inclination to monitor your own credit.
                 <br/>
                 Set-up alerts on your bank, credit union, debit cards &amp; credit cards, alerting you to charges made to these accounts. If nothing else go over your bank &amp; credit card statements upon receipt &amp; question any charges you did not make as soon as possible to avoid any potential liability. If you are living pay check to pay check, making minimum monthly payments, then you must reign in your spending. Start by keeping track of every daily expense. You'll be amazed at the "leakage" that occurs on a monthly basis. If you expect Social Security &amp; Medicare to "bail" you out, you will find a rude awakening. In the long run material "things" will not make you any happier.
                 <br/>
                 P. T. Branum said over 100 years ago that "There is a sucker born every minute", given population growth it is now every nanosecond. Quit blaming greedy bankers, inept politicians &amp; the "1%ter's and take control over those things you can &amp; take "personal responsibility"  for your finances. Because complaining about these things on a blog doesn't change anything.
                 <br/>
                 Money can be one of the hardest things to get, but it certainly is the easiest to give away, especially if you do not pay attention. If your bank charges fee's for depositing or withdrawing YOUR money, find a different bank, immediately!
                 <br/>
                 Finally, I am not so cold hearted or nave, that there is a portion of our population which due to things beyond their control, like medical issues or not allowed access to opportunities of education or obtaining gainful employment and am not opposed to audited government help via my taxes. We should all feel some responsibility to help those who are sincerely trying to help themselves, including those brave people who have worn the uniform of our armed services &amp; protected the freedoms we enjoy.
                 <br/>
                 As far as "greedy" bankers &amp; how they created the current recession, people forget the speculators who got rich "flipping houses", Regan's deregulation of Bank &amp; Insurance companies, unscrupulous Mortgage brokers who took advantage of uneducated public, the uneducated public, mortgage securitization, including the rating agencies, accountants, attorney's, Investment bankers  &amp; the media, which loves to "sell fear".
                 <br/>
                 We spend far too much time looking for someone to blame, instead of fixing problems. Just like the postings. If you have a problem with "greedy" bankers or credit cards don't use them. There are alternatives &amp; the choice is YOURS.

                 As a self-made millionaire who lost it all, I believe I'm qualified to speak about "self-interest" (versus greed).  We are all motivated by self-interest, but the key is showing deference to the self-interest of those that you "exchange" with (money for service, service for service, etc).  Banks have shareholders they "report to", and  those shareholders invested  (exchanged) for a return on their investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Banks exchange credit cards with consumers in return for annual fees, interest, or the ability to derive funds when the consumer exchanges their credit card "swipe" for an item.  The merchant accepts immediate payment (convenience)  in exchange for a fee from the bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In all instances above, there are different interests that have to be addressed and balanced.  The "imposition" of one parties interest over another leads to an inbalance, and a desire to move towards  equilibrium.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Overseeing all of these transactions as an independent (supposedly) arbiter, is our government.  Evidence has shown time and time again, our politicians exploit their role as arbiters in order to get re-elected.  As a "sucker" who lost it all , I'm confident I did not get the same relief the banks obtained as a result of my poor decisions.  Shame on me for not being smarter, but shame on politicians using taxpayer money to bail out donors (banks/voters)  who were just as stupid as I was in their decision making.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Banks  are there to make money, and that includes the provision of credit cards.  Call it greed if you like, but, if you have a job, then you are greedy  you're just in an inferior position to that of the greedy bank.  If the government bails out the bank, good for the bank and it's shareholders  bad for us citizens!

                 Are banks greedy?  Certainlybut no greedier than their customers.  The idea that banks are evil because they are greedy would then apply to every individual on the planet in one form or another.  No less greedy is the government.  And if we really want to get down to it, it isn't just the banks and government in bed together, we're right there under the covers with them trying everything we can to get the best deal whether it is a no interest introductory credit card, "free" goodies from the government for our business or ourselves, the best deal on a car, a tv, a whatever.  The vitriol directed at the banks is as much projection as it is deserved anger.  We scream that a car loan is costing us 20%but our credit is crap; we whine that a CD only pays 25 basis points but then we turn around and look for low cost or no cost checking accounts and credit cards.  Do some banks charge more than they should?  If they do the market will find outthat's why I have some accounts with regional banks and local credit unions instead of major national banksthey tend to cater more to individual consumers than major banks do.

                 I haven't read all the posts, but I can tell you that even though I have excellent credit and take advantage of these kinds of specials  I've recently experienced the dark side of these dealings
                </p>
                <p>
                 Recently my father in law passed away and I started to review the fianancials.  Even though his credit wasn't great, it wasn't bad either.  However, the interest rates the creditors were charging him were on the order of %25 annually.  I now realize that while I'm getting the perks, the banks are making it up on the vulnerable.  And after contacting the banks to see if the debt could be reduced, I was consistently met with  "he signed the papers  he knew what he was doing".  Well yes  that is true, but what choice did he have  go without food, let the house fall apart, let the car rot?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yes  the banks are to blame.  They have the money, and they will not give it away.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is really something wrong with the banking business when they will pay us 0.5% on our savings accounts, and they will charge 25% on loans.  Someone is getting rich  and it's not me

                 I have the american express 2% cash back on all purchases. In the past two years i have collected over $1,000 cash for paying my bills. I run a zero balance, that is hard to do but we will go with out (football tickets, fine dining, some extras). So if you can disapline yourself there is free cash to be made.

                 Only one of these cards list the interest rate. I could care less about all the bells and whistles on a card I just want low interest in case I don't pay it all off that month. I waited until I got two offers, one from USAA and one from my credit union and dumped the others- yes that means Chase, Citi and Bank of America. USAA and my credit union have low interest and it doesn't vary.

                 TC: one more thing: The gas stations that offer cash discounts never beat a 1% cash back on a credit card, much less the 2% I now get. So I wonder if it really matters. I remember back in college in Baton Rouge, many vendors discounted for cash but they were always the junky places.

                 TC: I live in SC. Many gas stations offer discounts for cash, which often includes debit cards. At least one vendor I deal with, a small beer-brewing supplier, offers cash discount. I have seen comments like yours before. I wonder if this is state regulation.

                 I find the vitriol thrown at banks in the comments to be puzzling. If the government didn't disallow merchants the ability to offer discounts for cash, credit cards would not have anywhere near the market power or usefulness they have today. If merchants were allowed to offer 3% to 5% discounts for using cash the market share of credit cards would fall precipitously. For those feeling offended by this particular marketplace, you should look first to our politicians who insist on market meddling that inevitably produces winners and losers according to their judgement.

                 Whenever you blame things on "the rich," that is nothing more than the whiny politics of envy and bitterness. "The Rich" got that way by the time-tested way: spending less than they earn being responsible with their money &amp; choices.. staying in school so they can earn a job with an actual salary and learning from things like books and other responsible people. People who don't do that. who wish to just have things handed to them  are the ones who blame everything on "the greedy rich."  I have two words for you: Grow up!!  As Winston Churchill famously observed: "Show me a man who isn't a liberal when he's 20 yrs old, and I'll show you a man with no heart.  But show me a man who isn't a conservative when he's 40, and I'll show you a man with no brain."

                 "banks make 500-700% profit on each transaction, "
                 <br/>
                 Really? How? I take payments by credit card, and I pay 3% on the transaction. unless the customer is going under balance, then there is no charge to them other than the charge I am making, my processor is making a swift 3% (which seems reasonable, arguably, but that is a separate conversation)
                 <br/>
                 So how do you figure they are making 700% profit? If you spend $10 with me, I get $9.70, you have $10 leave your account. I just dont see how the bank is getting $70 from this.

                 Never mind the credit card offers. One way or another, they always try to rip us off. I stick mostly to cash transactions, using credit cards as little as possible. And I have it set up to pay off the balance automatically so I never get hit with late fees or interest. And I have overdraft protection, so any time I overdraw my account, the balance gets swept into a line of credit, with a reasonable interest rate (6%). But I usually cover the balance quickly, so if I do get hit with interest it's only a matter of a few pennies.
                 <br/>
                 What ticks me off is that medical offices are now hitting us with late fees. But that's another story.

                 Actually good point about differing past experiences with banking institutions.  As we see from this atricle they all are different.  With near perfect credit score my Chase Mastercard told me to go pound sand when I asked for a rate reduction from 21%.
                 <br/>
                 I'll be checking into something like one of these even though I don't carry much ballance.

                 I have, for years a credit with 7.9% fixed rate, if I ever have to go over a month, it doesn't break me.

                 Hey, I have an idea!  Let's all argue about whether credit cards are good or not, and whether the banks that issue them are evil greedy pigs, a benevolent part of our economy, or a neutral transaction processor just running a for-profit business.  Be sure to chime in, because no matter what your experience or education on economic policy, banking, consumer psychology, or business management, your voice is just as valid as an expert's!  Thanks, internet!

                 It has nothing to do with "greed".  For 10 years my wife and I watched friends and neighbors spend like they were 1% ers, all on credit.  The we watched other do cash-out refi on their homes simply to put a BMW in the driveway, right before the housing buble burst.
                 <br/>
                 We have always done without what most take for granited, or "expect they deserve" and it has been tough over the years raising kids but we also reap the benifets of having a 800+ credit score for the last 15 years.
                 <br/>
                 It drives us crazy listening to the same people who fell for living outside their means blaming the "rich" 1 %ers and the those dasterdly  banks.
                 <br/>
                 Credit cards and home mortguages are volantary, so is debt, and so is a perfect credit score.
                 <br/>
                 Noone has a "right" to stuff or healthcare or anything else being used by democrats to purchase votes, that is where the fingers should be pointed.

                 Folks, I have been an American Express card holder since 1979 and have not paid one cent of interest. I pay my Am Ex balance when due at the end of each month.  Am Ex is excellent about protecting it's customers' warranties and faulty product purchases.

                 It's curious about blaming the "greed" of banks as the root problem of our economic system.  25 years ago, banks made about 1.5% return on assets. That means for example that if a bank had $100 million in assets, it made about $1.5 million a year  hardly greedy.  Today banks still make about 1.5% on assets.  The difference is that 25 years ago, banks made their profit by making loans.  How many of you critics have a loan from an actual bank where you went in an applied for a loan?  Home loans are generally not thru banks; car loans are made by the automakers lending arms; and etc.  So today banks have turned into transaction processors -they earn their 1.5% ROA on transactions not loans.  So, don't make any transactions if you don't want to pay a fee.  Asking for free transactions is just another form of greed  Time change.  Inane thinking never does

                 Credit cards should always be paid in full every month. If you cannot do so then you shouldn't use them. If you can pay off every month then they work for you. I enjoy a free plane tickets and car rental to Hawaii every three years with the miles in get. Really cost me 79.00 member fee per year. Only charge what you can afford each month and pay on time!

                 If you shop carefully and obtain items on sale the that helps negate any fees.  Having said that, I charge over $50,000 a year and have done that for years.  I pay the bills off each cycle and could care less about the costs.  Yes, there are losers in every equation, that's life.

                 I believe this is a paid advertisement.  I've got an 800+ FICO and have done research on the cards which provide the best deals.  For most purchases, I use the Capital One card that provides 1.5% cash back on all purchases.  For dining, I use Citi Forward: 5 points per dollar spent.  For gas and groceries, Pentagon Federal CU has a couple nice cards.  I also keep the Chase Freedom and Discover cards for their rotating discounts which are sometimes attractive.

                 Anyone with VERY good credit is smart enough to care more about the permanent APR than the temporary deals. Most of these promotions are paid for by 20%+ apr after the promotion. This I DO NOT NEED. I need a long-term great rate, like the ones I have now. Thus these deal do not tempt me at all.

                 No list of great credit cards is complete without the Hilton HHonors American Express card.  2 years ago my wife and I enjoyed an 8-night vacation at Hilton's all-inclusive resort in Jamaica, and bought the whole stay with HHonors program points  we paid only for our airfare.  We just booked another vacation for next month, also paid for with Hilton points, this time 7 nights in Curacao, a mere 2 years later.  Yes, that's a FREE VACATION EVERY TWO YEARS.  If you have the discipline to do all your spending on one card and pay it off every month, this one's a no-brainer.

                 Credit cards definitely offer some unique benefits if you know how to take full advantage of the terms ( at least reading the terms would be a great start for many users). When LOT airlines completely mucked up my trip, then refused an even partial refund, i got my entire airfare ($1100) back through the card company  I had used to buy the tickets. More recently, my wife and I got bonuses of 140,000 American Airlines miles by opening 4 Citibank cards 2 years ago, then closing all but one, which we use to get additional miles  ( 1 mile/$1 spent).  The yearly fee on the card is $90, and since we pay off the balance every month, we don't get charged any interest or other fees. Using the miles saved us about  $2800 on airfare, with over 40k miles still unused.  $2800 for $180 is a great deal in my book. Too bad it's for first time customers only. But I'll definitely check into the Barclays Arrival and Southwest deals in the article. Someone in the comments claimed you have to be "rich" to pay your credit cards off every month. Apparently, the commenter has cause and effect confused. If you ever hope to become anything close to rich, you might wanna start by paying on time and avoiding the fees. My wife's a nurse and I am Army enlisted, with no lottery wins or wealthy parents  so we are as middle class as it gets,  but our credit histories show zero late payments over the last 14 years. When you do that, banks will indeed offer you thousands of dollars in rewards. Yes, I realize bank owners are not the ones giving me the money  it comes from fees and interest banks collect from other cardholders. But any time folks paying 18% APR on sh*t they can't afford want to subsidize free airfare for us, we're on board, literally and figuratively :)

                 In response to Tim November 15, 2013. The people who pay for it are the ones without discipline and and self control on how to spend. The savvy ones get the cards, meet the minimums to get the bonus, pay them off and close the accounts. You'd be better off educating consumers on how to manage their credit than blaming it on the banks. Who doesn't know that a company's goal is to make a profit?

                 Funny to see the sheeple rise up to defend their spending-without-money madness. One point 'Sam' missed is that all these transactions are 'digital', and causes MORE money to be printed  which is WHY we're in the mess we're in; 'If you're not part of the solution'
                </p>
                <p>
                 And one fool on here actually believe that his cash has devalued  so he doesn't carry any  so only uses cards? HUH?? The logic there eludes me. lol. Sheeple. The controlled-MSM media and the gov' have gotten Americans to believe ANYTHING these days.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Which leads me to what is going to happen. A False Flag event IS coming, and a 'terror attack' is disguised within a drill, so those participating in the 'drill' are unaware the drill has 'gone live'.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The government keeps 'planting the seeds' of a power grid-takedown, a banking computer virus, etc. This is to get the idea planted in the American sheeple's mind, so that when it does happen, Americans, like those bobble-head dolls, will all collectively nod that they "knew about this".
                </p>
                <p>
                 When all you cash-less, living on cards and EBT's, and I-make-$1.25-purchases-on-a-card fools wake up, it will be too late. Their 'drill' they were "practicing" that day 'somehow coincided with a terrorist attack'  like Sept 11, Boston, etc., and your new god  the credit card  won't be able to save you.

                 I'll leave you with Vladimir Putin's recent words to chew on; Any fourth grade history student knows socialism has failed in every country, at every time in history, said Putin. President Obama and his fellow Democrats are either idiots or deliberately trying to destroy their own economy.

                 I tried the Chase Slate card which, on the surface, appeared to be just as advertised.  However, after receiving the card a letter came along a few days later explaining they could not pay off one of the balances.  When I called to ask why they said the bank would not accept a check from them and I had to write one myself from those that came to me in the mail.  Kind of strange so I cancelled the account.  That took forever!

                 J Smooth.CORRECT.CORRECTCORRECT..Some people villainize banks like it is their fault. Without fees people would just not pay. Banks are a business just like Walmart. They are giving you credit (money) that you don't have to carry with you. It is a convenience that is FREE if you use it right and not only that, it PAYS YOU for using it right. Pay on time and you don't have to worry. Spend ONLY WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD and you don't have to worry.

                 Why is  it that NOBODY understands how to use credit cards? Instead I always see these post about FEES FEES FEES!  You do not have to pay ANY FEES to use any credit card.  Please let me explain how simple this whole credit card issue is America:  Credit Cards are Great, that's right Great, but only for mature individuals who understand how they are to be used.
                 <br/>
                 1.) Credit Cards make up the bulk of a credit score (good or bad  your choice on how you use it) at a whopping 35% of your  score is judged by these specific debt instruments.
                 <br/>
                 2.) You have way more protection than your debit card (anyone shop at Target recently)
                 <br/>
                 3.) Safer than carrying cash, and if it's get's lost or stolen, call the issue and cancel it, AND get your money back! Try that with a wad of cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now these Fee's that you always talk about.  When you have a credit card, if  you only spend an amount that YOU KNOW you can PAY OFF IN FULL every on or before the DUE DATE, guess what player? drumroll please. YOU DON'T PAY ANY FEE'S!!!!! ZILCH, ZERO, NADA, NOTHING, NATHAN, NOT  1 CENT.Wow  Poof! It's Magic.  And you build awesome credit because you have a, 0 debt to credit ratio, and you get all the protections I mentioned before, and your favorite, NO FEES OF ANY KIND&gt;  so what is the complaining about? I'm guessing the people who aren't smart enough to pay off the balance every month and fall into a death cycle of interest. But these same people are smart enough to study fiat money and assert other conspiracy theories, yet cannot responsibly only spend  what they can afford. Why not use credit cards to your advantage and pay off any and all balances every month, and let the credit card companies pay you instead, smarty pants.  I'm just saying,  I Call it like I see it, and I C U.

                 There are transaction costs to all forms of payment. Even cash has the cost of counting it and taking it to the bank to deposit. Banks then have the cost of  tellers and accounting for it in their records. Checks have their transaction costs. Debit cards are like credit cards and have their costs. Fraud is a cost for all forms of payment. So the big question is; are the transaction costs for credit cards so much higher than all other forms of payment that they should be avoided by consumers and merchants? I doubt it. Not at this point, although the electronic age may come up with a payment method so superior that Visa and Mastercard and American Express go out of business. That'll be the day.

                 I use my cards like charge cards, so I never carry a balance.

                <p>
                 Regarding the higher cost of transaction on the merchant, one way to play that game is to own shares of bank stocks, then you get both sides of the game, like paying your self the transaction fee.

                 anybody who is paying credit card interest should get a payday loan and pay it down..:)
                 <br/>
                 Are you kidding?  Anyone paying credit card interest needs to do whatever it takes to get your balances down to zero, and if you can't you should cut up all your credit cards until you can manage your finances

                 I have a better card than all the above, if you are after rewards, and a second card that is arguably better.

                 The average corporate tax actually paid by U.S. businesses is 14%.   Some keep stating the 35% number as if it's real.  It isn't.  The business lobbyists have packed in a huge number "special exceptions" by "influencing" Congressmen and Senators to vote them into law.  I wonder how they "influence" them to do that?   It's too bad you and I don't have someone to write "special exceptions" into the law to cut our taxes by 21% a year.

                 I remember in the 1960's, into the 1970's, 12% was a common credit card interest rate, while passbook savings were paying 4.5% rising to 5.5 percent. Today, the average credit card interest rate is close to 15%, while regular savings accounts pay well under 1 percent.  See, there's plenty of room to provide for cash back rewards.

                 I have the same Credit Card for the past 25 years.  I purchased it through my Credit Union and over the years it has saved me a ton of money.   No gimmicks, just low interest rates, and excellent service.  Who needs banks?

                 Lots of great commentary from multiple angles of the issue.  As a consumer and regular user of plastic, I find carrying cash is much too inconvenient.  Mainly because cash sources, for me at least, are out of my way during my daily commute to and from work.  Oh sure, I could keep a small amount on hand home but then, it seems to disappear.  Like many consumers, I despise the merchant that has imposed a swipe fee if I choose plastic; and like many consumers, I do not give them my business any more.  They want to make profit just like any business owner does, but is it right to punish those that bring food to your table?  A few of them also I've noted, don't want to accept checks either.   As quickly as swiping a card at a POS machine has taken most of the civilized world by storm, it makes me wonder though if we will truly become a cashless society entirely.

                 Having been on the collection side of the house, the bigger issue is granting credit to people who do not understand the ramifications or should not have it!  Or, they choose to ignore the consequences and walk away from the debt.  Also, attorneys promising bankruptcy relief and a government that makes collecting money owed dang near impossible with outrageous regulation on legitimate collection firms.  All part of a government intervention that interrupts the business cycle with unintended consequences for legitimate businesses.  Borrow wisely grasshopper!

                 American Express suggested I use my card for every day expenses and told me that if I use my card at a gas station that I'll get a 3% kickback  well  by using my card it cost me 10c MORE per gallon of gas and I need just over 9 gallons so it cost me just short of $1.00 to use my AMEX card  I saved 3% of $32  or 96c  so in this case I came CLOSE to breaking even  but it pays to check out your card CLOSELY to see if the benefits outweigh the costs or is the bank winning?  There are THREE THINGS USED to CONTROL the people of Earth  1) Governments 2) Religions and 3) BANKS  beware the bankers!!!  Caveat Bankers.

                 Cash, checking account, debit card, credit card and bitcoin are instruments to facilitate financial transactions. Each instrument has strengths and weaknesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My wife and I choose to use credits cards for almost all of our financial transactions. The cards provide safety with nominal risk. The card issuers provide excellent service and assume the risk of fraudulent transactions. They provide additional benefits to card users in order to remain competitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Although we use credit cards, we do not carry a balance. We do not carry a balance as we use the cards for the "ordinary" purchases that we would pay with cash, check or debit cards. These purchases fall within our "budget" and are expected expenses. Extraordinary purchases, such as appliances, are also placed on the credit cards but have been put in our budget and we have set aside funds for payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The side benefit to us is the cash rewards for shifting our payments to the credit cards. The amount will total over $1,600 this year with a large part coming from the American Express Blue Cash Preferred Card.

                 Why don't they just lower rates and fees.   I don't need a "free prize in every box" or a rebate scam.  Why not just keep it simple.  Does anyone know a card like that?

                 banks make 500-700% profit on each transaction, so having 1-3% kickback out of our own money is no sinner! never consider a simple card that is shining example of bank's absolute greed and principle of not sharing the spoils.

                 @Greg,  Boy are you ever right about that,   Not only are there almost no companies actually paying the 35% or 50%, many pay 0% and not a few are actually getting our taxpayer money back as refunds!

                 @Clem  I agree with using credit unions.  Anyone who doesn't maintain a hefty balance at a bank (I'm talking 6+ figures here) is much better off at a credit union.  I get free checks as a long term senior customer, earn interest on my checking account with no minimum requirement, get refunds of any ATM fees I incur, have overdraft protection and always get personalized service when I need it.  There is no way that would be the case at a bank.  I remember years ago opening a checking account at Republic Bank on the promise of "free checking for life."  That was a joke.  They canceled the free checking after about three years.  I also feel a commitment to my credit union.  I rarely use ATMs, try to get cash back at the grocery store instead.  I rarely use checks anymore as my debit card provides my CU with a small profit.  Its a two way street with the CU feeling an obligation to me and I to them.

                 Everyone knows the merchant pays fees. Everyone also knows it's voluntary. No one is twisting their arm. However, consider this: in certain businesses, like travel + leisure, or restaurants, if you do not take credit cards, you are laughed right off the page in the online directory of places! Seriously, can you fathom how many extra "rounds" of drinks were bought because the one buying them "just put it on his card?"

                 I'm not sure if anyone else has commented on this, but has anyone mentioned that all of these deals end with a VARIABLE interest rate?  I'm paying 10% FIXED interest and would LOVE to transfer my balance to a 0% card for a year and a half but not at the expense of coming back to a variable rate that STARTS at 13% and could go clear up to 23%! Ouch!

                 I'm glad these banks make profits, my 401k holds some of their stocks.  Cut the sour grapes, my luck is somebody else's fault comments and get in the game.

                 It all boils down to the simple philosophy of..
                </p>
                <p>
                 IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CASH, YOU DON'T NEED IT!!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Personal budgeting &amp; household economy are how to stay out of debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Don't blame credit cards &amp; banks for making a buck off of your own greed &amp; self indulgence.  Be a better role model when using credit cards, teach your children better.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I acknowledge that there are always extenuating circumstances &amp; the cash may not be immediately available (ie hospital costs, emergency life saving procedures), but having the newest &amp; biggeBEp8q-Zkw%%; p=dedQ6eFst material possession does not constitute an emergency.

                 @bozozozo: Whether you can pay off balances has little to do with being rich or poor.  It has to do with how well you've aligned your spending with your income.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The way I see it, it either requires great riches or poor judgment to decide to pay an extra 30% on each purchase in the form of interest going to the bank (if you only pay the minimum each month, you may pay more than double the purchase price when all is said and done).  I know I'm not rich enough to afford to carry a balance.  Or at least I don't see interest payments as a wise use of my very limited funds.  I'd rather spend my  money on ME than on my bankers.

                 who pays? the slugs with poor credit who are paying more than 30% interest on their unpaid balances, and who can't seem to pay it down.
                </p>
                <p>
                 the winners are the rich who can pay their balance each due date.
                </p>
                <p>
                 the real winners are the credit card companies, who screw those who can't pay their balances, and who screw the merchants, by taking a percentage of their gross.

                 The thing Tim did not mention is that, while it's fine for the well-off and even the middle class to say they will pay a slightly higher price for goods in order to get the convenience and perks, the poor also have to pay the higher price whether they like it or not. Few places charge different prices for cash and credit. The gas stations used to try that, but soon found customers did not like it, so they just hid it in the price of a gallon and now charge everyone extra. They certainly did not just stop recouping the fees. And will not get the perks because they can't get the cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As Tim said, not the end of the world, and there's virtually no chance of anything done about it, but you might as well face reality.

                 Tim has a lot of good points, as does Sam. Speaking as a retired banker, and credit union officer, I can affirm that banks are indeed greedy. I once sat in a meeting where the senior participants were trying to figure out how to raise fees so customers with lower collected balances would not notice. The bank eventually succeeded, as people figured out what was going on, and the less valuable customers left. Most went to a large credit union. Fast forward ten years: that bank, and others that followed the leader, were on their collective knees begging those folks to come back into the commercial bank fold. It seems as if those lowly customers were wealthy and successful "members" now.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many, many of my commercial bank friends continue to do their primary "banking" with credit unions, just as they secretly did when employed at our/their respective commercial banks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Don't reply with the usual taxes, profits etc. argument. I am a dyed-in-the-wool Republican, and just as much a capitalist as most living in a relatively stable environment. I proudly pay my fair share of taxes and fees to live in this great land of ours- the USA.  I just appreciate the credit union environment, and its well known reluctance to participate in financial schemes that make no sense. Just because a large loan fee can be charged, along with an elevated interest rate, does not make an already crappy loan smell any better.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Commercial banks caused our world-wide financial meltdown. Greed is actually a "four-letter" word. Commercial bankers even wish the commercial deposit insurance funds could merge with the much more solvent credit union insurance fund.

                 I have had Chase Slate for some years. The introductory offer is good, but don't carry a balance after the interest free offer is up. I am currently paying 27.25% interest on a balance of some $2700. Wish I could get caught up soon.

                 Sam,
                 <br/>
                 I agree with your points about the government and the banking industry- I think they are all corrupt. But in support of Tim's point, as a small business owner the fees charged by banks to be able to have your business are exorbident. The tale 2-4% of hard earned profits- just taking it right out of the bottom line. The small business owner is taking the hit. In addition to the transaction fees they also charge businesses for the machine used to swipe the card. Your bank does not hate you. They still make 1.5-2.5% off every dollar you spend, even after giving you 1.5% back. Think of how much you spend in a year, and multiply that times the number of people in society using credit cards. Banks make a huge profit. The point is, they encourage you to use the card and charge small business owners who are struggling to break even every time you do.

                 "Swipe fee" is only charged to smaller shops which cannot reach the volume requirements bigger processors offer. Larger chains, like Safeway, don't pay that, just a straight percentage of the transaction  about 2.4%.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The bigger problem than swipe fees are chargeback fees. The processors charge a "chargeback fee" that may be in tens or even hundreds of dollars if you have "too many" chargebacks. It only takes one fraudster to lose hundreds of dollars to those fees.

                 I use a credit card that pays me cash back only.  In 2013  has received just about 200.00  so far. It is a matter of being responsible and not carrying a balance .  I use my card as I would a debit card. If I can't afford the purchase , I do not make the purchase. As far as businesses getting charged fees,  they can pass that on to the consumer if they wish to..Gasoline stations do it all the time. I choose not to purchase fuel from stations that do so. It is all a matter of choice . C. R.

                 USE OF CREDIT CARD IS SMARTER WAY TO GO. I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIMES FOR RETURNS, WARRANTIES, REBATES, TAXES, HAVING PERMANENTNT RECORD OF PURCHASR HISTORY HAS COME TO RESCUE. ALSO, YOU GET THINGS LIKE ACCIDENT AS ND RENTAL INSURANCE, BREAKAGR PROTECTION AND EXTENDRD WARRANTIES.

                 Angle Flores comment is great; short and to the point.  You don't have to be rich to have excellent credit.  Just pay your bills promptly and don't miss any.
                 <br/>
                 As for me, I don't use the credit card for little purchases, I use cash.  I think that helps offset the fees charged by CC companies.  I don't buy a 79 cent item with a credit card.  Not much left for the merchant that way.

                 Well Tim,
                 <br/>
                 You seem to have it all figured out.  Banks are greedy and bad.  People are stupid and get tricked into getting and using credit cards.
                 <br/>
                 If you don't want to use credit cards, fine  don't.  If you don't want to shop where credit cards are accepted, fine  don't.
                 <br/>
                 But do you really think cash is better?  Policies of our government and their sister-wife, the Federal Reserve make the dollar worth less and less every day.  And when the pumping stops and the inflation starts, cash lose value even more rapidly.
                 <br/>
                 The problems of bank policies stem largely from an overreaching federal government.  If banks  even big large mega banks  would be allowed to "fail" when they make stupid decisions and bad policies, they would likely make fewer of them.  Government interference in the loan underwriting mechanism and bailouts after huge blunders largely lets the banks do as they please.
                 <br/>
                 Capitalism is a risk-reward environment.  Eliminate the risk with bailouts, and the rewards with burdensome laws, regulations and taxes, and you no longer have Capitalism.
                 <br/>
                 Some regulation of banks is necessary to prevent fraud and maintain solvency.  Our current system is so far beyond that now.
                 <br/>
                 By the way, I have a credit card with no annual fee.  I pay the balance off each month, so I don't pay any interest.  I get 1.5% cash back on each purchase.  I'll bet credit card companies hate me.

                 Well said, I too have traveled the world using my award points. I even bought a flat screen TV for our mountain home.  Useing your credit card for everything and paying it off each month is the responsible way of handling a credit card.

                 All of these credit cards are for people with excellent credit. They can afford the offers if they choose. Now as far a Winco, they arent saving me any money if the product goes bad before i get it home.

                 Sam, it is true that usage ad acceptance is, indeed, voluntary. But there is voluntary and then there is voluntary.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In today's economic timed and hardships, fee businesses can afford to lose the patronage of consumers like you who rarely use cash anymore. It's sad that it's better to eat those fees than to potentially lose a customer. What makes that sadness more profound is the logistics of it: you as a potential customer do not carry the actual legal tender and currency of the land may not frequent an establishment because that business refuses to accept fake, electronic funds that 1) they have to pay a fee to someone else to make that transaction and 2) not even have access to those funds for several days.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A legal practice does not make for an ethical practice. Banks want excessive profits that they were unheard of before they began pushing "plastic." You want perks in return for spending your money. A business accepting your cards just wants to survive and compete.

                 Fees do vary widely. Your 2-4%  doesn't cover the entire breadth of the situation. Debit cards carry a lower percentage fee than credit cards. Regardless of percentage, you forgot to include an automatic "swipe fee" that can be as much as an additional 25 per transaction, applied to both purchases AND returns, making a business lose both ways. And then there are the additional higher fees for accepting card payment when a card is not physically present durinf that transaction. Rewards credit cards carry the highest financial burden for businesses because those businesses are paying out of pocket to forcefully give over the money to you to pay for them. Ever consider why so many businesses don't accept Discover? Discover will charge a business 2% to accept its card so they can turn around and give 1% to the cardholder.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm sorry, but businesses are more blackmailed into accepting plastic by consumers like you because it's impossible to survive otherwise. You say you'd be happy to pay higher fees to continue as you are? If you were, then you are no longer getting those perks. You're paying for them in smaller increments instead. And the vast majority of people are not so willing as you. Do you remember the outrage that occurred when Bank of America announced that they'd begin charging a $5 per month fee to its customers that used a debit card? B of A had to rescind that due to the backlash because people wouldn't voluntarily hand over five dollars a month for the convenience you love so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And while true that there are worse evils in the world to tackle, it doesn't diminish the importance of the smaller ones. As I said before: legal versus ethical. You have no issue with banks reaping outrageous profits for doing nothing? Do you have any issues with oil companies doing the same?

                 Tim,
                 <br/>
                 I think the part you're missing is that credit card usage and acceptance is voluntary. Good for Winco foods that they've chosen not to accept credit cardsthat is their absolute right. It is also my right to patronize businesses that accept my cards. I am more than willing to pay a slightly higher price for the convenience of using my card.  I carry almost no cash and use my credit card for everything. In addition to convenience, I have flown all over the world with miles which is a real perk. I also harbor no ill will towards the banks for making moneythere is nothing wrong with making a profit, even huge profits, as long as the activities are legal and ethical.
                 <br/>
                 Lastly, I'll point out to you that the higher prices we pay to cover hidden credit card fees absolutely pales in comparison to the price we pay for onerous regulations and taxation by the government.  Credit card transaction fees range from 2 to 4% while the federal corporate income tax is a world leading 35%! Tack on state and local taxes and we're up to 50% in some areas before we've started talking about regulation expenses. And unlike credit cards, the governments piece of the action is anything but voluntary.

                 The problem with all of these great deals, as is the problem with increased credit/debit card usage, lies solely on WHO ends up paying for these "deals" in the end. No one ever considers the obvious here: GREED. Who is behind every single one of these cards? A bank. We all know that banks do not just give anything away. They do not jus offer up perks for free. Someone always pays for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If The Great Recession should have taught the American people anything, it's that the banking industry is not on our side. We still feel the results of this today as larger banks continue tightening policies, raising fees, and introducing new fees for previously free services (Chase now charges fees for depositing too much cash into your account!!).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Yes, I digress. With cause. Everyone needs to understand that the banking industry wants to encourage the increase in card usage. Why? It makes them partners in every single transaction that occurs with one, and they will be getting a piece of the action for each and every swipe. Consider that every time any of us use a credit or debit card, for any reason. Each time that card is swiped, the business that just accepted your card (so you can get whatever benefit out of it you think you are) is paying a fee to the bank that issued it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Often these fees are rather steep and certainly add up to the cost of doing business in America today. Sowhat happens to that cost as it accumulates higher and higher with bank-sanctioned increased usage? Do these businesses choose to eat those costs, prolonging the affects of The Recession  that slow economic recovery, particularly for small business? Some do. If they don't, those costs are turned around and compensated for by raising the price in goods, services, or by tagging on their own fees for card usage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ultimately, my good people, it is you and all of the rest of us who pay the ultimate price. While the banking industry reaps their profits in the billions of dollars in processing fees alone,  we see an increase in what we pay across the board, just for the perceived benefits and conveniences these cards allegedly bring.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I applaud business such as Winco Foods, who do not accept credit cards in an effort to keep their prices low for their customers, and other business who have turned things around by charging the customer the fees for swiping their cards. After all, it is your choice to use the card, you should be the one to pay for any fees associated with that, not the business and not the next customer in line.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can assure you that if each of you were responsible for paying the fees that your card usage burdens this economy with, you'd think twice next time you pulled it out, and our wonderfully greedy banking industry would have to find another means of getting their hands in our pockets. Remember, banks don't give anything away for free anymore. They don't have to. Our government won't let them fail no matter what, and they'll continue grabbing money by the billions any way they can until they get slapped on the wrist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Only we have the collective power to influence their practices.
