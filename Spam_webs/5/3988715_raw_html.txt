     How much is inside bacon bits?
     <p>
      During World War 2, strict meat rationing made it almost impossible to
      get a full-sized meal in the morning. Tiny versions of mealtime favorites were
      introduced to the breakfasting public. Cinnamon Toast Crunch replaced
      cinnamon toast, salmon eggs replaced chicken eggs, and demitasses of
      espresso took the place of coffee cups. Unquestionably the favorite
      miniature product to come out of this crisis was the bacon bit.
     </p>
     <p>
      For years, bacon-flavored bits have been sold in jars and used on top
      of salads to add a meaty crunch. Recently Oscar Mayer began selling these
      little bags of real bacon bits.

      The bag claims to contain 3 ounces (85g) of bacon bits, but bacon
      is traditionally measured in strips, not ounces. How many strips of bacon
      are inside? On Friday night, we decided to find out.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steve, Elise and I were over at Tom and Amy's house. The plan was to
      cook some bacon up, and see how many cooked strips of bacon it took to
      total 3 ounces.
     </p>
     <p>
      We dumped the Bacon Bits package onto the scale; 2.995 ounces of bacon bits. How is that for
      accurate packaging?

      We used Oscar Mayer bacon for the comparison. This one pound package was US$5.99

     <p>
      Bacon is sold in packs of these long raw slices. You can also get
      individually-wrapped single slices for kid's lunches, also known as
      Small-Fry or Go-Pork.

      The first step in preparing bacon strips is to peel the slices apart
      from one another. If they don't peel apart easily, try soaking them
      overnight in baby oil.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bacon strips usually have red areas and white areas. The red areas are
      meat. The white areas are fat. Carefully cut away any blue or orange areas
      before cooking.

      As
      the bacon cooked, the fat on the bacon reached its melting point and turned into
      liquid, leaving the pure, healthy pork meat behind.

      While the bacon strips were cooking, we arranged the bacon bits into
      rectangles on a cookie sheet. It looked like they might have been chipped
      from about 12 slices.

      I wanted to measure the hot, liquefied bacon grease, but the plastic
      measuring cup couldn't handle the heat. It melted through and dripped all
      over the place before we it over the sink. Luckily the bacon fat
      seemed to enhance the flavor of
      <i>
       everything
      </i>
      it dripped onto! The
      biscuits were zesty! The salmon was exquisite! The Nylabone was
      brimming with goodness, and the croissants were delicious!
     </p>
     <p>
      If this happens to you, remember that replacement pork fat is easy to
      find in the supermarket. It is called "lard".

      At the scale, the cooked bacon had lost a considerable amount of

      I slowly added cooked bacon to the scale until it registered nearly 3
      ounces. Twelve slices weighed 2.985 ounces! We had our answer!

      As soon as the measuring was over, Tom and I were free to enjoy the
      cooked bacon.
     </p>
     <p>
      A few years ago, I could not have even imagined enjoying bacon except
      in the morning time, but thanks to the
      <b>
       Bacon 24*7
      </b>
      marketing
      campaign, and their computer-animated Sir Francis character, I don't even
      hesitate. Bacon is delicious anytime!

     <p>
      12
      slices is 63% of the pound of bacon, and since the package of bacon bits
      was only $1.89, you'd have to find raw bacon selling for $2.99 a pound to
      justify frying and Cuisinarting your own bacon bits.

      Good
      luck getting your food processor kashered, by the way.

    price for their weight. Bacon is priced like diamonds: The smaller the
    pieces, the cheaper they are per ounce.
