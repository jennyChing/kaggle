       Behold:  the Protong!!!
      </p>
      <p align="center" class="normal">
       These bronze earweights were inspired by Stanislav Szukalski's "Struggle" sculpture (1917).
       <br/>
       The design represents the struggle of the individual against society; singular quality versus quantity.
       <br/>
       The caption here, and thus what we've decided to name this new weight,
       <br/>
       is the name of a book of Szukalski's art, within which he posits an ancient mother language, the
       <i>
        protong
       </i>
       .
       <br/>
       The center image is posted at real size, and the left and right images are blown up 2X.

       <br/>
       The first edition, a batch of 6 bronze pairs, has SOLD OUT.
       <br/>
       Each piece weighed just under an ounce (0.91-0.98ounces aka 26.0-27.7grams),
       <br/>
       and measured 00ga at the top.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <img alt="*gold silver bronze cast Protong ear weights*" border="1" src="goldsilverbronzecastProtong.jpg"/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We have modified the top of our Protong earweights for the next edition, removing some material to make them a little less top-heavy.  This will also reduces the overall weight and makes for a thinner sized wearing surface as well, to around 2ga or so, though 0ga is a good clearance size to fit in the heads.
       <br/>
       Note the jaws come to sharp points, and care must be taken upon insertion and removal to avoid them.
       <br/>
       This new edition is now ready!  Prices for
       <i>
        protong
       </i>
       weights are as follows:
       <br/>
       shown first in gold plated over bronze (special order),
       <br/>
       silver ($115/pair, .78ounces/each aka 22grams/each), then
       <br/>
       bronze ($65/pair, .635ounces/each aka 18grams/each).

       Foxy earweights in bronze or silver

      </p>
      <p align="center" class="normal">
       These fox earweights are made to be worn either with the entire torso through the lobe for the best distribution of weight (at under 1/2" in diameter, requiring a hole size of just under 5/8" to fit them in)
       <br/>
       or with just the tail section in the lobe for those with smaller piercings
       <br/>
       (at around 4ga in diameter, requiring a hole size of just under 0ga to fit them in).
       <br/>
       <br/>
       These are quite heavy as far as the typical range of earweights are concerned, and must be used with extreme caution.  I personally find them to be comfortable for a day of wear, without strenuous activity (no running! ...and no cold weather!), if one is used to and likes a good hefty weighty feel.  However, these may be too heavy for most people.
       <br/>
       The weights are the same for both ears - no lefty and righty twist.  The foxes can stand up on their feet...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        We have made a new mold, and are casting the new edition of smaller foxes as you order them!
        <br/>
        Note that these second edition foxes are 70percent lighter than the first edition foxes,
        <br/>
        and that the bronze weights weigh appoximately 80percent less than silver weights.

        current high silver prices and making a new mold necessitate that the price change to a minimum of $295/pair ... (making them the same price for retail or wholesale customers!).
