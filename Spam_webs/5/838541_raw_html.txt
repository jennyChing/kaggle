           Stories have been told for millennia, often with the intent of teaching people lessons. Many such fables are relatively short, as only a few sentences are needed to get the point across. Here are some strange ones that are all but lost to modern culture.

             5. "The Frogs Desiring A King"
            </strong>
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Greek author Aesop was more than likely aninvented person, much likeHomer. Nevertheless, his persona has persisted throughout the years as one of the earliest authors to provide morals with his stories. Ittells the story of a group of frogs who live happily in a swamp, free of any cares. One day, a fewdecide they'd like a proper leader and plead with Jove, their god, to send them a king. He laughs and sends downa rather large log. The strongest of the frogsjumps on the log and mocks it. Soon, the rest join in, and they complain to Jove that they wanted a strong ruler, not a weak one. Jove listens and sends them a stork, which promptlygobbles them up.

          <p>
           Of Chastity is a short story from a collection known as the
           <em>
            Gesta Romanorum
           </em>
           (The History of Rome), most likely compiled nearthe beginning of the 14th century. This book was extremely popular and influential, even on the works of Shakespeare and Chaucer. According the Listverse,Of Chastity takes place during the reign of the Roman emperor Gallus and tells of an especially skilled carpenter building him a palace. The carpenter gets married, and his new mother-in-law gives him amagical shirtthat will stay clean as long as he and his new wife are faithful to each other.A soldier resolves to get the carpenters wife to cheat on him and cause the shirt to get dirty. The wife escapes the soldier by locking him in a room. Two more men try the same thing, and she traps each of them in rooms as well.When the carpenter returns home, she praises God that the shirt is still clean and tells her husband what happened. The soldiers are freed, their lives changed for the better.

          </p>
          <p>
           Like the Greeks, the people of India had their own moralistic writer, Pandit Vishnu Sharma. The sage from the third century B.C. allegedly authored a collection of tales known as thePanchatantra.Thestoryfollows a Brahman beggar who, one day, receives a full pot of rice gruel from helpful strangers. After he eats his fill, he still has a full pot left. Seeing the full pot at the end of his bed, the Brahmansbegins thinkingabout what might happen if a famine came to the land. He could sell the rice gruel and then buy a mating pair of goats.Lost in his fantasy, hekicks his foot outand breaks the pot. The rice gruel, as well as his dreams, spills onto the floor below.

             2. "The Mosquito And The Carpenter"
            </strong>
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           Written as early as the fourth century B.C., the Buddhawalks by a village and notices a carpenter with his son. A mosquito lands on the bald head of the carpenter, who asks his son to get it off. The son searches for something to swat it with it (apparently forgetting he has hands). The closest thing to the pair isan axe.
          </p>
          <p>
           The son grabs it and swings at his fathers head, killing him on the spot.

           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           It starts off with Death trying to claim a giant whose time on Earth is up. After a long battle, Death is unable to defeat the giant and is left dying himself.Just before he shuffles off the mortal coil, a stranger walks up to Death and helps him up. Death wants to reward the stranger but cant spare him his inevitable fate, so he makes a compromise: Hell warn the man when his death is coming by sending his messengers.Years later, when the stranger is old and shriveled, a hand taps him on the shoulder. Its Death. The stranger is upset, claiming Death didnt warn him. Death disagrees, saying he had sent his messengers:illness, old age, and sleep. The man realizes the truth and allows Death to take him.
