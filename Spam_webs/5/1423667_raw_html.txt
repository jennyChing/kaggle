       After several meetings with him we got a really good idea about his personal tastes as far as bikes go and he gave the impression that he doesnt go for the usual high shine, highly chromed motorbike, as he clearly doesnt have time in his busy schedule to clean and polish and give that sort .....

       We first met them in 2008 when they were doing some stuff with Nick Sanders and of course we had to introduce ourselves, I just had to find out if they are as genuine and down to earth as they seem on the telly.

       As you may have seen on the website we have had some dealings with Victory Cycles before when they asked us to modify their Victory Vega 8 Ball. They must have been pleased with what we did for them as they have asked us to do the paint work on 10 bikes for them.

       As they have got their 10th Anniversary coming up they told us they wanted to build 10 Hammer S bikes with engine modifications and limited editi .....
