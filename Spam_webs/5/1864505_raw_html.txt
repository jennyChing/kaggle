            Getting visitors to your blog is possible and quite realistic if youre willing to put in some effort to get the exposure that you need. If youre spending hours on blog posts and you feel like that workis being wasted because not enough people are seeing the posts, well take a look at some things that you can do to get the right exposure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are some things that you can do to get your blog posts in front of more people and to get more impact from each post.
           </p>
           <h3>
            1. Offer Email Subscriptions in Addition to RSS
           </h3>
           <p>
            Many bloggers only offer subscription via RSS. If youre not also offer subscription by email youre cutting out a portion of your audience, and youre missing out on the continual exposure to people who would subscribe by email. If, like most bloggers, youre using
            <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">
             FeedBurner
            </a>
            to publish your feed, offering an email subscription is easy. Just go to Publicize and Email Subscriptions in the FeedBurner dashboard to activate it.
           </p>
           <h3>
            2. Be Active on Twitter and Facebook
           </h3>
           <p>
            When I started blogging several years ago Digg was the social media site that almost every blogger was targeting for traffic. In recent years Facebook and Twitter have raced ahead of sites like Digg in terms of their potential for sending traffic to a blog.
           </p>
           <p>
            In order to get the most out of Twitter and Facebook youll need to be active on those sites and establish a following. Once you have done so, each time you publish a new post you can get some easy exposure by sharing a link with your followers. Hopefully it will get passed around by others, and before you know it you can reach hundreds and even thousands of people consistently.
           </p>
           <h3>
            3. Submit to Other Social Media Sites
           </h3>
           <p>
            Although social news and voting sites arent as popular as they were a few years ago, there is still an audience waiting to be reached. In addition to major sites like Digg and Reddit, niche social media sites can also be highly effective for getting exposure to a targeted audience. For those of you who blog in the design niche, were fortunate to have a number of sites like
            <a href="http://www.dzone.com/">
             DZone
            </a>
            ,
            <a href="http://designbump.com/">
             Design Bump
            </a>
            ,
            <a href="http://www.designfloat.com/">
             Design Float

            and
            <a href="http://thewebblend.com/">
             The Web Blend
            </a>
            , among others.

           <h3>
            4.Put Relevant Buttonson Your Posts
           </h3>
           <p>
            Some bloggers cover their posts in voting buttons, badges, and widgets, and others use none at all. From my experience voting buttons can be effective if they are used in moderation. Ive never seen it work very well to have buttons for every social media site imaginable, but having a couple buttons may encourage readers to share or vote. Currently Twitter, Facebook and Google +1 buttons are the most common. Simply including those buttons at the beginning or end of your posts may help to get you some extra exposure with each new post.
           </p>
           <h3>
            5. Build a Network
           </h3>
           <p>
            One of the most critical aspects of building a successful blog is the need to establish a strong network. Every successful blogger is well-connected to others in the industry, and so it should be a priority for you to do the same if you want to also achieve that success.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of getting exposure to your posts, having a network can help in a few specific ways. First, many bloggers share tweets, likes, and votes with their friends. So when one of your friends has a new post you may get an email requesting a tweet or votes, and you may be able to make a similar request when you have a post that you want to promote. Also, a network can help to attract more links to your blog, open up guest posting opportunities, and provide other possibilities for promotion and collaboration.
           </p>
           <h3>
            6. Offer an Email Newsletter
           </h3>
           <p>
            In the first point we looked at the need to offer an email subscription to your blog in addition to just the RSS feed. Aside from your blog posts that will go out to email subscribers, building a separate mailing list for a newsletter can provide even more exposure. A growing number of bloggers are now offering newsletters as a way to stay in touch with readers, and of course the newsletter presents another opportunity for you to get your blog posts in front of your audience. Most bloggers link to their recent posts somewhere in the newsletter so subscribers can quickly see what has been published recently.
           </p>
           <h3>
            7. Practice Writing Compelling Headlines
           </h3>
           <p>
            If you want your posts to be shared more on social media, to be linked to by more bloggers, and to be read by a higher percentage of subscribers and visitors, headlines are critical. Compelling headlines that get the attention of your audience will have a drastic impact on the amount of exposure that the posts receive.

            Writing effective headlines is something that doesnt come naturally to most of us, but it is worth the effort to learn more about how to do it. Copyblogger has an excellent resource,

            8. Use Keywords in Titles
           </h3>
           <p>
            Page titles are one of the most significant on-page factors in determining search engine rankings, and therefore having keywords in your titles can help to improve the amount of exposure that your posts receive on an on-going basis. In most cases the blog post title will also serve as the page title, but you can use also a WordPress plugin like
            <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">
             All-in-One SEO
            </a>
            to have more control over your page titles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before you publish a post give some consideration to what people will be searching for, and even do some basic keyword research if necessary. The
            <a href="https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner">
             Google Adwords Keyword Tool

            9. Link to Posts Internally
           </h3>
           <p>
            One easy way to get more exposure for posts in your archives is to add links to them from your new posts. If youve been blogging for any length of time you probably have a wealth of information built up on your blog. These old posts probably arent getting much traffic unless they are ranking well in search engines, but by including links to relevant posts you can increase the exposure to these old posts while helping your readers at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Get in the habit of reading through your posts before publishing just to look for opportunities to link to posts in your archives. Of course, you dont want to go overboard and have posts that are completely filled with links, but readers will appreciate when you link to something that is related so they can get more information if they choose.
           </p>
           <h3>
            10. List Related Posts at the End or Beginning of Posts
           </h3>
           <p>
            Related posts lists are used by many bloggers and in some cases they can be effective at helping visitors find other content that they may be interested in. For WordPress users there are a number of plugins to choose from that will get the job done, or you always have the option of manually creating the list of related posts. Doing it manually will take a few extra minutes but it gives you more control to promote the posts of your choice, rather than relying on an automated process to determine which posts to promote.
           </p>
           <h3>
            11. Exchange Links
           </h3>
           <p>
            Link exchanges can be a sensitive topic. Im not suggesting that you go out and get hundreds of link exchange partners for your blogroll. What I have seen to be more effective is a limited use of link exchanges to build links for specific posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of bloggers publish weekly or monthly roundups that include links to posts of interest from other blogs. If you currently do this, why not contact other bloggers about the possibility of exchanging links in these types of posts? Focus only on blogs that produce quality content and those that regularly publish similar types of link posts. If youll link to each other youll both get some added exposure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another option with the same basic concept is to exchange tweets. So if you have a friend that blogs on a similar topic you can each send out a tweet with a link to the others most recent post.
           </p>
           <h3>
            12. Create a Series of Posts with Other Bloggers
           </h3>
           <p>
            This is an idea that I used in the early months of this blogs existence and it worked out pretty well. The idea is to get a small group of bloggers together and agree to each publish a post on a specific topic so that each post will compliment or build on each other. Then each post will link to the others in the series, building more exposure for each. So if you have a group of 5 bloggers participating in the series each blogger will publish a post on his or her own blog and link to the other 4 posts in the series (or add the links once the other posts have been published). This will give you a link from 4 other blogs and instant exposure to their audience. If the posts are published at separate times it also creates anticipation for those that come later in the series.
           </p>
           <h3>
            13. Build Links to Specific Posts
           </h3>
           <p>
            When bloggers look at the subject of link building they usually consider social media marketing for specific posts, or building links from other blogs to their front page. Social media is certainly an effective way to gain exposure for your posts, but your other link building efforts dont have to be limited to getting links to your front page.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have posts in your archives that have potential to draw significant traffic or to have a big impact on readers, consider making an effort to build some links to these old posts. If you have an existing network of blogging friends in the niche you may be able to find some related posts on their blogs and ask them to consider adding a link to your post. You could also go back through your own archives and look for places to include links to your key posts. Another option is sharing links to older, but important, posts via social media.
           </p>
           <h3>
            14. List Popular Posts in Your Sidebar
           </h3>
           <p>
            Many blogs link to their most significant content in the sidebar, and this can be an easy way to get more exposure for certain posts. For example, our sidebar includes links to our posts

            15. Write for Other Blogs
           </h3>
           <p>
            Writing guest posts for other blogs is often recommended because it is a great way to build your name recognition and to get links to your own blog or website throughthe author bio. In addition to linking to your blogs front page in the bio, depending on the post you may have opportunities to link to other posts on your blog in the body of your guest post. Of course, this should only be done in situations where you are linking to highly relevant content that enhances the usefulness of your guest post, but in the right situation it can be a great way to get more exposure for a specific post on your blog.
           </p>
           <h3>
            16. Find Unique Topics and Post Ideas
           </h3>
           <p>
            A significant challenge that bloggers face when trying to increase exposure is simply getting people to care about your content. If youre blogging in a crowded niche this will be even more of a challenge. If youre able to come up with unique ideas for your posts and stand out from other bloggers it will be that much easier to grab the attention of your readers and visitors. Having this type of content will make all of your other efforts easier as well. For example, people like to share unique and interesting content, so once it gets a little bit of momentum withsocial mediaother people will do most of the work for you.
           </p>
           <h3>
            17. Keep Key Posts Updated
           </h3>
           <p>
            Most likely you have certain posts on your blog that tend to draw the most pageviews month after month. If you have been blogging for a while and if your site is fairly well established with search engines, you will almost certainly have posts that are a key to your traffic numbers on an on-going basis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most bloggers dont update posts after they have been published, but by keeping your key posts up to date you will increase their usefulness. Pages that you keep up to date provide you with opportunities to share them once again. For example, if you have a post on your blog that is one year old but consistently brings in a lot of new visitors to your site, consider updating it (depending on the nature of the content). After its been updated you can share a link on Twitter and Facebook and mention that it has been updated. Since you know that the post topic is already in demand its likely to be of interest to a number of your followers.

              From my experience Social Media is the most effort less method to get exposure to our posts. The idea is simple : Share what others would like and that would get re shared.

              Good post and very timely for me.  For the past 3  4 months I have been writing a blog on a weekly basis.  I think I am writing good content and have even started posting a tutorial video course.  While I am getting a small amount of traffic, I really want a lot more (to make the effort worthwhile).  The points about Feedburner, etc reaffirm my concern that I have not set it up properly or not maximising my exposure.

              Thank you for sharing these 17 tips to gain more exposure for posts. I am new to blogging and writing content for my website so I am unfamiliar with the S.E.O. aspect of boosting my rankings within google and other search engines. This will definitely help me, thank you for sharing them! :)

              It can be disheartening to someone who is just starting to write a blog when theres not many views or comments. It takes time to build it up and unfortunately just writing good and interesting content is not enough!

              Good points. I found that link exchange can help and hurt your in the same time, the hard way.

              Links exchange is not recommended now a day, google will penalised the sites which active participate in link exchanges, one of the point i liked in your blog post is active presence and sharing on social networking sites, we also gets backlinks from social networks and may help in backlinks along with traffic

                Link exchanges on a small scale will not be penalized and can be effective. Im not suggesting anything on a large scale as that has obviously not worked for several years.

              Great list.  One more to add is to Know your audience.  It might seem simple, but because we generally target entrepreneurs for our blog we know that entrepreneurs are very fast paced and sometimes dont have the time that other groups might have or devout to reading blogs, so we try to use bullets and lists to try and attract entrepreneurs.  However, if you are writing a blog for a book club, you would have the flexibility where a longer post would be appreciated.  It all comes down to catering to your audience.  Thanks!

              On the subject of point 6  the email newsletter, I am finding it getting harder and harder to collect email addresses for genuine use and despite great offers and incentives for signing up thanks to the overwhelming SPAM that keeps getting blasted out. I think that people are just so wary these days of handing over their email address even if what they get in return seems of value.

              I would like to just add another tip: make it easy for users to share your posts.
              <br/>
              (big, but not too big icons help out a lot). For wordpress users Ild recommend the addthis plugin because it is quite versatile AND you get analytics for free. (of course there are other plugins out there, but, I have seen this plugin working better than others (in conversion and viral terms) as opposed to others.
             </p>
             <p>
              oh and freebies people love to get things for free :p
