   <h3>
    No naughty bits here!
   </h3>
   <h3>
    Why is this site blank?
   </h3>
   <p>
    I get a lot of emails asking this question, so here goes:
   </p>
   <p>
    Sometime around the turn of the millennium ( a romanticized term for the winter of 1999/2000), I stumbled into my dorm room drunk from a college party, and found an IM from a friend on my comptuer to the effect of "Ha ha ha, there's a raver porn site. Check out this link!"  I clicked, I laughed, I messaged my friend back and we made some crass jokes for a while.  The jokes were actually more lame than crass - quite trite stuff like "Why do ravers need porn if they're always dropping ecstasy, and feeling each other up half naked and covered in sweat?"
   </p>
   <p>
    Somehow, I'm not quite sure how,  I started making jokes about an indie rock porn site-- where girls would wear pale yellow vintage cardigans, and for a monthly fee subscribers could see them unhook the top few buttons, showing off the slightest bit of graphic on the pale blue band t-shirt below.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like I said, I stumbled into my room-- so the door was still open, and it was only 3am, so when a few friends passed by with a half bottle of bourbon in tow they came on in.  I told them of my friend's discovery, my feeble attempt at a joke, and we all made some jokes for a while.  ( For the record, none were more amusing than my own.  NONE.)  The story gets a little fuzzy here, but the next thing I remembered, I seemed to own indieporn.com , and pledged to make the funniest joke porn site ever imagined.
   </p>
   <p>
    When i woke up the next day I kicked myself (literally, not figuratively.  i'm really a viotlent person) for doing something so stupid while drunk. Again.   At brunch someone who heard of my purchase  teased me nonstap about the dealings.  I deserved it.  But then someone brought up the fact that we were living in the age of ridiculous domain name sales-- where people would buy and sell domains for tens of thousands ( sometimes hundreds of thousands ) of dollars.  My domain could just be a fake porn site , or maybe someone would want to use it for a legitimate amateur porn site.
   </p>
   <p>
    I went to a smart school, and was surrounded by smart people- so I pondered on those words at great length.  By dinner that night I decided to grab a hold on the entire identity, including alternate spellings and .net:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="http://www.indieporn.com">
      IndiePorn.com
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="http://www.indieporn.net">
      IndiePorn.net
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="http://www.indie-porn.com">
      Indie-Porn.com
     </a>
    </li>
    <li>
     <a href="http://www.indyporn.com">
      IndyPorn.com
     </a>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    But wait... there's more!
   </p>
   <p>
    Within a few months, offers to buy the domains started coming in.  No one offered me a million dollars, ten thousand dollars, or even one thousand dollars.  I've turned them all down, even to this day.  Why?  Because the highest offer I got for all domains was Five Hundred Dollars.  Surely, one would think, the phrase "indie porn" and all its spellings would be worth more!
   </p>
   <p>
    At some point you realize that investing in pornographic internet domains isn't like doing the same with business domains-- someone isn't going to make a serious offer on the value of your portfolio.  The bulk of their attention is on making a campy movie for skinmax on a shoestring budget, and finding a stripper who can't make rent that month to star in a film in exchange for some breast augmentation.
   </p>
   <p>
    So I've kept the domains.  About a decade later, I got a few offers around $10,000 - but turned them all down as they seemed too low to part with.  Between the lack of ever getting a super serious offer, and the lone fact that I can say "Yeah, I own those names.  They're just sitting there... like always", it seemed like the right thing to do.  Besides-- if I ever need to make some cash quick, I can just sell out:  hire myself some stippers , have them put on some goth makeup and vintage dresses and strip to punk rock or emo -- thereby starting my very own online adult empire.
