     We should make the Yuletide season an occasion not merely for the giving of material things but an occasion for the giving of that which counts infinitely more  the giving of self.--J. C. Penney ("Christmas Thoughts")

     We worry about finding just the right gift, hanging just the right decorations, sending the right card. So many times I say I wish I could slow down, scale back, and reclaim the true meaning of Advent. The reality, though, is that I am the only one preventing that from happening.--Susan Hines-Brigger (

     Were I a philosopher, I should write a philosophy of toys, showing that nothing else in life need to be taken seriously, and that Christmas Day in the company of children is one of the few occasions on which men become entirely alive.--Robert Lynd

     What happy faces do we see,
     <br/>
     Their cares forgotten everyone,
     <br/>
     This is the way it ought to be
     <br/>
     From dawn until the set of sun.
     <br/>
     These blessed days of joy and peace,
     <br/>
     Bedecked with wonder, set apart,
     <br/>
     Through all our yeas will never cease,

     What is Christmas? It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future. It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace.--Agnes M. Pharo ("What Is Christmas")

     Whatever else be lost among the years,
     <br/>
     Let us keep Christmas still a shining thing:
     <br/>
     Whatever doubts assail us, or what fears,
     <br/>
     Let us hold close one day, remembering
     <br/>
     Its poignant meaning for the hearts of men.
     <br/>
     Let us get back our childlike faith again.--Grace Noll Crowell

     The carols old and true

     When Christmas bells are swinging above the fields of snow,
     <br/>
     We hear sweet voices ringing from lands of long ago,
     <br/>
     And etched on vacant places
     <br/>
     Are half-forgotten faces
     <br/>
     Of friends we used to cherish, and loves we used to know.--Ella Wheeler Wilcox ("Christmas Fancies"

     When the song of the angel is stilled,
     <br/>
     When the star in the sky is gone,

     When the kings and princes are home,
     <br/>
     When the shepherds are back with their flock,
     <br/>
     The work of Christmas begins:
     <br/>
     To find the lost--To heal the broken--To feed the hungry--
     <br/>
     To release the prisoner--To rebuild the nations--
     <br/>
     To bring peace among brothers and sisters--
     <br/>
     To make music in the heart.--Howard Thurman
