    It's fall again, time to reap what we've sown or at least what our 
        farmer friends have sown. In many parts of the Bay Area this means 
        apples and plenty of them. But what to do with all those apples? Well 
        you could eat them one by one, make some pies, bake a few for dessert, 
        or why not make some delicious hard cider. Hard Cider you ask? Yeppers, 
        it's easy and inexpensive.
   </p>
   <p>
    The art of cider making can be as simple or as complex as you want.   
        What I'm going to show you is how to make the most simple and   
        consistently good cider. There wont be a lot of fancy   
        equipment, extra steps, or needless technical jargon. Here is what   
        you need to make five gallons of cider.

    Instructions

   <p>
    Ok, here is what you do, get juice, add yeast, and wait! No,  
        seriously that's all there is to it. Ok, well, for those of you who need  
        a little more instruction here are the step by steps.
   </p>
   <ol style="margin: 0 10% 0 5%;">
    <li>
     Of course the very first thing you'll want to do is to is gather           
            together all the items we've suggested from the list above. If you           
            need more help with a particular item you can click on it to get a           
            pop-up with more information.
    </li>
    <li>
     Make sure your apple juice is at room temperature and start                                             
            preparing your yeast according to the manufacturers directions. If                                             
            you are using dry yeast now is the time to re-hydrate it, if you use                                             
            a "smack pack" style yeast you can break the inner seal,                                             
            and if using a pitchable tube allow to warm to room temp.
    </li>
    <li>
     Now you need to wash and sanitize everything that will come into                                           
            contact with the cider. Thoroughly wash your fermenter and airlock                                           
            with detergent and rinse well. Sanitize according to your sanitizers                                           
            instructions. Remember, sanitizers can't sanitize a dirty container.
    </li>
    <li>
     Add apple juice to your container making sure to aerate well.                                           
            Splashing the juice incorporates air into the liquid for the benefit                                           
            of the yeast.
    </li>
    <li>
     Add (pitch) yeast to the fermenter.
    </li>
    <li>
     Place lid on container and add airlock with a little water in it.
    </li>
    <li>
     Place your container in a spot where the temperature will remain                                           
            consistently in the mid to high 60's. The ideal temperature will                                           
            depend on your choice of yeast but all yeasts will work in this                                           
            range.
    </li>
    <li>
     When bubbling in you fermenter has stopped completely, usually in                                           
            a week or two, you have cider and it's time to bottle! It's very                                           
            important that you make sure all bubbling has stopped. Bottling                                           
            still fermenting cider is potentially dangerous. When in doubt wait                                           
            it out!
    </li>
    <li>
     Clean and sanitize your second container and your tubing as you                                           
            did for your fermenter. If you plan on using a bottle filler you                                           
            will need to sanitize this as well. You will also need to clean and                                           
            sanitize your bottles. Bottle caps need only to be sanitized.
    </li>
    <li>
     Siphon (rack) your cider to the sanitized container being careful                                           
            not to splash the cider nor disturb or pick up the layer of yeast on                                           
            the bottom of your fermenter.
    </li>
    <li>
     Now if you want sparkling cider you will need to add 3/4 cup corn                                           
            sugar to the cider. This is to give the yeast a little extra sugar                                           
            to produce carbonation. If you like still cider you simply omit the                                           
            sugar.
    </li>
    <li>
     Siphon your cider into the sanitized bottles leaving approx.                                           
            1" of headspace at the top of each bottle. Cap and store in a                                           
            warm place for one or two weeks to allow the yeast time to carbonate                                           
            then refrigerate.
    </li>
    <li>
     Uncap a few bottles and enjoy! Try to keep a few bottles around                                           
            for ageing. Cider ages well and flavors will blend and mellow over                                           
            time. A cool, dark, interior closet makes a perfect place to store                                           
            your cider.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h2>
    Now Experiment

    Once you've tried making a couple of batches of apple cider you can start to   
        experiment. How about a subtly refreshing Perry? Perry is made from pear   
        juice and can be made using the same procedure as above. If you don't   
        have access to traditional perry pears or their juice you can add a   
        small amount of grape tannin to give a slight puckering sensation. Or how about flavoring your apple cider with other fruits? Raspberry? 
        Peach? Cherry?
   </p>
   <p>
    To the left is a three gallon batch of Apple Cherry Cider. It's made                                          
        from two gallons of apple and a gallon of cherry farm fresh juice.Note,                                          
        the extra space between the top of the liquid and the top of the                                          
        container is allowable during primary fermentation only. If you want to                                          
        age your cider in bulk you want as little air-space as possible between                                          
        the top of the cider and the bottom of your air lock. You can accomplish                                          
        this by either racking your cider to a smaller container or topping-up                                          
        your fermenter with fresh juice.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whatever you try, it's a good idea to take detailed notes on                                         
        everything you've done to make your cider so you can repeat it in the                                         
        future. I keep a note on each fermenter with the details of the batch.                                    
        Quite handy when your ciders look identical because of only small                                    
        ingredient changes. I also keep a notebook with notes on every batch I've made. Not only                                         
        has it helped me keep track of my favorite recipes but it's a valuable                                         
        resource for when things go wrong.

     Both of these businesses sell everything  
                you need (except juice) to make cider at home. Although I'm not in anyway affiliated with them, 
                I have been a happy customer for many years and do not hesitate to recommend them.
