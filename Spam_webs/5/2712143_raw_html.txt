    <p>
     As an ESTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you
take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
Your secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things rationally
and logically.
    </p>
    <p>
     ESTPs are outgoing, straight-shooting types.  Enthusiastic and excitable,
ESTPs are "doers" who live in the world of action.  Blunt, straight-forward
risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get their hands 
dirty.  They live in the here-and-now, and place little importance on
introspection or theory.  The look at the facts of a situation, quickly
decide what should be done, execute the action, and move on to the next 
thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     ESTPs have an uncanny ability to perceive people's attitudes and 
motivations.  They pick up on little cues which go completely unnoticed
by most other types, such as facial expressions and stance.  They're typically
a couple of steps ahead of the person they're interacting with.  ESTPs use
this ability to get what they want out of a situation.  Rules and laws are
seen as guidelines for behavior, rather than mandates.  If the ESTP has
decided that something needs to be done, then their "do it and get on with it"
attitude takes precendence over the rules.  However, the ESTP tends to
have their own strong belief in what's right and what's wrong, and will
doggedly stick to their principles.  The Rules of the Establishment may
hold little value to the ESTP, but their own integrity mandates that they will
not under any circumstances do something which they feel to be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     ESTPs have a strong flair for drama and style.  They're fast-moving, fast-talking
people who have an appreciation for the finer things in life.  They may be
gamblers or spendthrifts.  They're usually very good at story telling
and improvising.  They typically makes things up as they go along, rather
than following a plan.  They love to have fun, and are fun people to be
around.  They can sometimes be hurtful to others without being aware of
it, as they generally do not know and may not care about the effect their 
words have on others.  It's not that they don't care about people,
it's that their decision-making process does not involve taking people's
feelings into account.  They make decisions based on facts and logic.
    </p>
    <p>
     ESTP's least developed area is their intuitive side.  They are impatient
with theory, and see little use for it in their quest to "get things done".
An ESTP will occasionally have strong intuitions which are often way
off-base, but sometimes very lucid and positive.  
The ESTP does not trust their instincts, and is suspicious of
other people's intuition as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ESTP often has trouble in school, especially higher education which moves
into realms where theory is more important.  The ESTP gets bored with classes
in which they feel they gain no useful material which can be used to get
things done.  The ESTP may be brilliantly intelligent, but school will be
a difficult chore for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ESTP needs to keep moving, and so does well in careers where he or she is
not restricted or confined.  ESTPs make extremely good salespersons.
They will become stifled and unhappy dealing with routine chores.  ESTPs
have a natural abundance of energy and enthusiasm, which makes them
natural entrepreneurs.  They get very excited about things, and have
the ability to motivate others to excitement and action.  The can sell
anyone on any idea.  They are
action-oriented, and make decisions quickly.  All-in-all, they have
extraordinary talents for getting things started.  They are not usually so
good at following through, and might leave those tasks to others.  Mastering
the art of following through is something which ESTPs should pay special
attention to.
    </p>
    <p>
     ESTPs are practical, observant, fun-loving, spontaneous risk-takers
with an excellent ability to quickly improvise
an innovative solution to a problem.  They're enthusiastic and fun to
be with, and are great motivators.
If an
ESTP recognizes their real talents and operates within those realms, they
can accomplish truly exciting things.
