            There is a major difference between price and cost. In many cases, investing in a security system solely because it's the cheapest price will net you the highest cost in the long run.  An example is when you purchase a basic 4 camera system from one of the large retailers or wholesale clubs for a cheap price such as $300-$400. This seems like a great bargain at the time of purchase but what is the long term cost? Many of these systems will have poor video image quality and will not provide you with adequate resolution to ID potential criminals.
           </p>
           <p>
            On top of that, the minute you run into any potential issues you will likely be referred to a manufacturer in another country where it is very difficult to communicate with the support person. We've seen this time and time again with customers who come to us after a bad experience buying from a big name retailer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alternatively, there are plenty of companies out there that will sell you a cloud-connected security camera for $150-250. The resolution on these kinds of cameras generally hover around 720p or 1080p and reviews will paint them as top rated, but you end up paying between $10-20 a month for the cloud storage. In the long run, you end up paying in $120-$240 a year for the simplicity of such a setup, whereas with a dedicated CCTV security system, you have all the footage stored on a DVR in your own home or business.

              Do you want cameras that are wireless / wi-fi compatible?
             </strong>

                wireless IP cameras
               </a>
               . In traditional security installations, coaxial cable is used to run the analog camera from the point of installation to the DVR. If the cameras are installed within a few hundred feet of the DVR, running the wire and minimizing the amount exposed cable isnt too difficult of a task. However, if the camera is more than 750 ft away from the DVR, in a warehouse or parking area for example, the video begins to degrade losing clarity and definition.
              </li>
              <li>
               An IP Camera resolves this issue by processing the images on the camera and transmitting digital signal instead of analog. The cameras can then be connected to a local hardwire switch using Ethernet cable or a secure wireless router. Not only does transmitting over wi-fi or over Ethernet achieve higher quality digital video and shorter cable runs, it is also easier to install. For wireless IP Cameras, simply plug in the wall transformer and assign an IP address during the camera setup. The camera can then be wall mounted or placed on a desktop and moved as your security need change.

              How far / wide can the security cameras see?
             </strong>
             <ul>
              <li>
               The answer to this question depends on your lens size and width. The larger your lens size, the farther youll generally be able to see. For example, our
               <a href="/ezbullet-vf-platinum-1.html">
                EZBullet VF Platinum
               </a>
               has a 2.8-12mm varifocial lens that allows it to see up to 100 while our powerful

                Ranger PTZ

               comes with a 3.4-122.4mm zoom lens that lets you see up to 300.
              </li>
              <li>
               How wide of a viewing angle you have is dependent on the image sensor. Common sizes are 1/4 and 1/3. Larger image sensors allow more light into the picture and give you a wider angle of view. For example, a 3.6mm lens will see almost 80 degrees wide. If you put it in the corner of a room youll see pretty much the entire room. A 50mm lens, on the other hand, will only give you a viewing angle of roughly 5 degrees wide. Its similar in concept to a camcorder, if you zoom in you can see farther away but your scene gets narrower.

             </ul>

             <strong>
              What recording resolution do I need?
             </strong>
             <ul>
              <li>
               This is a very common question when it comes to surveillance systems. We offer systems ranging from 420 lines of resolution up to HD-SDI systems that offer full HD 1080p resolution.
              </li>
              <li>
               More often than not, 420-550 lines will suffice for fixed, indoor systems that are monitoring a single area within 50 feet.
              </li>
              <li>
               If you're looking to monitor from longer distances, or want to be sure you're capturing the best resolution possible, we recommend stepping up to 700+ lines of resolution, which is a noticeable bump in image quality. If you want the best system available on the market you should consider an

                HD-SDI Complete System
               </a>
               . These systems come highly recommended and can provide recorded footage equal to what you see on your HDTV in full 1080p resolution, which is a 400%+ bump in resolution compared to standard 400-500 line cameras that are still common within the industry. The image below is a cropped version of two screenshots found

              <li>
               If you need cameras to record your outdoor property it's a very wise idea to go with fully weatherproof cameras. Unless you're placing them under an awning or area that will be covered 100% of the time it's worth the extra peace of mind to know your cameras won't be affected by extreme rain or wind. We offer a wide range of

              Do I need varifocal or fixed lens cameras?

             <ul>
              <li>
               For cameras installed with a fixed focal length lens, measuring for field of view must be precise. Once the camera is fixed in place, what you see is what you get. Considering the many video surveillance cameras available, a camera with an adjustable lens will give you greater flexibility during installation and keep you from timely labor spent on relocating cameras if your needs change in the future.
              </li>
              <li>
               Not all lenses are made alike. There are three main categories of lenses: fixed focal length with a manual iris, vari-focal length with a manual iris, and vari-focal length with an automatic iris. The automatic and manual iris label describes how much light the lens will allow the camera to see as the lighting conditions in the environment changes. If lighting will remain constant, like in an office setting, a manual iris is a great option because you will only need to adjust the iris during installation. But, if light in the environment changes over the course of the day, an automatic iris is your best choice. To illustrate the difference, imagine going to the optometrist for an eye exam. When the optometrist dilates your pupils it is the equivalent of seeing with a manual iris. Your pupil, like the iris of a camera lens, is forced to allow as much light as possible. In a dim room, you see clearly but when you walk outside your eyes are flooded with light which makes your vision out of focus and creates blind spots within your field of view.

               The fixed length or vari-focal length refers to the ability to adjust the cameras field of view. Vari-focal lenses are typically found in a 2.8mm to 12mm, 4mm to 9mm, or 5mm to 50mm configurations. Fixed focal lenses are available in in various sizes but are limited in scope (fixed) to the noted lens size. The smaller the lens size, the wider the field of view. Depending on the distance between the installed cameras and the point of interest, camera lenses with the same focal length will produce different fields of view. Therefore, before you make a camera selection, know how you want the camera to perform.

               should help you with this step. Just fill out the form from the drop-down options and you will have a rough idea of whether you'll need a 1TB, 2TB, or larger hard drive to accommodate your footage. Next you should decide what framerate you want your cameras recording in. 7.5 frames per second per camera is the minimum and will look like a group of photos linked together, but will allow TONS of footage on most hard drives. 15 frames per second will be much smoother but still a bit choppy, whereas 30 FPS will look just as good as the footage you watch on television in most cases.

            After looking over specs and price, it it also very important to consider if the company you are purchasing a security system from meets these requirements:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Do they deal solely in security products or is it just another line in their business?
             </strong>
             <ul>
              <li>
               Big name retailers sell millions of CCTV security systems every year but after your store return period expires you are often stuck with overseas technical support if and when something goes wrong. Don't settle for that. Buy from a USA-based retailer who sells just security camera systems for the best value for your dollar in the long run.

             <ul>
              <li>
               Companies who have been in business 10+ years are far more likely to still be there years down the road if problems ever arise with your system.

              <li>
               Do they know just enough about the product specs to try and shove a pre-packaged system down your throat, or do they actually have a salesperson who listens to your input and who makes recommendations based on your needs and wants?

            There are many reasons to have a Video Security System, but we believe the single most important reason is peace of mind. Knowing you can always look in on your cameras with remote viewing or pull up footage afterwards in the event of a break-in gives you peace of mind that you can't put a dollar value on. Being able to view both live and recorded video from any browser or smart phone helps ensure that you will never walk into a dangerous situation. It is easy to view your business or home before you arrive to know what is expected upon arrival.

            In a business setting, a CCTV security system serves multiple purposes.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             First, it helps keep all employees and customers honest. When people know they're being watched with security cameras thefts are far less likely. Criminals want to pick the easiest target possible.
            </li>
            <li>
             Second, a video security system gives you the ability to view the shopping patterns of your customers. This can help you understand what merchandise to place where to get the best results.
            </li>
            <li>

If you've ever worked in retail before, you know how much of a headache these customers can be. You can also see if any employee is entering incorrect amounts into the register in order to take money for themselves.

           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             You have 24-hour video footage of the warehouse or any storage area. This might pay big dividends if you have ever experienced inventory shrinkage.
            </li>
            <li>
             In the event of any break-ins or other unlawful behavior you can provide the authorities with a recorded video of the event which will greatly enhance their chances of solving the crime.
            </li>
            <li>
             Another excellent benefit of having a full security system for your business is having recorded video of any on-site accidents. If you have footage of the accident it can help determine if the accident was legitimate or possibly an intentional so-called-accident that was planned in an attempt to get a cash settlement for injuries.

           </p>

             Will the cameras be installed indoors or outdoors?

             Are the cameras I'm getting night vision/low light capable?
            </li>
            <li>
             If installed outside, what are the lowest and highest temperatures expected where the cameras will be mounted?
            </li>
            <li>
             Is the system to be used for a home or business?
             <ul>
              <li>
               If for a home, 400 or 550 lines of resolution will suffice for most installations.

             </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
             Do you want your DVR to record 24/7 or only to record when motion is detected? This can be set for each camera in the system.
            </li>
            <li>
             What is the best FPS to record in for my situation? 7.5FPS, 15FPS, or 30FPS?
            </li>
            <li>
             How long do you want to keep recorded video before recording over the oldest video? The answer will determine the size of the hard drive needed.
            </li>
            <li>
             Is the ability to view your system remotely for both live and recorded video important?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Another important question to consider is whether to go with a Hardware-based DVR or a PC-based DVR.

           Yes, most security systems are designed to be easy to install. We cover some of the most asked self-installation questions below:
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What tools will I need? How do I mount it to metal, wood, concrete, or a drop tile ceiling?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If your system comes with pre-made siamese cables and you're mounting your security cameras to metal, wood, or a drop tile ceiling, a cordless drill is all you will need. We recommend taking extra caution when mounting cameras to a drop tile ceiling as drop tiles can only support a small amount of additional weight. If you're mounting your cameras to concrete, a cordless drill with a heavy duty drill bit big enough to fit the siamese cable through will be needed. Be vary careful when drilling through resilient materials like concrete or wooden studs and make sure to drill the hole only as big as is needed.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            If youre wondering how to best mount security cameras, most of ours are made for wall or ceiling mounting and have brackets that are easily adjustable for either scenario. If in doubt, consult the included installation instructions on the preferred mounting applications for your security cameras.

            Running the cable from the cameras back to the DVR can be the most time-consuming step of self-installation but is fairly straightforward. Assuming you are using high quality siamese cable, you will only have to run the one cable from the back of every security camera to wherever you install the DVR. This does not account for motion sensors or microphones - these will add to your wiring job. In many cases, you will have to run wires through ceilings, walls, or rafters for a clean and secure install. We have a helpful

            This step can be frustrating without a second person to assist. Depending on the viewing angle your cameras offer you will likely need a second person to assist in aligning each camera to ensure they all aim at the proper location. One person will need to be near your DVR/Video Monitor and provide feedback to the other person to help get the cameras aligned properly. If you're working alone, a

            If you want to record in high definition, you'll need to install an HD-SDI system. HD-SDI stands for "High-Definition Serial Digital Interface" and allows you to run 1080p video through a standard coaxial cable. This is great in that the wiring isn't any more complex or expensive than regular cabling and it allows for an outstanding leap in picture quality equivalent to HD programming you view on your HDTV at home. This eliminates the frustration of "yesteryear" security systems whose quality generally fails to help identify small details like characters on a license plate or the cash at the register. The 1080p resolution that HD-SDI provides is top rated and can help make an investigation rather than break it. Installing a system with

             both
            </strong>
            HD-SDI Cameras and an HD-SDI DVR will provide full 1080p high definition video for both live and recorded video. Both your security cameras and your DVR must be HD-SDI compliant in order to record full 1080p footage. HD-SDI DVRs are a great upgrade for pre-existing security camera systems as well. If you replace your standard DVR with a hybrid HD-SDI DVR you'll only need to replace your old analog cameras with new HD-SDI ones in the locations that are most important to you. You can simply reconnect the cameras you're not replacing. This can be done in just a few hours.

            There are hundreds, if not thousands of options out there for security cameras that appear to be something else. Hidden security cameras can be made to look like clocks, smoke detectors, motion sensors and various other "normal" items. That said, the downside to these "nanny cam" type cameras is that they dont generally produce good quality video, oftentimes failing to produce a clear enough picture of an intruder. There are a handful of ways you can hide your regular security cameras or at least make them less obvious to intruders for both homes and businesses:

             PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) Camera
            </a>
            . Just determine the area you wish to cover and how much zoom you desire and that should put you on the right track to determining the camera you need. In addition to this, you will also need a PTZ controller of some sort, which requires it's own wiring separate from the camera power and video cable. For this reason, installing a PTZ camera is a bit more complex than a basic camera install.This PTZ controller is what grants you full control the camera once installed.

            If you want to hear and record audio, each security camera will need either a built-in microphone or an external microphone hooked up to it. Make sure you know how many cameras you would like to record audio with before you start shopping for a security system.It is very important to plan for this at the beginning as running an extra wire for audio after you have already wired your system can be a big pain. If you do plan ahead, we recommend running this audio wire along with the Siamese cable all the way from each camera to your centralized DVR, using zip ties where necessary to keep things nice and neat. Having a clean install makes it a lot easier if you ever upgrade your system in the future.
