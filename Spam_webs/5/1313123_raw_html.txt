        Its been reported that one Doug Manchester, who donated $125,000 to the cause of getting Prop 8 through because apparently he felt so strongly that gay marriage posed a threat to straight marriageis now in the midst of a divorce action.
       </p>
       <p>
        How could this possibly be?  After all, Manchester helped get Prop 8 passed.  Marriage should be safe in California and yethere it is threatened again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps Mr. Manchester should donate $125,000 to a new proposition that would outlaw divorce.  Lets see how well that works out.

          Id be more shocked if there hadnt been a few dozen other examples of ass-hatted individuals whod thought their wealth made them above societys rules and laws. This guys just the latest version.

          I hope theres enough evidence to let a family court judge spank this turdblossom hard.

          On tother hand, maybe theres enough evidence of malfeasance to put him in prison. Then the whole irony thing could come full circle.

          I suppose its a little ironic, but not necessarily.
         </p>
         <p>
          Hypotheticalize with me:
         </p>
         <p>
          Joe thinks that the artery clogging burgers sold at the Heart Attack Cafe are delterious to the citizens of his fine state. The burgers destroys healthy diets near and far and cause serious health problems.  He donates scads of money and the shuts down the Cafe. Then Joe, who doesnt eat the burgers, has a heart attack.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is not really all that ironic.  It would only be ironic if they found out that Joe secretly ate Cafe burgers every day, directly causing the attack.
         </p>
         <p>
          Back to the original story, its only ironic if Dougs wife is divoricng him b/c he had a homosexual affair.

           <p>
            There are a couple elements missing from your hypothetical. Burgers actually *do* have an effect on health. Joe wasnt making stuff up when he said that he said that. So whether he had a heart attack or not, he was still right about the burgers. Also, Joe didnt *choose* to do something unhealthy. The heart attack is something that just happened to him. So again, no hypocrisy.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Heres a more direct analogy. Joe campaigns against a local burger place because theres a cancer causing chemical on the meat. He ignores the fact that its a minute amount and he ignores the fact that similar amounts are on every type of cooked meat because it is a natural result of cooking. He just campaigns against the place for giving people cancer anyway.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Then he sneaks behind the burger place and smokes a cigarette.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Thats irony because the cancer crusader is not just a nut who ignores facts, hes also actively engaging in cancerous activities.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Plus, its a much closer analogy to the Save our marriages guy who cited his Catholic faith in defending his marriage, then went against Catholic teachings and got a divorce.

              Yeah, people do tend to misuse irony.  I just used that in the link because, well, that was the headline. Technically, its not actually an example of irony.  Irony would have been Manchesters wife at a rally actually saying, With the passing of Prop 8, at least now my marriage is safe.  This actual sequence of events is an example ofIm not sure if theres an actual word for it.  If there is, probably the French have it.  They have a word for EVERYthing.

              My favorite CORRECT use of the term was in MST3K many years ago  Mikes first episode, covering The Brain That Wouldnt Die.  The mad scientist gets attacked by his own monster (naturally), who rips off one of the scientists arms.  Said scientist then proceeds upstairs to the living room, where he goes into death throes that seem to last for about ten minutes of screen time.  He finally collapses.

          Id love to see the numbers on how many supporters of traditional marriage are divorced.  I know Newt Gingrich, one of the leaders of the Right, told his wife he was divorcing her while she was recovering from cancer removal surgery.  Compassionate conservative indeed!

          The anti-gay marriage movement isnt about improving marriage for anyone.  Its about keeping the others out and maintaining the current status quo as much as possible.  (Of course marriage has changed drastically over the years, but anti-gay marriage folks like to pretend its always been exactly the same as it is now.)

          This actually shows a key reason why gay marriages should be legal (and are where I live): as Manchester is finding out, its really difficult to find someone to spend the rest of your life with, into your twilight years.  If two people who happen to be gay think theyve found that sort of love, they deserve the chance to make it official.  Maybe itll end in divorce like in this case, but if it goes the distance, thats something wonderful.

              Their prejudices may be entirely consistent, but were commenting on their standards of behavior. They rail on about protecting the sanctity of heterosexual marriage whenever someone brings up civil marriage equality, but they feel free to crap all over their own marriages.

That sort of thing.  But if theyre just filled with hatred and hate everyone and everything, then theyre not hypocrites.  Theyre also no one Id want to be anywhere near

            As for polygamy, Ill admit I dont have all the answers. But then, there isnt much of a movement to allow polygamy save from those groups lead by the likes of Warren Jeffs, who are simply interested in turning under-age women into slaves.

            Steve, I dont believe there is a line between most of those things. I dont think anything done about gay rights will ever lead to people marrying appliances or animals. Ive never seen anything that supports the idea that theres some kind of slippery slope between these things.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Ive seen it suggested before, but suggestion of the possibility is not evidence. In fact, making such an extremely implausible suggestion without any evidence to back it up basically makes the anti-gay marriage side look like theyve run out of ideas.

            Every time Ive seen this discussed online, someone eventually brings up the other species bit  but I have yet to see even one of those people up in arms over Spocks parentage. I mean, his parents werent even from the same

            Those of us actually involved in multiple marriages (who arent doing so because of some religious interpretation, anyway) arent pushing for legal recognition of our relationships. Itd be nice, but so long as one of the legally-married spouses is around, our rights as a family are still defended. Its the monogamous couples who need legal assistance  the extended family isnt always the best protector of rights, especially if the extended family disapproves of the relationship to begin with.

              But what happens when, as will most likely happen in a good percentage of plural marriages, things dont work out? The person who is not part of the legal marriage would be pretty much out in the cold, probably even more so than someone who was in a long term relationship without marriage. People have won palimony cases but Id bet it would be very difficult to do so when pal was a married couple.

              .
              <br/>
              Any precedent on this?

              The moral principles that defends gay relationships and marriages also defend polygamy (unless theres fraud involved). But they do not defend relationship or marriage with animals or appliances as they could not be considered concenting adults. (also, lets face it, neither cats nor most appliances have the commitment necessary for a long term relationship nowadays).

              Cats are definitely capable of long term relationships. Passive-aggressive, borderline negligent relationships, but thats about as much as Ive ever gotten from a woman.

              I think  weve lost track of the main thread here.  The real question, therefore is if marrying a cat of the same sex is as acceptible as marrying one of the opposite sex.

            I would write that off as a petty strawman argument, but what appliance could enter into a legal contract? A sentient one. If machines have become self aware, stopping them from enslaving us should probably take a higher priority then sorting out their marriage rights.

              Thats a dirty lie, you dirty liar! In fact you only ONCE used the Prince Albert in a can. The other times it was Dinty Moore in a can, Betty Crocker in a box, Peter Pan in a jar and Captain Morgan in a bottle. Ha ha, pretty funny, itll be even funnier when someone one day asks me if I have Bill Myers in a shallow grave down in my basement and I answer yeah and they say, well good.

          Yes, lets all have traditional marriage, in which Im property transferred from my father to my husband. The two tribes will form an alliance over the new marriage that will allow for new trade opportunities. That sounds exciting.

            when youre 12 and hes 50, and already has 6 other wives, and he can divorce you if you dont get pregnant within the year, but youre not allowed to leave him of your own volition no matter how much he beats you. Thats how weve been doing it for the last 5000 years, and we wont allow for any variations, dammit.

          Id bet my last $20 that this guy is in denial of his own homosexuality. Why would he spend so much money on preventing gay people from marrying?
          <br/>
          .Because dammit, the church wouldnt let me marry who I wanted and now Im stuck in a dead-end marriage and Ill be damned if I let those other gay people experience the joy that Ive always wanted.
          <br/>
          .I mean, $125,000 is a lot of money- it must be a pretty damn
          <b>

          cause to him if hes willing to spend that much, regardless of how rich he is.

          apparently he felt so strongly that gay marriage posed a threat to straight marriage.
          <br/>
          No where in the linked story does it say this.  The story said he was against gay marriage because of his faith.  Many churches, including the majority of mostly black churches in California are against gay marriage.

              Probably they feel a need to point that out because the Right(TM) is typically blamed for gay marriage bans, but the highest percentage of support for Proposition 8 came from the most reliable voting block for the Left(TM). Its only scapegoat BS if that group is blamed for causing it. They didnt-it was a broad spectrum movement- but they did support it. Its always helpful to remember that all movements are coalitions, and just because someone is on the Right in some or even most circumstances doesnt mean he wont take the Left stance in other circumstances. (Says the fiscal hawk conservative who supports gay marriage.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Plus its at least interesting to point out that, notwithstanding the common argument that gay rights is the new civil rights movement, the participants in the old civil rights movement dont seem to think so. I dont know if it proves anything, but its interesting.

              My person opinion? I think some people point this out b/c, on the whole, there is a perception that black people tend to be democrats and therefore tend to be liberal. Again, their *perception* is that if they are black (and therefore liberal democrats) agree w/ the ban, it is worth mentioning.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rightly or wrongly, i think that is the thought process.

          Granted that there are extremes on both ends!  Even with this, one should not say that just because someone is opposed to gay marriage does not mean that they are bigoted towards those who are homosexuals.  For one who says that is being just as bigoted or more rightly put, more prejudice towards those have an opposing view.  Just as I would not say that all who believe in gay marriage are all active homosexuals, so you should not make the counter claim.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is always kind of odd, that it appears that often times people can fall into the same trap and fault as those whom they oppose so easily.

            Not everyone who supports equal rights is necessarily someone who would benefit from them, but I think that people who actively try to prevent equal rights can safely be called out on their prejudice.

            Just as I would not say that all who believe in gay marriage are all active homosexuals, so you should not make the counter claim.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Strawman argument. The two things are completely different.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Someone can easily support another persons rights without being exactly like that person. However, someone cant actively work to deprive people of rights and then say they have nothing against those people.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Not everyone who is against gay marriage is a monster, but they are doing something wrong. Theyre saying that a certain group of people inherently deserve fewer rights. That is bigoted. Its not burning people at the stake, but its still bad.

            You mean like the white segregationists who didnt hate blacks as long as blacks stayed out of white peoples neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces? Sorry, but when you arbitrarily condemn someone to second-class status because they belong to a particluar group, thats bigotry.

            <br/>
            Rather than judging what someone does behind closed doors with a consenting adult with neither partner getting hurt, how about judging people based on whether they are productive members of society? If someone works hard, contributes more to society than they take from it, and doesnt hurt people unnecessarily, thats all you need to know about them.

              Well, what about people who sincerely believe that societal recognition of marriage should be used to encourage relationships that can lead to begetting children, and/or that heterosexual couples are the ideal case for child raising? I dont agree with that viewpoint, but its one that can (and I think is) held by people who dont actively dislike homosexuals i.e. by people who are, by definition, not bigots. And in a country with a 50% divorce rate, and with an ever-increasing number of children being born out of wedlock and raised by single parents, it is not a ridiculous opinion to believe that the last half centurys experiment with liberalizing marriage laws has backfired, and to believe that we shouldnt further divorce (pun intended) child raising from marriage. Most of the literature out there suggests that gay couples raise children as well as straight couples, but producing children is a bit more difficult for them. Again, I dont agree with this theory, but it isnt inherently bigoted to believe it.

              Susan Estrich wrote a column recently about the health care bill. She identified two big problems. One was that passing a health care reform act was looking increasingly difficult. But the one that she thought was more disturbing was how shrill and nasty the rhetoric in political disputes has become in this country. I agree with her thats a much bigger problem than this one issue. How exactly is it helpful to vilify your opponents this guy in particular, or in general the gay marriage opponents at whom youre slinging terms like bigot? Other than reinforcing your moral superiority, what is the point? Does it achieve anything other than cause the people youre arguing against to dig in their heels? Name calling is not exactly the best way to try to convince people to reconsider their positions.

              I doubt their sincerity. Ive seen just as much pushback against gay couples adopting children. This country, this world actually, does not have a problem with producing children. We have a problem with overproducing children. Saying that two people shouldnt be able to get married because they cant produce a child is fighting a problem we dont actually have.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              As for heterosexual couples being ideal for raising children, that is so logically bent that it hurts my head. If people really cared about the ideal for raising children, then there are a *lot* of people out there who shouldnt be raising children. Convicted murders still have a right to have kids, but two men with stable incomes and no criminal records arent ideal enough? Again, I doubt the sincerity of people who believe that.

              Id ask them if they condone marriage for heterosexual couples who have no intention of reproducing. If so, Id ask them to explain the contradiction. Theyd be unable to do so because there is no explanation; its a smokescreen for bigotry.

              There were segregationists who sincerely believed that allowing people of different races to live together would undermine the fabric of society. That view deserves no more respect than the view that opposes the right of homosexuals to marry. Sincerity and bigotry are not mutually exclusive.

              Should Martin Luther King Jr. have pulled his punches? Used softer language to have avoided causing white bigots to dig in their heels? Obviously not. I see no reason to soften my language either. For too long, weve allowed people to rationalize their bigotry towards homosexuals. Its long past time we call people out on the carpet for this sort of bigotry.

              My grandfather married my step-grandmother when they were both in their 50s. They couldnt have children together, they both knew it, and nobody tried to stop them from getting married. The alarm at separating childrearing from marriage is incoherent.

          David, I actually agree that it probably does little good to try to shame people on this issue and may even be counterproductive. Among a number of demographic groups there is more shame involved with being called gay than being called homophobic. So theres that. Plus, while I find myself losing patience with people on this issue I have to remind myself that just a few years ago this was not even on the radar. Seriously. Look it up. Even most gays werent pushing for gay marriage and in fact some of the people who were got a good bit of flack from certain parts of the gay community. It wasnt until 2001 that any modern nation recognized it. The point being thisI feel that i have to be careful in painting opponents of gay marriage rights as hateful bigots over an issue that I had no concern about myself, just a few years earlier.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Racism was wrong 100 years ago and was recognized as such 100 years ago. Sure, a majority may have not understood that but there were those who saw it clearly. many, in fact. Even when gay rights began to take hold in the 1970s I dont recall seeing any push for them to have the right to legal marriage. In fact, when opponents of the Equal Rights Amendment tried to argue that it would lead to gay marriage the response from advocates was NOT how that would be a good thing, that gays should have that right. It was that the ERA opponents were trying to scare people with scenarios that were ridiculous. Even among the left it seems, the very idea of gay marriage was ridiculous.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Well, times have changed and I think everyone should get on board. I can understand those that say that its not the same as the ban of interracial marriage, that marriage was always defined as the union of a man and a woman, that no valid dictionary included of the same race, that any law that went beyond that definition was not based on what marriage really was, etc. And as Ive said, unless one who was an adult for the last 30 years or so has a record of arguing and writing letters and otherwise agitating for the rights of gays to marry, I think one is on thin ice for portraying as nazi-like haters anyone who has not come around to an idea that is really a pretty new one for the national scene.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          All that said, it IS on the national scene now and in these modern times we should not have to have endless debates about something that is almost surely going to happen, especially when the benefits greatly outweigh any possible likely drwbacks. It will make gay people happy. It will give them all the benefits that straight people have gotten from marriage, which must be considerable since we keep doing it even in the face of many failures. I understand that for many the issue is moving too fast but I would appeal to their better natures and urge them to take a chance. Be on the side that brings joy to people and harms nobody.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          But lets not those of us already on that side dislocate our shoulders from patting ourselves on the back too much.

            Just as I should make clear that we are very much on the same side here though I may be more inclined to deal gently with those not enlightened. And I do believe that this is the best way to win them over. There are genuine hateful bigots and I think it best to point them out and compare and contrast our own nature with theirs and let the undecided decide who theyd rather be in the boat with.

          Okay, I have to chime in here. Divorces are horrific, terrible experiences. I have not experienced one myself but I have seen others go through the process. Beyond his politics, I cannot find anything saying Manchester is a  horrific person (I know for some not supporting gay marraige makes you evil and I understand that thinking). Lets say he is, I still wish he werent going through this.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          What is wrong with society now that we have people gleefully dancing at the suffering of others? Im aware of the obvious response  Manchester caused others to suffer by denying gay marraige. Again, I do not know that Manchester was motivated by sadism. He was either (depending on your view of the world) motivated by a misunderstanding of homosexuality or a desire to act upon a religious or social belief. Maybe its both? I dont know.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Lets say he is a vicious, racist, corrupt millionaire who uses his money not to cure diseases or help the poor but instead to keep down those he believes to be inferior. Okay. I still wish his marraige was not falling apart. What good is there in this beyond the ability to point a finger and go Ha ha! Dramatic irony!
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          People, in general, have become comfortable with sadism. This goes for those on the left, on the right, for gay marraige, against gay marraige. It doesnt matter who you are or what you believe in  we are now capable of wishing harm on others. I was speaking with a friend of mine a few months ago about a woman who sabotaged his career. He told me he was praying (he and I are both very religious) for harm to come to her. That stuck with me. I didnt say anything because I didnt want to risk lecturing someone on their beliefs (another thing peole seem ready to do now). As a Catholic, Ive been brought up to never wish harm on another  no matter how bad they may be or how much you might disagree with them. Is denying gay marraige wishing harm on someone? Ive heard points for both sides. Its certainly denying a degree of freedom to someone. For Catholics you get into  the issue of encouraging illicit behaviour.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Back to my main point. John Edwards is supposedly coming out to admit that he is the father of a child born out of an affair. Supposedly he might have attempted to get someone to take the fall  I dont care. I feel sorry for the man. I feel sorry for the woman who thought she was in love. I feel most sorry for the child whose short life is now defined by a political scandal covered on Fox News and MSNBC. I feel sorry for Sarah Palin as well. Clearly incapable of handling the pressure of being a governor, her life is best described as a disaster. Trig is a political prop to most when in truth hes a REAL BOY who will suffer for all of his life due to a medical condition. Perhaps this all started with Bill Clinton. I felt sorry for Clinton, whose actual crime was lying about a question someone had no business asking him. At the same time, I felt most sorry for Clintons children. Nobody ever spoke about them. I cant even find out about Manchesters family.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          So enough snarky comments and sarcastic blog posts. You dont like the guy. Fine. Maybe hes an Adolf Hitler who never got the chance to lead a Reich. How about instead of dancing over the grave of his marraige you hope that everything works out for him (it tends to when you have that much money). And if you dont agree with his beliefs, hope that the experience leads him to realize the folly of his ways. Either way, enough of this sadistic, jeuvenile nonsense.

            Oh, settle down. No one here  not PAD, not anyone  has called Manchester vicious, racist, or a sadist; nor has anyone here compared Manchester with Hitler. Those are all willful distortions on your part. Besides, if Manchester is as delicate a flower as you seem to believe, perhaps he shouldnt have become a public advocate for one side in a very contentious debate.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            All were doing is discussing what Manchesters divorce illustrates  that the real threat to marriage in the country, if there is one, doesnt come from homosexuals. Thats not sadistic, jeuvenile (sic) nonsense, its a worthwhile observation in the context of an important national discussion.

              Forgive me for not running that post through a spell check. As per settling down, I believe youve already asked someone to get help for what they believe in. Lets all learn to respect the opinions of others. I did not accuse anyone of comparing Manchester to Hitler. I was using the comparison myself to articulate a hypothetical situation.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              I bow to the internet Gods for invoking Godwins Law (Im not sure I did, but hey, I just learned about it five seconds ago). I wonder if theres a law that states that as a discussion of gay marriage rights goes on, one individual will repeatedly call others bigots for debating the other side. Or if theres a law that states that, in lieu of citing Hitler, one will cite the Civil Rights movement and state there is little to no difference.

              They werent called bigots for debating the other side. They were called bigots for trying to keep certain people from having the same rights as others. Since the definition of bigot is person who is intolerant of people of a different creed or belief, that doesnt seem inaccurate.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Is it incendiary? Probably. It probably doesnt really help the conversation because calling people names makes them defensive, whether the names are literally true or not. On the other hand, people who are hurting others need to know that just because they think theyre nice people doesnt mean they are. So Im not sure what the right way to handle the situation is.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              However, if your argument is that things are getting blown out of proportion, youd be better of not blowing things up yourself. Yes, your words did imply that people were treating someone like Hitler, whether you intended them to read that way or not. You did compare this conversation with sadism, and sadism is every bit as much of a loaded word as bigot. If you want to lower the temperature of the conversation, this isnt the best way to do it.

              Per your remark about name calling: I fully apologize if Ive offended anyone. My goal was to explain that people shouldnt revel in this mans divorce. The Hitler comment was meant to be an extreme to articulate a point  not an accusation aimed at any poster.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              I stand by my orignal point. We have, as a society, become comfortable watching peoples lives fall apart. In that regard, Im not really talking about you posters. I tried to extend the argument by pointing out the issues with Palin and Edwards. I was also tempted to bring up Michael Jackson. What amazed me about that situation is that the very same people who covered his (very obvious) mental issues with a kind of gleeful bile and vitriol turned right around and talked about how they loved the man.

              Second, Im not going to respect all opinions. Political differences and aesthetic tastes, sure, Ill respect opinions different from mine. But when someones opinion amounts to declaring that a certain group of people deserves second-class status, no, I dont respect that.

              a person who uses his money to promote state and national politics cannot claim the protection of individual freedoms and lifestyles. He is not involving himself in his own private affair but in public affairs, and is therefore open to criticism, even harsh criticism.

              He had an idiotic belief that homosexual marriage was a threat to heterosexual marriage, he did something about that, his own marriage went tits up for unrelated reasons. Ironic as Hell, sure. Courage of his convictions has nothing to do with it.

              Well, no, probably not.  Thats because no one is particularly hurt by the beliefs of the flat earth society, and trying to lower the speed limit is arguably an endeavor to help people stay safe (although 20 seems a bit absurd.).

              This isnt about offending people. This is about going to extremes in order to deprive people of rights that they had previously enjoyed in California.  Its not like he called them names.  Why are you minimizing what he did while maximizing the reactions to his obvious hypocrisy of firmly embracing Catholic teachings when, and only when, they suit his fancy?

              When someone demands that others be held to the tenants of his faith, then yes, failure to adhere to his own faith is hypocritical.

              By the way, its not that he didnt adhere to *all* the tenants of his faith. I doubt this conversation would be the same if hed broken a tenant that had nothing to do with marriage.

              Depends. If he donated to a campaign to restrict the speed limit and then it was discovered that he frequently gets busted doing 25 or 30 above the posted speed limit he might well be discussed as a hypocrite or worse by many. But, yeah, no one would care about it otherwise since it has nothing to do with gay marriage.

              @ Jason M. Bryant  You know, your response to my making an observation about how some people are acting appears to be to again emphasise how bad he is and how much he deserves it Which kind of illustrates what I was commenting on.
              <br/>

              How good or bad the other guy is shouldnt justify how good or bad we are.

              I described exactly what he did. If you interpret that as an effort to emphasise how bad he is and how much he deserves it, then thats your own interpretation.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Did he not try to enforce others living up to his religious standards on marriage? Did he not then decide not to live to his religious standards on marriage? Expecting others to do something and then not doing it himself is the definition of hypocrisy. So yeah, he deserves to be called a hypocrite.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              I dont think he deserves to have his life fall apart, but he certainly deserves to have people point out that his actions didnt match his rhetoric. We all deserve to be called out on that when we make that mistake.

              If thats all he did  fail to adhere to his faith  then no, its not necessarily hypocrisy. But he tried to impose his faith on *other people*, to their detriment, while failing to live up to that faith himself when it conflicted with his personal desires. Thats hypocrisy.

              It has nothing to do with deserving. The point of the whole discussion is not that he got something he deserved or didnt deserve. The point is that he did two things, fight against gay marriage and get divorced. One was justified by the catholic faith, the other is contrary to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              What he deserves or not deserves is between him and god. What he doesnt deserve is to be taken seriously on his political position considering his recent actions.

              Bill I dont mind the guy being called bigot or hypocrite if thats what he is. I do have a vague problem with other things hes getting called, but even that is just symptomatic of the main thing I was commenting on  that people who are not bigots or antigay are just as happy to sling epithets and abuse at those they do consider fit into those categories as people actually in those categories are to do that to others. Hence, ironic behaviour at least. Or possibly even hypocrisy?

              He did.  The two actions werent separated by years.  He was pumping money into the Prop 8 campaign in July of 2008, worked on its behalf through to its passing in November of 2008, and told his wife he wanted out of the marriage in October of 2008.  The only reason its just hitting the news now is because he tried to pressure her into doing it fast, in order to avoid (a) having to give her a lot of money and (b) publicity, I would guess.  After months of his stonewalling her, papers were filed that took it public.

              Because I attended George Takeis wedding, and it was a beautiful thing to watch.  And the earth didnt open up and swallow the wedding party.  It is insulting to me, as a thinking American, to have people shouting that that ceremony was somehow a danger to the American way of life.  It angers me that not only were the Prop 8 people trying to make sure that no other gay couple can share in that happiness, but they were hoping that Prop 8 would mange to undo the results of that ceremony.  Bigots should not have the right to block the rights of non-bigots.  And the entire business reeks of hypocrisy, because Ive said repeatedly in the past that divorce undos far more marriage than gay marriage ever can, and that if Prop 8ers really had the courage of their convictions, theyd try to ban divorce.  But they wont, because theyre hypocrites.  Ive been contending that it isnt about trying to save straight marriage; its about that they dont like gays, period.  So when this story came along and proved my point, I wrote about it.

              Run that one by me again What have I actually said about hypocrisy except that it requires professing to believe one thing whilst acting differently at the same time? Well, that and that if someone is a hypocrite its OK to call them one?

              Whilst I suppose its vaguely flattering that youd classify that as my criteria, I just thought it was part of the text book definition of hypocrisy. And if I was trying to do something, which Im not, then every point Im not trying to make (plural) has just been refurted by one (singular) interpretation of something which I havent said anyway?

              Why on Earth should they say that or why should I expect them to? My comment stands, as previously stated: that people who are not bigots or antigay are just as happy to sling epithets and abuse at those they do consider fit into those categories as people actually in those categories are to do that to others.

              Well if you want to start the thread with Gee, I Dont Understand This At All you can hardly bitch too much about being deliberately obtuse as a capital offense.
              <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://www.peterdavid.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>

              <br/>
              Your insistance that the point is about definitions of hypocrisy is also obtuse, and whether its deliberate or not becomes academic thereafter, particularly since you just agreed that were agreeing on that point anyway.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              What seems to have pressed your hot button is the impression that Im somehow defending this guy, or minimalising his hurtful and hypocritical actions, when Ive actually agreed that they are both of those things several times already.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              What I was attempting to comment on was a larger issue of how a number of people behave in a number of instances, which does reduce the guy to just one more example.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              The mistake I seem to have made was to keep getting dragged back into mentioning him again and again, or indeed at all.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              (BTW, digressing more than a little, the interface to this site really, really, sucks when it comes to following a lengthy thread. Not to mention the pain in the arsedness of still having blank line suppression in place)
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              You know what? first thing I said in this thread: Jeff, I guess you didnt get the memo. People labelled bigot, racist and homophobe are one of the few minorities it is still OK to dump on.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              Your own take: Bigots should not have the right to block the rights of non-bigots.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              PAD, youre a great writer, an intelligent, articulate and well-informed person, but I dont think you have any monopoly or wisdom into the human condition that lets you decide what rights other human beings get without some kind of due process being involved.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              We could dance around on this one for a few more rounds, but it probably ends with me losing my temper, telling you youre full of shit and flouncing off in a huff, so lets at least avoid some of those cliches.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              I appreciate your passion to defend what you believe in, and I share many of your beliefs, but I do think your willingness to judge and condemn is putting you  and a lot of others  on the same path as those youre judging and condemning  its the one that ends with a mob of self-righteous villagers screaming Burn her, shes a witch.
              <br/>
              
              <br/>
              So, Im outta here. Feel free to add whatever epilogue you wish to this. Let my own devastating parting shot be that despite a number of clever and very funny posts I still think Russet Moons a bloody stupid idea

              Peter J. Poole, I think the dispute is quite simple.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the beginning you have claimed that
              <br/>
              PAD and others are being mean to, dumping on, dogpiling on, piling on, lynching, gloating, condemning  etc. Mr. Manchester by calling him a hypocrite.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since the beginning we have claimed that since hes a hypocrite, and his hypocrisy is relevant to the greater discussion on gay rights, than it is neither wrong nor mean-spirited to call him a hypocrite.
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact that the view that he is a hypocrite is a majority view in this specific blog while Mr Manchesters view has few supporters does not make either view less valid. Nor does it make him a victim of any form of meanness.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason this discussion got stuck is because you have been bending over backwards to cast the people on this blog who called Mr. Manchester a hypocrite as a lynch mob of some sort while casting him and yourself as innocent victims of said mob, all the while constantly ignoring the simple explanation that Mr. Manchester is being called on his political hypocrisy (as political figures often are).
             </p>
             <p>
              Whats happening here is just a bunch of people of shared political opinions who are commenting on a clearly political action of a political figure who is not even affected by this in any way. There is no lynch mob, no meanness, no victim, no innocent person being dogpiled for no fault of his own.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its no different than a group of people sitting in a living room calling Tony Blair an idiot for going to Iraq. Hardly extraordinary.

          That is a flat statement and, I believe, patently untrue.  I think we as a society tend to rally around people who are in need.  Any number of timesincluding as recently as the Chicago Comicon raising money for Ostranderif someones life is in a spiral and others can pitch in, they do so.

          If were going to discuss society, then I think of far more relevance is societys considerable intolerance for hypocrisy.  Here youve got a guy who must, must, absolutely MUST stop gay marriage because his Catholicism dictates it.  And then he dumps his wife of five decades.  How exactly does the Catholic church feel about divorce, I wonder?  Ah, I remember:  They disapprove.  It is this extremely malleable attitude toward the dictates of Church and Biblethis self-serving mindset that allows people to cherry pick one philosophy that deprives one group of happiness while at the same time ignoring another philosophy that impedes their own desiresthat stinks to high heaven.

          Its not like Manchester was walking along, minding his own business, and he got hit by a car and people are going, Yea!  That guy who helped make Prop 8 a reality is now crippled!  Hell, its not even as if it was his wifes idea and hes being made to suffer.  This is a guy who stopped others from being able to wed while waving his crucifix and declaring how sacred marriage isand then demonstrates that he doesnt believe his own marriage is sacred at all by dumping his wife.

            We were actually talking about divorce in a class I take at my local Catholic church. The church disapproves of marraige in the sense that they wish they didnt happen and werent needed. Regarding gay marraige, its actually an interesting stance. They do not support gay marraige because they do not support homosexual actions (gay people are not, however, evil people). In truth, the church does not actually recognize any state marraiges. If you get married by the church and the priest sings a form legalzing your union, then youre married. If the state divorces you but you dont seek out an annulment by the church (which will usually provide one due to a stance that those in the church must support the goverments rulings and laws) and attempt to get remarried inside a church, you cant. The church only cares about holy unions, not state ones.

            .
            <br/>
            At our meeting, we all kind of came to the agreement that the state shouldnt provide any marraige certificates. Instead, they should just issue civil unions (and give those to whoever they choose).

              Ive been wondering about that myself, but cant help coming to the conclusion that the same sorts of people who supported Prop 8 would oppose this just as vigorously. After all, civil union is just a different name for the same thing: marriage. Ultimately, I think the only way gay marriage will be accepted society at large is if enough of them are allowed that people get used to the concept, and can see that the world isnt going to be consumed by hellfire as a result.

              Well, how about taking the other view?  After all, opposition to gay marriage is typically rooted in religious dogma.  Yet as near as I can tell, unequal distribution of fundamental rights is flatly unconstitutional.  This is a clear case of church vs. state and that shouldnt be happening.  So its simple:  Take church out of the marriage equation entirely.  After all, the investing of powers given to the church flow from the state.  So perhaps the middle man should be eliminated.  Perhaps it is the church that should get out of the marriage business entirely.  After all, the church has strong views on death, but its not in the business of creating  a last will and testament.  Furthermore, one of the scare tactics used to ram through Prop 8 was to convince the credulous that churches would be forced to perform gay marriage.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Since churches have demonstrated their willingness to conspire to deprive honest, law abiding citizens of their right to pursue happiness, screw it.  Lets just do away with church marriages and leave it entirely a state matter.

              You do not not need to be married to be happy. This statement reminds me of an ad I saw online trying to keep Prop 8 from being passed. A line of celebrities and other people gave reason why they wanted it to fail, and Neil Patrick Harris said, Because Im in love, and I want it to mean something.

              I must confess, Im scratching my head here. Please, help me to understand  how would giving gays the right to marry afford them more rights than heterosexual couples?
              <br/>

              <br/>
              Some people would beg to differ. For one thing, denying gays the right to marry assigns them to a second-class status. It means the government is saying that their relationships are not equal to heterosexual relationships. Also, marriage provides certain legal protections and privileges; again, denying those protections to gays assigns them to a second-class status.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Is there a particular reason you believe gays are deserving of that second-class status? If so, what is it?

               Its not a deprivation of human rights. Every citizen in America is allowed to marry someone of the opposite sex, even gay citizens. Gay people want more rights, not equal rights.

              Oh, yes, of course, everyone in America has the absolute legal right to enter into a loveless, shame-infested, dishonest marriage. Heterosexuals, however, also have the right to enter into a marriage based on genuine love and commitment, and they do not need to think about what its like to be unable to marry the individual they love. To say that civil marriage is a special right when the married partners are of the same gender shows no respect for the validity of those partners love for each other.

             <p>
              Again: most people in this country do not need to think about what it is like to be in a committed relationship and be unable, by law, to get married. Its easy enough to say that civil marriage rights arent necessary when youve never lived in a society where you dont have them.

              1. What Im saying is that everyone has the right to get married, provided the person they are marrying is of the opposite gender. Gay people ASK for equal rights, but they already have them. No one is allowed to marry someone of the same gender, and gay people want this right. Therefore, they want more rights, not equal rights.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              2. I do not believe gay people deserve second-class citizenship. In fact, I havent established my position on the issue. You seem to have inferred than I am against gay marriage, but the points I made are clerical and technical; someone on either side of the fence could make the same observations. As far as I am concerned, it is an issue of states rights. Proposition 8, allowing people to VOTE on whether they wanted gay marriage in their state or not, was the absolute best way to handle the issue in my opinion.

              While as a formal, literal matter gays do have an equal right to marry someone of an opposite sex, the usual rejoinder to that is to quote Anatole France: The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread. Having a right to something in which you have no Earthly interest is of little value.

              Im quite sure youre dead wrong.  Im quite sure that marriage laws in most states do not, in fact, specify two genders in their marriage laws.  The reason Im sure of this is that a number of states have gone out of their way to hold referendums in recent that specifically exclude same sex couples.

              That is, quite simply, abominable. Do you understand that?  In those statesI suspect in most statesthere was not a specific law that deprived couples of the same sex from marrying until the people and/or legislature got together and made sure that such a law was instituted.

              Your argument can easily be rolled back sixty years and you could declare that any white person has the right to marry any other white person and any black has the right to marry any black person, but interracial couples want more rights, not equal rights. And I tell you, sixty years from now, the attitude youre expressing today is going to seem as antiquated and absurd as the sentiment aboveso valid in the 1940s and 50sseems today.

              For the record, here in the great state of Washington, about a year or so ago, the legislature passed a domestic registration partnership law. Any couple who were sharing living quarters and living expenses could register as domestic partners, which afforded them most (not quite all, but most) of the legal protections associated with marriage, while not being in fact marriage.

              Various groups, mostly backed by fundamentalist Christian churches, lost no time in beginning to gather petitions for Referendum 71, designed to eliminate even this concession to the concept of marital freedom. Its expected to be on the ballot this fall, assuming no fraud with the signatures is detected

              Well, no.  John got snippy with Gail because she said, John, I hope you dont mind my posting this and then posted it, and it was Byrnes contention that it was the equivalent of saying, Do you mind if I smoke? and then lighting up regardless.  His issue was with the way Gail presented it, not with the the cause itself.

              .
              <br/>
              Gails mistake was asking for permission to do something and then going ahead and doing it without waiting for confirmation.  Johns mistake was likening a worthy cause to smoking a cigarette and generally behaving like a jerk about it, rather than either (a) responding initially, Well, Im not sure why you asked permission when you went and did it anyway, but dont worry about it because its a worthy cause.  Just next time if youre going to ask, wait for me to say okay, or (b) saying nothing at all rather than make an issue out of it.  Just because your pride has been pricked doesnt mean you have to act like a proud prick.

           Is it incendiary? Probably. It probably doesnt really help the conversation because calling people names makes them defensive, whether the names are literally true or not.
          </i>
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          When I was younger, I was very prejudiced towards homosexuals. Then I went to college and met some out-of-the-closet homosexuals (the ones I knew in high school didnt out themselves until much later). I began to recognize on some level that prejudice against gays was wrong, but didnt have the courage to act on it. I stood silently by as I witnessed acts of intimidation born of bigotry and outright hatred.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Over the years Ive gotten to know some homosexuals personally and professionally, and some of them have had a profoundly positive impact on my life. I figure the least I can do  the VERY least  is to break my silence and stand up for their rights.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          The word bigot is incendiary? How about words like fairy, or queer, or homo, or faggot, all of which are used in casual conversation today?
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          I believe bigotry thrives in the shadows, when we couch it as simply being someones opinion. Could I be nicer about it? Perhaps. But then again, I think many homosexuals would tell you that some heterosexuals could be nicer about it by not calling gays cruel names, denying gays equal rights, and in some cases committing violence against gays.

            Well, as long as youre being no more intolerant of people than they are being of other people, and dont demean them any more than they demean other people, thats probably okay Wait, no, I dont think it is.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Two things: (1)
            <i>
             You know, I cant believe this sailed past me: David the Bold declares that it isnt inherently bigoted to view a class of people as undeserving of equal rights  based on a world-view that is illogical and by his own admission ill-supported by factual evidence. If that isnt bigotry, then nothing is.
            </i>
            Lets see here, according to dictionary.com bigotry means
            <b>
             stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from ones own.
            </b>
            So, no, poor logic does not constitute bigotry. Considering that a thread in this discussion is that the newspaper, Alanis Morissette, and large portions of English-speaking society tend to misuse a word (irony), I find this amusing. Particularly considering that the only stubborn and complete intolerance visible in this discussion is the doctrine that everyone who opposes gay marriage for any stated reason is, perforce, bigoted. Some poor logic is probably bigoted. Taking the leap from some people who believe X are bigots to everyone who believes X is a bigot springs to mind.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            (2) I still dont think that lowering yourself to your opponents level is a good way to win a debate over a major social issue particularly when youre representing a viewpoint that is the distinct minority in this country. I think gay marriage will ultimately prevail in America, because America is traditionally very good about advancing freedom. It takes a while sometimes (see: Civil Rights Movement, the), but we get there. Itll go faster if the movement engages the nation and tries to convince their opponents that yes, gay marriage is an equality issue, and yes, equality is a very American virtue. People eventually will come around. (I did, and Im a Republican. The libertarian wing of the party does still exist, you know.) Itll take
            <i>
             longer
            </i>
            to get there if gay rights advocates engage in arrogant, self-righteous tactics that (a) shove the institution down peoples throats and (b) lead to pushbacks like Proposition 8. (Right now youre getting a pushback from someone who supports gay marriage: me.) Im just saying.

              Imposing an institution on a polity that has affirmatively rejected it is something of a shove. Alan can think of it as metaphorical forced sodomy if that makes him feel better. Although its forcing an ethical doctrine down someones throat, so maybe its moral rape instead of oral rape. (Ewwwww. Wicked pun.)

              The other thing that I think people miss in this discussion is that we wouldnt be having any discussion whatsoever of gay rights if tolerance for diverging viewpoints and lifestyles hadnt become such a cornerstone of modern American political culture. That is a wonderful development. The price of it though is that in turn you have to tolerate (not endorse, not approve, not even forgive) those whom you, in turn, find as revolting as the true bigots find gays. I think Bill does have to agree to disagree with people whose views he finds reprehensible, because he in turn expects people to tolerate his opinions. If we take the approach that we tolerate everyone except those whose views are just too reprehensible, how exactly have we progressed as a society? Were just as intolerant, but better focused on whats truly right? Is that really a trade up? How do we know that were more enlightened now? Im not a huge Holmes fan, but in

              he had it right: time has upset many fighting faiths, and theres no reason to think were immune to evolving standards. There is no reason to think that anyone alive is exactly right on any one issue, let alone all of moral philosophy. So lets discuss things, try to muddle our way forward, and show a little respect.

              David,
              <br/>
              One of  the hardest things about being an American  something too many people, on both ends of the political spectrum, often forget  is that freedom of speech goes both ways. Your freedom to speak your mind requires you to support others whose views you cant stand, views you would  give your life to oppose. Thats why the ACLU has backed Nazis right to march, Rush Limbaughs right to privacy, and the peoples right to know what our government is doing.

              True tolerance entails supporting someones rights in regards to the issue at hand.  I am perfectly tolerant of someones right to be a bigot.  The bigot, on the other hand, is in return intolerant of the rights of gays by attempting to institutionalize said bigotry in the form of such things as Prop 8.  Tolerance, if it is to be genuine, has to be two ways.  Otherwise its just one person punching another in the face and the guy being punched is being told to take it without complaint in the interests of tolerance.

            Bill, it seems to me that what people here are trying to say is that if your objective is to change peoples minds then the word bigot, though mostly accurate, is probably not useful. This does not mean that you have to go soft on this issue, but theres both a tactical and a moral reason to prefer strong but not antagonistic language, unless your objective is not to convince but to attack (which is legitimate at times).
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at the civil rights movement you see that MLK focused on language of rights, empathy, common values with white Americans, hope, in order to influence Americans. He knew that he would have little effect on the more extreme bigots, but he was more interested in the people who might harbor prejudices, but who could still be reached by his message because of shared values. On the other hand, when the civil rights movement shifted to a more antagonistic, radical, nationalistic tone, it lost much of its influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other  hand, Malcolm X used very extreme language. That language appealed more to certain blacks than MLKs language, and possibly helped galvanize them and get them to become more active in the civil rights movement. This is important too. Malcolm X was also a great speaker, so he could influence white minds even though his language was incendiary. However, in the long run the incendiary style probably had more negative effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, although the word bigot might be accurate, it is also very blunt since it does not distinguish between somebody who is truly hate filled and somebody who has still some qualms about gays.

              Micha, you make some good points.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Its possible my own hard-nosed attitude is as much about my guilty conscience as it is about the issues at hand. When I was much younger I was prejudiced towards homosexuals, and it wasnt until I met some openly gay people that I realized how foolish I was.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Nevertheless, I think its worth making the point that one neednt wear a white hood and burn crosses in peoples front yards in order to be a bigot. If you believe someone else is undeserving of equal protection under the law because that person is in some way different from you, you are on some level a bigot.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              I realize that there are those who would say, Hold on, what about people who object upon religious or moral grounds? You have to respect their beliefs. Well, no. Not really. Religion, morality, and even science (albeit really, really bad science) have all been used in the past to justify racism. A lot of people opposed interracial marriage on religious, moral, and or sociological grounds. Most of us today realize that the battle between segregationists and integrationists was more than merely a difference of opinion. Yet there are some who believe I must simply agree to disagree when the same kind of thinking is applied to homosexuals. I simply cant accept that.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Yes, I realize that many who oppose gay marriage arent rabidly anti-gay. Then again, many people who harbor racist attitudes arent rabid about it, either. I know people to this day who will tell me they have nothing against black people, only to then follow it up with the word but. Usually they end up expressing a sentiment which amounts to not in my neighborhood. To me, theres not much difference between that, and those who dont hate homosexuals *but* dont want to see them able to legally wed.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Was it fair to draw an analogy between, say, what PJ said and the attitudes held by the most ardent segregationists of decades past? Probably not without acknowledging that I have no reason to believe that PJ is any way as hateful or malicious. Nevertheless, I think the difference here is one of degree rather than kind. While my tone may have left something to be desired, my point is sound: the rationalizations used to justify opposition to gay marriage are just that rationalizations. Behind those rationalizations is some level of bigotry.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              But the bottom line, Micha, is that you are correct: Martin Luther King Jr. was an unapologetic fighter against discrimination, but he did so by appealing to peoples better natures rather than deepening the divisions between us. If Im going to invoke his name, I probably ought to also follow his example. After all, weve seen what intransigence has done for the health care debate in this country, and it is in no way positive.

              I dont believe we should strip people of their free speech rights simply because I disagree with them. If someone has the right to advocate discrimination, do I not also have the right to say it is wrong to do so? Or is that in your view intolerant?

              If I agree to disagree, that means we shake hands and walk away. I dont intend to do that with respect to gay marriage. I intend to do everything I legally can to help change the laws of this country so that opponents of gay marriage dont get their way. The one thing I wouldnt advocate  and would in fact fight against  is stripping opponents of gay marriage or anyone else of their right to free speech. If you believe otherwise about me, you have misjudged me.

              Maybe I was inferring more than you actually said there. (I dont think I was, but since my entire participation on this thread has been bemoaning that people tend to talk past each other, I dont want to do it by accident by creating a straw man in my head.) I still think theres a problem though if instead of engaging your opponents opinions, you disregard them, if instead of explaining your standpoint you reduce those who disagree to single words (e.g. bigot), you delegitimize their presence in the marketplace of ideas. They have as much business there as you do. Their viewpoints are entitled to exactly as much respect as yours. Micha wrote, In any case, I dont think being intolerant toward gays and being intolernt against people who are prejudiced toward gays are equal. But in general I dont recommend intolerance. Why isnt intolerance toward gays and intolerance toward bigots morally equivalent? Either were going to have a free and open society where everyone is welcome to express his views, or were not. Its much the same reason that free speech cases tend to involve speakers whom most people find repugnant. Popular speakers (or at least speakers popular with the dominant political or ideological regime) dont
              <i>
               need
              </i>
              free speech guarantees. If we only tolerate those of whom we approve, its McCarthyism all over again, except instead of blacklisting Communists were blacklisting bigots. At most that is a
              <i>
               slight
              </i>
              improvement. And thats true whether were talking about actually stripping them of free speech rights, which I dont think I accused you of, or shunning them and denying their legitimacy, which I think youre explicitly doing. I wasnt thinking agree to disagree in the sense of walking away from the argument; much to the contrary, I think what the gay rights movement needs to do is stay in the discussion, but actually

              , with people who are entitled to be treated as fellow citizens with their own opinions, not written off as ignorant thugs. Really Ive been arguing against the tone you were using in some of your earlier posts; substantively Ive agreed with a fair amount of what youve said, particularly about the intemperate tone damaging the health care debate.

              Discussion functions best when common ground is found as, at the very least, a basis for that discussion.  A foundation, if you will.  Having a discussion without that foundation is like building a house on quicksand.  And it is problematic for gays to have a discussion about the legalities or fine points of gay marriage when the oppositions POV boils down to:  (a) you are an abomination because the Bible says so, and (b) you do not have the same rights I do.

              Nevertheless, I think its worth making the point that one neednt wear a white hood and burn crosses in peoples front yards in order to be a bigot. If you believe someone else is undeserving of equal protection under the law because that person is in some way different from you, you are on some level a bigot.
             </p>
             <p>
              I used exactly the same argument in a different discussion about discrimination. We agree that the opposition to gay marriage is motivated by a prejudice, and that an analogy to the restriction of interracial marriage is a valid analogy.
             </p>
             <p>
              think the difference here is one of degree rather than kind.
             </p>
             <p>
              We also agree about that. But I believe the difference of degree is a very important one.
              <br/>
              Ultimately it is not in our interest to lump together all the degrees of prejudice and separate them from the pure, since lets face it, most people have or had certain low level prejudices.  Our interest is to offer the option for people to become gradually less and less prejudiced (including ourselves).
             </p>
             <p>
              Its possible my own hard-nosed attitude is as much about my guilty conscience as it is about the issues at hand. When I was much younger I was prejudiced towards homosexuals,
             </p>
             <p>
              So was I. So were many people. Its human nature. Homosexuality is a weird phenomenon. But thats all the more reason to be more charitable to good people who might hold certain prejudices.
             </p>
             <p>
              
              <br/>
              I dont believe we should strip people of their free speech rights simply because I disagree with them. If someone has the right to advocate discrimination, do I not also have the right to say it is wrong to do so? Or is that in your view intolerant?
             </p>
             <p>
              Exactly. I think part the problem here is the use of the word tolerance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Micha wrote, In any case, I dont think being intolerant toward gays and being intolernt against people who are prejudiced toward gays are equal. But in general I dont recommend intolerance. Why isnt intolerance toward gays and intolerance toward bigots morally equivalent?
             </p>
             <p>
              The statements:
              <br/>
              The KKK are scum.
              <br/>
              and
              <br/>
              Niggers are scum.
              <br/>
              are equal from the point of view of freedom of speech. Neither are great examples of rhetoric skills. But they are not morally equivalent, I think, and I wouldnt consider the person making the first statement to be equal in his intolerance to the one making the second. However, a person who exhibited a certain level of tolerance to the people making both statements could be considered admirable if by tolerance we mean to say that he tolerates the man, not his opinions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its difficult to have a discussion with a person or a group of people who strongly feels that you dont have the right to exist, as pretty much anyone in Israel can tell you.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is. But from a tactical point of view it is better to appear as the person willing to have a discussion even if the other side does not, unless there is another reason not to do so (sometimes there is).

              David, you have repeatedly asked for civility while calling me names like whiny and intolerant. Ive tried to moderate my tone and engage you in a civil discussion, and youve taken that as license to sucker-punch me repeatedly. Are you really interested in a civil discussion? Because if so, Id be happy to have one. But if youre merely here to stir up the pot, I have better things to do.

              Actually, I dont think I did. In fact, I explicitly said in my last post that I was bothered by your tone in your

               earlier
              </i>
              posts. As you said, you have moderated that. I dont think anything youve said in this thread in the last couple days has been whiny, and I havent called it such. Im sorry if you interpreted what I was saying that way. But you are far from the only person to employ that mode of argument, and that form of argument is a fair target, whether youre using it right now or not.

              I did, and do, think that reducing your opponent to bigot is a ridiculous form of argument. It lets you sidestep the discussion entirely, because if someone is a hopeless bigot, by definition you cannot reason with him, so why bother trying? I recognize that it is frustrating. As PAD asks, How do you find common ground with people who are entitled to be treated as fellow citizens when those individuals do not believe that gays are entitled to be treated as fellow citizens? The short answer is that you dont. But nobody thinks that Rev. Phelps is going to be at the hypothetical negotiating table. The mistake is taking the easy way out and writing off everyone who believes that gay marriage shouldnt be legalized as a Phelps-type character. No national poll has ever found a majority of the American people to support gay marriage, yet do you really think the American people at large is, as PAD describes, a group of people who strongly feels that you [i.e. homosexuals] dont have the right to exist? Or for that matter, the Democratic Party, which, as I understand their platform, officially favors civil unions but not marriage? It is wrong, both factually and ethically, to equate all opponents of gay marriage with Phelps. And I still think its wrong to be as disrespectful of Phelps as he is of other people. Instead of arguing this point, I should have just quoted Hamlet: Treat every man after his desert, and who shall scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity- the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty.

              Frankly Im not sure that beliefs are voluntary. I dont know how one would go about arguing Mel Gibson into not being a hardline Catholic. But even setting that aside, Im not asking you or anyone not to despise genuine bigots. Micha is right, the KKK are scum. But theyre scum with rights to participate in political discussions, same as everyone else. The system has to be result-independent; you dont have to listen to them, but you do have to let everyone have access to the forum without being shouted down. Remember a few years ago when an Hispanic student group stormed a stage at Columbia while one of the Minuteman organization was speaking? Almost
              <i>
               everyone
              </i>
              sided with the Minuteman on that one, as well they should. Even jerks are entitled to speak their piece, at which point they will probably reveal themselves to be jerks.

              Oddly enough, the ones most prone to this belief seem to be the ones who are most vocally against gay marriage.

             </p>
             <p>
              The truth is that it doesnt matter. Whether homosexuality is a choice (like religion) or not (like race), neither are grounds for discrimination.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, it should be pretty obvious that homosexuality is not a choice for the simple reason that heterosexuality isnt.
             </p>
             <p>
              The opponents of gays try to claim that gays are actually doing something that is harmful to society in a way that justifies restricting their rights. But this argument is false on two counts. One, its not true and is just an excuse for a prejudice stemming from the fact that homosexuality seems strange to heterosexuals. Two, the same people who want to restrict the rights of gays would never suggest curtailing individual civil rights to deal with acts that do have a negative effect on family values such as divorce or infidelity.

          stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from ones own.

          Thats a terrible definition. Is any person, even the most narrow-minded intolerant of ANY opinion that differs from ones own? Should people be tolerant of any creed? And how do you define stubborn and complete?

          The Merriam Webster definition on the other hand seems too narrow:
          <br/>
          Bigot: a person obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance
         </p>
         <p>
          In any case, I dont think being intolerant toward gays and being intolernt against people who are prejudiced toward gays are equal. But in general I dont recommend intolerance.
         </p>
         <p>
          lead to pushbacks like Proposition 8
         </p>
         <p>
          It is somewhat problematic to blame people fighting for their rights for causing a pushback. Is there a way to fight for ones rights without causing a pushback? Or should people not fight for their right, but waitt for the american people to get there on their own?
          <br/>
          I presume there is no correct answer. Sometimes you try to avoid a pushback, sometimes you live with its inevitability, and at other times you try to create it in order to acheive your objective.

            I know people who arent particularly vocal about unfair discrimination against minorities, but are quick to take umbrage at any criticism of the majority. Its as though in their minds anyone who would question the status quo has the sole burden of proof.

            There are good ways to fight for your rights and there are bad ways. I tend to think that legislative lobbying is a good way and litigation is a bad way. Like it or not (and generally I like it), the core aspect of living in a democratic republic like the US is that the people, collectively, get to determine what sort of society we have. Every single person has the right to challenge that consensus and try to change it. But ultimately the majority rules. Successful strategies (see again: Civil Rights Movement, the) address the majority through persuasion, rather than trying to finesse the system by persuading the courts to impose their desired settlement, whether the majority likes it or not.

            On the other hand, you have the gay marriage approach, which is to litigate an issue that they know they have no chance to win legislatively outside of New England. Instead of having a social discussion about what equal rights mean in modern America, it seeks to have courts declare, this is what equal rights mean, end of discussion. Are you really surprised that theres a negative reaction to that? You dont have to be Scalia to think that gay marriage is an interpretation of the 14th Amendments equal protection aspect that not one single person who voted on it saw coming, and that therefore maybe this issue should be handled by the political branches. The Proposition 8 fight was particularly disturbing; not only did you have a court overturning a plebiscite, but then the court was asked to overturn a plebiscite reinstating the first referendum. At some point its fair to ask the California Supreme Court what part of no it doesnt understand. The gay rights movement shouldnt give up. But it should realize that even when the majority is making a stupid decision, that mistake is theirs to make. The solution is to persuade the majority that theyre wrong. Taking power away from the people is not the solution. Calling everyone who opposes the one true faith a bigot or a homophobe is not the solution; even if you think its true, all youre going to do is convince a supermajority of Americans that youre self-righteous, intolerant, and whiny, because youre implicitly calling most Americans nasty names. Thats where the pushback comes from. It isnt taking umbrage at any criticism of the majority; its asking for a modicum of respect from those who wish to change the system. Were right and everyone who disagrees is evil/racist/bigoted/homophobic/etc isnt an argument, its a soundbite. It lowers the level of political discourse, which is too low already.

              In theory individual rights belong to people not as a result of the good will of the majority but by virtue of being human or a citizen at least. Another approach is that rights belong to people by virtue of the constitution, but still such rights presumably belong to people regardless of whether they are a majority or a minority or have the good will of the majority. If this is the case, and the issue is not one of policy but of human/constitutional rights, then presumably the court is the place you would go if your rights were infringed, no?
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, the constitution and the courts depend on the people both according to theory and practice. So going to court if the people are hostile might not be enough even if you assume youre being denied unalienable rights. But you might still do it as a matter of principle, to lay claim to your rights rather than behave as if they are something that depends on the whims of the majority.
             </p>
             <p>
              The civil rights movement employed both a the method of persuasion (speeches, essays etc.), the courts, and very confrontational methods whose very purpose was to cause a pushback (civil disobedience). The success of the civil rights movement was achieved by using all these methods, not just one of them. In his essays MLK responded to people who suggested the courts should not be used, as well as to people who suggested a more gradual approach (gradualism). This is part of his legacy together with his appeal to the better nature of people and his inclusiveness.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moreover, going to court has (and had) other purposes beyond trying to change policy through the courts. First, like I said, you go to court in order to lay claim to the rights you think you deserve. Secondly, if you win, you get a recognition of your rights from an important institution. Thats valuable even if their is a pushback. Thirdly, going to court is like civil disobedience or a big demonstration, it pushes an issue into the center of public discussion very effectively and also helps galvanize the supporters. These are no small things. They are very hard to accomplish, and they may very well be worth whatever pushback you might get. This is especially true if to begin with your position is weak and unrecognized and/or if your opponent is using similar techniques to motivate his side.
             </p>
             <p>
              I dont follow the struggle of gays in the US, but it seems to me they wouldnt have gotten very far if they used just mild methods like petitions and demonstrations. It would have been very easy for the public to ignore that as some crazy quirk of a small strange group. Civil disobedience would not have been effective or relevant, so going to courts seems like the most effective way to push the issue and magnify the voice of your group.

          The idea that proponents of gay marriage are stridently trying to force their will on the majority is bass-ackwards. It is opponents of gay marriage who are trying to legislate second-class citizenship for homosexuals. Lets at least be honest about that.

            Fourteen years ago I married a woman of a different race (and I put race in quotes because, despite what the Farrakhans and Dukes of this world say, were all human  I dont do rishathra, thankyouverymuch!) At the time I was born my marriage would have been illegal in many states. We couldnt go visit her family in Texas without the risk of arrest, not to mention our kids. Add in that some members of my family are homosexual, and I tend to take these things seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for homosexuality being choice vs. genes  can you imagine any other choice that denies a citizen a fundamental right? The only one I can think of is a felony conviction denying the right to vote in some states.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now lets replace the word homosexual with any other you like  Jew or Catholic or Episcopalian or union member or  you get the point.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to whether opponents of marriage equality are bigots, I dont care. Its not their personality I disagree with, but their views on a specific issue. Its political.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heres my idea of a real Defense of Marriage amendment: Marriage shall be defined as a voluntary union of two consenting adults. There you go  none of the straw men about bestiality or pedophilia or all the other crap.

          Having read this entire thread again Ive come to the conclusion that I let David push my buttons and convince me I was doing something I was not: flying off the handle. I let him trick me into tying my own hands behind my back while he sucker punched me repeatedly. Apologies for the length of this post, but its time I stand up for myself here. While Im at it, Im going to address people other than David as well.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Here goes
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Peter J Poole: So the guy thinks one thing, acts on it and subsequently finds himself thinking differently and acting differently?
          <br/>
          
          <br/>
          Technically, unless he did both at the same time you cant even make the hypocrisy charge stick.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          PAD already proved to you that, yes, Manchester met your definition. Im going to make it a one-two punch: youre wrong about the definition of hypocrisy.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          According to the Microsoft Encarta North American Dictionary, hypocrisy is the false claim to or pretense of having admirable principles, beliefs, or feelings. Nowhere does it say anything about simultaneous actions. Now, if Manchester had renounced his support of Prop 8 because he himself wasnt a perfect Catholic and *then* decided to get a divorce that would not be hypocritical. Getting a divorce two years after supporting Prop 8 without at least acknowledging a contradiction  that would fit the definition of hypocrisy.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Peter J Poole: I do have a vague problem with other things hes getting called, but even that is just symptomatic of the main thing I was commenting on  that people who are not bigots or antigay are just as happy to sling epithets and abuse at those they do consider fit into those categories as people actually in those categories are to do that to others. Hence, ironic behaviour at least. Or possibly even hypocrisy?
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Nope. Its neither. Manchester is trying to deny people equal protection under the law because of what they are, were criticizing him because of choices he made. Theres no hypocrisy, because were not saying one thing and doing another. Now, if I were to go start a movement to prohibit women from holding elected office after criticizing Manchester for working to deny equal protection under the law for gays, *then* Id be a hypocrite. But Im not doing that, so Im in the clear.

          If I had said that poor logic alone constitutes bigotry, youd have a point. But I didnt, and you dont. I said believing that a class of people is undeserving of equal treatment under the law for no logical reason fits the definition of bigotry, which it does.

          Lets rewind the clock back to the Jim Crow era. Lets say a white person in this era professes not to have anything against black people and is always courteous to any blacks he meets. He simply doesnt believe black children should be allowed to attend school alongside his children, because even though he has nothing against black people he thinks the races just shouldnt mix. I think wed agree that that person would meet the definition of bigot. How is that any different than someone who believes gays shouldnt marry?

          The polity has attempted to rewrite the law to deny gays the right to marry. They are the ones attempting to impose, not the other way around.

          I never said everyone who opposes gay marriage is a Phelps-type character. I said that anyone who opposes gay marriage is bigoted. Again, bigotry isnt limited to those in white hoods burning crosses on peoples front lawns. If you believe that not everyone deserves equal treatment under the law, you are a bigot. That may be an emotionally charged word, but that doesnt mean its inaccurate

          David: But ultimately the majority rules. Successful strategies (see again: Civil Rights Movement, the) address the majority through persuasion, rather than trying to finesse the system by persuading the courts to impose their desired settlement, whether the majority likes it or not.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s persuaded the general public not with gentle rhetoric, but instead by tugging at their conscience with horrific television footage of black men and women being hit with water cannons and attacked by police dogs. If desegregation had been left up to the voting public, wed still have Jim Crow laws on the books today in at least some states.

          <br/>
          Homosexuals dont have the same hook for civil disobedience that the civil rights protestors of the 60s did. The police arent going to hit gay couples with water cannons if they declare themselves married in California; the government simply wont recognize it, and that doesnt make for good T.V. Therefore the court system is the logical place for their fight.

            Personally I dont think youve flown off the handle in this debate. At times Ive disagreed with your rhetoric, because I think youve been dismissive of people with whom we both fundamentally disagree, for reasons that I address in the next paragraph. I think your comments, certainly for the last several days, have been measured and rational, although I disagree with many of them. I have apologized for implying otherwise, and reading back through the comments here I did ratchet up the snideness unnecessarily on Sunday. If Im going to go after you for using incendiary rhetoric, I should fess up when I do it, and I did. Given that I did so in the midst of making a pitch for reasoned debate, we might want to reopen the discussion of irony.

            I somehow doubt that Manchester ever said that homosexuals did not deserve equal protection under the law. I doubt
            <i>
             any
            </i>
            prominent Proposition 8 supporters said that; even if they thought it, theyd have to be staggeringly dumb to say it publicly. (Which, again, is not going to stop the Phelps-type person, but I agree with you that not all bigots are walking caricatures.) Instead, the anti-gay-marriage argument is that equal protection doesnt require redefining marriage to include two members of the same sex. My entire objection is that some gay marriage supporters, who shall remain nameless, prefer to write off that position as naked bigotry rather than affirmatively making the argument that yes, a meaningful concept of equal protection
            <i>
             does
            </i>
            require new forms of marriage. I tend to think that slinging out terms like bigoted, which you target at anyone who opposes gay marriage, is unhelpful even if its true. It is a substitute for argument rather than an argument. It implies that anyone who takes the position opposite to yours is undeserving of a full response. (And by dismissing Manchester the same way you ignore Phelps, I feel you are equating them.) Thats why I keep dragging out free speech rhetoric, even in the absence of actual censorship. If you never engage your opponent, you never even open yourself up to the possibility that ye might be mistaken. How do you
            <i>
             know
            </i>
            youre right about a moral argument, ever? Communists
            <i>

            they were right. Segregationists
            <i>
             knew
            </i>
            they were right. Oppression by intellectual consensus is almost as disturbing as oppression by actual censorship. Gadflies are important, and even jerks deserve to be taken seriously, rather than dismissed outright. Thats a practical argument as well as an ideological one; coherently stating your position can only strengthen it. And who do you think the people on the fence are going to believe, the faction thats making (poorly-) reasoned arguments, or the one thats calling the other names?
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            That is my entire thesis. I apologize again if I went a bit overboard on sarcasm at times, as I feel I did. Painting ones opponents argument as somewhat ridiculous is an often useful trial strategy. Its inappropriate on what should be a reasonable debate in a blog.

            I believe I actually pointed that out two days ago. Regarding your subsequent argument, there are ways other than being beaten with a hose to arouse empathy in the general public. Americans are not immune to gentle persuasion. I dont recall womens rights being advanced by police dogs and hoses. Personally, I flipped to the pro-choice side of the abortion discussion after reading an essay in my philosophy of law class. I think litigation actually hurt that issue;
            <i>
             Roe
            </i>
            killed off a womens political movement and left in its place a frothing conservative antiabortion movement. (That argument comes from an essay by then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, incidentally.)

            As the old sayings go, money talks and actions speak louder than words.  When youre contributing six figure sums to a movement designed to deprive gays of equal protection under the law by actually changing the law so that it no longer applies, then thats exactly what youre saying.  The KKK doesnt need to hold a press conference to say that theyre bigots; a burning cross sends the message.  Manchester performed the financial equivalent of a burning cross.

          </b>
          defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman until the series of laws defining it as such were passed, or those would have been redundant. That doesnt mean that the word marriage didnt have a clearly understood legal meaning up until the time gay marriage advocates challenged the customary practices. Not every word in a legal document, be it a statute or contract, is defined either because of sloppy draftsmanship or because it never occurred to anyone that there would be a dispute over its meaning. Imagine if you have a rental agreement that youre allowed to have dogs in a certain apartment building; odds are nobody  is going to bother writing into the apartment contracts that dog means a member of

There is a famous case in that vein famous because its routinely inflicted on first-year law students determining how to tell whether the word chicken in a contract means a broiler or a fryer. You will look in vain for a Federal law on how to interpret chicken in international sales contracts, but since that case the Southern District of New York has had guidelines on how to do so (common sense prevailed chicken was not ruled to be a technical term). As with chickens, marriage at common law meant exactly what the ordinary user of English understood it to mean, a couple consisting of a husband and a wife (usually to the detriment of the wifes rights, particularly in the older cases). And since every state but Louisiana is a common law jurisdiction, the Blackstone-era definition of marriage is the default rule nationwide. The advantage of codifying the term under the state constitutions or statutes is that the codification trumps common law, preventing a future court from altering the existing rules (unless the future court rules the statute unconstitutional, which is why a number of states preferred constitutional amendments over statutes). As I mentioned before,
          <i>

          Thats even true with Proposition 8. Proposition 8, when proposed, changed nothing. At the time it was being qualified for the ballot,
          <i>
           In re Marriage Cases
          </i>
          hadnt been decided yet. Proposition 8 was intended to reset the definition of marriage in the event (which happened while Proposition 8 was pending) that the California Supreme Court invalidated the existing law. Presumably thats one reason that Proposition 8 only trumped the part of
          <i>

In any event, at the time Proposition 8 was circulated, the governing law on gay marriage in California was the same as it was when the California Supreme Court invalidated His Holiness the Mayor of San Franciscos attempt to issue marriage licenses to gay couples: it was forbidden. The law struck down in
          <i>
           Marriage Cases

              I dont think Im self-righteous. Ill admit to occasionally veering into arrogance though. What makes it worse is that the arrogance occasionally expresses itself in excessive snideness, which I suspect is where the tinges of self-righteousness come from. Its a flaw Im less successful in controlling than Id like. I apologize for the occasions when I fail, and I thank you for your words.

             Yeeeeeees except, well, that isnt actually what happened. Youre probably right that most states didnt have a statute defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman until the series of laws defining it as such were passed, or those would have been redundant. That doesnt mean that the word marriage didnt have a clearly understood legal meaning up until the time gay marriage advocates challenged the customary practices.

            That denies the indisputable fact that the nature of marriage has been subject to constant change for centuries, including as recently as sixty years ago when mixed marriages were specifically illegal in many states because it was clearly understood that different races should not mix.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            Gay marriage advocates challenged nothing.  The laws/statutes on the books did not deny gays the right to marry, and thus they reasonably argued that they were as entitled to the full weight and power of the law as any other group.  According to the Constitution, they are absolutely correct.  And in defiance of that Constitution, the citizenry of various states are going out of their way to deprive them of those rights to which they had previously been entitled.  Its really no more complicated than that, and discussion of attempts to define chickens are irrelevant except to say this:  I know a chicken when I see it.

         <p>
          I think we have a trees forest kind of situation here. So heres a very long and boring recap:
         </p>
         <p>
          Theres a sub-group/subculture of people called gays.
         </p>
         <p>
          Gays have been fighting to be recognized as a legitimate and worthy group whose relationships are legitimate and worthy and who deserve to be treated equally both by the law and by society (not the same thing).
         </p>
         <p>
          Theres a social/legal/(sometimes)religious/partially economic institution called marriage.
         </p>
         <p>
          As part of their struggle gays claimed that since their relationships are equal to heterosexual relationships they are equally entitled to call such relationships  when reaching a certain level of commitment  marriage and equally have all the legal/social aspects of the institution of marriage.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the past the idea that gay relationships are equal to heterosexual would have been considered absurd  a strange claim by a strange  marginal group.
         </p>
         <p>
          Even today many people still feel that gay relationships are not equal to heterosexual relationships and that therefore they should not be able to form a legal/social bond of marriage.
         </p>
         <p>
          Gays and their supporters replied that their is no good reason to deny them the right to have their relationships treated as equal to heterosexual relationships. The only reason to do so is because of prejudice toward gay relationships or, more bluntly, because of bigotry.
         </p>
         <p>
          Opponents of the gay movement attempted in some cases to ensure that gay relationships will not be treated by the law as equal as heterosexual by introducing laws or amendments that will restrict marriage only to heterosexuals.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since gays were claiming an unalienable right rather than a handout or privilege, they went to the institution whose job it is to protect the legal rights of citizens  Batman, and the courts. Since courts reflect society but are not an exact reflection, and since there is large group of people who support gay marriage and a large group that doesnt, appeal to the courts sometimes worked and sometimes didnt.
         </p>
         <p>
          At times that gays did get the support of the court, their opponents used other legal methods to prevent homosexual relationships being treated as equal to heterosexual, namely prop. 8.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since attitudes toward gays and toward gay marriage are split in the US, and since up until very recently the idea of gay relationships being equal was considered absurd, and since gays are a small, dispersed, sometimes hidden segment of society, the objective of the gay rights movement was to force the issue of gay marriage into the center of public discussion (just as other movements have done in the past). Going to court was one of several methods used to achieve that. It was used in the past by the civil rights movement alongside other methods (some of which were also used by gays  using public figures, running for office, demonstrations, iconography, rioting). You can compare the success of the gay rights movement to push their issue to other movements. It seems to me it is doing well. The negative reaction from their opponents is inevitable whether they went to court or not. By going to court they force a confrontation and public discussion instead of being ignored, which is a big problem for  movements.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since they have successfully pushed this issue into the limelight, it is no surprise that the public discussion becomes heated, including name calling. Theres nothing unique about that. Political discussions are often heated. Calling their opponents bigots (or homophobes) might be blunt and even counter productive but is not avoiding the discussion, since thats exactly the point gay rights advocates are trying to make  that the only motivation for opposition to gay marriage is prejudice.
         </p>
         <p>
          Pointing out that  the same Catholic principles that were used to justify opposition to gay marriage were disregarded when Manchesters own interest, namely divorce, was on the line hardly constitutes name calling or gloating or being mean. It shows that he is insincere, and is actually motivated by prejudice toward gay relationship rather than Catholicism.
         </p>
         <p>
          
          <br/>
          &gt;I dont recall womens rights being advanced by police dogs and hoses.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was during the era of the suffragettes. Confrontation, provocation and controversy are often used by movements, sometimes it has positive and sometimes it has negative results. Sometimes both.
         </p>
         <p>
          &gt;Personally, I flipped to the pro-choice side of the abortion discussion after reading an essay in my philosophy of law class.
         </p>
         <p>
          Good for you. Essays are one tool, but used alone it would not have been a very effective tool regardless of your personal experience. This is true of other tools as well, including litigation.
         </p>
         <p>
          &gt;I think litigation actually hurt that issue; Roe killed off a womens political movement and left in its place a frothing conservative antiabortion movement. (That argument comes from an essay by then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, incidentally.)
         </p>
         <p>
          There are several issues here:
          <br/>
          1) Did Roe help give American women access to abortion?
         </p>
         <p>
          Yes.
         </p>
         <p>
          2) Did Roe help or harm womens rights?
         </p>
         <p>
          I know there was a backlash against feminism in general. But I dont know if Roe was the cause I dont know if this backlash caused any actual decline in womens rights or was just a cultural phenomena.
         </p>
         <p>
          3) Did Roe cause the rise of an anti-abortion movement?
         </p>
         <p>
          Youre assuming a lot. Youre assuming that if there was no Roe than the social change would have occurred nevertheless calmly and that people who are against abortion would have not been able to block that change and would have reacted more placidly to it than they did react to Roe. You also do not know that nor do you know how long it would have taken for change to occur on this issue or on the issue of gay marriage. As a person who is not affected by either you can promise that change will come slowly but surely out of the goodness of American hearts in the most gentle methods. But you are not the one that has to wait nor are you the one who is trying to create the change.
         </p>
         <p>
          4) Did Roe harm the womens movement?
         </p>
         <p>
          I dont know. But there is one thing that I think is true. If a movement relies too much on the courts while neglecting other methods than it looses the ability to engage both its own constituency and the public its trying to affect. It does not mean that going to courts is necessarily wrong, but since movements are often lead by lawyers and academics it sometimes happens that the movements become too caught up with law and complex intelectual theories that they loose popular influence.

            (1) With regard to the assumption Im making: yes, you correctly summarize my theory. Youre correct, I dont know that to be true, nor do I know how long that change would have taken. I do think thats true. I do that for two reasons. One is that the most consistently viable tactic used by the pro-life movement has been to attack activist judges. With regard to
            <i>
             Roe
            </i>
            , thats a ridiculously easy target because the opinion itself is so craptacular that Ive seen pro-choice legal commentators stop just short of apologizing for it. But the underlying argument seems to be that the result is inherently unfair because 9 unelected judges essentially imposed a solution on a contentious social issue. That argument goes away if the solution comes through the political branches. Its a lot harder to complain about activist legislatures, certainly at the state level. At the national level theres always a reasonable argument to be made that a government of enumerated powers has gotten its tentacles into to many pies. (In these metaphors, governments are always monsters with tentacles instead of fingers.  ) State governments are
            <i>
             supposed
            </i>
            to be governments of general jurisdiction. It is much easier for, say, NY State to pass an abortion law governing abortions within the borders of New York. And theres really no doubt that the states that are friendly to abortion rights would be so voluntarily in the absence of SCOTUS opinions. The states that fight like hell to limit abortion now would probably be closer to an outright ban in my counterfactual, so abortion rights in those states would be worse off. In your language, people who are against abortion would have been able to block the change in, say, Alabama, but not in New York or California. Its purely a value judgment, and your mileage may vary, but I think thats less bad than having a legal regime of questionable legitimacy, where the peoples ability to craft their laws is curtailed by court-ordered policy judgments. The second thing that Id argue is that history suggests that, once a policy choice is made, the nation does tend to come to accept it. Think about the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Repealing it would be unthinkable, and that became unthinkable very quickly after its passing. Compare that to the
            <i>
             Roe
            </i>
            backlash, still going strong decades after the opinion. I have to think that people are more willing to accept defeat if that defeat came about legitimately.

            (2) Your second point that I quoted that Im not the one who has to wait proves too much. Youre right, I dont have to wait to marry a loved one because my state hasnt legalized the relationship (yet). That doesnt mean I dont have an opinion on what the result of a political fight should be, or how it should be obtained. I have absolutely no problem expressing my policy preferences on political issues, even when those issues are unlikely to affect me directly. Men are entitled to weigh in on the abortion debate. White Yankees were entitled to be Freedom Riders. Straight people are entitled to offer opinions on gay marriage. Ultimately, everything does affect me, even if indirectly, because these issues affect the nation I live in, and I have a right to be heard on how that nation should be run. I say this as a pro-choice, pro-gay-marriage straight male. We won a victory on abortion rights that is difficult to justify, and we are getting clobbered fair and square on gay marriage. I have every faith that we will ultimately prevail on gay marriage, but we need to do it the right way, or we may end up with a victory that does nothing but ensure that for decades afterward there will be a loud, bitter, angry opposition with a legitimate gripe.

              You may believe that the equal protection clause of the Constitution does not apply to gay marriage. I cant for all the world see why it wouldnt. Marriage extends certain rights and privileges not available otherwise, and denying that to homosexuals denies them equal treatment under the law.

Following the victories won as the result of the civil rights movement of the 60s, we had decades of loud, bitter, angry opposition. People are always pissed off whenever there is radical social change because like Wayne and Garth, most of us fear change. No matter how the fight for gay rights is won  through the legislatures, the courts, or a wrestling match  a lot of people wont accept it. In a few decades, their attitudes will be rightly relegated to the same junkbin where we keep attitudes like those that were behind laws against mixed-race marriages.

              Basically he writes this:6 states have legalized gay marriage and the other 44 do not appear to be doing so any time soon. A perfect opportunity to see the effects. So, opponents of gay marriage, what quantitative result can we expect to see in
              <br/>
              Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire compared to the other 44 states, as a direct result of their legalization of the institution? Just give a nice simple easy to check stat. A 12% increase in divoce rates, a doubling of illegitimate births, Sandworm sightings up 72%, whatever.

              First answwer to second point:
             </p>
             <p>
              Im not saying that you have no right for an opinion on either the subject of gay rights or abortion. I would never say that, since Im a male heterosexual who is not exactly American (althoughh legally I do have the right to vote for president), because thats not my own view, and because I had this argument used on me. However, I do believe that you should be more humble before you demand from a group of people, be they blacks, gays or weomen, to live under certain unjust laws just because you dont want their struggle to offend your sensibilities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moreover, it is easy for you to look at the civil rights movement and say it was the good fight, but can you honestly say this would have been your attitude had you lived in that time. This was a fight that was done by using the willfull violation of the law (civil disobedience), the willfull confrontation with lawenforcers and civilians, it did involve appeal to the courts and to the federal government. If today we can look at it as a success both for changing the law and society itself, we have to admit that it didnt happen easily or gently, or because Americans are all nice people, but by a very fortunate combination of all these methods and others. The reason you cant reppeal the civil rights act is not because it is based on the legislature rather than the courts laws can be changed tooBut because the change that occured in American society thanks to the methods I mentioned (as well as other grander historical processes) was too strong for the push back.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Roe vs. Wade. The counterfactual you describe would have resulted in millions of American women living in certain states not having the option of abortion in their own states. We can imagine and hope that maybe 20-30 more years of Americans living like that would have resulted in a changing of opinions in those states too, or maybe not. But those 30 years would have been much harsher on them than either you or me, thats assuming it would not have gone on longer.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, while you might think that the people who oppose abortion have a legitimate claim, and they have certainly fought hard, they have failed to outlaw abortion despite the backlash and 20 years of Republican rule in the White House. Thats more than 35 years of American women having access to abortion. Moreover, have opinions during that time have more against abortion or for it? Is it now more or less accepted socially? If so, that would show that like the Civil Rights Movement what we have is social change following after the actions of the courts, not instead.

              Well, Ive said about 107 times on this blog now that I think equity does argue for extending marriage to homosexual couples. As for the argument why the equal protection
              <b>
               clause
              </b>
              doesnt apply, its often some form of originalism: the theory that the best interpretive guide of an unclear provision is the intent of the legislators who drafted or voted on the provision. Im generally not a huge fan of the theory, largely because I dont think that a group can have a single guiding intent, but it isnt a fringe argument. The smartassed answer would be that the EPC doesnt apply because the Supreme Court said it didnt, but it wouldnt be the first time SCOTUS got the 14th Amendment wrong. (Plessy v. Ferguson and the Slaughterhouse Cases come to mind.)
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              The specific legal hurdle for EPC challenges is that the Supreme Court assigned homosexuality to the lower rank of what are called protected classes, which is how the Federal courts categorize which classifications get which level of scrutiny. Race-based discrimination is subject to strict (the highest level of) scrutiny, sex-based classification is subject to intermediate scrutiny, and most other classifications, including sexual orientation, is subject to rational basis review, meaning that if the discrimination has a rational purpose, it is permissible. Using marriage to encourage procreation is reasonably likely to pass that level. Its a little over/underinclusive, meaning that gay couples with kids cant get married while infertile straight couples can, but in rational basis review, the plan doesnt have to be precisely tailored in the way it would for, say, race-based firefighter promotions. Californias Supreme Court doesnt use that sort of hierarchy, and ruled that sexual orientation discrimination is subject to the highest level of scrutiny, so close doesnt count.

              Actually, thats not the *ordinary* political process. Ordinarily, a state legislature passes a law and its the law of the land within that states borders. Or the Congress passes a law and everyone within the U.S. is bound by it. To amend the U.S. Constitution, either Congress must propose an amendment by passing a bill by a two-thirds majority in both houses and then send it to the state legislatures for ratification; or two thirds of the states must call for a Constitutional convention to propose an amendment which then must be ratified by the state legislatures (the latter route has actually never been taken). Which was my point: you have to go to *extraordinary* lengths to change the Constitution, so much so that most amendments die on the vine (thank goodness). The founding fathers wanted to ensure that we couldnt change the Constitution willy-nilly.

              <br/>
              In any event, you seem far more enamored of the details about our system of governance and missing the point of the system. The Bill of Rights was heavily influenced by, among other things, John Lockes concept of natural law. According to Locke, in our natural state we are possessed of certain rights which are not contingent upon the laws or policies of any government. The Bill of Rights was written to ensure that we would be protected from the tyrannies of both the majority and the minority, so that we could not easily be stripped of our unalienable rights. In other words, if the law doesnt recognize our unalienable rights then its the law thats in error and not the other way around.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              To echo what Micha said: you seem far more concerned about the sensibilities of the majority than you do about extending equal rights under the law to all. Yes, I know you feel youve said 700 times that you support gay marriage, but it will still ring hollow even if you say it a 701st time. Why? Because youve spent more verbiage expressing righteous indignation about how the tone of some liberals  like me  offends your sensibilities than you have about any convictions regarding gay rights.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              By assigning sexual orientation to a lower level of protected status, the SCOTUS has assigned gays to second-class status. Its the same kind of premise that underpineed the ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford  that some of us are less human than others.
              <br/>
              Ultimately, what the SCOTUS is doing is allowing people to vote on other peoples humanity. One of the things Idve hoped wed have learned over the centuries is that the majority isnt always right, and that Democracy isnt *always* about majority rule. Mostly it is  but *not* always.

              Actually Im going to agree with much of what you just said. I believe that there are many rights that we deserve by virtue of being human, and if the law does not reflect that, the law needs to be changed. Conversely, after watching California amend its constitution willy-nilly, I think we can all be grateful that the national Constitution is rather harder to monkey around with.

I may have spent more verbiage talking about the value of a reasonable tone than about the underlying morality, but isnt that to be expected? Of course I talked more about the thing we were debating than the thing we agree about. I agree with you only takes 4 words to say. Saying what I think needs to be reconsidered, and explaining why I think that, is a more involved discussion.

The whole tone argument was about preserving the political debate, which cannot exist if the contest devolves into name calling and a shouting match, as the current health care reform debacle attests. My preference for it being a political debate rather than a court-imposed settlement is because that is how I feel the system should work.

              The rule of law is about more than getting to the right answer. It is about getting to the right answer in the right way. I emphatically believe that people have natural rights, but natural right is not the basis for a legal decision in the courts. It is a moral, rather than a legal argument. Youre right that government protects minorities from the majority as often as it empowers the majority, but that system was itself adopted by the majority. American courts can only interpret laws or constitutional provisions that are democratically adopted. The Bill of Rights was adopted by the majority. (And by ordinary political process, I mean that it was enacted by vote in the means provided for by the Constitution which it was.) Courts can enforce those rights, the courts can interpret them to resolve gaps or ambiguities, but they ought

               not

              rewrite them to repair inequities. Judicial review is a wonderful tool, but one that can be abused. As difficult as the Federal Constitution is to amend, a judicial opinion can effectively end a political debate. That power should be used sparingly.

              David, I dont disbelieve you when you say youre in favor of gay marriage, so perhaps saying your convictions ring hollow was too strong a phrase. I apologize.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              I agree with you that we cannot simply cast aside the political process when it suits us; to do so could just as easily jeopardize our civil rights. I also agree with you that judicial review should be used sparingly and that judges should find meaning in the law rather than imposing meaning on the law.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              Still, I believe the equal protection clause can and should apply to gay marriage. I believe the reasoning used by the SCOTUS to determine otherwise in effect declares that homosexuals are second-class citizens. I believe judicial action with respect to gay marriage would fall within sparing use.
              <br/>
              .
              <br/>
              In a broader sense, I think we have to remember that creating social change is a messy business. Those who are against gay marriage are unwilling to be dragged out of their comfort zones. Political debate is certainly an important ingredient for effecting a societal change, but its often not enough. People who believe homosexual behavior is an offense against God (which encompasses a lot more people than just the Rev. Phelps) are unlikely to be swayed by a rational argument, just as many racists dug in their heels against integration decades ago. Protests, civil disobedience, legislation, court battles, and more are all part of the process of steering society on a new course.

              You know, if were not careful were going to end up with a purely civil and reasonable discussion. From there its dogs and cats living together peacefully, and itll just be terrible.

              I agree that people who believe homosexuality is innately sinful will rarely be convinced otherwise. Theyll just have to be outvoted.

              didnt make homosexuals second class citizens. Theyre still entitled to all of the rights of citizens, including equal protection law. If a gay citizen is denied a benefit based on his sex or race, he has the same rights as a straight citizen. It just means that classification along that one axis, sexual orientation, isnt subject to the same level of scrutiny as racial classifications. It is still reviewed, and bear in mind that
              <i>
               Romer

              was a step in the right direction, from sexual orientation discrimination being completely unregulated.

              <br/>
              My whole problem with the courts involving themselves in marriage itself is because its such a fundamental social institution. Contrary to what PAD said the other day, marriage did have a clearly understood definition, and two people of the same sex living together wasnt it. I strongly believe that redefining that institution is a policy decision, not a straightforward application of equal protection law, and should be handled by the political branches rather than the courts.

              One other thing I think should be pointed out (and its nice that we seem to arriving at a nice thought out discourse here), while I think most people who call anti-gay marriage supporters are thinking of folks like Fred Phelps and Pat Buchanan, they are also talking about President Obama, who, for all his good points, is less progressive on this issue than Dick freaking Cheney.

          OK, a few more thoughts before I go move all of my earthly possessions into a new house, and these are specifically for those who still oppose gay marriage:
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Some of you think homosexuality is an offense against God. As Ive said, if you dont want the government interfering in your religious beliefs its best not to impose your faith on others. Once you open the door to government interference in religion, everyones religious freedom is threatened including your own.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          As for the argument that gay marriage will devalue straight marriage, do you really believe that straight people will be less likely to marry just because gay people can? Or less likely to honor their vows because of gay marriage? One has nothing to do with the other.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Finally, if youre offended by the word bigot because you have nothing against gays *but* you dont believe they have the right to marry, think about this: many people believed they had nothing against blacks *but* didnt want them in their neighborhood, or marrying whites, or whatever. Theres always a form of prejudice or unfair bias hiding within that word but. If you oppose gay marriage, youre implicitly judging that gay relationships are on some level not the equal of straight relationships and that inequality should be codified in the law. You cant have it both ways. Either you believe homosexuals deserve equal rights or you dont.
          <br/>
          .
          <br/>
          Finally, and most important, think about every other societal change that has run into opposition: the abolition of slavery, womens suffrage, the repeal of Jim Crow laws, etc. In every case, the opposition always declares that this or that change in the social fabric will cause the nation to go to hell in a handbasket and it never does. If history is any guide, its highly unlikely that allowing gay marriage will be the one time that the sky is falling crowd will be right. Under these circumstances wouldnt you rather place your bet on embracing legal equality for all people?

            You make a lot of valid points, Bill.  Theyre the sort of points that opponents of gay marriage usually avoid by dropping back ten yards and declaring that the Bible says gays are evil, and therefore everything else is moot.

            <br/>
            I tend to liken this to the whole Coolio/Weird Al situation a few years ago.  Coolio had a song that wad deeply personal for him (Gangsters Paradise) For him, it was special and unique and was meant to stand for something. Weird Al comes along a makes a parody (Amish Paradise).
            <br/>
            Coolio thinks Gangter is the REAL song, Amish is the perversion.
            <br/>
            Al doesnt see it as a perversion.  He doesnt mean any harm by it.  He wants to enjoy the music in a way that suits him, his personality, and his tastes.
            <br/>
            Coolio may very well think that the mere presence of the Weird Al version detracts from the power and importance of his own. Who knows, to a limited extent, he may be right?  Now, whenever Gangsters Paradise is plays, people are reminded of the amish version.
            <br/>
            Both versions have their fans. Both enjoyed for different reasons.
            <br/>
            I sort of lost where I was going with this, and I ams ure someone will be glad to point out where my analofy fails, but I guess what I am trying to say is that I can sort of understand why someone who feels deeply about something (whether it be what defines marriage, , or which version of a song is better) can feel that a variation on the original can devalue it.

              As I recall reading, Weird Al gets permission before he parodies a song. He had Coolios permission. Therefore, Coolio has nothing to complain about. To say that he thinks his version is the definitive version, and not Weird Als is simply saying water is wet.

              There was actually some sort of mixup about that, Alan  if memory serves, Al thought Coolios people had given permission and Coolio thought otherwise.  So there was some sort of glitch there  but youre right overall that he gets permission, even though from what I know of the law he doesnt have to.

              From what Ive read, Coolios people DID give permission, but Coolio didnt know about it until the release.  Thats why Al now goes right to the performer for permissions first.

          With regards to those who claim that by speaking out firmly against those who are intolerant  by the simple act of CALLING them intolerant  we are, ourselves, being intolerant of their views, I quote Karl Popper in his work, The Open Society and its Enemies:
         </p>
         <p>
          Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterances of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary, even by force; for it may turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers from listening to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

          Those who oppose gay marriage, whatever their reasoning, are intolerant. They are actively seeking to deny an entire grouping of their fellow humans the right afforded to all other groupings.  This is intolerant and it is bigoted  no matter their proclaimed reasoning  and I am not afraid to call them on it, nor am I afraid to tell them they where they can stick their intolerance and bigotry.
         </p>
         <p>
          To paraphrase Oliver Wendell Holmes, the right of others to be offended by my marriage to another man ends where my right to be married to someone I love begins.
         </p>
         <p>
          So go, PAD, keep pointing out the hypocrisy and bigotry of those who oppose what should be common sense: the very human, very AMERICAN, right to marry the person you love, regardless of gender.

            Arent you sort of fighting a straw man here? I dont recall anyone actually objecting to people speaking out firmly on the issue of intolerance. I do recall making the argument that if your only mode of speaking out is to label another person a bigot, without actually discussing the issue, youre really not engaging in speaking at all.
            <br/>
            .
            <br/>
            The rest of your argument frankly scares me. You say the right of others to be offended ends so were telling people how to think now, are we? You literally just said that someone doesnt have the right to hold a particular opinion. Not just denying the right to act on that opinion, but the right to hold it. Please, please tell me you let your rhetoric get away from you.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            As for Mr Poppers argument that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside of the law, fortunately that theory is, itself, outside the law. Ordinarily Im not a huge fan of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr, but on free speech he usually had it right. Persecution for the expression of opinions seems to me perfectly logical. If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes in law and sweep away all opposition. To allow opposition by speech seems to indicate that you think the speech impotent, as when a man says that he has squared the circle, or that you do not care whole heartedly for the result, or that you doubt either your power or your premises. But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution. It is an experiment, as all life is an experiment. Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge. While that experiment is part of our system I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.

            The issue isnt that were convinced that Rev. Phelps has anything useful to contribute to the discussion. He probably isnt particularly interested in discussing anything to begin with. The issue is that you, or I, or PAD, or the Human Rights Campaign, have no more
            <i>
             right
            </i>
            to shut up Phelps than he does to shut up any of us. Its not about whos right. Judgment of the Red Scare in the 1950s is negative not because the Communists were right they werent but because its the intolerance of intolerant people that was unAmerican. Theres no one in the past 50 years that was more intolerant than Communist nations, and the Communist Party of the US wanted to bring that level of nightmare to our shores. They were
            <i>
             still
            </i>
            entitled to make the argument, to run for office, because thats how our nation works. Shouting bigot at someone is no different from shouting Commie its a poor substitute for argument.

            You should absolutely point out the hypocrisy and bigotry of your opponents. But you should do that by explaining why theyre wrong, by competing in the marketplace of ideas, and most specifically by putting forward your product in that marketplace of ideas known as an election.

          I must also admit, I would like to see an answer to the question posed in the post-SDCC thread (where Shadow Complex was mentioned) at the end of the thread, as it never saw a response. Ill just copy &amp; paste that posting again here:

          Peter, did you have any reservations about adapting the work of Orson Scott Card on Shadow Complex? I ask because youre one of the most outspoken creators on an issue of which he seems to be firmly on the opposite side. Also, my liberal guilt may keep me from playing the game and it looks really cool.

            No, no reservations.  The ideas that were adapted for Shadow Complex involved extremist political assholes trying to bring down the government and the good guys stopping them from doing so.  I dont really have a problem with that.

            Nor does the game have anything to do with gays, gay marriage, gay equality, gay abandon, nose gays, etc.  All its about is a game.  I have no more reason to avoid contact with Shadow Complex because Card hates gays than I do to refuse to visit Cooperstown because Ty Cobb was a racist.
