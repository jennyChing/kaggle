             may have actually played  only a minor role in the housing meltdown, new research reveals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some  people claim that high mortgage default rates which helped crash the economy in  2008 were the fault of predatory lenders who approved risky housing loans to  unqualified buyers.
            </p>
            <p>
             But  a study of an anti-predatory lending program in Chicago found that the program brought  down default rates only modestly, while causing major disruptions in the  market.

             Ben-David  and his colleagues analyzed the effects of a pilot anti-predatory lending  program, passed by the Illinois legislature, which was implemented in Chicago  in 2006, near the peak of the housing boom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under  the program, certain mortgage applicants with low credit scores, as well as  those who applied for risky loans, were required to submit their loan offers  for review by financial counselors. The  counselors identified loans that had above-market interest rates, loans that  appeared to be unaffordable based on the borrowers financial situations and  loans that had indications of fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  belief was that these counselors could steer applicants away from unsuitable  loans, although applicants did not have to follow the advice they received.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  program was implemented in 10 zip codes in the Chicago area. The researchers compared loan applications in  those areas to those that originated in 10 zip codes which had similar  demographic characteristics, but where the program was not in effect.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  program had a huge impact on mortgage loans in the affected areas, Ben-David  said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  number of mortgage loans that originated in the program area dropped by nearly  half, mainly because lenders specializing in risky loans left the area.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many  lenders decided they just didnt want to deal with the new regulations and  exited the market, Ben-David said. Many of these lenders had some  characteristics that could be tied to predatory lending.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  loans that were issued in the program area were less likely to feature risky  characteristics, as defined by the legislation, and tended to go to borrowers  with higher credit ratings.
            </p>
            <p>
             But  the key finding of the study was that default rates declined only modestly as a  result of this program. The default rate  in the communities served by the new program fell from 27 percent to about 20  to 21 percent.

             A  default rate of 20 percent is still quite high.  Our findings suggest that predatory lending was responsible for only  about a quarter of mortgage defaults in the targeted area, Ben-David said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  problem, Ben-David said, was that the program helped drive out bad lenders, but  not bad loans.
            </p>
            <p>
             They  eliminated predatory loans, but not reckless loans, he said. People still bought homes that they couldnt  afford and lenders were still willing to approve their mortgages.
            </p>
            <p>
             The  pilot program was supposed to last four years, but was ended after just four  months because of strong opposition, not only from people in the real estate  industry, but also from local residents and community leaders who were supposed  to be helped from the law.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many  people saw the law as infringing on their right to pursue the American dream of  homeownership, Ben-David said.
            </p>
            <p>
             In  the end, the program had good intentions but came at a very high cost for the  limited benefits it provided, Ben-David said.
