    ABSTRACT.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Objective.
   </em>
   To identify neurobehavioral effects of prenatal marijuana exposure
on neonates in rural Jamaica.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Design.
   </em>
   Ethnographic field studies and standardized neurobehavior assessments
during the neonatal period.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Setting.
   </em>
   Rural Jamaica in heavy-marijuana-using population.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Participants.
   </em>
   Twenty-four Jamaican neonates exposed to marijuana prenatally
and 20 nonexposed neonates.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Measurements and main results.
   </em>
   Exposed and nonexposed neonates were compared
at 3 days and 1 month old, using the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale, including
supplementary items to capture possible subtle effects. There were no significant
differences between exposed and nonexposed neonates on day 3. At 1 month, the exposed
neonates showed better physiological stability and required less examiner facilitation to
reach organized states. The neonates of heavy-marijuana-using mothers had better scores on
autonomic stability, quality of alertness, irritability, and self-regulation and were
judged to be more rewarding for caregivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    Conclusions.
   </em>
   The absence of any differences between the exposed on nonexposed
groups in the early neonatal period suggest that the better scores of exposed neonates at
1 month are traceable to the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics
of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal
development.

   The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of marijuana (or
"ganja" as it is called in Jamaica) consumption during pregnancy and lactation
on offspring during the neonatal period. Despite the prevalence of marijuana use among
women of childbearing age,
   <a href="#1">
    1-3
   </a>
   reports on the behavioral teratogenic
effects of prenatal marijuana exposure have been conflicting and inconclusive. Fried and
Makin,
   <a href="#4">
    4
   </a>
   for example, found that moderate levels of marijuana use in
their middle-class Ottawa sample (7.0 joints per week) were associated with poorer
habituation to light, higher levels of irritability, and increased tremors and startles as
assessed by the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) between the third
and sixth days of life. Tennes et al,
   <a href="#5">
    5
   </a>
   on the other hand, found no
relationship between exposure to marijuana and the neonates' behavior as rated by the
NBAS. Similarly, a recent study of 373 lower socioeconomic status (SES) mothers and their
neonates by Richardson and colleagues
   <a href="#6">
    6
   </a>
   found no relationship between
moderate levels of marijuana use during pregnancy and neonate behavior on the NBAS on the
second day of life. Yet Chasnoff,
   <a href="#7">
    7
   </a>
   lending support to Fried's findings,
observed that marijuana use during pregnancy made a significant contribution to variance
in the Brazelton State Regulation cluster scores, including habituation, in neonates a few
days of age.
  </p>
  <p>
   More recently, Coles et al,
   <a href="#8">
    8
   </a>
   studied the effects of maternal drug use
on the neurobehavioral status of 107 neonates and found maternal marijuana use had
depressed effects on the Orientation cluster of the NBAS at 14 days and on the Range of
State cluster at the end of the first month. The interaction of marijuana use and cocaine
and alcohol, however, was responsible for significant amounts of the variance in neonate
behaviors over the first month of life. Nevertheless, they concluded that although the
influence of drug and alcohol exposure could be noted statistically, the effects on
neonate behavior were small and behavior was not clinically aberrant.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is likely that many of conflicting results among published studies on the effects of
prenatal drug exposure are due to methodological problems in (1) the measurement of
neonatal outcomes and (2) the context in which the research is conducted. With the
exception of the analysis of cries of neonates in Jamaica
   <a href="#9">
    9
   </a>
   and the work
of Scher et al
   <a href="#10">
    10
   </a>
   and Dahl et al
   <a href="#11">
    11
   </a>
   that demonstrated
altered sleep cycling and motility among North American neonates, most research has used
the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale as an outcome measure in examining the
effects of prenatal drug exposure. Inconsistencies in the use of the scale, however, have
included the timing of the administration, the degree to which examiners were trained to
reliability,
   <a href="#12">
    12
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#13">
    13
   </a>
   and the approach to data reduction
and analysis. Perhaps most important, only the 28 neurobehavioral items on the NBAS have
been used in any analysis to date. Although supplementary items were added to the second
edition of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale
   <a href="#12">
    12
   </a>
   to be
used with high-risk or fragile neonates, the items have not yet been employed in any
published study of the effects of in utero drug exposure. This may mean that the more
subtle differences that could distinguish marijuana-exposed neonates simply may not have
emerged in the traditional scoring schemes and neurobehavioral cluster analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
   With regard to the research context, it should be noted that virtually all the studies
of prenatal exposure have been conducted in the United Sates and Canada where marijuana
use is primarily recreational. This is in marked contrast to other societies, such as
Jamaica, where scientific reports have documented the cultural integration of marijuana
and its ritual and medicinal as well as recreational functions.
   <a href="#14">
    14
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#15">
    15
   </a>
   Previous studies have had difficulty controlling possible confounding
effects of factors such as polydrug use, antenatal care, mothers' nutritional status,
maternal age, SES and social support, as well as the effects of different caretaking
environments, which could lead to differences in neonate behavior.
   <a href="#8">

   <a href="#16">
    16
   </a>
   The legal and social sanctions associated with illicit drug use often
compromise self-report data and render it almost impossible to obtain accurate prenatal
exposure levels.
   <a href="#17">

   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Jamaican perinatal marijuana study provides a unique opportunity to address several
of these methodological issues. First, although the study employed the NBAS to assure
comparability with other studies, it was assumed that the full-term scale might not be
sensitive to less obvious effects of risk status. Because the effects of marijuana were
expected to be subtle,
   <a href="#4">
    4
   </a>
   and because the results of studies using the
NBAS to examine the effects of substance abuse on neonatal behavior have been
inconclusive,
   <a href="#6">
    6
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#8">
    8
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#16">
    16
   </a>
   the new
supplementary items were administered to better capture the more latent effects of
maternal marijuana use on neonatal behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Jamaica the use of marijuana is culturally integrated and governed by social rules
that guide consumption and distribution and inhibit abuse.
   <a href="#14">
    14
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#15">
    15
   </a>
   Because the cultural meanings that attend marijuana use and users have
been documented to influence the outcomes of consumption,
   <a href="#14">
    14
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#18">
    18
   </a>
   the Jamaican study permits cross-cultural scrutiny of the concepts and
assumptions formulated in Eurocentric cultures. Also unlike the United States and Canada
where polydrug use prevails, marijuana use by women in Jamaica has been relatively
uncontaminated by other drugs; even alcohol and tobacco are used only minimally by women.

   Furthermore, conducting the study in one rural parish (county) provided an opportunity to
compare users and nonusers who are drawn from the same population in which there is little
variation in such factors as nutrition and prenatal care. Finally, field workers resided
in the communities and developed long-term, trusting relationships with participants. This
enhanced the credibility of self-reports of consumption and permitted confirmation by
direct observations of marijuana-linked behavior.

   Previously reported findings from this study suggested a biological vulnerability
associated with prenatal exposure to marijuana in the immediate postnatal period.

   This paper explores the influence of the cultural context of caregiving by
evaluating the infants both at the beginning and the end of the neonatal period with
assessment measures specifically designed to capture the subtle effects of maternal
marijuana use on neonatal behavior.

   <strong>
    CULTURAL CONTEXT
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   This project was based in the southeastern part of Jamaica in which there is a
well-known and documented widespread use of marijuana.
   <a href="#19">
    19
   </a>
   Consistent
with the working class throughout Jamaica, residents in the rural communities from which
the sample for this study is drawn view marijuana not only as a recreational drug but one
that also has ritual and medicinal value. Rastafarians, members of a political-religious
movement that endorses marijuana as a sacred substance, may smoke ritually on a daily
basis. Marijuana also is known for its therapeutic and health-promoting functions. It is
consumed as a tea by family members of all ages for a variety of illnesses and to maintain
and promote health.
   <a href="#14">
    14
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#15">
    15
   </a>
   Although the consumption of
marijuana tea transcends class, age, and gender divisions, marijuana smoking traditionally
has been an adult male, working class activity.
   <a href="#14">
    14
   </a>
   ,
   <a href="#15">
    15
   </a>
   The female marijuana smoker was a rarity and the few women who engaged in smoking were
considered base and undignified and often held in contempt by both men and women. Instead,
women prepared marijuana for themselves and their families in the form of teas and tonics.
  </p>
  <p>
   More recently, however, increasing numbers of women have begun to smoke marijuana
regularly.
   <a href="#20">
    20
   </a>
   To some extent, this was attributed to the increasing
participation of women in Rastafarianism, but the practice has spread to nonRastafarian
women as well. Not only are such women now grudgingly tolerated by their communities, many
of the heavy-marijuana-users, particularly if they were Rastafarians, have been given the
commendatory title of "Roots Daughter." Roots Daughters are described as women
"with a purpose," who can "think, reason and smoke like a man" and who
are self-reliant and dignified. They smoke marijuana on a daily basis, in a manner not
unlike that of their male counterparts, and continue to smoke during pregnancy and the
breast-feeding period.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although marijuana use during pregnancy is discouraged in prenatal clinics and through
government-sponsered prevention programs, the consumption of marijuana during pregnancy by
Jamaican women is not necessarily indicative of a mother's lack of concern about the
health and development of her infant. Supported by the folk belief that marijuana has
health-rendering properties and by the experience of relatives and neighbors, women use it
as a vehicle for dealing with the difficult circumstances surrounding pregnancy and
childbirth. For instance, 19 of the marijuana smokers in the sample reported that it
increased their appetites throughout the prenatal period and / or relieved the nausea of
pregnancy. Fifteen reported using it to relieve fatigue and provide rest during pregnancy.
All the mothers considered the effects of marijuana on nausea and fatigue to be good for
both themselves and their infants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The responsibilities that accompany pregnancy and infant care in an unyielding economic
environment are not trivial. The multigravidas, in particular, reported that the feelings
of depression and desperation attending motherhood in their impoverished communities were
alleviated by both social and private smoking. Despite these reports of the benefits of
marijuana to both mother and baby, the women who smoke marijuana with any regularity
continue to be in the minority. Most women in Jamaica refrain from smoking the substance
and those who do smoke marijuana represent a departure from the norms regarding standard
female behavior.

   <strong>
    METHOD
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   An ethnographic design, combining community and household naturalistic observations and
interviews of 60 women with standardized testing of their neonates using the NBAS, was
employed. With the assistance of local midwives, the field workers identified and
recruited pregnant women who used marijuana until a sample of 30 was obtained. After each
participant agreed to participate and informed consent was obtained, she was then matched
(again, with the assistance of local midwives) with a gravid woman who did not use
marijuana, according to age, parity, and SES. The study was fully explained to both the
marijuana users and the companion group and none refused to participate. During the course
of the study, three of the mothers designated as nonusers were discovered to be tea
drinkers and were transferred to the users category, resulting in a sample of 33 users and
27 nonusers. Further losses to the sample include two spontaneous abortions in the users
category and one stillbirth and a preterm in the nonuser category, yielding a maternal
sample of 31 users and 25 nonusers. Social, medical, and obstetrical histories were
determined via maternal interviews. Naturalistic observations of the women in their homes
and communities were conducted by the field workers who maintained routine contact with
the participants throughout the prenatal period. Data concerning labor and delivery and
the status of the neonate, details of labor, any anomalies or complications, birth weight,
and length of gestation were abstracted from hospital records for each birth event.
  </p>
  <p>
   The sample was drawn from the vast category of "rural poor," which constitute
the majority of the population of this region of Jamaica. The two groups were matched for
SES, based on income and employment, parity (0 to 8 for both smokers and nonsmokers) and
age . The 60 women ranged in age from 15 to 42 and all were of Afro-Jamaican descent. None
were gainfully employed in permanent jobs although many worked occasionally outside their
homes as agricultural or domestic laborers or as "higglers" (vendors). Only one
of the women was legally married, although more than half of the women were living in a
more or less permanent common-law arrangement with their infant's father. Three of the
women were members of a Rastafarian sect and lived in a communal "Rasta Camp."
All had regular prenatal care from at least the second trimester to birth. The use of
alcohol and tobacco was minimal in both groups and did not exceed 3 beers or 15 tobacco
cigarettes per week for any of the women in the study. Based on self reports, reports of
community residents and direct observations by field workers, the group of marijuana-using
mothers was further designated as "light," "moderate," or
"heavy" users, depending on the frequency the amount of use. Light users were
defined as those women who consumed marijuana tea only or smoked infrequently, averaging
less than 10 cigarettes per week. Moderate users were those women who smoked 3 or more
days a week, averaging between 11 and 20 marijuana cigarettes. Heavy users smoked daily,
usually more than 21 marijuana cigarettes per week. Many moderate and heavy users also
were regular marijuana tea drinkers. Although it was not by design, the user group was
divided into almost equal categories of heavy (n = 10), moderate (n = 9), and light (n =
12).
  </p>
  <p>
   Although the sample was matched on three major variables, the social histories revealed
subtle and unanticipated differences both within the using group and between the two
groups. First, as a group, the heavy users had the highest level of education. All the
heavy users had had some schooling beyond the primary school level and three had had some
post secondary training. Although SES was a matching variable in the selection of the
sample, the roots daughters (heavy-marijuana-users) were distinguishable by the source of
support. None relied exclusively on the father of the study child for support whereas most
of the sample was either solely or heavily dependent on their infant's father. Although
none of the women in the sample was routinely employed, the alternative sources of income
for the roots included their own cash-generating activities such as running an illegal
gambling operation or selling marijuana, remittances from relatives living abroad, support
from parents or from former mates in the form of cash, food, housing, clothing and/or
child care, and for the three Rastafarian women, housing and food in a communal living
arrangement. The heavy-marijuana-users did not have more income and status than the other
women, but they did have more control over how they acquired and spent their resources.
Closely linked to this greater economic independence is the lower level of conjugal
stability among users compared with nonusers. Because they did not rely on male support,
they were relatively free to separate and form new relationships if their current
relationship was not to their liking.
   <a href="#21">
    21
   </a>
   Among the women using marijuana
heavily, only 48% were in common-law unions compared with 71% of the nonusing women. Among
the 10 heavy-marijuana-users, only 3 lived in more or less permanent, co-residential
relationships with the fathers of their infants. The remaining seven maintained their own
households, although 3 were visited regularly by their infant's father.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Newborn Assessments
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The newborn assessments were administered in the hospital on the first and third days
and at 1 month of the newborn's life in the hospital maternity ward. To keep the
conditions of birth as comparable as possible, only those newborns who were born in the
hospital and remained there for 3 days were included in the analysis. Therefore, although
the maternal sample was 31 users and 25 nonusers the newborn sample was reduced to 24
exposed and 20 nonexposed newborns.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Jamaican examiner, who was blind to the neonates group assignment, was a registered
nurse who had worked for several years on the maternity unit and was trained by the Child
Development Unit Harvard Medical School both to the .90 reliability criterion and to
administer the NBAS supplementary items.
   <a href="#12">
    12
   </a>
   Three examination data
collection points were used to embrace the entire neonatal period: 1 day, 3 days, and 1
month. Given the great disparity within the sample regarding the timing and place of
birth, the day assessments were omitted from the analysis because of possible differences
in recovery time, in keeping with the recommendations of the NBAS manual.
   <a href="#12">
    12
   </a>
   Based on the developmental assumptions underlying the NBAS,
   <a href="#13">
    13
   </a>
   the
assessment of neonate behavior at the end of the first month also can provide a functional
assessment of the effects of the caregiving environment on neonate behavior. The Brazelton
scores at the end of the first month, therefore, can be interpreted not only in terms of
direct marijuana effects but also as a result of the effects of the environment on
behavior.
   <a href="#12">
    12
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   The supplementary items assess behavior such as the quality of the neonate's attention
or the cost of this level of responsivity to the neonate's physiological or motor system.
The supplementary items also assess the extent of examiner effort that may be necessary to
facilitate the neonate's performance. This, in turn, may be a critical area that
differentiates the fragile neonate, who has difficulty in coping with the demands of the
examination, from the less stressed, healthy neonate. These additional supplementary items
also identify the threshold of responsivity in neonates and the degree to which they are
vulnerable to external environmental stimulation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quality of Alert Responsiveness is an assessment of the overall capacity of the neonate
to respond to both human and nonhuman stimuli. Cost of Attention describes the degree to
which the neonate's motor, state, and physiological systems are stressed or compromised as
the neonate interacts with the environment. Examiner Persistence is a measure of the
amount of examiner facilitation that is necessary to enable the neonate to maintain
homeostasis or to be able to respond optimally to the challenges of the examination.
General irritability is an extension of the irritability item in the Scale proper and
describes the overall amount of fussing or crying during the course of the examination.
The Robustness and Endurance item assesses the degree to which neonates become exhausted
or stressed during the course of the assessment or the extent to which their
"energy" resources enable them to organize or recover in the face of stress. The
Regulatory Capacity score is an index of the strength of the regulatory system and of the
neonate's ability to self-regulate. State Regulation provides a measure of the range of
the neonate's six states and the degree to which the states are robust and stable and
contribute to the overall organization of the neonate. Balance of Motor Tone Examines the
consistency of motor tone throughout the body and is demonstrated by the balance between
the flexor and extensor motor groups. The final item, Reinforcement Value of the Infant's
Behavior, is a measure of the examiner's reaction to the neonate and a clinical rating of
the degree to which the neonate was easy or difficult to manage through the course of the
examination. Of these nine items, only Regulation of State and the Cost of Attention items
were not scored. On the basis of the individual item scores, each subject was assigned a
score for each of the seven clusters, and a score for each of the seven summary
supplementary items.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the analysis of the NBAS data, the 3-day and 1-month individual scores were reduced
to the seven clusters described by Lester et al.
   <a href="#22">
    22
   </a>
   These clusters and
the supplementary items were used as dependent measures in the subsequent analyses. The
clusters are Habituation, Orientation, Motor Organization. Range of State, Regulation of
State, Autonomic Regulation, and the number of Abnormal Reflexes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The groups were first dichotomized into marijuana-exposed versus nonexposed and, using
SPSS-X statistical software,The tests were performed to compare the performance of these
neonates on the NBAS clusters and on the supplementary items. Because the neonates of the
heavy users received the most frequent and consistent exposure both prenatally and during
the first month of life they served as the "extreme" cases in which to search
for specific developmental and behavioral effects. To examine these effects, the scores of
the neonates of heavy-marijuana-using and neonates of nonusing mothers were also compared
using t tests.

   <strong>
    RESULTS
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The course of the pregnancies were similar in each group and the two groups of neonates
were not significantly different according to physical examination data, including birth
weight and length and gestational age.
   <a href="#23">
    23
   </a>
   Because Apgar scores were not
recorded by hospital nurses at standard time intervals, they were less reliable.
Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in the Apgar scores between the two
groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    t
   </em>
   tests were used to compare the performance of neonates of users (n = 24) and
nonusers (n = 20 on the NBAS cluster scores and on the supplementary items on the third
day of life.
   <a href="#table1">
    Table 1
   </a>
   shows that there were no significant
differences on the seven clusters. There also were no differences on the seven
supplementary items. To examine the degree to which heavy marijuana use may have an effect
on neurobehavioral outcome, we then compared the performance of the heavily exposed and
nonexposed neonates on the NBAS on day 3, by examining group differences on the seven
Brazelton cluster scores and on the supplementary items scores. As
   <a href="#table2">
    Table
2
   </a>
   reveals, there were no significant differences in performance on the Brazelton
cluster scores on day 3. Similarly, no differences were found on the supplementary item
summary scores.
  </p>
  <p>
   At 1 month, however, comparisons between exposed and nonexposed neonates revealed that
the neonates of using mothers had significantly higher scores on the Autonomic and Reflex
clusters of the NBAS (see
   <a href="#table3">
    Table 3
   </a>
   ). On the supplementary items,
these neonates scored higher (were less irritable) on the General Irritability item.
  </p>
  <p>
   Comparing the heavily exposed and the nonexposed infants, the Brazelton clusters on day
30, showed that the offspring of heavy-marijuana using mothers had significantly higher
scores on the Orientation cluster, on the Autonomic Stability cluster, and on Reflexes
(see
   <a href="#table4">
    Table 4
   </a>
   ). Due to the intercorrelation among the variables
comprising each cluster, no
   <em>
    t
   </em>
   scores or
   <em>
    P
   </em>
   values are reported for
individual items. Nevertheless, a comparison of individual item scores showed that
neonates of heavy users had higher scores on habituation to auditory and tactile stimuli,
and to animate auditory stimuli, the degree of alertness, capacity for consolability,
irritability (ie, less irritable), and had fewer startles and tremors. The comparisons on
the supplementary items revealed significant differences on all seven variables, with the
neonates of mothers who were heavy-marijuana users performing more optimally on these
items.

   <strong>
    DISCUSSION
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Although no positive or negative neurobehavioral effects of prenatal exposure were
found at 3 days of life using the Brazelton examination, there were significant
differences between the exposed and nonexposed neonates at the end of the first month.
Comparing the two groups, the neonates of mothers who used marijuana showed better
physiological stability at 1 month and required less examiner facilitation to reach an
organized state and become available for social stimulation. The results of the comparison
of neonates of the heavy-marijuana-using mothers and those of the nonusing mothers were
even more striking. The heavily exposed neonates were more socially responsive and were
more autonomically stable at 30 days than their matched counterparts. The quality of their
alertness was higher; their motor and autonomic systems were more robust; they were less
irritable; they were less likely to demonstrate any imbalance of tone; they needed less
examiner facilitation to become organized; they had better self-regulation; and were
judged to be more rewarding for caregivers than the neonates of nonusing mothers at 1
month of age.

  in the immediate postnatal period that was not evident in the supplementary item results of this study. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the Brazelton supplementary items, conducted under more controlled conditions, simply provided a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of the neonates' neurobehavioral status. It also is possible that the social effects
  <a href="#25">
   25
  </a>
  of the neonate's cry characteristics may even have elicited a quality of caregiver responses that could contribute to better outcomes at 1 month. It should be pointed out that Coles et al
  <a href="#8">
   8
  </a>
  also reported more significant differences at 1 month on the Brazelton Scale clusters than at earlier assessments, suggesting environmental effects. In this case, the direction of the differences in performance on the Brazelton examination between 3 days and 1 month suggest not only that the environment may be more influential than prenatal exposure in predicting outcomes but that the environment of the exposed group may be superior to that of the nonexposed group.
  <p>
   Conventional wisdom would suggest that mothers who are long-term marijuana users are
less likely to create optimal caregiving environments for their neonates. In this area of
rural Jamaica, however, where marijuana is culturally integrated, and where heavy use of
the substance by women is associated with a higher level of education and greater
financial independence, it seems that roots daughters have the capacity to create a
postnatal environment that is supportive of neonatal development. Indeed, Pearson's
correlations, performed determine whether there was an association between the mother's
education and neonatal outcomes at 1 month, revealed that maternal education was
significantly correlated with the Autonomic cluster at 1 month (
   <em>
    r
   </em>
   = .27,
   <em>
    P
   </em>
   = .031) and approached significance with all the supplementary items.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although it is tempting to explain the 1-month outcomes by simply appealing to the
correlation evidence linking performance to maternal characteristics, the question remains
as to how these characteristics are translated to the formation of a better environment
for neonatal development, particularly given the higher level of conjugal instability
among users. Ethnographic observations of the postnatal environments identified that,
despite the higher level of single mother households among the users, they had fewer
children at home and thus fewer child care responsibilities compared with their nonusing
counterparts. They also had more adults living in their households. Pearson's correlations
revealed that the household child / adult ratio was significantly correlated with the
Habituation clusters at 1 month (
   <em>
    P
   </em>
   = .046,
   <em>
    r
   </em>
   = .30) and with later child
development outcomes.
   <a href="#21">
    21
   </a>
   Although the exact mechanism linking child /
adult ratio to 1 month outcomes requires further delineation, it is possible that with
more adults present to assist the mother and respond to the neonate and / or with fewer
children to compete for attention, the mother is better equipped to facilitate the
neonate's interaction with his / her environment. The lower child / adult household ratios
and the mother's characteristics are not unrelated. The dispersal or outplacement of older
children to their respective father's households as a new child is brought in is a common
practice, facilitated by the pattern of serial mating in which the using mothers are more
likely to engage. Thus, in this Jamaican rural working class context, conjugal instability
is associated with greater rather than diminished access to the resources that influence
child development.

  has identified the importance of understanding the cultural context of drug use to explain outcomes. Whether or not the effects of marijuana during the prenatal period are real or only perceived, it is clear that for them, it has at least symbolic value in assisting them through the physical, social, and psychological difficulties of pregnancy and the postnatal experience. Furthermore, unlike the United States, in which heavy marijuana use often is associated with maternal incompetence and a suboptimal caregiving environment, the data from this study indicate that in Jamaica, the heavy-marijuana-using mother's education, independence, and greater access to resources converge in a constellation of maternal competence and a supportive context for neonatal development.

    Strengths and Limitations
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   It should be noted that there are several limitations posed by this study and caution
must be used in interpreting the results. First, the means by which the study participants
were recruited may have introduced a bias in the sample. Second, the sample size is small,
obviating the use statistical procedures that might be able to account for the many
environmental variables that seem to influence some of the outcomes. Third, in a
prospective study of this nature it is impossible to foresee and control for all the
potential environmental and maternal confounders. Finally, this study has not eliminated
alternative explanations. It is possible for example, that the outcomes at 1 month are
related to neonatal exposure to marijuana constituents via breast milk or to prenatal
influences that simply were not manifested at the 3-day examination.
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, the prospective design, using ethnographic techniques and inductive
analyses, offers several advantages to the exploration of prenatal exposure to illicit
drugs. First, given the difficulties encountered in recruiting participants who are
engaging in an illegal activity and then retrieving credible data from them,
identification by fieldworkers, with assistance from local midwives, represented a
contributive alternative to a random sampling strategy. Second, although the sample size
is small, it provided an opportunity to follow up drug-using women through pregnancy with
the level of detail that often is lacking in retrospective studies of large numbers of
women. Finally, the effects of prenatal exposure to drugs such as marijuana depend on
several factors for which it is difficult and sometimes impossible to control in most
clinical investigations.

   Although this study was successful in
controlling for polydrug use and SES, other variables (financial independence, mothers
education, and household child / adult ratio) emerged as meaningful during the course of
this study. Indeed a strength of the inductive design is its capacity to identify such
unanticipated variables and to understand how they are linked in Jamaican culture with
heavy marijuana use and a roots daughter syndrome. Although some might interpret this
failure to identify the relevant variables at the outset of the study and control for them
in a more experimental design as a weakness of the study, one could argue, conversely,
that the project's greatest value is its capacity for discovery and the generation of
hypotheses and research questions that can be explored in subsequent studies.
