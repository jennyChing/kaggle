      Judi and her husband live in Fort Pierce, Florida, where their lives are controlled by their four Scottish Folds, AKA the Scottish Mafia. Liam, Fiona, Fibber and Oliver have a kitty paradise in their giant 6 x 12 screened in catio that Judi and her husband added onto their already large screened porch area. Inside this tropical paradise, the kits get to enjoy cat-safe foliage including patio palms, impatiens and parsley, plus tons of other feline amenities.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Climbing ramps and perches are all made from untreated rough-sawn cedar thats wrapped with natural sisal. Wheatgrass and catnip patches below the ramps provide wonderful grazing areas and a cool place to nap, although they need to be replaced continuously because of a few feline junkies.

     </p>
     <p>
      The koi pond provides endless hours of entertainment, and Judi says that the fish are perfectly safe because the cats havent yet figured out how to get in there without getting wet.

      The mafia enjoys a lovely custom made litterbox hideaway made with birch veneer and cherry stain to match the exterior of the main house.

      When Carrie found this house in Portland, she knew it was a perfect fit for her and her menagerie because it already had the beginnings of a catio. Once she started working on the catio, however, she quickly realized that the original structure (shown below left) was going to have to be completely replaced, so the project took on a slightly larger scope, but the end result is paradise for Carrie and her furry family members.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The cats access the catio through the sliding glass doors leading to the indoor cat lounge area. A clear polycarbonate roof keeps everyone nice and dry, even in the rainy Pacific Northwest climate. Carrie chose to build the structure from fir, but if she did it again, she says shed probably use cedar to avoid having to paint or stain the wood. The entire project, including a short stretch of fence and a gate to keep the dogs in the yard, cost $5000. Carrie says, Its pretty obvious that I did not think of resale when I built this. I  plan on living in the house for the rest of my life so my heirs can  figure out how best to market it.

      If you live in Australia and youre looking to create an amazing outdoor cat enclosure for your cats, then you must check out the selection from
      <a href="http://www.catnip.com.au" target="_blank">
       Catnip Cat Enclosures

      . This company makes some of the most adaptable outdoor cat enclosures Ive seen. For over 17 years this family owned business has designed cat enclosures for every possible configuration.

      Catnip cat enclosures can sit on the ground or they can be mounted to the side of a building. Standard enclosures are made of galvanized steel, but they can also be custom powder coated in any color to match your home. The enclosures almost disappear!

       The Cat Cottage Senior Sanctuary

      is a special little hideaway in Pasadena, CA built just for senior and special needs kitties. These lucky kitties have a wonderful catio so they can safely enjoy the beautiful Southern California weather in their golden years.

     </p>
     <p>
      The structure itself was originally a prefab TuffShed barn, with a  vaulted ceiling and a loft. They were able to customize it with windows  and a skylight to give the kitties lots of natural light inside. They had power lines run underground  for electricity, then added insulation, drywall, window trim, paint, a  dimmable chandelier, handmade kitty stairway to the loft, and an air  conditioner as well as a small catio. Its a small  space, but with so much vertical room, plus the catio, its fine for  elderly cats who spend most of the day following the sun from one nap  spot to another!

      Catio Showcase reader Maggie sent in photos of this nifty little cat enclosure that her fiances dad built for his two cats Squeezy and Tiger. Its a freestanding enclosure made with simple materials from the local home improvement store. Its filled with cat amenities like a rope-covered scratching post and shelves for perching and climbing. Theres room for a litter box and some food and water, plus an enclosed sleeping area for a little privacy.

      The sunflowers planted around the enclosure will look beautiful and provide some camouflage when they come up. It looks like Squeezy and Tiger really love their little outdoor getaway!

      in Phoenix, Arizona with a temporary home while they wait to be adopted. All About Animals Rescue was founded in 2010 by Dawn Kavanaugh, who really knows cats. She and her husband added this catio onto their home for their own cats, plus it allows them to rescue countless cats off the euthanasia list from local animal control agencies. Dawn and her team of volunteers run adoption events every week at local pet supply stores and each week dozens of happy cats go home with loving new owners.

      is an easy way to give your cat a little bit of safe outdoor space where she can catch a breath of fresh air and watch the world go by. This pre-made cat enclosure attaches securely to a windowsill, extending outside and creating a small perching ledge inside. Kitty can access the outer portion of the enclosure through a lockable, weather-proof entry flap. The veranda is made of metal with a rust-resistant coating. It measures approximately 17 x 28 x 20 and holds cats up to 20 lbs.

      Bob and Glenda built this spacious outdoor catrun at their Utah home. The structure spans three-quarters of the length of the house and is built of redwood and wire mesh. The cats access the catrun through a door in the window of the laundry room. Bob and Glenda added a tree branch for scratching and climbing, a shelving system, and two cat houses inside the catrun. There is a full-size door so people can access the incredible backyard gardens and pond, which the cats spend their days watching and enjoying.

      When Stokely and her dad moved from Long Island to Las Vegas, she was used to living outside, but there are all sorts of desert predators in Vegas that might prove dangerous to an outdoor kitty, so dad built her a special enclosure for their new Southwest home. Stokely now has a beautiful outdoor patio where she can lounge during the day and at night she goes into her own private house thats locked safely inside a predator-proof fence where she can sleep without any worries. With food and water and lots of places to nap  plus Im sure she sees the occassional lizard run by for entertainment  Stokely seems to be enjoying her desert paradise.

       Linda and Randys Amazing Oregon Catitat

      <img alt="Catitat1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-202" height="400" src="http://catioshowcase.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Catitat1.jpg" title="Catitat1" width="630"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      When Linda and Randy moved from Seattle to Bend, Oregon, they wanted to create a space for their cats to go outside, but they were concerned about the coyotes and barn owls in the area since they live near a large land preserve. So they decided to build this incredible catitat to let their kitties have a safe place to roam.
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Catitat2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-203" height="236" src="http://catioshowcase.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Catitat2.jpg" title="Catitat2" width="630"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Linda and Randy hired a fencing company to build the structure and then stained the wood themselves. The main structure is 24 feet by 40 feet and it is filled with climbing shelves, ramps, grass, and natural elements like a large dead tree, perfect for natural scratching! The main supports are sunken into the ground about 6 inches and secured with concrete. Also the wire fencing extends about 6 inches blow ground to keep other critters from burrowing in. There is a full-size door into the catitat so Linda and Randy can join the cats in their outdoor paradise, which they do frequently when the weather is nice.
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Catitat3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-204" height="236" src="http://catioshowcase.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Catitat3.jpg" title="Catitat3" width="630"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      The cats access the catitat through a long walkway leading from a cat door inside a cabinet in the house to the main enclosure. The roof of the walkway comes off in segments, just in case there is an emergency and a cat needs to be removed from the walkway.
     </p>
     <p>
      <img alt="Catitat4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-205" height="293" src="http://catioshowcase.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Catitat4.jpg" title="Catitat4" width="630"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      As you can see, the cats sure do seem to enjoy this incredible structure. I wonder if they know just how lucky they are!

      When Lyn took her two cats from their home in Florida to New England for the summer, they were missing their outdoor enclosure, so Lyns son built this little portable enclosure to tide them over. The screened in cubicle sits on a picnic table outside a window, allowing the kitties to get some fresh air. A simple solution for a vacation home.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lyns son would be happy to build you one at a reasonable price if you are interested. Please contact me at kate (at) moderncat (dot) net and I will put you in touch with him.

      To start the project, they first enclosed a large covered patio area that faces toward their lovely pool and backyard. They hired Tom Whitling of
      <a href="http://www.theavianhome.com/" target="_blank">
       The Avian Home
      </a>
      , a custom builder who specializes in bird aviaries. This is the first cat enclosure that he has worked on. Tom pre-constructed the custom panels and then secured them in place with concrete bolts and screws into the stucco walls. All the panels were painted before installation, as you can see below.

      After the panels were in place, Harvie and her husband went back and caulked around the bottom to keep water and bugs out, plus they added clear Plexiglas panels along the bottom portion on the outside of the panels to keep out rain spatters, water from the pool sweep, and dust from the gardeners leaf blower.

      They added two shelves, one at waist height and another way up high, for kitty climbing, plus lots of cat trees, scratchers, a litter box, and food and water. Comfy human furniture, colorful decor, and a ceiling fan add just the right touches to make everyone feel right at home.

      The cats access the catio through the sliding glass doors, which have cat flaps installed in the screens. There is an alternative entrance into this catio from the kitchen window.

     </p>
     <p>
      Since the first catio was such a success, Harvie and her husband decided to add a smaller catio off the master bedroom. This catio also has a climbing shelf, cat trees, and a loveseat.

      As if living in California isnt nice enough, these lucky kitties sure do have a wonderful home!
