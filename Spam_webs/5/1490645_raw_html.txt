    <h4>
     Demographics
    </h4>
    <br/>
    The demographic of the United States is quickly changing. About a century ago, the majority of U.S. immigrants were European. Today, Latin America and Asia compile a larger number of immigrants with Europe only accounting for a small fraction. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2010 Mexico accounted for 29.6%, Asia 28.2%, Central and South America 23.8%, Europe 12.3%, Africa and Oceania 4.4%, and Canada 2.1%. The Bureau also states that 12.8% of people living in the U.S. were born in a different country. Seeing as Central and South America account for almost  of the immigrant population, equaling about 48 million people, Hispanic influence in the marketing world is great; in fact, it accounts for over $1 trillion of U.S. buying power.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    An interesting look at the comparison between origin of birth and type of job was performed by the U.S. Census Bureau. The results showed a large number of Latin Americans working in areas such as:
    <br/>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Construction
     </li>
     <li>
      Education
     </li>
     <li>
      Healthcare and Social Services
     </li>
     <li>
      Leisure and Hospitality
     </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    Looking further into their line of work, it was found that Hispanics earn a competitive amount of money each year, putting them right next to the average American who sits in the middle class.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in September 2013, before taxes, Hispanics make an average of $48,066 a year. After taxes it drops to $47,590.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The exciting notion about this for companies is that Hispanics yearly expenditures practically meet their annual income; the average expenditure within the Hispanic home is $42,268. The best question to be asked here is what are these tens of thousands being spent on? The largest expense is housing, as is expected. The next largest purchase is food, totaling $6,570 a year. As far as smaller expenses go, a few of the surprising purchases come when we compare things like apparel and services ($2,030) to vehicle purchase ($2,890). Hispanics use almost the same amount of money on apparel as they do on their vehicles. The amount spent on apparel was the largest amount of money used in this regard when compared to the three other groups within the study (white and all other races, black or African-American, and all consumer units).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4>
     Food
    </h4>
    Let's start with food! Who doesnt love food? For U.S. Hispanics, this is one of the forerunners in yearly purchases. On average, Hispanics spend $300 more per year on groceries than non-Hispanics, as indicated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey. Most of their money is spent on meat, which is then followed by dairy, fruit, vegetables, and poultry and eggs. Bakery items are not a huge hit on the Hispanic grocery list. It makes sense however that meat would be at the top of the list seeing as many Hispanic dishes include it: tacos, moles, burritos, and ceviche all typically have some kind of meat in them ranging from pork and chicken to even fish.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The top three key factors that drive Hispanic food purchase decisions are:
    <br/>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Healthy Foods
     </li>
     <li>
      Convenience
     </li>
     <li>
      All-Natural
     </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4>
     Other Purchases
    </h4>
    Hispanic women tend to say they are the decision makers of the household. In fact, 86% of Hispanic women reported that, on average, they make the decisions as far as what and when to purchase certain items. As Maria Portokalos from the movie
    <i>
     My Big Fat Greek Wedding
    </i>
    said, The man may be the head of the house, but the woman is the neck and she can turn the head any way she wants. 50% of Hispanic women agreed that items such as food, beverages, clothing, and pharmaceuticals were decided by the woman of the household. Items that typically were purchased by both genders included things like home electronics, personal electronics, auto/transport, and insurance, as stated by the Nielsen Women of Tomorrow Report.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These statistics make sense when you couple them with the fact that one out of five dollars spent on womens fashion footwear is accounted for by Hispanic women. According to an article by the Miami Herald, approximately $3.3 billion dollars were spent on pumps, flats, boots, and sandals by Hispanic women during 2012 and 2013.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Another interesting, yet highly purchased item by Hispanics are gift cards. According to the Comdata Stored Value Solutions gift card survey, most cards purchased have an average balance of $71 dollars compared to an average of $41 for Caucasians and $60 for African-Americans. This total for Hispanics increased 33% from 2006 to 2007. Gift cards are purchased for a number of different reasons, including but not exclusive to: personal use, a gift to a child as a budgeting tool, or because they are multi-functional - some cards allow you to choose between DVD purchases and music, while others incorporate multiple restaurant possibilities, etc.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4>
     Holiday Shopping
    </h4>
    Holiday shopping takes on a whole new form for Hispanics. Holidays are the time during which they spend excess amounts of money on others when compared to other demographics. In a survey of 1,900 acculturated Hispanic women, respondents average a total of $1,176 on holiday shopping which is 57% higher than the national average. Some of the go to retailers included Macys, Target, Kohls, Wal-Mart, and JC Penney. The women also revealed that they were two times more likely to purchase a product that had been endorsed by a Latin brand or personality.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The question Im sure we all have now is why? Why are Hispanics emerging as such big spenders and influencers on the U.S. market? The answer is a disposable income. Hispanics between the ages of 20 and 29 have about $10,000 less debt than other Millennials, says a September study by PNC Bank. On average, they owe closer to $18,000 rather than $27,800 like their counterparts. Many Hispanics (45%) live with their parents which allows them to save money on rent or a mortgage payment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h4>
     Technology
    </h4>
    U.S. Hispanics are early adopters of technology; in fact, 31 million of them have a mobile phone. Even younger children run around with their thumbs plastered to their miniscule keyboards. Approximately 64% of 15-year-old Hispanics already own a phone, and by the time they are 17 that amount increases to 78%. Hispanic consumers want the newest style, the best technology, and the fastest way to connect and share things with their friends and family. They are your clients when it comes to hip, new Web-enabled phones. The average Hispanic will spend 42% more on mobile devices and 35% more on data services than the average user. They use apps more, shop on their phones more, and watch more mobile video per month than other demographics. They spend 17 hours a week online, and 14 hours per day with some kind of technological device.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It is obvious that cell phones are a big hit for U.S. Hispanics; however, Apple doesnt get to brand this groups purchase. Android devices are the choice of most Hispanics as they are packed with the latest new features and are relatively inexpensive, according to eMarketer data. With an Android device, you are also able to use a pay-as-you-go service rather than being locked in to a two-year contract. Knowing the popularity of cell phone devices within this demographic and correlating that to their love for Android, retailers would be wise to ensure mobile sites and apps are developed to excel on an Android device.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Because they spend so much time on the internet, many Hispanics are considered e-fluentials - someone that spends an average of 25 hours online connecting with others. Hispanics spend an average of 30 hours per week reaching out via the internet, surpassing what is needed to be an e-fluential; but they also interact daily with more people face to face. Female Hispanics interact with around 68 people on any given day, versus the 45 of your average female American. This can be a big deal for companies seeing as 87% of Hispanics exhibit strong label loyalty and are eager to share their experiences with others. If a retailer can connect with the Hispanic demographic, it creates a loyal customer whos going to share their experience with others and create more and more loyal customers for the retailer to capitalize on. Now thats an audience worth advertising to.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hispanics enjoy their time on the internet because they see it as a good source of learning, as stated by the CDCs Healthy Communities Program. They find magazines help them keep up-to-date on the latest styles and trends, newspapers keep them informed and up-to-date -- plus, minority newspapers gear information and concerns toward their specific community -- while television on the other hand, is consumed purely for entertainment.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Therein lies the trouble for network television companies: what is entertainment to the U.S. Hispanic? One of the most popular TV shows Modern Family stars Hispanic actress Sofia Vergara. While the use of a Hispanic actress was thought to entice Hispanic viewers, the shows popularity was naught among this demographic. Many Hispanics believe network television tries too hard to make things funny and do so at the minoritys expense. Shows use every stereotype in the book in order to get a good laugh from consumers, when in all actuality its driving some consumers away. According to an article by the
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/business/media/networks-struggle-to-appeal-to-hispanics-without-using-stereotypes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">
     New York Times
    </a>
    , U.S. Hispanics still watch Spanish-language networks in high quantities, the most popular of which seems to be telenovelas.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hispanics in the U.S. are very label loyal. This demographic is growing rapidly, accounting for 48 million people and $1 trillion in market power. It would be wise to begin advertising to the U.S. Hispanic and have them loyal to your brand now so that as they become larger and more powerful within the U.S. market they will spread your brand to others. Marketing strategy states that businesses need a targeted approach on consumers, so why not start here?
