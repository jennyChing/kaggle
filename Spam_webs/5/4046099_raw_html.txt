     CALVIN AND ARMINIUS -- Predestination AND Free Will
    </h1>
    <!--HTML format and Linkable verses added 7/27/2006-->
    <p>
     The age old debate of Arminian vs. Calvinist continues.  It divides and causes quarrels and it breaks my heart.  
I consider myself
     <!-- neither Arminian nor Calvinist. REPLACED WITH THE FOLLOWING 7/27/06 -->
     <!--a mix of Arminian and 
Calvinist REPLACED WITH THE FOLLOWING 9/2008-->
     a
     <!--removed 12/2008 loose-->
     Calvinist who believes in free will.
     <!-- Yet, I do believe in free will, but n REMOVED 7/27/06 -->
     <!--removed 12/2008 Neither a pure free will 
perspective nor a pure predestination perspective is correct in my understanding. -->
     <!-- Sorry Arminius.  Sorry Calvin.  REMOVED 7/27/06 -->
     I embrace those saved by Jesus Christ alone (Calvinist or not!) as my brethren in Christ.  Free will is not the 
Way to God. Calvinism is not the Way to God.  Jesus Christ is the Way to God (See
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      John 14:6
     </a>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     I will share my thoughts about the debate, however.
    </p>
    <h2>
     SOVEREIGNTY AND CHOICE
    </h2>
    <p>
     Like Calvin, I believe that God is sovereign.  He knows all, sees all and history is but a moment to Him.  He 
engineered this universe knowing all that would happen.  Further, all glory goes to Him and our works and merits 
are
     <!--virtually REMOVED 7/27/2006-->
     nothing.  Yet, even as that is true, that does not mean that free will does 
not exist.  Where I
     <!--removed 12/2008 greatly-->
     differ from
     <i>
      <!--replaced 12/2008 many-->
      some
      <!--end replace-->
     </i>
     Calvinists is
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     free
     <!--end add-->
     choice. God knows the choices (by my free will) I would 
make, both those influenced by a Holy Spirit empowered spirit and those influenced by an enemy corrupted flesh.  
God knew all the choices I would make before I was born and while I indeed do make those choices, the choices that 
I do make are choices that God has already Himself foreknown.
     <!--REMOVED 12/2008 Yet, it is not as if God made the choices for me.  -->
     <!-- He simply knows. REMOVED 7/27/06 -->
     God revealed Himself to me and I responded.
     <!-- Next sentence added 7/27/2006-->
     HOWEVER, I 
ONLY RESPONDED BECAUSE GOD MOVED IN ME TO RESPOND.
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     Left to myself, I could not and would not choose God as I would be incapabale.  This is true for all of us (See

     <!-- Next sentence added 7/27/06 -->
     I have heard it said of free will that it is "giving into the greatest inclination at the time."
     <!--Added 12/2008-->
     In his book
     <i>
      Putting Amazing Back Into Grace
     </i>
     , 
Michael Horton writes, "Just because humanity
     <i>
      declared
     </i>
     independence does not mean that it
     <i>
      became
     </i>
     independent" (chapter 3). Prior to God changing one's heart, the only 
"free" will is to choose which sin to be in bondage to. Everyone who sins is enslaved to sin (see
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:34;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      John 8:34
     </a>
     ). We cannot please God without faith in Him since "everything that does not come from faith is sin" (see
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2014:23;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Romans 14:23
     </a>
     ).
     <!--end add-->
    </p>
    <p>
     And then John Piper asks the question, "
     <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByDate/2004/179_What_Is_the_Will_of_God_and_How_Do_We_Know_It/" target="_blank">
      What is the will of God and how do we know it?
     </a>
     " (which links to 
a very insightful site). God demonstrates 2 wills -- that of His commandment (which we can fail) and that of His sovereignty (which we cannot - i.e., it
     <i>
      will
     </i>
     happen no matter what). 
And if we fail His commandment due to behaving out of the flesh, then are we free at all? Or is it some twisted 
sense of "freedom" since we become enslaved to sin and can only make the right choices when we are 
slaves to righteousness by the transforming work of His Holy Spirit?
    </p>
    <h2>
     NOT GOOD AND TRANSFORMED, PARTICIPATION
    </h2>
    <p>
     I agree with Calvin that no one is good.  This is supported 
in the Bible in Psalm 53:3 and Romans 3:23 to name a couple of the 
many verses
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     listed above
     <!--end add-->
     .
     <!-- Yet, Calvin goes extreme in my opinion in saying, REMOVED 7/27/2006 -->
    </p>
    <p>
     Calvin states the following:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Let it stand, therefore, as an indubitable truth, which no engines 
can shake, that the mind of man is so entirely alienated from the 
righteousness of God that he cannot conceive, desire, or design any 
thing but what is wicked, distorted, foul, impure, and iniquitous; 
that his heart is so thoroughly envenomed by sin that it can breathe 
out nothing but corruption and rottenness; that if some men 
occasionally make a show of goodness, their mind is ever interwoven 
with hypocrisy and deceit, their soul inwardly bound with the fetters 
of wickedness."
    </p>
    <p>
     I agree that mankind is sinful.
     <!-- but what REMOVED 7/27/2006 and replaced with next couple of words -->
     One could argue about the changes made by 
the Holy Spirit and transformation via the renewing of the mind 
(
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:1;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Romans 12:1
     </a>
     ) 
when one is saved and subsequently in process of sanctification.
     <!--Next sentence added 7/27/2006 -->
     However, this is not Calvin's point as Calvin is referring to the unregenerate man who is totally depraved and steeped in sin.
     <!-- One could ask added 7/27/06 -->
     One could ask, "What about the spirit versus the sinful nature?"
     <!-- Following sentence added 7/27/06 -->
     This is not at issue.
     <!-- What 
about the empowerment of the spirit in that battle by the Holy Spirit?
This is all the work of God, but it is IN US, not separate from US
as if we don't matter.  In practicality, sure, we may mean nothing in
what we can do, but God loves us and includes us. REMOVED 7/27/2006-->
    </p>
    <p>
     Where is the person's participation in God's redeeming work?  TRUE, 
our work may not mean anything as far as gaining salvation but our 
participation is part of our transformation after salvation and our 
transformation does not come without our choices made during our 
temptation!  This choosing (empowered by the Holy Spirit) in 
transformation is part of sanctification.
    </p>
    <p>
     Calvin
     <!-- seems in his statement above to separate man from God and
leave man there. REMOVED and replaced with rest of sentence 7/27/2006 -->
     is addressing man separate from the life of God (see
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206:5;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Genesis 6:5
     </a>
     and
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2017:9;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Jeremiah 17:9
     </a>
     ).  
Yes, man is separated from God, but when Christ 
is in the heart of man then that gap of separation is bridged by 
Jesus Christ via the cross.

    <h2>
     SALVATION AND DAILY CHOOSING
    </h2>
    <p>
     <!--I am not saved by works as some would try to accuse me of saying. REMOVED 7/27/2006-->
     Jesus did all of the work on the cross and in His life.  I am 
justified by Christ alone.  When I responded to the Holy Spirit 
tugging at my heart,
     <!-- it is only because He offered an option REPLACED 7/27/06 with the following -->
     it is only because the Holy Spirit had ALREADY DONE WORK IN MY HEART for without Him we perish (see
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:14;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      1 Corinthians 2:14

      2 Corinthians 4:3-4
     </a>
     ).  I 
did work some changes in my life afterwards
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     IN CHRIST
     <!--end add-->
     <!--, but replaced 12/2008-->
     ;
     <!--end replace-->
     He empowered and 
began to change me.
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     And He will complete that work He began (see Philippians 1:6).
     <!--end add-->
     God always works and I, now included in His 
flock, work (
     <!-- removed 12/2008 and am -->
     empowered by Him).  In doing this, He did not 
abolish my free will.
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     He restored it. I now actually
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     free will, though in Christ am a slave to righteousness by His work, certainly not my own. In Christ, I can choose not to sin.
     <!--end add-->
     Jesus gives me freedom to choose daily!  When  
I choose to sin, I choose to not live life abundantly as Christ offers in
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      John 10:10
     </a>
     .  I make choices based on the battle between spirit and
     <!-- 7/27/06 REPLACED sinful nature (Believers still sin, but are delivered from the dominion of sin, i.e. sinful nature, as well as the penalty of sin) with the following -->
     flesh,  and He knows what choices I will make and works 
them out according to His purpose whether that be to witness to 
another or to learn a lesson myself or to be disciplined or something 
far beyond my understanding.  He sees the "big picture." I do not. I 
only see glimpses -- divine revelation.
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     Yet, He goes even further than just working it out for good.  He doesn't idly sit by an wait for me to screw up and then do the trick to make 
things just "work out." While He does allow, use, and sometimes initiate adversity, that last word is the point.  He initiates. He moves me via His Spirit to make the right choices as left to my 
own devices, I fail.  In my salvation, I responded ... to prompting by the Holy Spirit.  He drew me.  John 6:44 states, "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day."
     <!--end add-->
    </p>
    <p>
     Choose this day whom you will serve (Refer to
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2024:14-15;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Joshua 24:14-15
     </a>
     ). 
When faced with temptation I DECIDE which way I go, but as a 
believer, I HAVE THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO OVERCOME.  
Not by my power do I overcome, but by His.  Grace is a gift and gifts 
can be refused, but once taken, grace is for good.
    </p>
    <h2>
     PREDESTINATION
    </h2>
    <p>
     <!--Removed 12/2008 Now granted, t-->
     There is something called predestination out there since
     <!--replaced 12/2008 it-->
     "predestined"
     <!--end replace-->
     is in the Bible
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     (See Romans 8 and Ephesians 1)
     <!--end add-->
     <!--, but I do not define or understand it the same way 
my Calvinist brothers and sisters do REMOVED 7/27/06-->
     . Predestination intertwines with  
foreknowledge -- God's knowing of my destiny (-destination) before 
(pre-) it happens.  This is what makes this debate almost a moot 
point. If God preordains it OR He works out things so that in the 
long run my choices fit into His purpose, then isn't the same thing 
ultimately going to happen?  Ok, I know most, if not all, of my 
Calvinist friends will say that foreknowledge is not predestination.
     <!-- Added next sentence 7/27/06 -->
     I agree! 
Foreknowledge does not fully capture what predestination is.  I heard 
an interesting twist on predestination one time, and I think there is 
something to be said for it:  When one is saved, he or she is 
predestined to Heaven and eternal life (That is once one is saved, he 
or she is forever saved and destined to go to Heaven even though he 
or she is before -- pre -- the point of having passed from this 
earthly life and into the life to come).
     <i>
      Many
     </i>
     Calvinists extend 
predestination to a predeterministic view of all humanity.  This 
almost says to me that if Joe Schmoe is shared the gospel and says 
he chooses it that he still may be predestined for condemnation. 
Ludicrous!  I know personally some Calvinist brothers and sisters 
who share tracks and the 4 Spiritual Laws with others where it is set 
up for the reader to make a CHOICE.  If these brothers and sisters 
believe in
     <!--replaced 12/16/2008 pure-->
     "predeterministic"
     <!--end replace-->
     Calvinism, then besides
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18-20;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Matthew 28:18-20
     </a>
     , why do they 
bother offering people a choice if Joe Schmoe might be destined for 
condemnation? Maybe they would say because they don't know how he is 
pre-ordained. Well, if they don't know, they could still just sit 
back and let God's pre-ordained stuff just happen. No! God knows, but 
we act, too. Even if we just sat there, and we all do that too often, 
then we are
     <!--removed 12/2008still-->
     exercising
     <!--removed 12/2008 free-->
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     our
     <!--end add-->
     will though in an ungodly way
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     (which means that we are acting out of 
the flesh, which is bondage, not freedom)
     <!--end add-->
     .  Yet, 
to go against God's will is not to undermine His plan.  Reflecting 
back on that insightful twist to predestination, one could say that 
foreknowledge applies to all, but predestination is for those who 
become saved WHEN they become saved.
     <!-- Added next sentence 7/27/06 -->
     I would say it applies to those who 
are saved even BEFORE they become saved. Does not God want ALL to come 
to repentance and not perish as
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:9;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      2 Peter 3:9
     </a>
     suggests? Yet, people 
choose against God and He knows that they will choose against Him.
     <!-- Added next sentence -->
     Yet, to leave predestination there is to reject biblical election and replace it with foreknowledge; predestination is more than foreknowledge. 
Humanity does not do what God intended most of the time, but God 
knows all, sees all.  He is not surprised, but we are not stuck in a 
predetermined program. It begins to go beyond trying to understand 
at this point.
     <!-- The rest of this paragraph added 7/27/06 -->
     Much of this is an argument for evangelism, 
not against predestination.  Even though choice is evident, one cannot make a choice for God without God FIRST 
working in his or her heart.
    </p>
    <h2>
     FREE WILL
    </h2>
    <p>
     While the Bible mentions "predestined", it is also quite clear that 
we have
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     (or at least had)
     <!--end add-->
     a free will
     <!--, also REMOVED 7/27/06-->
     .  I believe that free will is part of
     <i>
      Imago 
Dei
     </i>
     (The image of God).  True love and fellowship cannot exist without 
free will.  The tree
     <!-- Added specification as to which tree it was 7/27/06 -->
     of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden was what I call the "free 
will element." Why else would God put the tree there?  He wanted true  
love and fellowship with Adam and Eve, not a forced predeterministic 
fellowship which would not be true fellowship. God told Jonah what to 
do and he CHOSE to run.  God wants all to come to repentance and not 
perish (
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:8-9;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      2 Peter 3:8-9
     </a>
     ), but Jesus also said that narrow is the gate 
to Heaven and wide are the ways to destruction (
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:13-14;&amp;version=31;" target="_blank">
      Matthew 7:13-14
     </a>
     ). 
That means that somehow, people go against God's will.  That means 
people choose against God.
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     However, again, the most "freedom" an unregenerate heart can have is to choose the type of sin to be enslaved to.
     <!--end add-->
     A requirement for true love and 
fellowship and being in God's image is free will, and it happens that 
they are of great cost!  Our choosing against God cost Him Jesus on 
the cross! Yet, this is what God foreknew
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     (and planned from the beginning)
     <!--end add-->
     and how it is the Greatest 
Example of God working things out to the good.  The crucifixion and 
resurrection are the climaxes of all existence and history fulfilling 
prophecy and saving the lost and giving the believer hope for eternal 
life! I do not deny the power of the Holy Spirit and His influence in 
the lives of people, but God is not in the clouds with a remote and 
we a bunch of robots.  God knows my decisions and their outcomes, but 
I don't sit and let all the preordained stuff just happen around me. 
That is a predeterministic view that I reject, a view pragmatically 
synonymous with atheistic behavioralism or evolution.  But in saying 
all of this, I am also not saying that God sits around and lets 
things just happen as a distant an impersonal deity.  He knows each 
and every choice -- good or bad -- that is going to happen and He 
knows how it will all fit together for His ultimate purpose. There 
are NO SURPRISES TO GOD!
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     And our only hope to do good is in and through Him!
     <!--end add-->
    </p>
    <h2>
     SALVATION
    </h2>
    <p>
     I am saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone for if He 
had not done the act of grace on the cross, there would be no option 
except Hell. Yet His freeing act on the cross gives
     <!--replaced 12/2008 us-->
     those in Him
     <!--end replace-->
     freedoms to 
choose His will, choosing He foreknew and choosing empowered by His 
Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <h2>
     THE REAL ISSUE
    </h2>
    <p>
     God and mankind are both active; but only God foreknew what 
occurred, is occurring, and what will occur. However, the real 
issue is "Where do you stand?"  Certainly how salvation occurs 
is worth exploring, but division over how is ridiculous.  I am 
exploring it and I hope that this document can unify as opposed 
to divide brethren in Christ.  The free will aspect of my perspective 
is not to the degree that I am saved by works and is not one to the 
degree where I deny God's sovereignty. I believe in God's working 
in the lives of people but not at the expense of people becoming 
mindless (and not being able to think and make choices, thus 
unable to love and fellowship truly
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     , though we can only truly love in Him
     <!--end add-->
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     To try to ultimately pin this down is unfruitful in my opinion. 
More accurately, pinning this down is impossible (to be mentioned). 
Ok, maybe I am in my folly to type all of this but I do this to 
dilute some of the "stuff" that separates the Body of Christ and 
to get at the heart of the matter. Is Christ in your heart?  Are 
you saved?  Are good works coming out of your faith instead of 
trying to save you?  These are the questions that must be asked, 
even though others are asked above.  "Are you Calvinist or 
Arminian?"
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     while a good question,
     <!--end add-->
     is NOT the question that needs to be asked.  Jesus 
asked, "Who do you say I AM?" (

     REVISITED
    </h2>
    <p>
     I have revisited this topic (and this document) many times. I
     <!-- add 7/27/06 -->
     have in the past
     <!-- end addition -->
     fluctuated between Arminius and Calvin, neither accepting both nor 
rejecting both
     <!-- added rest of sentence 7/27/06-->
     , but now I am
     <!--removed 12/2008 a combination of both (you can guess which direction I lean :)-->
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     a Calvinist who lets the tensions stand
     <!--end add-->
     .
     <!--removed 12/2008 Neither Arminianism alone nor Calvinism alone is 
fruitful-->
     Phil Smuland, a
     <!--removed 12/2008 dispensationalist -->
     pastor and Calvinist 
himself stated, "Extreme Calvinism is unhealthy" and in a later 
message reminded the congregation to remember when they first came 
to Christ before they were "theologized, Calvinized, galvanized, 
and homogenized." God is a God of justice and grace. Both justice 
and grace are attributes of God. Just as neither justice alone nor 
grace alone is healthy for a Christian lifestyle (as grace alone 
is abused as a license for sin when without justice, and justice 
alone is abused as Pharisaic legalism when without grace), free 
will and predestination also co-exist.  It was so eloquently put  
in words paraphrasing Charles Spurgeon in a Bible study I 
attended in February 1999 that free will and predestination are two 
lines that are both co-existing principles in truth; these two lines 
converge in eternity. I am a free moral agent, but God is omniscient. 
I can make choices, but the Holy Spirit inspires righteous choices.  
I can go against God's will, but God can use it in the "big picture" for 
good.  How I want to reconcile this in my mind!  It is like a cruise ship.  
People choose whether they dance, go to the restaurant, the show, 
lounge, swim, or whatever, but the ship is set on its course.  All those 
choices are part of the functioning of the cruise ship and the cruise 
ship will reach the destination.  The universe is like the cruise ship. 
Or as one quote went from J. Nehru states, "Life is like a game of 
cards.  The hand that is dealt you represents determinism; the way 
you play it is free will."
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     Yet, to play the cards right or to be doing good 
activities on the cruise ship can only be accomplished by the One who knows right and good and 
works in us to do it.
     <!--end add-->
     Humanity can
     <!--removed 12/2008 freely -->
     make its choices, but 
the book of Revelation shall unfold. Still, this document may raise 
questions and tensions in both free will and Calvinist camps.  It raises 
tensions and questions within me.
     <!--removed 12/2008 I read through it and think, &quot;That 
sounds Calvinist&quot; or &quot;That sounds Arminian.&quot;-->
     Am I repeatedly 
contradicting myself? A wise sister in Christ named Rebecca (Breindel) Dillard 
once said that part of this debate is reflective of God's divinity. 
I pondered her statement. How true that is!  We can make choices 
and even go against God's will, but God is still God and He is still 
sovereign. The lack of reconciliation is mind-boggling, but the 
tensions stand. Free will and predestination co-exist in some 
mysterious way, a way that seems tense, but in my finite mind, I see 
that I will never fully comprehend this aspect of God's divinity. 
It surpasses the mere three-dimensional world I perceive in my 
finite mind.  This goes beyond the finite and into the eternal. 
I just must go in faith knowing that these seemingly irreconcilable 
ideas co-exist and I must trust that as I make choices, God is also 
sovereign.
     <!--added 12/2008-->
     God is good and we can trust that.

     Pastor Jim Logan dissected
     <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8:28-30&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank">
      Romans 8:28-30
     </a>
     , which states, 
"And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God 
foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. 
And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified."  He mentions that predestination 
has nothing to do with Heaven or hell, that all of us were destined for hell before we were in Christ. Rather he mentions that foreknowledge means that 
God foreknew we would exist and of those who would be in Christ He predestined to be conformed to Christ.  Predestination, Logan states, is a matter of 
believers in Christ being conformed to Christ. Logan emphasizes to not confuse predestination with election. Some Calvinists are mistaken in that confusion, 
though that is not good Calvinism. Logan also reminds those to whom he preaches that it was God's work, not yours. And I once again reiterate that God is good and we can trust Him.

    <h2>
     FAIRNESS TO BOTH SIDES
    </h2>
    <!--START ADDITION 7/27/06 -->
    <p>
     The Reverend C.H. Spurgeon delivered a sermon entitled
     <i>
      Sovereign Grace and Man's Responsibility
     </i>
     (No. 207) on Sabbath Morning, August 1, 1858, at the Music Hall, 
Royal Surrey Gardens. He covers this issue eloquently and more maturely and clearly than I have here.  See his full 
sermon at
     <a href="http://www.spurgeon.org/sermons/0207.htm" target="_blank">
      http://www.spurgeon.org/sermons/0207.htm
     </a>
     . I conclude 
with some quotes from his sermon:
    </p>
    <i>
    </i>
    <p>
     And just let me say here, that it is the custom of a certain body of Ultra-Calvinists, to call those of us who 
teach that it is the duty of man to repent and believe, "Mongrel Calvinists." If you hear any of them 
say so, give them my most respectful compliments, and ask them whether they ever read Calvin's works in their 
lives. Not that I care what Calvin said or did not say; but ask them whether they, ever read his works; and if 
they say "No," as they must say, for there are forty-eight large voluines, you can tell them, that the 
man whom they call "a Mongrel Calvinist," though he has not read them all, has read a very good share 
of them, and knows their spirit; and he knows that he preaches substantially what Calvin preached-that every 
doctrine he preaches may be found in Calvin's Commentaries on some part of Scripture or other. We are TRUE 
Calvinists, however. Calvin is nobody to us. Jesus Christ and him crucified, and the old fashioned Bible, are our 
standards. Beloved, let us take God's Word as it stands. If we find high doctrine there, let it be high; if we find 
low doctrine, let it be low; let us set up no other standard than the Bible affords.
     <br/>
     . . .
     <br/>
     This doctrine is as much God's Word as the other. You ask me to reconcile the two. I answer, they do not want any 
reconcilement; I never tried to reconcile them to myself, because I could never see a discrepancy. If you begin to 
put fifty or sixty quibbles to me, I cannot give any answer. Both are true; no two truths can be inconsistent with 
each other; and what you have to do is to believe them both. With the first one, the saint has most to do. Let him 
praise the free and sovereign grace of God, and bless his name. With the second, the sinner has the most to do. O 
sinner, humble thyself under the mighty hand of God, when thou thinkest of how often he hath shown his love to 
thee, by bidding thee come to himself, and yet how often thou hast spurned his Word and refused his mercy, and 
turned a deaf ear to every invitation, and hast gone thy way to rebel against a God of love, and violate the 
commands of him that loved thee.
     <br/>
     . . .
     <br/>
     I do not think the truth lies between the two extremes, but in them both.
     <br/>
     . . .
     <br/>
     Where we get wrong is where the Calvinist begins to meddle with the question of damnation, and interferes with the 
justice of God; or when the Arminian denies the doctrine of grace.
     <br/>
     . . .
     <br/>
     Have nothing to do with me where I have nothing to do with Christ. Where I separate from the truth, cast my words 
away. But if what I say be God's teaching, I charge you, by him that sent me, give these things your thoughts, and 
turn unto the Lord with all your hearts.

    <p>
     And let's not forget about considering the 5 points of Calvinism, a.k.a. Calvin's TULIP:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      T - Total Depravity.  The verses listed earlier in this document support this.
     </li>
     <li>
      U - Unconditional Grace. If grace were conditional, it would no longer be grace.
     </li>
     <li>
      L - Limited Atonement. This is a tough one, requiring some theological massaging, which 
would then make me a four-point Calvinist if you have to stoop to labeling. A five-point Calvinist 
would say that Jesus died ONLY for the elect, not for all people. What I say is that
      <a href="JesusDiedForAll.htm">
       Jesus died for all
      </a>
      as supported by Scripture, but that the effect of the atonement is limited to the elect (also supported 
by Scripture). Think about it. God's grace is sufficient 
for all, but applied to some (You could also think in terms of common and specific grace).  Jesus said this when he said, "Enter through the narrow gate. 
For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 
But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it" (Matthew 7:13-14). 
This means that those who enter the gate are a limited group.  John 3:17 states, 
"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him." 
Some look at the word
      <i>
       world
      </i>
      , but miss the phrase
      <i>
       through him
      </i>
      .  The narrow gate, those 
through Him -- in Christ.  These are His elect.  That is why the effect of the atonement is limited.  
The act on the cross is universally sufficient, but we know that it is not universally applied since 
not all will be in Heaven. Worthy of debate and you may differ, but the important question is, "Do you know Jesus and 
are you trusting His death and resurrection - His perfect work on your behalf - for salvation?"
     </li>
     <li>
      I - Irresistible Grace.  Those whom God calls respond to Him.
     </li>
     <li>
      P - Perseverance of the Saints. Once saved, alwasy saved.  If eternal life could stop, 
then it would no longer be eternal. "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. 
I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. 
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all[a]; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand" (John 10:27-29).
