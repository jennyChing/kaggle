   Greetings, people of the internet. The Gamescrap website was brought to its knees last week due to someone dropping a server or something to that effect. The details are not important right now, because mostly it was my own fault. Thankfully, the content has survived and is being transported with loving care to a new site that is nowhere near as ugly, slow, or bloated.
  
  At my current rate, looks like things can be up and running in the next couple of weeks (I should stop quoting times...it only ends up gettig me in trouble). In the meantime, however, content is still being worked on, teased, and released onto all of these easy to reach places:
