         <p>
          Back in October 2014,
          <a href="http://www.arena.net/" target="_blank">
           Guild Wars 2 developers
          </a>
          announced that they will be releasing the eighth and final episode of the second season of the Living World  Point of No Return. Since then, Guild Wars 2 fans have been in a frenzy trying to paint the scenario developers have come up with to put a close to the games second season. Now that its finally here, all the speculation can finally stop.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you havent gotten the chance to test the new patch for yourself, here are the things you can look forward to:
         </p>
         <h2>
          1. Achievements
         </h2>
         <p>
          There are 10 new achievements in Point of No Return. However, earning them is not going to be easy. First, you need to complete the story for the first time before the achievements are unlocked. Once youve done this, you need to start from the beginning and complete the story once again to be able to earn the achievements.
         </p>
         <h2>
          2. Equipment to Complete the Carapace and Luminescent Armor Sets
         </h2>
         <p>
          New head and chest armor pieces for the Carapace and Luminescent sets will come out in this episode. This is really something that I am looking forward to because the collection of armor sets in my inventory is something I am really proud of.
         </p>
         <h2>
          3. New Items
         </h2>
         <p>
          Items are very important to enhancing the abilities of a Guild Wars character. In this episode, players can expect to find three new Mordrem devices in the inventory of the vendors in the game.
         </p>
         <h2>
          4. Mordrem Vinewrath
         </h2>
         <p>
          <a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordrem_Vinewrath_%28world_boss%29" target="_blank">
           Mordrem Vinewrath
          </a>
          is a new World Boss you will encounter in Point of No Return when you reach the level 80 meta event in the Silverwastes. Based on the walkthroughs I have read so far, it will take a lot of power to be able to get to and defeat Vinewrath. However, one of the rewards is a Hero of the Wastes boon that will give you 50% bonus magic and extra bandit crests. I am already readying my character for what I expect to be an epic battle.
         </p>
         <h2>
          5. New Items at the Gem Store
         </h2>
         <p>
          We can all expect to see the following items on the shelves of the Gem Store:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Mini Rox
          </li>
          <li>
           Mordrem weapon skins
          </li>
          <li>
           Ghostly Mail Courier
          </li>
          <li>
           Pact Fleet Finisher
          </li>
         </ul>
         <h2>
          6. New Skills for Some Characters
         </h2>
         <p>
          Some characters will have new skills but unfortunately for Mesmers, you will no longer be able Illusionary Skill while in mid-air.
         </p>
         <h2>
          7. Bug Fixes!
         </h2>
         <p>
          One of the things that I looked forward to with the announcement of the release of Point of No Return was fixes for known bugs. Guardians will be very happy to know that all of the bugs related to their characters have been fixes.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have already started playing Point of No Return but I have yet to complete the story. That may seem a little surprising to you seeing as I practically spend all day and night playing Guild Wars 2. But since this is the finale episode for Living World, I am in no rush to finish it anytime soon.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am enjoying the story so far but as expected, Ive noticed some lagging and a couple of bugs. Thats fine, those things are normal when a new patch comes out. I am hoping theyll be fixed within the next couple of weeks.

           Pieces of Advice for Guild Wars Beginners
          </a>

          I know there are hundreds for Guild Wars starter guides all over the internet. Some of them even offer walkthroughs that start from signing up for a GW account. But I thought Id write this post anyway because unlike those comprehensive beginner guides, the pieces of advice Im about to give are based from my own experiences.
         </p>
         <p>
          1. Think twice before you answer the questions in the character creation page because these will determine the storyline of your game. I made the mistake of fooling around with the answers when I first started and that lead me restart all over again after a month of playing. The reason why I decided to create a new character was because I didnt find the storyline of my first one interesting. Dont get it me wrong, it was okay but it just wasnt for me.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. One thing Ive noticed among Guild Wars beginners is that they skip the process of talking to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character" target="_blank">
           NPCs
          </a>
          at the beginning of the game and just proceed to starting on a quest. Dont do this! Its pretty much the same as going to battle without a plan. Not only will you lose, you will also be wasting your time and energy.
         </p>
         <p>
          <img alt="240px-Soldier_(NPC)" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-35" height="267" src="http://gwshack.us/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/240px-Soldier_NPC.jpg" width="240"/>
         </p>
         <p>
          I learned this lesson many years ago when I was playing Diablo 2 and I had to defeat
          <a href="http://www.diablowiki.net/Andariel" target="_blank">
           Andariel
          </a>
          . If you arent familiar with the game, Andariel is a demon who uses fire. Now like any normal person, I decided to use ice against her. My character died at least 15 times before my brother told me that I should use fire against her. I told him that was ridiculous but then he told me to talk to Deckard Cain. Thats when I found out that even though Andariel uses fire against her enemies, it was also her greatest weakness because of her past.
         </p>
         <p>
          From then on, I made it a point to talk to the NPCs whenever Im playing a role playing game. So my advice to you is to not be lazy and do the same. Sometimes, all the advice you need to complete a quest is hidden in mundane conversations with NPCs have.
         </p>
         <p>
          3. I know it can be tempting to spend real money on your game so you can advance faster. But trust me, its best to wait until youve at least reached level 20 before you bring out the green bucks. Why? Well, refer to #1. I spent real money on a character I abandoned a month after. What a waste!
         </p>
         <p>
          4. Draw up a solid plan for your character before you start distributing those level up points. Decide which skills you want to strengthen and that will help you determine which attribute to focus on when your character levels up. However, you can never go wrong with strengthening the vitality of your character even at the early stages of the game.
         </p>
         <p>
          5. During combat, it is always best to learn how to switch weapon sets. Doing so will increase your chances of winning because you will be able to use a wider range of skill and take advantage of the unique attributes of each weapon. Furthermore, it will avoid long cool down periods for your weapons thus ensuring that you will be able to launch a steady attack.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars" target="_blank">
           Guild Wars
          </a>
          has already become an addiction. Why would I when I myself know that it has changed the way I live my life? A common question Im asked by family and friends is  How has that game affected your life for the better?. I really have no singular answer to this. The best I can do is list down the ways Guild Wars has changed my views in life.
         </p>
         <h2>
          1. Life is a strategy game.
         </h2>
         <p>
          I know many people see life as a game of chance and I was one of those people before I started playing Guild Wars. I used to take a lot of uncalculated risks that resulted too many failures. But when I became addicted to Guild Wars, all that changed.
         </p>
         <p>
          You see, there is no room for uncalculated risks in Guild Wars. Every move you make during a conquest needs to be well thought of. Of course, there are still some risks involved but before you make your move, you need to be ready for all the possible scenarios that will arise.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is how I live my life today. I always plan ahead and make sure to envision the consequences of my actions. If I dont think the possible outcomes are worth it, I steer to another direction. Its as simple as that.
         </p>
         <h2>
          2. Patience is a virtue.
         </h2>
         <p>
          Like with any game, you dont start out with a strong character when you first start playing Guild Wars. It takes time, effort, and resources to build an unbeatable character. It took me almost 6 months before I was able to strengthen my characters skills and traits. Three years into playing the game, I am still in the process of building an inventory of equipment and tools worthy of a trophy.

          Through the game, I have learned to value the importance of patience in real life. I now understand that success does not come quickly or easily. This has changed the way I look at everything from career growth to simple things like marinating a steak overnight.

          It seems like the

           developers of Guild Wars

          come out with an update every other week. It can get pretty annoying especially when youve worked on a strategy for days only to find out that one of the vital aspects in your game plan has been redesigned. This was the case for me the first year I started playing Guild Wars. It became so irritating that I almost decided to quit the game. If it werent for the talk I had with another player, I probably would have.

         <p>
          He told me that that like in real life, the world and scenarios in Guild Wars change according to the times. He added that the only way to survive these changes is to learn to roll with the punches even if it meant I had to go back to the drawing board and come up with a new strategy.
         </p>
         <p>
          I now apply the same principle in real life. I have learned to not sweat the small stuff and just go with the flow.

          Over the years Ive been called many things: gaming addict, degenerate gamer, life-waster and more. Never have I been called what I really am: successful small business owner. It never made sense to me to go and work for someone else who told me what to do, how to do it, when to do it and when I was allowed to take holidays. It was actually a disturbing thought for me. I liked and always have liked playing games. Yes, I may play games like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars">
           Guild Wars
          </a>
          too much but I could say others watch too much TV. At least gaming is interactive, fun, useful and not brain numbing. In fact, shortly after I started playing Guild Wars I started applying learnings to my newly started pressure washing business. Doing so helped increase my revenues and the company culture flourished. Let me tell you what I learned, how I applied it and how you can do the same. Enjoy.
         </p>
         <h3>
          What I learned from Guild Wars
         </h3>
         <p>
          Before getting into how I applied what I learned playing Guild Wars let me tell you the 3 main things I learned that I ended up transferring to my business.
         </p>
         <h4>
          1. Specialists, Not Jack-of-all-Trades
         </h4>
         <p>
          In Guild Wars you have character creation and professions. You choose not only the look of your character but their profession. All this means is you pick what specialist skills your character has. None of the character are 70% good at everything they are always very specialized. This was a key learning for me. I always grew thinking it was better to be sorta good at everything instead of deadly at a very small number of things. Playing Guild Wars taught me the importance of specialist characters in the game and in real life. Think about a NBA player. They make millions and are good at playing one sport.
         </p>
         <h4>
          2. Cooperative Missions
         </h4>
         <p>
          When you only have one specialist character you need to team up with other different specialists not the same specialists to complement each other and complete missions. Think about if you had a company full of good computer programmers but zero salesman. Yes, youd have a great product but no one would know about it and youd go out of business fast. You need to form a team to complete your mission of making a profitable good business.
         </p>
         <h4>
          3. Guild Alliances
         </h4>
         <p>
          Guild Wars taught me the power of not just forming a useful team that you ally with but also the power of allying with other good teams who know about other missions and quests. Think about it like Microsoft forming a partnership with Facebook. They are both on a different mission but can be useful to each other in certain areas. Guild Wars taught me the importance of this tactic in business as well as in gaming.
         </p>
         <h3>
          How I applied my gaming experience to my pressure washing business
         </h3>
         <p>
          So now that I explained the 3 main things I learned from Guild Wars let me tell you how they applied to my pressure washing business for the good.
         </p>
         <p>
          I started hiring specialists instead of people that could do a little of everything. I hired a small engine mechanic to perform maintenance on our
          <a href="http://pressurewashr.com/best-heavy-duty-power-washer-on-the-market/">
           fleet of heavy duty gas pressure washers
          </a>
          . I hired an accomplished internet marketer to get us more business from online. I hired a specialist wood deck sealer to perform our wood deck pressure washing. You get the idea.
         </p>
         <p>
          For the cooperative missions applied to my business we basically just created weekly goals and rewards for achieving the goals. An example would be to
          <a href="http://pressurewashr.com/">
           research and purchase the best new pressure washers
          </a>
          if we had units that were going to cost more to repair than we could buy for. Another example was to get 5 new clients before the weekend even if it meant going door-to-door. These missions involved all employees and were fun and we had celebrations when we achieved our goals.
         </p>
         <p>
          In terms of forming an alliance with other teams we became friends with the local hardware store employees and the local gym employees and the local delivery company. These partnerships allowed us special deals that kept everyone happy. And we all know a happy employee is the best type.
         </p>
         <h3>
          How you can do the same even if you have no gaming experience
         </h3>
         <p>
          You see how gaming skills have direct transfer to business? It really isnt rocket science it is just about looking at things from a strategic point of view like you would in a game. Try thinking of your business as a game where the mission is to make more money by getting more clients. Go and try to win the game!

          Addiction to video games doesnt really give anyone a reputation for being cool. But according to a latest study, video gaming actually improves self-confidence. Researchers indicate that gamers are triggered to take on personality characteristics they desire, which in turn enhances their self-esteem. While anything that enhances self-esteem is a good thing, we still think interacting in social gatherings is better off than logging time in front of a PlayStation 4.
         </p>
         <p>
          Its believed that the feeling of insecurity is one reason why people with low self-esteem are worried of being accepted or liked by their peers and significant others.
         </p>
         <p>
          Research Studies
         </p>
         <p>
          In one psychology study, researchers created and tested video games specifically made to help people improve their self-esteem, or
          <a href="http://www.video-game-addiction.org/">
           simply made them more addicted
          </a>
          . Within the study, researchers asked the participating games how they felt of their ideal characteristics after game play. The answers indicated that participants have increased their self-esteem instead of neglecting self-worth.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another study showed that self-esteem is highly influenced by certain thinking approaches. Difficulties in self-esteem stem from peoples critical views which concern their performance and characteristics, and the assumption of others rejecting them. In comparison, people who are more secure of themselves tend to have automated thought processes that allow them to be confident and not worry about any social rejections.
         </p>
         <p>
          Taking on Preferred Roles
         </p>
         <p>
          The attractiveness of video games presents opportunities for people to assume a role they prefer and then having the chance to take on such role. When someone wants to be more outgoing and plays with such personality, it allows that person to feel twice better during game play. This is actually a good thing, considering that average gamers would spend endless hours every week playing video games. Unless, youve set time aside for this virtual past time, its not recommended to squeeze endless hours of gaming for the sake of boosting self-esteem.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the ways that gaming has helped many people is to give them a larger soft network of connections. People they can chat with and connect with, and sometimes even meet with in person. For instance, through my gaming and online work, Ive been able to connect with many people, including Mark from
          <a href="www.paintballenthusiast.com/">
           Paintball Enthusiast
          </a>
         </p>
         <p>
          Workout Routines
         </p>
         <p>
          Aside from playing video games, making a switch to workout routines and immersing in social gatherings will not only provide a post self-esteem enhancement, itll also lead to healthier and strong body  and it usually feels good, regardless if youve become daring, physically attractive, or confrontational. So while no one will get knocked over for spending endless hours in front of a game console, it would feel a lot better to get more done by hitting the gym and taking part in social events.
