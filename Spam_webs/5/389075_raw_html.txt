They are very valuable because front-end engineers carry the design from idea to conception and you need to execute a beautiful UI and UX in only 24 hours. Your team only has one attempt (or a rare second attempt). It cannot be too experimental because it would be difficult to code. It cannot have too many features because there is not enough time to showcase it all during presentation. Just optimize for 1 to 2 primary features to maximize the judges WOW factor.

We brainstormed different ideas, but it wasnt the idea that I pitched that convinced Harry to team up. It was through our mutual understanding that the mentality and expectation we set for ourselves was to go big or go home. His will to win matched mine and he had skills that engineers usually lack. Coupled with a drive to win, Harry was extremely skilled in the following:

            You really have to build out the app. Show some good code. Get ready for some Backend / Database / Algorithm questions. Typically they want to know how scalable the tech or the product can be, where the edge cases are, and where it can break. Technical judges think technically, logically, and in depth. They value Conventional Economics over Behavioral Economics. Play to those pointsusually having a simple app with tons of customer validation, and/or market analysis will not impress.

            These guys are driven by business fundamentals. They want to know the market size. They want to know the opportunity for your hack to integrate with their investment portfolios ecosystem. Extra points if some other company has done your business model + integration + hack + community combination before. Cite those examples! Historical data in this case measures potential $$$ opportunity.

However, because we were focused on the back-end, we neglected to create a fully functional front-end product experience. While it was still a good overall hackathon, no judges questioned us on how we loaded data into our app. They only looked at the front-end user experience, which we didnt leave time to work on.

            We realized that with the judging panel, they would focus on the storytelling and that a good concept combined with some solid design prototyping would likely be sufficient. Both being children of immigrants coming to the US, we told our personal story to convey the importance for immigrants to engage with free courses (ex: English, Computer, Health, or Personal Finance) or services (Food Drive, Free Concerts and Museums) within the community via calendar, list, and reminder features. We spent a lot less time than other teams on our actually hack, but our approach paid off.

           If you are the 1st team to present, prepare for a lot of different questions because all the judges are awake. After 10 presentations, there will be no more questions. If there is no question, quickly speak up. Continue to create selling points and talk about your user feedbacks. Show artifacts and evidence that you went out to test it. Talk about the results and what you learned speaking with those customers. The time is yours to loseso maximize it.

Optimize for those time, otherwise the judges are just staring into space.

           My biggest takeaway I have after participating in more 40 hackathons is:
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            its the people you worked with that matter the most.
           </em>
           Its the opportunity to test out team chemistry, interaction style, and handle pressure together as a team. The jokes and bantering you guys tell each other during the hackathon, the time spent while eating, or the late night emailing back and forthare mirrors of whats its like starting a startup, its just that at a startup, you are now doing that every single day.

           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            After you win with a team, youll get to ask yourself, do I really want to do this everyday and turn this into a startup? How can I graduate from Hacker-Market Fit to Founder-Market Fit? How I can turn this hackathon project into a startup?
