               broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions asserts that peoples daily experiences of positive emotions compound over time to build a variety of consequential personal resources. The authors tested this
               <em>
                build hypothesis
               </em>
               in a field experiment with working adults (
               <em>
                n
               </em>
               = 139), half of whom were randomly-assigned to begin a practice of loving-kindness meditation. Results showed that this meditation practice produced increases over time in daily experiences of positive emotions, which, in turn, produced increases in a wide range of personal resources (e.g., increased mindfulness, purpose in life, social support, decreased illness symptoms). In turn, these increments in personal resources predicted increased life satisfaction and reduced depressive symptoms. Discussion centers on how positive emotions are the mechanism of change for the type of mind-training practice studied here and how loving-kindness meditation is an intervention strategy that produces positive emotions in a way that outpaces the
               <em>
                hedonic treadmill

              A paradox surrounds positive emotions. On one hand, they are fleeting: Like any emotional state, feelings of joy, gratitude, interest, and contentment typically last only a matter of minutes. Moreover, positive emotions are less intense and less attention-grabbing than negative emotions (

               Ellsworth &amp; Smith, 1988

              ). Yet on the other hand, research indicates that positive emotions contribute to important downstream life outcomes, including friendship development (

              broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions outlines a possible path: Because positive emotions arise in response to diffuse opportunities, rather than narrowly-focused threats, positive emotions momentarily broaden peoples attention and thinking, enabling them to draw on higher-level connections and a wider-than-usual range of percepts or ideas. In turn, these broadened outlooks often help people to discover and build consequential personal resources. These resources can be
              <em>
               cognitive
              </em>
              , like the ability to mindfully attend to the present moment;
              <em>
               psychological
              </em>
              , like the ability to maintain a sense of mastery over environmental challenges;
              <em>
               social
              </em>
              , like the ability to give and receive emotional support; or
              <em>
               physical
              </em>
              , like the ability to ward off the common cold. People with these resources are more likely to effectively meet lifes challenges and take advantage of its opportunities, becoming successful, healthy, and happy in the months and years to come. Thus, the personal resources accrued, often unintentionally, through frequent experiences of positive emotions are posited to be keys to later increases in well-being. Put simply, the broaden-and-build theory states that positive emotions widen peoples outlooks in ways that, little by little, reshape who they are.

              The key hypotheses of the broaden-and-build theory have received empirical support from multiple laboratories. First, the

              </em>
              holds that positive emotions broaden peoples attention and thinking. Experiments have shown that, relative to neutral and negative states, induced positive emotions widen the scope of peoples visual attention (

As the novelty of an experience subsides, peoples emotions tend to revert to a trait-like baseline. In this study, we sought to overcome this challenge by using an induction based on meditation.

             <p id="P7">
              We suspected that meditation would outpace the hedonic treadmill for several reasons. First, it incorporates mindful attention, which has been shown to undo hedonic adaptation (

               Schwarz, Kahneman, &amp; Xu, in press
              </a>
              ). Second, unlike watching a film or receiving a gift, meditation practice is active and personalized. Participants can lengthen the meditation, alter their focus, or otherwise try to get more out of their practice, keeping it within a range that is feasible but not boring. Most important, participants can use the insights and psychological skills developed during meditation practice in many situations and life domains. Meditation, then, offers opportunities for enhanced emotions throughout the day, not simply during meditations, per se.

              </em>
              = 25), which required a daily practice of guided meditation lasting about 1 hr. As in past studies, trait anxiety was significantly reduced in the meditation group. Both immediately after the training period and 4 months later, electroencephalogram monitoring revealed that meditators showed increases in left-sided anterior brain activation, which has been repeatedly linked to greater positive, approach-related emotions (for a review, see
              <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R16" id="__tag_229893525" rid="R16">

              ). Meditators also showed a more robust and effective immune response to an influenza vaccine administered at the end of the training period, and the strength of this response was correlated with the magnitude of left-sided anterior brain activation. The suggestion that meditation practice increases positive affect is also supported by at least one experience sampling study (

              Most empirical work on meditation has centered on mindfulness meditation (e.g.,

               Teasdale et al., 2000
              </a>
              ). Because we were particularly interested in evoking positive emotions, we employed a related mind-training practice, loving-kindness meditation (LKM). LKM is a technique used to increase feelings of warmth and caring for self and others (
              <a class=" bibr popnode" href="#R60" rid="R60">
               Salzberg, 1995
              </a>
              ). Like other meditation practices, LKM involves quiet contemplation in a seated posture, often with eyes closed and an initial focus on the breath. Yet whereas mindfulness meditation involves training ones attention toward the present moment in an open-minded (nonjudgmental) way, LKM involves directing ones emotions toward warm and tender feelings in an open-hearted way. Individuals are first asked to focus on their heart region and contemplate a person for whom they already feel warm and tender feelings (e.g., their child, a close loved one). They are then asked to extend these warm feelings first to themselves and then to an ever-widening circle of others. Thus, LKM may well cultivate broadened attention in addition to positive emotions. According to the broaden-and-build theory, these two experiential consequences go hand in hand.
             </p>
             <p id="P11">
              In LKM, people cultivate the intention to experience positive emotions during the meditation itself, as well as in their life more generally. Moreover, mind-training practices like LKM are thought to not only shift peoples fleeting emotional states but also reshape their enduring personality traits (
              <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R17" id="__tag_229893516" rid="R17">
               Davidson et al., 2003
              </a>
              ), a coupling of momentary with long-term gains fully compatible with the broaden-and-build theory. We acknowledge that mind-training practices, including LKM, are not simply vehicles for improving emotion experiences. The primary goal within contemplative traditions is, instead, to learn about the nature of ones mind and dispel false assumptions about the sources of ones happiness (
              <a class=" bibr popnode" href="#R14" rid="R14">
               Dalai Lama &amp; Cutler, 1998
              </a>
              ). These insights can, in turn, shift peoples basic outlooks on themselves in relation to others, increasing empathy and compassion. Approaching daily life with the new insights and outlooks developed through mind-training practice is what is thought to enhance peoples emotion experiences. That said, the goal of the present study was to test the build hypothesis, which required a means of reliably eliciting positive emotions over the span of months. We saw LKM as a suitable vehicle to meet this goal. Future empirical work is needed to test whether the cognitive shifts outlined by scholars of contemplative practices are indeed responsible for any success LKM has in enhancing positive emotions.
             </p>
             <p id="P12">
              LKM involves a range of thoughts and visualizations, and it directly evokes only select positive emotions (i.e., love, contentment, and compassion) and carries some potential to evoke negative emotions. Moreover, given the possibility of gradual shifts in peoples outlooks and personality traits, we expected the positive emotions generated by LKM to increase over time. Our study involved daily assessments of time spent meditating and of a wide range of discrete positive and negative emotions. This strategy allowed us to determine whether (a) positive emotions, measured directly, are responsible for any changes produced by LKM; (b) different classes of positive emotions (low- vs. high-arousal, e.g., contentment vs. amusement; or self- vs. other-focused, e.g., pride vs. love) are differentially induced by this practice; and (c) the effects of LKM on positive emotions increase (because of practice) or decrease (because of adaptation) over time.

The present study tests LKM in a larger sample, with a wider variety of outcome measures. Most critically, it gathers detailed data on positive emotions as a potential mediator of the benefits of this form of meditation.

             <p class="p p-first" id="P14">
              We conducted a randomized, longitudinal field experiment to test whether positive emotions, induced through LKM, build consequential personal resources. In designing our experiment, we grappled with selecting the most appropriate comparison condition. In laboratory research, we have used sham meditation (i.e., sitting with eyes closed) to achieve precise experimental control. For a 7-week intervention that asked participants for a substantial investment of time and effort, both ethical and face-validity concerns led us away from this sort of placebo meditation. Another approach is to choose a comparison condition that best addresses the current state of knowledge in a given area. Our review of the scientific literature had uncovered no published evidence that LKM could produce sustained increases in positive emotions and only limited and indirect evidence that positive emotions could build personal resources. Given this embryonic state of evidence, an appropriate initial comparison group would reflect treatment as usual, which, outside the clinical literature, is perhaps better phrased as life as usual. Thus, we chose a waitlist control design, which can assess treatment efficacy while controlling for self-selection, history, maturation, regression to the mean, and the effects of repeated testing (

              ). Although the groups differ in terms of experimenter demand, delivery format, and expectation of improvement, we address these limitations procedurally and analytically to the extent possible (see Discussion).

              In the context of a workplace wellness program, we offered a 7-week meditation workshop to employees interested in stress reduction and willing to respond to questionnaires and provide daily, web-based reports of their emotions. All volunteers completed an initial survey that assessed their life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and status on a range of personal resources. Volunteers were then randomly assigned to either our meditation workshop or a waitlist control group (which received the same workshop after the study ended). Over the next 9 weeks (including 1 week before and after the workshop), participants in both groups completed daily reports of their emotion experiences and meditation practice. About 2 weeks after the workshop ended, participants completed a final survey that reassessed their life satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and status on the same personal resources measured previously.
             </p>
             <p id="P16">
              In addition to daily reports of emotion experiences, which may well underestimate the frequency of emotion experiences, at the time of the final survey, participants also completed a detailed account of the emotions they experienced that particular day using the day reconstruction method (DRM;
              <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R44" id="__tag_305668770" rid="R44">
               Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, &amp; Stone, 2004
              </a>
              ). The DRM is a survey method that builds on the strengths of two older methods: time-use assessment and momentary data capture (i.e., experience sampling). Like each of these earlier methods, the DRM minimizes recall biases and provides a comprehensive picture of daily experience. Participants first reconstruct a detailed diary of this morning by dividing it into sequences of episodes. Next, they complete a series of questions, including emotion reports, for each episode of their morning.

              We predicted that participation in the 7-week LKM workshop would increase individuals daily experiences of positive emotions, over time across the 9 weeks of daily reporting and within the specific morning targeted by the DRM. Drawing from the broaden-and-build theory, we further predicted that increases in positive emotions, produced by LKM, would, in turn, build participants personal resources. To test the generality of the build effect of positive emotions, we targeted a wide range of personal resources, including cognitive resources (e.g., mindfulness, the ability to savor positive experiences), psychological resources (e.g., ego-resilience, environmental mastery), social resources (e.g., positive relations with others, social support given and received), and physical resources (e.g., illness symptoms, duration of sleep). Finally, we investigated whether these resources actually made a difference in participants lives. To do so, we tested whether any increments in resources, in turn, contributed to changes in overall life satisfaction, a judgment of fulfillment and well-being that differs from positive affectivity in its global focus and cognitive emphasis (

              </a>
              ). As a secondary way to assess whether newly built resources were consequential, we tested whether they led to decreases in depressive symptoms. We distill this series of predictions into the following overarching mediational hypothesis:

              portrays the conceptual model that underlies the build hypothesis as we tested it here. Note that this study does not directly assess momentary changes in broadened cognition, because of the lack of valid measures that could be used repeatedly and in the field, nor does it directly assess the cognitive shifts produced by LKM that trigger positive emotions. As such, this study evaluates positive emotions as a mechanism for the effects of LKM but does not further decompose the mechanisms by which LKM and positive emotions exert their influence.

               All study orientation sessions were held during employees lunch hour, in a large auditorium on Compuware premises. At orientation, Barbara L. Fredrickson or Michael A. Cohn introduced interested employees to the rationale for investigating the effects of meditation on health and well-being. We sought to enhance prospective participants investment in the study by describing benefits of meditation already featured in the popular press and regularly used to draw attendees to comparable workplace wellness courses, specifically, the potential to reduce stress and improve health and well-being. We also described the timeline of the study and the details of compensation and explained the value of gathering data from a waitlist control group. We did not describe LKM, the broaden-and-build theory, our hypotheses regarding mediation by daily positive emotions, or other information that might have created detailed expectancy or demand effects. Those who could not attend an orientation session received information by phone.

               Within the week following orientation, interested employees logged on to a secure website, gave consent to participate in the study, and responded to the initial (T1) survey (described below). Participants learned their group assignment (meditation workshop or waitlist control) only after completing the T1 survey.

               The daily reporting phase of the study began 1 week following orientation and continued for approximately 9 weeks. Each day, participants visited our secure website to complete a short report on their emotions and time spent in meditation, prayer, or solo spiritual activity over the past day. After approximately 1 week of baseline reporting, workshop classes and daily practice began for the meditation group (described below). Daily reporting continued for approximately 1 week after the meditation workshop ended.

               After the daily reporting phase ended, the final (T2) survey became available online. Participants visited our website a final time and completed the same measures as at T1, followed by a day reconstruction (described below) and a demographics questionnaire. After data collection was completed, participants received debriefing information explaining more about the details of the study.

During Week 1, participants practiced a meditation directing love and compassion toward themselves. During Week 2, the meditation added loved ones. During subsequent weeks, the meditation built from self, to loved ones, to acquaintances, to strangers, and finally, to all living beings. The first meditation lasted 15 min, and the final one lasted 22 min.

Participants were assigned to practice LKM at home, at least 5 days per week, with the guided recordings. The text of the guided meditations and week-by-week content outlines are available by request from Sandra M. Finkel.

A series of hierarchical linear models, with time nested within individualalso known as growth models investigated the impact of experimental condition, passage of time, and time spent meditating on self-reported emotions. An additional set of analyses examined participants emotions within a single morning, incorporating information about the amount of time that participants had meditated over the course of the study and whether they had meditated on the particular morning in question.

               We then tested the build hypothesis in a combined latent growth curve and path-analysis structural equation model (SEM). The growth curve for positive emotions from the hierarchical linear model analyses was reparameterized as a SEM-based latent trajectory model. In the path-analysis portion of the model, baseline positive emotions and slope of change in positive emotions predicted change in the targeted resource, which then predicted change in life satisfaction or depression. Each of the 18 resources we measured was tested in a separate model.

                The impact of LKM on positive emotions might be expected to be a function not only of experimental condition but also of individual effort put into daily practice. We tested a growth model for positive emotions that included the number of hours of meditation practice each week as a fixed effect, time-varying predictor, along with time and experimental condition. To allow us to examine any changes in the impact of meditation practice on positive emotions over the course of the study, we entered meditation practice for each week of the study as a separate variable. We deliberately left experimental condition in the model to test the unique contribution of time spent meditating each week, above and beyond the impact of participation in the workshop or interaction with the meditation instructor. Unexpectedly, time spent in meditation, prayer, or solo spiritual activity significantly predicted positive emotions during the baseline week before the workshops began (

                To estimate the impact of LKM instruction and practice on positive emotions, we tested a separate model with the meditators alone. By excluding the control participants, who were not receiving LKM instruction, we avoided diluting the estimate for the impact of meditation, prayer, or solo spiritual activity on positive emotions with non-LKM forms of spiritual practice. In this model, 1 hr of meditation practice during Week 2 was associated with a 0.06-unit increase in positive emotions (

Furthermore, even though meditation practice dropped after the workshop ended in Week 7, 1 hr of meditation practice in Week 8 still exerted approximately the same influence on positive emotions as it had in Week 7 (

                The DRM provided data on participants emotional experiences within the episodes of an ordinary morning. This offered a window into the impact of our intervention on emotional experiences in response to specific daily events, rather than emotions summarized over an entire day. Five participants did not provide DRM data, leaving 134 for analysis. There were 918 episodes recorded in total, with each participant reporting a mean of about seven episodes (

We estimated a series of models predicting positive or negative emotions for a given episode from experimental condition, total number of hours engaged in meditative activity over the course of the study, the time of day of the episode, whether the episode included meditation, whether the episode included social interaction, and the interaction between social interaction and total hours of meditative activity. This interaction term was included to explore whether LKMwhich focused on kindness and compassion toward othershad a specific influence on the participants response to interactions with others.

First, we added meditation at episode as a time-varying predictor to test the effects of engaging in meditative activity on positive emotions experienced during that same episode. Second, in place of the episode-level predictor, we added a dummy variable indicating whether or not participants meditated that day to test the effects of engaging in meditative activity on positive emotions experienced that day. Meditating during an episode predicted higher positive emotions during that episode (

We explored whether time spent meditating over the previous 9 weeks differentially influenced participants experiences of positive emotions, depending on whether they were interacting with others or not. We tested a model with time of day, social interaction, time spent meditating over the previous 9 weeks, and the interaction of social interaction and time spent meditating as predictors. The slope for social interaction was allowed to vary (Var

              <p class="p p-first" id="P68">
               We tested the full build hypothesis by combining a growth model for positive emotions with an SEM path analysis. This combined model used the strengths of growth modeling, which considers individual trajectories of change over time, and path analyses, which can examine direct and indirect effects in mediational models. The growth model for positive emotions was reparameterized as a latent trajectory model in an SEM framework (
               <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R13" id="__tag_338841771" rid="R13">

               ). Experimental condition and time spent meditating during the week predicted positive emotions for each week of the study. Time spent meditating was entered as a time-varying predictor. An intercept and slope for positive emotions over the course of the study were created by allowing the indicators for positive emotions, representing positive emotions during each week of the study, to cross-load on both intercept and slope latent variables. The latent variable that reflected the intercept of positive emotions, at baseline, was created by fixing factor loadings for the indicators to 1.0. The latent variable that reflected change in positive emotions over the course of the study was then created by specifying factor loadings that reflected week in the study (0.0 = baseline, 1.0 = Week 1, 2.0 = Week 2, etc.).
              </p>
              <p id="P69">
               In the path-analysis portion of the model, the intercept, representing each participants initial level of positive emotions during the baseline week, and slope, representing each participants rate of change in positive emotions over time, predicted change in his or her resources between T1 and T2, which then predicted change in life satisfaction between T1 and T2. In other words, each participants baseline level of positive emotions and individual rate of change in positive emotions over the course of the study, calculated within the latent trajectory portion of the model, became predictors in the path-analysis portion of the models we tested. Given our experimental design, only change in positive emotions (i.e., slope) was predicted to build participants resources. Thus, we predicted that the path from slope of positive emotions to resources would be significant, but the path from baseline positive emotions to change in resources would not. The resource variable was a difference score that represented change between T1 and T2 in the specific resource featured within each model. We tested the model for each resource assessed, and this was the only variable that changed across models. Last, the life-satisfaction variable was also a difference score, representing change in life satisfaction between T1 and T2. Thus, the model examined whether initial positive emotions and changes in positive emotions over the course of the study predicted changes in resources over the course of the study, which, in turn, predicted changes in life satisfaction over the course of the study. Participants with greater increases in positive emotions were hypothesized to exhibit greater increases in resources and, in turn, life satisfaction. A diagram of the model tested is depicted in

A multitude of factors may be associated with individual trajectories of change over time, therefore, it is rare for growth models or combined growth and path-analysis models to fit well when assessed using standard SEM fit indices, such as root-mean-square error of approximation (

               </a>
               ). For this reason, it is noteworthy that each of the models we tested produced an estimated root-mean-square error of approximation of less than 0.08 (range = 0.0680.076), indicating an acceptable fit to the data. Given that all of the models tested were acceptable fits to the data, and that overall model fit was influenced by the fit of the latent trajectory portion of the model (which was the same for each resource), we examined the significance of the individual path coefficients in the models for each resource to test the build hypothesis.

In other words, increases in positive emotions over the course of the study were associated with significant increases in these resources, which were, in turn, associated with significant increases in life satisfaction.

The direct effect from change in positive emotions to change in life satisfaction was not significant for any of the models tested, nor did the model fit significantly improve when this path was included. For the nine resources that were found in previous analyses to exhibit the predicted pattern of significant build paths, these path coefficients remained significant when the direct effect of change in positive emotions on change in life satisfaction was included in the model. These results indicate that changes in positive emotions only produced changes in life satisfaction to the extent that they built personal resources. This further underscores the conceptual distinction between transient experiences of positive emotions and global judgments of life quality (

These effects were generally nonsignificant, with values that varied depending upon the path and the resource being tested. There was one exception: The direct effect from time spent meditating in Week 2 to change in life satisfaction was significant for each of the 18 resources tested (e.g., mindfulness,
                <em>

Excluding this direct effect, there were other, isolated significant effects, which represented a total of 4% of the 360 path coefficients estimated, but there was no pattern to these effects, and they did not exceed the percentage of path coefficients that would be expected on the basis of chance alone. These results suggest that experimental condition and time spent meditating exerted their influence on resources and life satisfaction because of their impact on positive emotions.

               <p class="p p-first" id="P75">
                To explore whether positive emotions might beneficially influence measures of negative psychological adjustment through the same mechanisms by which they influence life satisfaction, we tested a series of models for which depressive symptoms was the ultimate variable in the model, replacing life satisfaction. In these models, change in positive emotions predicted change in the resource, which, in turn, predicted change in depressive symptoms. Model fit, as determined by root-mean-square error of approximation, remained acceptable. In addition, the predicted build paths were significant for the same nine resources for which these paths were significant when life satisfaction was the ultimate variable in the models. These findings suggest that increases in positive emotions decrease depressive symptoms through the same mechanisms by which they increase life satisfaction: built resources.

               <p class="p p-last" id="P76">
                We also examined the possibility that positive emotion directly influenced depressive symptoms, in addition to its indirect impact via built resources. In the first set of models, we examined the significance of the direct effect from change in positive emotions to change in depressive symptoms (Path D). Unlike the results for life satisfaction, this path was significant for all models tested. In addition, the overall fit of the models significantly improved for all 18 resources when this path was included in the model (

This pattern of results suggests that increases in positive emotions influenced the decline in depressive symptoms via both built resources and a direct impact on depressive symptoms. The one resource for which this was not the case was social support received, for which the mediated build paths were not significant when Path D was included.

               To test for possible effects of differential participant completion on our results, we repeated the analyses above using our intent-to- treat and per-protocol samples.

               ) generally showed the same significant paths in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol samples. Positive emotions significantly predicted savoring the future only in the completer sample, and change in ego resilience significantly predicted change in life satisfaction and depression in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol samples, even though it did not do so in the completer sample. Overall, the hypothesis that positive emotions help people build consequential personal resources was supported in the intent-to-treat analysis. However, these analyses suggest that conclusions about the efficacy of LKM may need to be restricted to individuals who invest adequate effort in training and practice (approximately 70% in this sample).

              ) states that, over time, recurrent experiences of positive emotions allow people to build consequential personal resources. The data reported here provide the first experimental test of the build hypothesis. The findings are clear cut: The practice of LKM led to shifts in peoples daily experiences of a wide range of positive emotions, including love, joy, gratitude, contentment, hope, pride, interest, amusement, and awe. These increases in positive emotions were evident both within the trajectories of change in daily emotions over the span of 9 weeks and within a detailed analysis of a given morning 2 weeks after formal training ended. These shifts in positive emotions took time to appear and were not large in magnitude, but over the course of 9 weeks, they were linked to increases in a variety of personal resources, including mindful attention, self-acceptance, positive relations with others, and good physical health. Moreover, these gains in personal resources were consequential: They enabled people to become more satisfied with their lives and to experience fewer symptoms of depression. Simply put, by elevating daily experiences of positive emotions, the practice of LKM led to long-term gains that made genuine differences in peoples lives.

              is unambiguously supported by the evidence reported here. Most important, positive emotions emerge as the clear centerpiece of the model. LKM was beneficial precisely because it helped people experience positive emotions; direct effects of LKM, circumventing the hypothesized build paths, were virtually nonexistent. Positive emotions emerged as the mechanism through which people build the resources that make their lives more fulfilling and help keep their depressive symptoms at bay.
             </p>
             <p id="P80">
              These data also echo a message from our recent work that unpacks the relationship between positive emotions and life satisfaction (
              <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R12" id="__tag_382596421" rid="R12">
               Cohn et al., 2008
              </a>
              ). Although both can be considered facets of happiness or subjective well-being (
              <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R47" id="__tag_229893508" rid="R47">
               Lucas et al., 1996
              </a>
              ), we found positive emotions, and not life satisfaction, to predict change in resources. Furthermore, the association between increased positive emotions and increased life satisfaction was fully mediated by resource building. This suggests that people judge their lives to be more satisfying and fulfilling, not because they feel more positive emotions per se, but because their greater positive emotions help them build resources for living successfully.
             </p>
             <p id="P81">
              Nine of the eighteen resources we tested fit the hypothesized build paths. Of the remaining nine, six showed changes in the expected direction on the build paths (see
              <a class="fig-table-link table figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="/pmc/articles/PMC3156028/table/T4/" rid-figpopup="T4" rid-ob="ob-T4" target="true">

              </a>
              ). We speculate that these six resources may be affected by positive emotions, albeit less strongly or more slowly than other resources, and not that the build hypothesis is categorically inapplicable to them.
             </p>
             <p id="P82">
              The resources that did show significant build effects might be loosely grouped into two categories. The first involves having a loving attitude toward oneself and others and includes self-acceptance, social support received, and positive relations with others. The second involves a feeling of competence about ones life and includes pathways thinking, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and ego-resilience (which was influenced by positive emotions, although just shy of significantly influencing life satisfaction). We speculate that increases in positive emotions may impact these resources more rapidly and to a greater extent than others.
             </p>
             <p id="P83">
              This study confirms yet again that positive emotions are more than momentary good feelings. Laboratory experiments have documented that positive emotions broaden cognition (for a review, see
              <a class=" bibr popnode" href="#R32" rid="R32">
               Fredrickson &amp; Cohn, 2008
              </a>
              ). Now we have evidence from a field experiment to document that positive emotions also place people on trajectories of growth, leaving them better able to ward off depressive symptoms and become ever more satisfied with life. This experiment also carries the inspiring implication that people can take deliberate action to cultivate meaningful experiences of positive emotion and reap these benefits as a result.
             </p>
             <p id="P84">
              This field experiment also further documents the benefits of meditation. When people initiated a practice of LKM, they enjoyed payoffs both immediately, in terms of self-generated positive emotions, and over time, in terms of increased resources and overall well-being. Meditators even experienced enhanced positive emotions in ordinary life situations, especially those involving other people. This substantiates the claim that this type of meditation changes the way people approach life.
             </p>
             <p id="P85">
              We found that the effects of LKM were specific to positive emotions, without a comparable decrease in negative emotions. This resembles the work of

               Teasdale et al. (2000)
              </a>
              , who anecdotally reported that their mindfulness-based protocol does not reduce negative emotions but, instead, alters responses to negative emotions that can lead to depression (

               Segal et al., 2002

              </a>
              uncovered a marginal decrease in trait anger in their pilot study of LKM. They also observed reductions in anxiety and distress, but these may have been due to the studys central outcome of pain amelioration.

              </a>
              also found a decrease in trait anxiety with mindfulness-based stress reduction but only weak support for changes in negative emotion. Future work will need to resolve these inconsistencies.
             </p>
             <p id="P86">
              Another curious finding was the null effect of LKM on self-ratings of compassion. In hindsight, we speculate that our sole daily item for compassion (In the past 24 hours, what is the most sympathy, concern or compassion you have felt?) may have oriented respondents toward compassion felt in response to the suffering of others, rather than kindness or equanimity per se. If the suffering of others was not directly salient to participants on a daily basis, increases on this particular item may have been limited. We suggest that future work tailor measures of compassion to more directly reflect the teachings of contemplative traditions.
             </p>
             <p id="P87">
              A final puzzling finding was the initially lower level of positive emotions in the meditation group. We speculate that this difference reflects the difficulties of initiating any self-change effort, even if those changes are self-chosen. Consider the parallel to the perennial New Years resolution to lose weight to be healthier. At the peak of a persons motivation to shed pounds, he or she might join a local gym. Then, days later, the person realizes that he or she must actually go to the gym and exercise. Starting a meditation practice may similarly involve a period of doing something unfamiliar, difficult, and draining without immediate rewards. Contemplative traditions have articulated five obstacles facing novice meditators, including craving, anger, boredom, restlessness, and doubt (
              <a class=" bibr popnode" href="#R42" rid="R42">
               Kabat-Zinn, 2005
              </a>
              ). These obstacles are thought to result from increased awareness of challenging inner states that may be commonly present, although not noticed during ones typical busy and outward-directed focus. Indeed, nearly all attrition occurred during the initial weeks, when participants may not have been sufficiently in shape to feel competent at meditation or derive benefits from it. Yet if people can endure these first difficult weeks, meditation becomes more effective, and positive emotions begin to accumulate and compound, changing people for the better.
             </p>
             <p class="p" id="P88">
              Because we set out to develop a durable method of inducing positive emotions, the dose-response results we documented are particularly inspiring. We found that the amount of positive emotions participants gained per hour spent meditating increased over the course of the study, tripling from the first week to the last. Rather than becoming bored with or jaded to the effects of meditation, our participants seemed to be building a dependable skill for self-generating positive emotions again and again. These findings are especially noteworthy given that most of our participants were novice meditators and our meditation workshop lasted only 7 weeks.

              <p class="p p-first" id="P89">
               This study breaks new ground in several ways, which leaves ample room for future research to probe or refine its findings. First, the sample was predominantly White, educated, and motivated for self-change. Mindfulness-based programs have shown widespread emotional and medical benefits in diverse populations and for individuals without prior interest in meditation (
               <a class=" bibr popnode" href="#R40" rid="R40">

               </a>
               ), and it will be important to determine whether the same holds true for LKM. Second, the duration of the experiment was just over 10 weeks. In the future, it will be important to investigate the extent to which the resources endure beyond the end of the intervention or into periods of heightened stress or negative emotions. We found that after the formal workshop ended, time spent meditating and positive emotions decreased in tandem, even though meditation remained effective at evoking positive emotions.

               have argued that intentional activity is required to sustain gains in happiness. Future research will benefit from assessing the duration of gains or determinants of continued, independent practice. Finally, the current experiment did not include daily measures of broadened cognition, which would have allowed a more precise test of the proposed links between positive emotions, broadened thinking, and resources. Currently, no measures of broadening are valid, repeatable, and administrable outside the lab, but once one has been developed and validated, it will be an important contribution to this research program.

               Another necessity in future work will be to move beyond self-report data to eliminate concerns of shared method variance. Implicit or behavioral measures, observer reports, and physiological markers will be especially useful. Specifically, researchers can track changes in emotions over time with implicit or behavioral measures of affect (

               ). In a more recent study of LKM, we obtained observer reports from peers identified by study participants. Preliminary analyses suggest that, as expected, observers judge meditators to be more helpful than control participants (

               ), this experimental design can inadvertently create experimenter demand, expectation of improvement, or nonspecific effects related to delivery format. We address each possibility in turn: First, the explicit focus on love and kindness may have created demand to elevate self-reports of these emotions. However, our data indicated that (a) LKM was associated with changes in many positive emotions, not just the ones explicitly discussed; (b) guided meditations featured the terms love and compassion beginning in Week 1, yet the profile of changes in self-reported positive emotions (see
               <a class="fig-table-link fig figpopup" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F2" href="/pmc/articles/PMC3156028/figure/F2/" rid-figpopup="F2" rid-ob="ob-F2" target="figure">

               Second, simply participating in a meditation workshop might create the expectation of improvement. These expectations might give rise to positive emotions, such as hope and confidence, a legitimate, though nonspecific, effect of the intervention. We underscore that the increase in positive emotions evident in the current study did not appear until Week 3 (see
               <a class="fig-table-link fig figpopup" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F2" href="/pmc/articles/PMC3156028/figure/F2/" rid-figpopup="F2" rid-ob="ob-F2" target="figure">

               ), whereas placebo responses typically emerge rapidly (
               <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R63" id="__tag_229893501" rid="R63">
                Scott et al., 2007
               </a>
               ). Third, nonspecific effects of delivery format, including contact with a caring instructor, group interaction, and weekly work-release time might also have contributed to increases in positive emotions. However, we found that when controlling for group assignment, time spent meditating still predicted increases in positive emotions. Even among participants who received the nonspecific benefits, meditation itselfthe proposed core of the intervention predicted positive change. We also examined whether participants reported a boost in positive emotions on the day of workshop sessions or the day after, comparing waitlist participants, LKM participants who did not attend that weeks workshop, and LKM participants who did. The results did not differ from chance, suggesting that the higher positive emotions reported by LKM participants reflected a continuous upward trend, rather than a temporary response to the one day each week that involved time off of work, social support, and contact with the instructor. Overall, patterns in our data argue against spurious results arising from our use of a waitlist control group. Now that LKM has shown efficacy in increasing positive emotions and building personal resources, future work will be able to directly control for nonspecific effects and expectancies by comparing LKM with other meditative or self-change techniques.

              <p class="p p-last" id="P92">
               Another alternative explanation for our findings is that whatever positive emotions our participants were feeling at T2 cast a rosy glow over all their self-reports and artificially produced the appearance of growth in resources. The reports from the DRM provided an estimate of positive emotions for the day the T2 measures were completed. We regressed that days positive emotions on aggregate positive emotions over the 9 weeks of daily reports (
               <em>
                R
               </em>
               = .69) and created a residual term, representing positive emotions that were present at T2 and could have cast a rosy glow over responses but that were not present during the time resources were being built. We tested the residual variable in our mediational models, in place of change in positive emotions over time. It did not predict change in any of the resources. This suggests that positive emotions experienced over time exerted a gradual, cumulative effect, rather than simply biasing responding at the moment participants were responding to T2 questionnaires.

              <p class="p p-first" id="P93">
               One of the most deflating concepts facing positive psychology is the hedonic treadmill (
               <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R4" id="__tag_229893518" rid="R4">
                Brickman, Coates, &amp; Janoff-Bulman, 1978
               </a>
               ): Even though positive and negative events (e.g., winning the lottery, becoming paraplegic) temporarily alter levels of happiness, people quickly adapt to them and return to a fixed emotional set-point. The hedonic treadmill, as classically stated, implies that all efforts to improve happiness are doomed to failure. Yet more nuanced research (
               <a class=" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="#R19" id="__tag_229893499" rid="R19">
                Diener et al., 2006
               </a>
               ) indicates that adaptation is not necessarily inevitable and may be strongest for negative affect and weaker for positive affect and life satisfaction. The evidence reported here reveals that one way to outpace the hedonic treadmill is to begin a practice of LKM. Participants who invested an hour or so each week practicing this form of meditation enhanced a wide range of positive emotions in a wide range of situations, especially when interacting with others. We find these data especially promising. LKM appears to be one positive emotion induction that keeps on giving, long after the identifiable event of meditation practice.

               Positive emotions feel good, and feelings like love, joy, and contentment can be valuable in and of themselves. Yet the broaden-and-build theory posits that natural selection sculpted our ancestors positive emotions to be useful in more far-reaching ways as well. These desirable states built resources that gave our ancestors an edge in circumstances that impinged on their survival. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment to provide clear support for the build hypothesis. By random assignment, one group of individuals began a mind-training practice that increased their positive emotions and, in turn, their personal resources and well-being. Just as the broaden-and-build theory predicts, then, when people open their hearts to positive emotions, they seed their own growth in ways that transform them for the better.

               Preliminary analyses incorporated sex of participant as a predictor. It did not significantly predict positive emotions, the impact of experimental condition on positive emotions, or the impact of experimental condition on positive emotions over time. In addition, it was not related to the constructs we examine in subsequent models. For this reason, all reported analyses collapse across male and female participants, and we do not consider the impact of participant sex further.

               To address concerns about multicollinearity between experimental condition and time spent meditating, we tested a separate model in which number of hours of meditation practice was group mean-centered. The pattern of significant findings was identical, except that the impact of time spent meditating became nonsignificant for Week 3, as well as Week 4.

               Another way experimenter demand might have produced the results is if meditation participants gradually began to skip responding on days low in positive emotions. Meditation participants did respond less frequently over time (dropping from 5.2 to 4.6 responses per week), whereas waitlist participants did not,
               <em>
                F

               </em>
               .002. However, the week-by-week correlations between positive emotions and response frequency were very low in both groups. The sole significant correlation suggested that, if anything, the highest positive emotions were reported by participants who responded most frequently (i.e., least selectively). Also, recall that emotion measures were analyzed using per-participant means for each week, meaning that frequent responders did not contribute disproportionately to the data.
