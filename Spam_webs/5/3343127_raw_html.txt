         Weve all heard of a parallel universe and alternate dimensions where carbon copies of ourselves are thought to reside. Youd think these types of stories were reserved for episodes of Dr. Who but what if we had news of a parallel universe found?
        </p>
        <h2>
         <span style="color: #0000ff;">
          <strong style="font-weight: bold;">
           Woman From Another Dimension
          </strong>
         </span>
        </h2>
        <p>
         <img alt="Parallel Universe Found" class="alignright wp-image-815" height="222" src="http://topfoundfootagefilms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/achovnice-300x187.jpg" width="355"/>
         This is the strange story of when a woman from a parallel universe found herself in our reality. Is this a simple case of some sort of mental health problem or is there some substance to it?
        </p>
        <p>
         It is tale about a parallel universe found in Spain where a woman named Lerina Garca woke up one morning to find she was in our dimension instead of her own.
        </p>
        <p>
         She actually went online in 2008 to specifically ask for help off the experts as she was convinced she had slipped dimensions. Its a wonderful story in my opinion as she seems very intelligent and very lost at the same time  check out the first excerpt from her forum post back in 2008:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Hello, my name is Luz, I have 41 years and I think I jumped into a parallel universe. I find it hard to tell because everyone will think Im a psychotic, and no one will believe me. Please, if anyone has had a similar experience to write me an email
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         I dont know what it is  maybe its the fact that the message sounds calm yet lost at the same time? Something always grabs my attention in her post.
        </p>
        <p>
         She then carries on to explain that this all had nothing to do with time travel  she simply woke up one day and everything was different!
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141014636/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0141014636&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=footage-21">

         </a>
         She points out it was mainly the small things in her life that had changed. The first thing she noticed was the sheets on her bed had changed to sheets that were unfamiliar. She didnt really pay this much attention and set off to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         When she got to her office in work she found out that it was not there any longer. She looked at all the names on the doors but hers was not one of them. She thought she must of been on the wrong floor but she was not  this was the correct floor!
        </p>
        <p>
         It turns out she was working for this company but in a totally different department for a totally different supervisor  she has no recollection of switching departments!

         The transcript of her forum post I encountered had been translated from Spanish to English but they have not done the best job on it. From what I can gather I think she had a new boyfriend in her original home but once she arrived at this parallel universe found she was back with her ex. Read through the excerpt below and see if you can grasp what Im saying

        <blockquote>

          6 months ago Im not with my partner of 7 years, we left and started a relationship with a guy in my neighborhood. I know him well, Ive been 4 months with him and know his name, address, where he works as a child you have and where he is studying. Well, now there is this guy. It seems that existed before me jump but now no trace, I hired a detective to look for it and there in this flat

         It wasnt long before she thought she must be experiencing some sort of hallucination so she paid a visit to a psychiatrist. She was told it was all attributed to her stress levels but she does not go along with this theory.
        </p>
        <p>
         She cannot get over the fact that her boyfriend of 4 months ( see excerpt above ) never existed  both himself and his son seem to have been figments of her imagination!
        </p>
        <p>
         She also claims that her sister had an operation on her shoulder about three months before the dimension slip. Her family claim that her sister has never had any sort of medical procedure on her shoulder!

         Is this evidence of a parallel universe found? Is Lerina Garca a traveler from another dimension that has slipped through somehow?

        <p>
         Its a fascinating story made even more interesting by the fact she went online to find answers. She does plead at the end of her post not to be ridiculed as she really does feel lost ( you know how cruel some people can be on the internet! ).
        </p>
        <p>
         I seriously have no idea how to take this story  at times it really does tug on the heartstrings. She really does believe she is in the wrong placeshe believes she is lost!

         What are your opinions on her astonishing claim?

            I was amazed to find this story as I have been experiencing exactly the same kind of phenomena for the past two months or so.  I am desperate for an explanation and would love to get in touch with Lerina Garcia to compare notes. I feel I am just coming back to normal now but have a feeling of amnesia in that I can hardly remember what I did the day before.  Feeling very confused.  Such a huge relief to know someone else has had the same thing happen to them.  I need to find out more.

              Hi Lynette thanks for stopping by. Its amazing to hear you are suffering from the same sort of problem but you are not alone. During our research we have come across quite a few reports of this sort of case. I suggest doing a thorough Google search on the matter as there are many examples of this happening to people worldwide. You may well find a few answers
              <br/>
              Hope you feel better and get this sorted out soon.
              <br/>
              Thanks so much for stopping by and sharing your experiences with us.

              Hello. My name is Kevin. I am 30 years old. I am going to sound completely insane, but I think I can help you. In introduction, I would like to let you know that I am a thinker. I believe that every man knows right from wrong from birth as an inherent knowledge, and therefore do not need governing (in essence I believe in anarchy, or each man is a soul king, each woman is a soul queen). I believe that humans are slaves, and that if we change nothing then we cannot free ourselves, therefore I am a Human Abolitionist (my own term, meaning I free the people of earth, not just the races and nations). I do not believe in the gods of man, though I do believe in the true and powerful creator of our universe. I create theories and test them myself because I cannot find anyone willing to think alongside me. I have always resonated more easily with older people, because I have an old soul. I know things I shouldnt know, and I see things in a broader perspective than my age would suggest. A little background on why I am commenting. I am Black and Native American (my great grandfather was a Cherokee Chief). We have never followed any native american traditions in my family as long as I can remember, so what I describe to you next, for me, seemed extraordinary and strange, but familiar. When I was younger, I was what the Native American peoples call a Skin Walker or shape shifter (I actually had a friend who is a native american who follows tradition tell me that in my 20s, as I didnt know beforehand). In my sleep, I would disconnect from my own body and move freely around anywhere I wish. It would start in a dream, and I would realize (maybe from fear of a nightmare or having a boring dream) that I was dreaming and become conscious there. From there I was able to control the dream lucidly, leave my body, then travel to space or jump inside the bodies of animals. I tried other people, but they were too difficult. The thing is, I thought I was dreaming. Until one day when I was about 17, I slipped into a wolf and found a friends house. I wanted to scare him in my dream because he had wronged me in real life. So I hopped his fence as the wolf and saw his son, who I immediately begun growling at, because I knew my friend would in real life protect his son, but this was my dream and I wanted to eat his son in my dream. I did not, as he protected his son, contrary to my dream theory, and shot the wolf. And so I was jolted awake. When I awoke completely from the quick return to my body, I went about everything as normal, and about a week later I saw my friend. Now, between this time I had slipped into other peoples dreams and done many other things, but I thought they were just very realistic dreams in which I could do anything. So when I saw him, he starts to recount the story of a recent wolf attack in his own backyard. As he described it, I began interrupting and finishing his sentences. It was then that I knew that it wasnt a dream and that I was really messing with reality. My friend and I no longer speak because of that incident, and because of the reality check I lost my ability to leave my body for 13 years. I believe the experience that Lerina Garca and Lynette experienced is the same as what I have experienced, only a different aspect. I feel that if I show this to you, I can help you get home. What I used to do, someone wrote a book on it (found here:
              <a href="http://obe4u.com/files/the_phase.pdf" rel="nofollow">
               http://obe4u.com/files/the_phase.pdf
              </a>
              ). They call it The Phase. I am a very calm and rational person, but I also believe in metaphysics. Some of the methods described in this book are, eerily, the exact same methods I used to use to exit my body. I didnt know it then, but the more I read this book, the more I see. I have tried their methods, and, not to my surprise, they worked. I now can leave my body again. It is the same as before, except now I am more careful. My problem was Practice. I didnt understand before why I was able to leave my body, but now I do. Now, I dont even have to think about it. I was not sure my results were normal until I was just doing an internet search on metaphysics and came across Lerinas story, which led me here, and down to the comments. I believe I also know why this happened to Lerina Garcia and Lynette, and how they can get back to normal. I will tell you here instead of in email if space allows. In order to tell you, I must first tell you why I believe I know. As I said before, I am a thinker. I believe in learning and keeping an open mind. I do not limit myself to the physical or mental borders of others, and as such, in my mind, I am free to do whatever I want, and Think whatever I want. Even the impossible. I had a theory when I was 8 years old about electrically powering a hoverbike, which was all electric and had no lubricants. I wanted to make it real. I am about to attend school for Electrical Engineering for this purpose. I recently found out that the Chinese made a hover car for BMW based on my beliefs. Anyway, there have been many people who influenced my beliefs, but the main people have been ancient texts depicting the ships of gods (ancient as in they wrote what they saw and experienced and didnt just tell stories to make others happy) and people like Edward Leedskalnin (who created Rock Gate in Florida by himself, stating that he knew the secrets of how the egyptians built the pyramids and moved 2-10T stones by himself using magnets, and wrote a 4 books on it as well, found here:
              <a href="http://www.leedskalnin.com/LeedskalninsWritings.html" rel="nofollow">
               http://www.leedskalnin.com/LeedskalninsWritings.html
              </a>
              ). Now is when you will have to keep up, because I will be brief about as much of this as possible to not take up a lot of time, but this will inevitably be a long message. The universe, some scientists believe, was made from a big bang, created by Hydrogen gas, which in turn is the building block of this theory, along with Leedskalnins works. The hydrogen atom has 1 positive and 1 negative, as it is only made from 1 proton and 1 electron. Edward Leedskalnin, an electrical engineer and physicist (much like Nikola Tesla), proposed that atoms themselves are nothing more than magnets, and that they are cosmic force, flowing through everything. He theorized that the current diagram for atoms is incorrect, as there is no electron (but in truth there is not Neutron). In true understanding, he was not saying there is not one, he is saying that it is not as we have been taught, and the proton is actually North Pole magnet, and the electron is actually South Pole magnet (still no Neutron). Separating 1+ and 1- magnet is what creates electricity. If you move a magnet over a coil, nothing inside the coil moves, as science teaches us. There is no invisible fluid. What is actually moving is the magnets. They jump into a conductor as it is easier to move through, and as they move, we separate them to create electricity. In fact, I can show you videos on youtube and in person that show that all you need to create electricity is a magnet and a copper coil. To visualize the energy being used, attach them to a light bulb and you will see light. Why is this important to you? Because that same cosmic force is what brought you both here. The universe is made up of magnets. Everything in it is made up of compressed magnets. Your body is a conductor for these magnets, this is why electrical pulses are what keep you running. Your mind is the only thing you are. Your body is just the shell you use here or there, and they only resonate slightly differently in the spectrum. The universe exists on many planes, but and the planes transition into each other like the colors of the rainbow. During sleep, people sometimes experience out of body experiences because they separate themselves from their shell. This is the science behind it. The Yin and Yang govern us all, the Soul and Soul Mate. I theorize that the Yin Yang bagua is not just a symbol, it is an actual diagram of the true higher powers creation. Edward Leedskalnin said that they must run together, and when we separate them, they create electricity, and not only that, but all kinds of light (like ultra violet, gamma, infrared, and so on), light that you can see and some that you can not. I believe that he is right. Also, so do others, like an author named Michio Kaku, whose book Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel states theories that I obtained just by reading ancient texts and Edward Leedskalnins works. I make music, and even sound has poles, like magnets. Light also has poles, I believe, because the universe is made from magnets, but we only see the visible light on the color spectrum because those colors are closest to us in the wavelength. In saying that, our universe has poles as well. In pulsating between the poles, waves are generated, and depending what type of conductor the waves pass through, they create light, sound and and all of the elements of the periodic table. In pulsating, there are many places where the same sound or version of light is experienced. Since the universe has waves, there are millions of places the same effect of planet creation and evolution has happened through time. Meaning that Lerina and Lynette and all of us exist on multiple planes as the exact same person, with very little alteration in the timeline, and the further along the line we go, the less similarities we and our counterparts have, until we no longer even look the same. Similar to the movie The One with Jet Li, but broader in scope. I believe The Phase is this. Now, I promised so I will deliver. About getting you back, read the first book I posted about The Phase and out of body experiences, and encounter the phase with your own consciousness. From there, you will know how to get back. Basically, you only have to dream it, leave your current shell in this plane, imagine yourself home and you will be put back into place. I hope this helps. If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to me and I will do everything I can to make this as clear and painless as possible for you. I do wish you the very best on your journeys, and may you get back home.

               <p>
                This theory is my theory of the time/space continuum. It is the culmination of 22 years of work. The future time that others experience is  nothing more than the waves colliding together so that you, when your mind is clear to the clairvoyant, can see the future of what happened in someone elses past in the spectrum. Our future is alterable by small decisions due to this.

            I have experienced something like this some years ago, still to this day, I wonder how it happened, and can I do I again.  It is good to know that more people are experiencing similar travels.  I believe that it is important for all of use to come together to share our stories so we can find that common denominator.

            In my theory I would say because parallel universes have not yet been found and made a fact. There is only theories about them but if there is millions and millions of them for every desicion we make like USA can have a parallel universe where they never nuked Japan. So there beeing millions of parallel universe the chance is that his might happen. If you heard about that thebeatlesneverbrokeup.com in my theory it is possible that NASA or USA might had a scientist that proposed a parallel universe machine but got declined and because the parallel universe theory that decision in other universe is yes they might have made a machine with would work. Yes and No matters alot. We never know what is out there.

              Ok so Ive had the same experience. It happened a lot when I was younger (12-14). However, I would see the future in dreams and when I did it would be months or even years into the future. The first time it happened I was 4 and my brother was ordering a drink and I instinctively said sprite before he even had the chance to say it. I was correct. Ive had dreams about going to sonic with friends I hadnt met until 2 years later. A dream of seeing a chest in my friends house that I didnt encounter until 2 months later. But heres the crazy thing. Ive had dreams about the past as well. Let me explain in detail. My mother and I were staying in a hotel at the time and I had fell into a deep sleep. I saw myself in a hallway. There was a door. I opened it. Inside was my mothers closet but it looked different  there were items in there that I had never seen and some from my (and my brothers) childhood. I remember seeing a pair of red slippers with Elmo on them. I picked them up. it was almost like I was transported. This is a weird analogy but it was like the 3rd person view on call of duty, I could zoom in or out at my own will or move around but I couldnt affect anything. Anyway I saw my brother who was 4 at the time, I dont really remember much but what happened was probably insignificant. I was suddenly back in the closet. I saw a cerulean purse and I picked it up. I was transported to a bull fight. I could see my mom under some kind of sheltered patio on the sideline of the fight. She looked to be in her mid twenties (she had me when she was 31 btw) I remember she was wearing a blue crop top, the purse I picked up earlier and some high-waisted faded jeans. I went back to the closet, exited out the door I came in, and then woke up. While it was fresh in my memory I asked my mom about the bull fight and she confirmed that it did happen and that she was the age I saw her in the dream as. Im not sure if we reached the same brain wave pattern or whatever but I saw her past and I assume that those items in her closet were artifacts of some kind.

           <p>
            Im not sure what happened to me but I remember having moments of reliving the same day except because I was familiar with the events happening the ending was alternately different. This has happened multiple times especially during my early teen years.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember when I was 17 I became really sick. I had visited multiple doctors and even searched symptoms similar to what I was dealt. Out of three different doctors between family specialists and GI specialists non of them could identify what was happening to me. I am a male and I had severe cramping, bleeding, and lack of talorance for food and water.  I couldnt eat or drink anything without mind numbing pain and vomiting. this took effect over the course of exactly 21 days with which I had suffered tremendous amounts of pain and starvation.  I hadnt eaten or drank anything and I was losing 1-1.5-2 pounds a day. I was in the hospital every 3 days and constantly nearing death. I had become anemic and lost too much blood to function correctly. I was dying! And the doctors through the course of those 3 weeks hadnt had the slightest clue what was happening to me. On the 21st day of this I was rushed to a local hospital and been admitted. I remember them checking my vitals and the nurses and doctors swore they didnt know what could have been taking me like this. I remember I past out. I thought I was dying then and there but I woke up and the doctors had IVs in my left arm.  They told me that they knew what it was and explained the symptoms and origin of the disease.  Its called CROHNS disease and relative to irritable bowel syndrome. Two terms I had never heard before in my entire life! They told me its quite common for a lot of people. I spend 1 week in the hospital in recovery with medications specifically for the now known and identified disease which the night before the same doctors had no clue about nor were familiar with the symptoms of.  When I went home I began to hear more and more about people with crohns. There are commercials on television that I had never even seen before talking about treatment for this disease on the channels that I watch most often! I had never seen these before!  I couldnt understand what was happening. I didnt notice any other small or huge changes but its insane! I was expected to die and suddenly I was treated to live!  Its been 4 years since then.  I now am with the girl I met in the summer after 5th grade. I moved away with my mom and I lost her.  We met in community collage in 2012 on our freshmen year. She was different this time,  obviously,  but I mean Slightly out of place. It seems that She remember things about our past that I dont. there are people who supposedly knew me and I knew them but I dont! Not even slightly familiar! It had been 7 years since Ive seen her last! But there is something different
           </p>
           <p>
            Its just unbelievable that I am still alive. I sometimes believe that I may be in a coma in that hospital living the last 7 minutes of my brains activity in a long dream. I cant help but feel that this isnt my original home. I believe I slipped into a different reality where obviously I lived instead of died like I thought was going to happen. I cant say Im not satisfied with this world though. my goals and dreams happened here. In the previous world I thought Id never find Rachel (the girl I met in the summer of fifth grade) and I was dying but I all I ever wanted to do was find her. I felt as though it wasnt real for me to be dying at that time before I past out.  I felt as though i couldnt let it happen even if the doctors couldnt help me. I only wanted one thing.  To find her and live happily with her.  But like I said. I woke up in the same hospital same room but only with doctors who were familiar with the case and were treating it and I lived to find her. Im not sure how else to describe it
           </p>
           <p>
            My conclusion is that I was given a chance to be with her. But the difference is if I had have never slipped here I would have died and never found her.  But since I was given the chance I am forced to except her as this world treated her which is far from what I had expected and wanted.  She was raped at 14 by a 17 year old and I have endured numerous occasions of depression and suicidal tendencies over this I sometimes wish that I had have just died instead but Im here in this world where I got her back only not the way I knew her to be There is a sacrifice to these jumps Ive been with her for 2.5 years now.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I have to say is  If you JUMP planes of existence. You should expect some serious sacrifice of your old life And values.  You should expect to be confused,  hurt,  depressed,  suicidal,  and mentally changed from it

                I Probably shouldnt have put this up. its really not something to share but i feel there are no limits to the places you can go. and when you do. it can be quite devastating.

            I shouldnt be complaining really I guess I got what I wanted. The chance I begged for And I suppose this new world is my second chance at life I still suffer the depression over the changes from time to time but I suppose this was meant to happen   ? I dont know this is all too confusing still for me  I am currently a computer engineer and I have ententions to become and electronic engineer and physicist to perhaps create the gate to the other realms. It has to be possible to jump My guess is that machine is necessary to enhance the brains subconcious cognition in order to leap elsewhere. Either our minds are capable in certain condition or need a boost to leap or ALIENS FREAKIN TOOK ME TO A PARALLEL SOLAR GALAXY SIMILAR TO THE LAST ONE INSTANTLY!  ugh. Its so confusing and difficult to determine what really happened when I was unconscious Maybe I didnt swap realms. Maybe those doctors just came across the apiphany of a conclusion and figured it out.  I dont know Ive put a lot of thought into what could have happened and my mind has concocted numerous conclusions!  I cant wrap my mind around my fate but I know if this is the life I was given then it must be my destiny.
