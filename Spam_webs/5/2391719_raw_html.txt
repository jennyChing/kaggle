Figuring out what Power U means is something you can sorta guess. While predecessors like LL Cool J and Big Daddy Kane alienated part of their fan base by catering too much to the ladies, Meth managed to keep the balance. \"Back when I was nothin'\/You made a brother feel like he was somethin'\" were never far from macho sentiments like \"Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight, aight.\"&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It also helped that RZA's track sounds like a deranged video game and not some sappy tune. The pumped-up Diddy remix was like a brand-new song. Gone was Streetlife's chorus, replaced by Mary J. Blige's presence, which elevated this keep-it-real joint to royal R&amp;B status. Throwing in Biggie's \"Lie together, cry together, I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together\" from \"Me &amp; My Bitch\" gave the remix a touch of gangster.&lt;\/p&gt;","headline":"4.

The hungry eight MCs dared anybody to step to them, warning in the process that the game was about to change. The inventiveness (Meth's \"The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me *cough*\"), morbid humor (Ol' Dirty warning, \"I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse\"), and outrageous claims (\"Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel,\" says RZA) made the music industry take notice.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And that was the added beauty. \"Rejects\" of the biz, Prince Rakeem and The Genius' startling comeback was something resembling the plot from one of the beloved kung-fu films the Clan adopted for their signature sound. GZA closes by taking shots at mountain-climbing, guitar-playing A&amp;Rs: \"The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels\" (a shot at his former bosses, Cold Chillin').
