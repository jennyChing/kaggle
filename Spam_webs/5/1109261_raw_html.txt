  <meta content="The Planet Analog Community is the gathering place for designers -- newbies and wizards -- alike, interested in discussing and advancing the state-of-the-art in analog design techniques, technologies, integration and application. With design cycles shortening, analog expertise in high demand, and access to the truly experienced analog engineer lacking, Planet Analog fills the gap between theory and practice in a community devoted to the art." name="description"/>
