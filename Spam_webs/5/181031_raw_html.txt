       BY DADAJI J. P. VASWANI
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This meditation lasts 15 to 20 minutes.  It is a meditation of SIX steps.  Each step will take roughly two and half to about three minutes.  I will first explain to you all the steps and then you can start.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <b>
       FIRST
      </b>
      is the step of rhythmic breathing.  Breathe in slowly, 
easily, evenly, and deeply and then breathe out slowly, easily, evenly, and 
deeply.  Within three minutes you should be able to breathe in and out about 
ten times.  But you need not count.  I will do the counting for you.  And 
when the three minutes are over, shall ask you to move on to the second step. 
 As your breathing becomes rhythmic, your tensions will relax.  It may be 
better if you blend the repetition of OM with your breathing.  As you 
inhale, take in the breath, utter the sacred syllable OM silently.  Then 
exhale, take out the breath and as you do so, utter the sacred syllable OM 
orally i.e. with sound.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <b>
       SECOND
      </b>
      is the step of detached observation.  In this step, as an 
observer you have to watch the movements of the mind.  Detach yourself from 
the mind.  This is very, very important.  You are not the mind.  You are only 
watching the mind.  What is the mind doing?  What thoughts is it 
entertaining?  You are not the mind.  You are not thinking those thoughts.  
Just watch the mind.  Observe the mind without any judgment, without any 
criticism. You are but a silent observer; observe without judgment, without 
criticism.  You will find that as you detach yourself from the mind and just 
keep on watching it, its movements, gradually the mind will cease its 
activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then we come to the
      <b>
       THIRD
      </b>
      step.  The third step is the step of serenity, 
the step of peace.  In this third step, you may imagine yourself as a rock in 
the midst of an ocean.  Waves arise.  They dash against the rock.  The rock 
is unaffected, is calm, tranquil, peaceful, serene.  Waves arise.  Waves are 
the distracting thoughts.  They dash against the rock.  The rock is 
unaffected, calm, tranquil, peaceful, serene.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then we come to the
      <b>
       FOURTH
      </b>
      step.  It is the step where you realize your 
oneness with all that is, all men, all creatures, all things, all conditions. 
 You are not apart from others.  The others &amp; you are parts of the one great 
whole.  You are in every man, in every woman, in every child.  You are in 
every unit of life, in every bird and animal, in every foul &amp; fish, in every 
insect, in every shrub, in every plant.  You belong to all countries and 
communities, all races and religions.  You are at one with the universe.  
This type of meditation will fill your heart with loving kindness &amp; a spirit 
of compassion so that a stage may come when you will not wish to snuff out 
the life even of the smallest insect.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <b>
       FIFTH
      </b>
      is meditation on your immortality.  In the fourth step 
you have realized that you are not merely in your physical body.  You are in 
all that is, in the experience that we call death.  It is the body that drops 
down, the physical body.  But you will continue to be, even when the body has 
dropped down, you will continue to be in every grain of sand, in every drop 
of water, in every ray of sunshine.  Death cannot touch you.  You are 
immortal.  If you are at one with all humanity, then even if there is one 
human being alive, you are alive.  If you are at one with all living 
creatures, then even if there is but one creature breathing the breath of 
life, you are alive. Yes, you are immortal, immutable, eternal, deathless!
     </p>
     <p>
      And now we  come to the FINAL, the last, the
      <b>
       SIXTH
      </b>
      step.  In this step 
you breathe out peace and happiness, goodwill and bliss to all.  May all be 
happy and full of peace and bliss.  Think of all who dwell in the Northern 
lands and pray in the heart within: may all who dwell in the Northern lands 
be happy and full of peace and bliss.  Then think of all who dwell in the 
Southern lands and offer the prayer may all who dwell in the Southern lands 
be happy and full of peace and bliss.  Likewise, may all who dwell in 
Eastern lands and all who dwell in Western lands, may they all be happy and 
full of peace and bliss.  Breathe out peace and goodwill to all.  May all be 
happy and full of peace and bliss.  All living things whether they be near or 
far, tall or tiny, rich or poor, educated or illiterate, whether they be born 
or are still in the womb unborn, may all, all, all be happy and full of peace 
and bliss.  May those that love and those that for some reason or the other 
are unable to love you, may those that speak well of you, and those that for 
some reason or the other are unable to speak well of you, may all, all, all, 
without exception, be happy and full of peace and bliss.  You are in them 
all.  It is only when they become happy that you are happy.  May all be free 
from disease, ignorance, sorrow.  As you get up from this meditation, you 
will find that you yourself are happy and full of peace and bliss.
     </p>
     <p>
      And now if you are ready, we shall begin with the meditation.  Sit in a 
relaxed posture; as far as possible, the back, the neck and the head should 
be in a straight line.  In the beginning you may find it difficult to bring 
them all in a straight line but do it as far as possible.  Above all, be 
relaxed.  Relax your body.  Relax your muscles.  Relax your limbs and now let 
us embark on this interior journey, a journey that takes us within, a journey 
that in due course may change our lives and fill us with tranquillity, with 
peace and bliss and make us instruments of GODS help and healing in this 
world of suffering and pain.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
      <b>
       FIRST
      </b>
      step, the step of rhythmic breathing.  Therefore, breathe in 
slowly, easily, evenly, deeply, as deeply as possible and to make your 
breathing deep, one thing that will help you is, when you exhale, try to 
breathe out as much as possible.  Now take the first step: Empty the lungs as 
far as possible.  Now inhale.  Take in the breath and utter the sacred 
syllable OM silently.  Then exhale, take out the breath and as you do so, 
utter the sacred syllable OM orally, with sound.  
Begin:  Inhale............(PAUSE)..............Exhale,  
OM............................(PAUSE)
OM..........................................................................
..........................(PAUSE)
OM..........................................................................

..........................(PAUSE)
OM..........................................................................
..........................(PAUSE)

Some of you feel so relaxed and at peace that you would love to be in this 
state for a longer period.  When you do your individual meditation, you can 
increase this period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now we come to the
      <b>
       SECOND
      </b>
      step;  it is the step of detached observation.  
Detach yourself from the mind, watch the movements of the mind.  Dont get 
involved with the mind.  You are not the mind.  You are only a silent 
observer.  Watch the mind without any judgment.  No judgment.  This is very, 
very important.  Only observe the mind.  Watch the movements of the mind. 
Watch them.  Dont get involved with the mind.  You are not the mind.  You 
are only a silent observer.  Watch the movements of the mind even as you 
would watch the movements of a little child who is trying to be naughty.  
Dont pay attention to your breathing.  Only watch the movements of the mind, 
sitting easily in a relaxed posture.  Watch what the mind is 
doing...................................................................( 
__mins of silence).  Dont pay attention to the breathing.  Only watch the 
movements of the mind.  Watch as a silent observer.  Watch without 
judgment................(__mins of silence). 
Be relaxed.  See that the muscles around the eyes  and those around the mouth 
are relaxed.  Relax, relax, relax, 
relax...........................................(___mins of silence).
The next three mins are over.  We have had in all a little over six minutes 
of meditation.
     </p>
     <p>
      We move to the
      <b>
       THIRD
      </b>
      step.   It is the step of serenity and peace.  I 
imagine that I am like a rock in the midst of an ocean.  Waves arise;  
distracting thoughts come to me.  They dash against the rock; but the rock is 
unaffected, unmoved, calm, tranquil, peaceful,  serene.  So many waves come.  
Perhaps I have done something during the day which I should not have done.  
Let that not disturb me.  I am a rock in the midst of the ocean, unaffected, 
unmoved.  Perhaps I have not done something which I should have done 
something which I should have done.  Let that not disturb me either.  I am a 
rock in the midst of an ocean, unaffected, calm, tranquil, peaceful, serene: 
calm, tranquil, peaceful,..............................................(    
mins. of silence).
Some past memory comes to me.  Let that not affect me.  I am a rock in the 
midst of the ocean: calm, tranquil, peaceful, serene:  calm, tranquil, 
peaceful, 
serene........................................................................
............ (  mins of silence.)
Dont pay attention to your breathing.  Dont watch the movements of the 
mind.  You have only to imagine that you are a rock in the midst of the 
ocean, unaffected by anything that may have happened, unaffected by anything 
that may happen. You are like a rock in the midst of an ocean - calm, 
tranquil, peaceful, serene;  calm, tranquil, peaceful, 
serene..................................................(       mins. of 
silence).
     </p>
     <p>
      We now come to the
      <b>
       FOURTH
      </b>
      step:  It is the step of realizing the oneness 
with all that is;  all human beings, all creatures, all birds, all animals, 
fish and foul, insects, even mosquitoes, all trees and shrubs and plants.  I 
am  one with them all.  I am in the  lowliest of the low, in the poorest of 
the poor.  I am in the meanest of the mean, in the most wretched, the most 
miserable.  I am in him.  He is not apart from me.  Oneness, oneness with 
all.  Out of this cometh  true love.  If  I  am one with all, I am in the 
lizard of which I am afraid. I am in the cockroach which I want to kill.  I 
am in all; I am in all; I am in all.  How can I kill anyone?  How can I 
criticize anyone? How can I judge anyone? How can I think ill of 
anyone?.......................................................................
.......(    mins of silence).
I am in all that is.  What a wonderful feeling this is.  No-one is apart from 
me.  Everyone, everything is a part of me.  For  I am  the universal  self:  
TAT VAM ASEE.  That art thou.  Thou are not the physical body that thou has 
worn during this period of earth incarnation. Thou art that, Thou art that;  
Thou art that, the universal self.  Relax, relax, relax.  Let your backbone 
be straight.(  mins of silence)
     </p>
     <p>
      And now we come to the
      <b>
       FIFTH
      </b>
      step.   If  I am in all, if I have realized 
my oneness with all, I can never, never die. It is only when I feel  I am 
this physical body that I live in fear of death. Now I can challenge death.  
Death, you cannot touch me!  You can only take away the physical body.  But I 
am in all.  So long as there is one human being alive on earth, I am alive.  
So long as there is one creature that breathes the breath of life, I am 
alive. So long as there is a leaf fluttering in the wind, I am alive.  I can 
never die.  I have never died.  I am eternal.  I am immortal.  I am 
immutable.  I am deathless.  I am in every ray of sunshine, in every drop of 
rain, in every grain of sand.  I am one with all that 
is...............................(   mins of silence)
By now your breathing has become deep.  Be relaxed;  see that your spine is 
straight.  See that there is no tension in the muscles around your eyes and 
around your mouth.  See that there is no tension in the muscles of your legs. 
 Relax, relax, relax 
..............................................................................
........(   mins of silence).
You are not the physical body.  You are not the body-mind complex.  You are 
the universal self, the oneself that is in all.  In all that is 
..................(   mins of silence)
     </p>
     <p>
      And now we come to the FINAL step, the
      <b>
       SIXTH
      </b>
      step: the step in which we 
breathe out love and goodwill and peace to all: I love you all,  I love you 
all.  Let that aspiration come out of the very depths of my heart.  In the 
measure in which I give love to others, love will flow back to me and I will 
always have plenty of love to give to everyone who meets me. Love all in the 
Northern countries, in the Southern countries, in the Western countries and 
in the Eastern countries:  I love everyone,  I love you, I love you and I 
pray that you all may be happy, full of peace and 
bliss........................................................................
..........(     mins of silence)
I love those that love me and also those who for some reason or the other 
are unable to love me.  I  love those that speak well of me and also those 
who for some reason or the other are unable to speak well of me.  Actually  
call out someone by name - someone who you think does not love you, does not 
speak well of you and say  Mr. X, Y, Z,  Mrs. X, Y, Z,  Miss X, Y, Z,  I 
love you, I love you,  I love you all.  May you all be happy and full of 
peace and bliss. ....................(      mins of silence)
     </p>
     <p>
      By GODS grace, our period of silence is over.  And now let us rub the 
palms of our hands together and gently, very gently, softly, very softly, 
touch them on the eyes and open them.
