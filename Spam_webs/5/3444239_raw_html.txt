13 Therefore, gird your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, 15 but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; 16 because it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy." property="og:description"/>

             Introduction
            </h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Upon entering seminary in Dallas a number of years ago, I worked part-time in the warranty division of John E. Mitchell, a manufacturer of automobile air conditioners. One day a fellow-worker who wanted to cut a piece off of a two-by-four quickly decided to use a saw set up to cut aluminum. With a 15-inch blade powered by a 5-horsepower motor, that radial arm saw was awesome. But there was no stop on the saw to hold the piece being cut. As my friend began to saw, the teeth caught the blade thrusting the board through the wall behind the saw! My friend escaped unhurt.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Today I own a considerably smaller radial arm saw, but I have never forgotten that incident. Because I fear my power tools, I use my radial saw with great caution. John Maurer, a friend who has a number of saws much bigger than mine, has a great deal of respect for his saws too. John has remarked that the most dangerous tool in a wood shop is the shaper. Because the shaper does not look or sound as dangerous as the other tools, workmen may become careless in its use.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             We often think of fear in negative terms, as a non-productive or even counter-productive force. In truth, fear may be very positive and productive. Peter speaks in verses 1 Peter 1:17-21 of our text about the fear which should characterize Christians. We find the principle command in verse 17: Conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay upon earth
             <b>
             </b>
             (verse 17).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Certainly the fear of God is not characteristic of a pagan culture. Sadly, all too often a proper fear of God is not a prominent part of the Christians life either. Fear is viewed as harmful by our culture. Children have no fear of their parents. Citizens have no fear of lawful authorities. And yet Peter tells us to live out our lives in fear. Surely this kind of fear does not come naturally for us or for Peter. A careful study of our text can provide helpful understanding of that fear which compliments our faith and our hope in God.
            </p>
            <h3>
             The Structure of our Text
            </h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Our text falls into three parts: Verse 17 introduces the subject of fear with a command to live in fear, and one reason is set down as a basis for fear. Verses 18 and 19 set down a second basis for our fearthe redemption which has been accomplished through the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary. Verses 20 and 21 set down a third basis for fearthe work of the Father in our salvation.
            </p>
            <h3>
             The Context of our Text
            </h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
             At the beginning of verse 1 Peter 1:17, the 
             <b>
              if
             </b>
             of the New American Standard Bible is rightly rendered 
             <b>
              since
             </b>
             by the New International Version:
             <sup>
              <a href="#P929_251971">
               21
              </a>
             </sup>
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Since you call on a Father who judges each mans work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The problem with their translation is the translators omission of the very important word 
             <b>
              and
             </b>
             which is found in the NASB:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             And if you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each mans work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay upon earth.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The best of both translations would catch the positive emphasis of both:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             And since you call on a Father who judges each mans work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The and is very important as it clearly links verses 1 Peter 1:17-21 to the two major commands Peter set down in verses 1 Peter 1:13-17:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ (verse 13).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Be holy yourselves also in all your behavior (verse 15).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Verse 21 shows us that the theme of hope is still in Peters mind. The fear Peter calls for is the other side of hope, and it is a strong motivation for living a holy life. Thus we have the 
             <b>
              and
             </b>
             at the beginning of verse 17. Peters final words in verse 21 are 
             <b>
              faith
             </b>
             and 
             <b>
              hope.
             </b>
             Not surprisingly, his subject in 1:22-2:3 is love, a love linked to the Word of God.
            </p>

             Living in Fear

             Peter assumes his readers are true believers and thus God is their Father (compare John 8:31-47 and Romans 8:14-16). The term here rendered 
             <b>
              address
             </b>
             has several uses. It is used for the giving of a surname or of ones surname (Acts 10:5, 18). It is also used a number of times with the sense of appeal. In the Book of Acts, this term is used for Pauls appeal to Caesar (see Acts 25:11-12, 21, 25, etc.). Many times the term is employed for ones call upon God for salvation or for help:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             AND IT SHALL BE, THAT EVERYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED (Acts 2:21).

            <p class="bodytext">
             And they went on stoning Stephen as he called upon [the Lord] and said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! (Acts 7:59; see also Acts 9:14, 21; 15:17; 22:16; Romans 10:12-14; 2 Timothy 2:22).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             If we are a child of God, there is a sense in which we can think of God as being there for me. But there is much more to the concept of God as Father than this. As Peter is about to indicate, the fact that God is our Father requires of us the holiness which fear promotes:
            </p>

             14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? 15 Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 16 Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, I WILL DWELL IN THEM AND WALK AMONG THEM; AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE. 17 Therefore, COME OUT FROM THEIR MIDST AND BE SEPARATE, says the Lord. AND DO NOT TOUCH WHAT IS UNCLEAN; AND I WILL WELCOME YOU, 18 AND I WILL BE A FATHER TO YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE sons and daughters TO ME, SAYS THE LORD ALMIGHTY (2 Corinthians 6:14-18).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The Father-son concept begins early in the Old Testament. God referred to the nation Israel as His son, His first-born son:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             22 Then you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says the LORD, Israel is My son, My first-born. 23 So I said to you, Let My son go, that he may serve Me; but you have refused to let him go, Behold, I will kill your son, your first-born (Exodus 4:22-23).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             When the nation failed to fulfill its mission as Gods son, God chose David and his descendants to be His son as each of these kings ruled over the people of God. Part of the Father-son relationship involved correction:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             12 When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. 13 He shall build a house for My name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 14 I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, 15 but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 16 And your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever (2 Samuel 7:12-16).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             When David and his sons after him failed to fulfill their sonship, God sent the Lord Jesus to serve as His son:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             13 Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the Child and His mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is going to search for the Child to destroy Him. 14 And he arose and took the Child and His mother by night, and departed for Egypt; 15 and was there until the death of Herod, that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, OUT OF EGYPT DID I CALL MY SON (Matthew 2:13-15).

             3 And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high; 4 having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they. 5 For to which of the angels did He ever say, THOU ART MY SON, TODAY I HAVE BEGOTTEN THEE? And again, I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME? (Hebrews 1:3-5).

             Those who are in Christ by faith in Him are the sons of God who will share in His rule over the earth:

             12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, [even] to those who believe in His name, 13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. (John 1:12-13).

            <p class="bodytext">
             15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, Abba! Father! (Romans 8:15).

            <p class="bodytext">
             23 And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for [our] adoption as sons, the redemption of our body (Romans 8:23).

             To be a son of God, and thus to have God as our Father, involves much more than the assurance that we have a certain hope, a place in the kingdom of God. It means God is our Father in the fullest sense of the term. The One whom we call upon as Father is also the One who
             <b>
             </b>
             impartially judges according to each individuals work.
             <b>
             </b>
             We cannot have God as our Father in a restricted way, but only as He is completely. Our Father is also the Judge of all the earth
             <b>

             (Genesis 18:25). His judgment includes all men and is conducted without partiality. In judgment, God shows no favorites. God deals equitably with all men. The Jews in particular presumed otherwise. They were wrong, as we are if we expect God to judge us differently as His children. Indeed, as His children, we have been given more, and our responsibility is greater.

             Years ago, my father taught Junior High in the same school where I was an elementary student. We did not see each other all that often at school. My friend Ricky and I discovered quite a legitimate way to skip class. We became school projectionists and were excused from class to operate the movie projector for other classes. This required pushing the projector on a mobile cart all around the school building. And, of course, at times we raced in the halls to see just how fast we could negotiate those 90-degree turns. One day I was doing especially well wheeling the cart around a sharp turn at high speed when I crashedright into a teacher walking down the hall. That teacher just happened to be my father. I can assure you I received no special treatment; indeed, it could not have been worse. My father was also my judge.

For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned [them] on earth, much less [shall] we [escape] who turn away from Him who [warns] from heaven. 26 And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, YET ONCE MORE I WILL SHAKE NOT ONLY THE EARTH, BUT ALSO THE HEAVEN. 27 And this [expression], Yet once more, denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. 28 Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe; 29 for our God is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:18-29).

             To sum up Peters teaching in verse 17, we are to fear the God who is both our Father and our judge. As sons of God, we may call upon Him for help to bring justice to the earth and even to punish the wicked, but when we do so let us remember that He also judges us. His standard for us is holiness, and thus we must conduct ourselves with an awareness of our own weakness and vulnerability to sin. We must not expect God to overlook the sin in our own lives, for while its penalty has been paid at Calvary, God is at work to purify us to His glory. We should live our lives in this present age well aware that we are citizens of heaven and that our conduct must not only meet the requirements of earthly authorities, but also of our Father.

             Redemption is a prominent theme in this epistle. Over and over again Peter refers to our salvation, brought about by the Father through the shed blood of His Son (see 1:1-3, 10-12, 13, 18-21; 2:4-10, 21-25; 3:18-22; 4:1, 13; 5:1). Peters use of Old Testament terms and citations bring to mind the first great redemption God accomplished at the exodus of Israel from Egypt. This redemption is overshadowed now by that redemption brought about by God through the sacrificial death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. The greater redemption is described in terms reminiscent of the former.

            <p class="bodytext">
             One would expect Peter to emphasize the work of Christ, for it is the basis of our salvation. But who would have expected him to speak of it here in a context where he calls us to live in fear? How could the first exodus or the second (see Luke 9:30-31) be an incentive to fear?
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             We should begin by remembering the purpose of the first exodus, the execution of Gods promise to Abraham and His descendants (see Genesis 15:13-16). It was also Gods intervention to relieve the sufferings of His people (Exodus 3:7-10). But it was also accomplished to bring glory to God by demonstrating His power and glory through the opposition of Pharaoh and the devastating defeat of the Egyptians:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             13 Then the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 14 For this time I will send all My plagues on you and your servants and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like Me in all the earth. 15 For [if by] now I had put forth My hand and struck you and your people with pestilence, you would then have been cut off from the earth. 16 But, indeed, for this cause I have allowed you to remain, in order to show you My power, and in order to proclaim My name through all the earth (Exodus 9:13-16).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Not until after the deliverance of the Israelites at the exodus was the Law given and Gods standards of holiness set down in the Law. By means of the exodus, Gods great power and sovereignty were made known, not only to the Egyptians but also to the Hebrews. They watched as God humbled and defeated the Egyptians, mocking their gods by each of the plagues. No one contested Gods repeated claim given as the Law was set down, I am the LORD

             </b>
             (see Leviticus 19:37). Only twice was this claim made in Genesis (15:7; 28:3), but it is found dozens of times in the rest of the Pentateuch and hundreds of times in the Bible.

             The first exodus was an event designed to teach the Israelites to fear God (see Jeremiah 32:16-22). The final exodus likewise was designed to produce a holy fear in the hearts of Gods people:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             38 And they shall be My people, and I will be their God; 39 and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me always, for their own good, and for [the good of] their children after them. 40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts so that they will not turn away from Me (Jeremiah 32:38-40).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             In the redemption of Christ on the cross of Calvary, we see the holiness of God and His hatred of sin. We see there the terrifying judgment of God upon sin. We also see the power of God in raising up the Lord Jesus from the dead. Our redemption certainly should produce a healthy and holy fear.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The key to understanding verses 17-21 may be in grasping two dramatic contrasts Peters words bring to our attention. First is the contrast between God our Father (verse 17) and our forefathers (verse 18). The second contrast is between the worthless heritage we gained from our forefathers and the priceless, precious heritage we have gained from our heavenly Father, through the work of Jesus Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Let us first consider the contrast between our Father and our forefathers. We have nothing in which to boast that we have received from our forefathers. Many of the Jews wrongly assumed that their status was dependent upon their earthly ancestry. They believed that being sons of Abraham made them sons of God. John the Baptist warned them that this assumption was false:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             9 And do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say to you, that God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham (Matthew 3:9).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He maintained God was His Father and His opponents had the devil as their father (see John 8:31-59).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The Jews had nothing to boast about concerning their ancestral origins:
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             5 And you shall answer and say before the LORD your God, My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt and sojourned there, few in number; but there he became a great, mighty and populous nation (Deuteronomy 26:5).

             in James 1:26. What we gain from our earthly forefathers is of no value. Indeed, what we gain from our forefathers is of negative value. Though what we gain from our earthly fathers is worthless, what we receive from our Heavenly Father is priceless. The redemption He has provided in Christ is not that of the sacrificial animals of old but the blood of the precious, sinless Son of God shed for our sins for our salvation. The treasure of this redemption, in contrast with the comparative trash of our human heritage,
             <sup>

            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Each time we partake of communion and remember the redemption we have received we are reminded of the depth of our sin, the height of His righteousness, love, and mercy, and the awesome magnitude of His divine judgment. We should be humbled, overcome with gratitude, and filled with a holy fear.

             A Fear of Our Father
             <br/>
             (1:20-21)
            </h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
             20 For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you 21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Two points catch our attention as we consider these two verses. First, the fear Peter requires of us is closely associated with faith and hope (verse 21). Second, verses 14-21 focus on the Father.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The fear of God is not incompatible with faith and hope. Faith requires fear. How can we place our trust in a God whom we do not fear? The fear of God is rooted in who God is, in His holiness, power, majesty, justice, and mercy. How could we trust in a God who is not infinitely greater that we are? I suggest we can only trust in a God whom we fear.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Hope likewise is related to fear. Hope looks forward in time, and fear does as well. Hope looks forward to those things we desire, and to some extent, fear looks forward to those things we should dread. Hope draws us toward the things of God, and fear should repel us from those things which offend God.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             I find the emphasis on God the Father both interesting and instructive. Quite frankly, the Father is perhaps the most neglected member of the Trinity, even though He is the One to whom both the Son and the Spirit are and will be in submission (see 1 Corinthians 15:20-28). We usually find much emphasis and attention focused on the Son and on the Spirit, but we do not see nearly as much focused on the Father. Peters words should serve as a corrective to us.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             In verses 20 and 21, Peter portrays salvation in a very significant way. He portrays the Son of God as the Servant whom the Father has sent to redeem His chosen ones. It is the Father who chose or predestined (foreknew) the Son. Our salvation was the plan of the Father in eternity past, before He created the world. God sent the Son to save us, for our benefit. What was planned and purposed long before has now appeared to us in Christ Jesus. As God the Father sent the Son, so it is He who raised Him from the dead and glorified Him. And for this reason, our faith and hope are ultimately in the Father.
            </p>
            <h3>
             Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p class="bodytext">
             The words of our text should shape our theology. They inform us that it is certainly not our worth which attracted God to us, for we did not exist at the time He purposed our salvation. The work of Christ is not to be viewed in terms of our worth to God (the current trend in evangelical circles), but in terms of the Fathers plan for His Son. The cross was not meant to glorify lost sinners but to save them, to the glory of God the Father. Our Lord knew this, even if we do not (see John 17:1-6). It is the blood of Christ and the redemption it accomplished which is precious, while what we have contributed is the worthless way of life inherited from our forefathers.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             This should also straighten out some of the crooked thinking currently popular regarding our past, especially regarding our parents. I do not know how many times I have heard it said that we cannot understand God as our Father until we first have a proper picture of our earthly fathers. Peter teaches us just the opposite. We cannot understand our forefathers correctly until we do so in the light of our Heavenly Father. He has purposed and provided our salvation, through His Son. Our forefathers have only provided that which is futile. When we come to fear God as our Father, we learn to fear our parents as well. But we also recognize them as sinners who will always fall short of what fatherhood is all about, because fatherhood comes from God (see Ephesians 3:14-15, in several translations).
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Our text should also serve to instruct us as fathers and parents. Our children should learn to fear us, as parents, in a healthy and godly way, just as they must learn to fear God. I see hardly any healthy fear of parents in our culture,
             <sup>
              <a href="#P1056_288408">
               25
              </a>
             </sup>
             or any fear for those in authority. I see far too little fear of parents in the church today. If fear of God and of parents is biblical, and it surely is, then let us strive to promote the fear of God in our lives and in the lives of those under our authority.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             I believe we must also seek to apply the teaching of our text in evangelism. Some would tell us we should evangelize by stressing the love of God and not the fear of God. We simply cannot proclaim the cross of Christ without emphasizing both. Why would our Lord promise that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment
             <b>
             </b>
             (John 16:8) if men were not to fear the wrath to come? Why would Paul say that the terror of the Lord
             <b>
             </b>
             was an incentive to his evangelism and ministry (see 2 Corinthians 5:11)? Men and women need to trust in Jesus Christ because they rightly fear the wrath of God. And having come to faith in Him, they need to continue to live out their lives in fear, just as Peter commands in our text.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             Have you come to fear God? I pray that you have. And if you have, you will no longer fear those things which once paralyzed you in the past. You will fear the living God, in whom you have faith and hope. This fear is pure and purifying.
            </p>
            <p class="bodytext">
             One final word on the subject of fear comes from our Lord Himself.

             24 A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master. 25 It is enough for the disciple that he become as his teacher, and the slave as his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household! 26 Therefore do not fear them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. 27 What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear [whispered] in [your] ear, proclaim upon the housetops. 28 And do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And [yet] not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows. 32 Everyone therefore who shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven. 33 But whoever shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven (Matthew 10:24-33).

             23 It is worthwhile to note that when the nation Israel forgot or rejected the truth that God is the Lord they would have to relearn it. But this time it would be by means of their own punishment (like the Egyptians--see Deuteronomy 28:15ff., especially verses 27, 60, 68), so that they would know that He is the Lord. This is a constant theme in the Book of Ezekiel (see, for example, 22:16; 25:5, 7, 11, 17; 26:6).
