           A note from Jeannie Crabtree C.Ac.:
          </p>
          <p>
           I have been helping others with their health concernsfor about 30 years and it has become clear that following a route that includes Natural Health information
        and Natural Health care would help immensely in all of
        the above mentioned
           <br/>
           health problems.
           <br/>
           <br/>

        answers to
           <br/>

           Alternative health care - more and more people are open to
        using alternative health care, even as they continue their annual check ups and regular health 
visits with their medical doctor.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The alternative health approach has the ability of getting to
        the cause behind
           <br/>
           the cause of health issues because it assists
        the body to come back into
           <br/>
           balance. This can involve therapies
        such as acupressure, or may take in diet changes, creating a
        new healthy way of eating for better health.
          </p>
          <p>
           Alternative health often involves the taking of supplements,
        energetic
           <br/>
           remedies, herbal extracts, homeopathics, doing detoxification and rebuilding
        through nutritional supplements.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Alternative health care often combines areas of healing emotionally
        as well.
           <br/>

        people on the phone
