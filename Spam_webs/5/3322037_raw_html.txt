  <meta content='Dramatic scientific evidence that all of physical matter is formed by an &ldquo;aether&rdquo; of invisible, conscious energy has existed since at least the 1950s.

	Renowned Russian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev (1908-1983, pronounced Ko-zir-ev,) proved beyond any doubt that such an energy source had to exist, and as a result he became one of the most controversial figures in the history of the Russian scientific community.

	The awesome implications of his work, and of all those who followed him, were almost entirely concealed by the former Soviet Union, but with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the advent of the Internet we are finally gaining access to &ldquo;Russia&rsquo;s Best-Kept Secret.&rdquo;

	Two generations of remarkable research by thousands of Ph.D. level specialists have emerged from Kozyrev&rsquo;s seed findings, which completely change our understanding of the Universe. With our prominent mention of him in this book, we hope to permanently establish his historical importance and impact to our colleagues and readers.

	1.1 THE AETHER

	The word &ldquo;aether&rdquo; means &ldquo;shine&rdquo; in Greek, and the fundamental reality of such an unseen, fluidlike source of universal energy has long been a hallmark of the world&rsquo;s secret mystery schools. The works of Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Plato discussed it at great length, as did the Vedic scriptures of ancient India, referring to it by several names such as &ldquo;prana&rdquo; and &ldquo;Akasha.&rdquo;

	In the Orient, it is often known as &ldquo;chi&rdquo; or &ldquo;ki,&rdquo; and special emphasis is placed on its interactions with the human body, such as in the science of acupuncture. Masters and adepts who inherited the secret traditions could eventually learn to manipulate this energy to create miraculous results, such as levitation, teleportation, manifestation, instant healing, telepathy and the like.

	Such results have been repeatedly documented in the 20th century and studied in the laboratory, as we wrote in Convergence: The Science of Oneness.

	The aether&rsquo;s existence was widely accepted without question in scientific circles until the early 20th century, when the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 was co-opted to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that no such hidden energy source existed.

	However, more recent breakthroughs involving &ldquo;dark matter,&rdquo; &ldquo;dark energy&rdquo;, &ldquo;virtual particles&rdquo;, &ldquo;vaccum flux&rdquo; and &ldquo;zero-point energy,&rdquo; to name a few, have brought reluctant Western scientists to acknowledge that there must indeed be an unseen energy medium throughout the Universe.

	As long as you use a benign term like the &ldquo;quantum medium&rdquo; and not the forbidden word &lsquo;aether,&rsquo; you can talk about it in the mainstream press without much fear of ridicule.

	The mainstream scientific establishment is very heavily polarized against anyone who gets too close to an &lsquo;aether&rsquo; theory, as they &ldquo;know&rdquo; that such a theory must be false and will therefore fight vigorously against it. However, such suppression only increases the desire and commitment that many others have put into solving the puzzle.

	One early example of proof for the existence of the aether comes from Dr. Hal Puthoff, a respected scientist from Cambridge University. Puthoff frequently mentions experiments from the early 20th century that were designed to see if there was any energy in &ldquo;empty space,&rdquo; conducted before quantum mechanics theory ever existed.

	In order to test this idea in the laboratory, it was necessary to create an area that was completely free of air (a vacuum,) and lead-shielded from all known electromagnetic radiation fields by using what is known as a Faraday cage. This airless vacuum space was then cooled down to absolute zero or -273 C,the temperature where all matter should stop vibrating and thus produce no heat.

	These experiments proved that instead of an absence of energy in the vacuum, there was a tremendous amount of it, from a completely non-electromagnetic source! Dr. Puthoff has often called this a "seething cauldron" of energy in very high magnitudes.

	Since this energy could still be found at absolute zero, this force was dubbed "zero point energy" or ZPE, whereas the Russian scientists usually call it the &ldquo;physical vacuum&rdquo; or PV. Recently, established mainstream physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman have calculated that:

	The amount of zero-point energy in the space volume of a single light bulb is powerful enough to bring all the world&#39;s oceans to the boiling point!

	Clearly, we are not dealing with some weak, unseen force, but rather a source of almost impossibly grand power, which would have more than enough strength to sustain the existence of all of physical matter.

	In the new view of science that is emerging from aether theory, all four of the basic force fields, whether gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear or strong nuclear force, are all simply different forms of the aether/ZPE.

	To get another idea of how much &ldquo;free&rdquo; energy really exists all around us, Professor M.T. Daniels found that the density of the gravitational energy near the surface of the earth is equal to 5.74 x 10^10 (t/m^3). [Let us not forget that gravity would simply be another form of aether in this new model.]

	Prof. Daniels&rsquo; finding means that drawing a sizable 100 kilowatts of this &ldquo;free energy&rdquo; power from the gravitational field dips into an extremely tiny 0.001% of the natural energy that is being produced in that area. (New Energy News, June 1994, p.4)

	Research conducted by Nikola Tesla led to his statement in 1891 that the aether &ldquo;behaves as a fluid to solid bodies, and as a solid to light and heat,&rdquo; and that under &ldquo;sufficiently high voltage and frequency,&rdquo; it could be accessed &ndash; which was his hint that free energy and anti-gravity technologies were possible.

	Let us pay special attention, again, to Tesla&rsquo;s statement that the aether has a fluidlike effect when we are dealing with solid objects, as this ties in directly with the work of Dr. N.A. Kozyrev.

	

	1.2 ANALOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING KOZYREV&rsquo;S FINDINGS

	In Chapters 3 and 4, we will explode the myths of quantum physics and show that the oft-cited &ldquo;particle&rdquo; model of the atom is seriously flawed. Just as Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity suggested, all of physical matter is ultimately made of pure energy, and there are no &ldquo;hard particles&rdquo; to be found in the quantum realm.

	More and more, the scientific community is being forced to accept that atoms and molecules are akin to candle flames, where the energy that they release (such as the heat and light of the flame) must be balanced by energy that they absorb (such as the wax of the candle and the oxygen in the air.)

	This &ldquo;candle analogy&rdquo; is a hallmark of Dr. Hal Puthoff&rsquo;s model, which he uses to explain why the hypothetical electron does not radiate away all of its energy and crash into the nucleus. This seemingly &ldquo;perpetual motion&rdquo; within the atom is simply explained away as &ldquo;the magic of quantum mechanics&rdquo; in the mainstream view.

	In order to truly be able to get a grasp on Kozyrev&rsquo;s work and related findings, certain new analogies for physical matter are required. Rigorously, Kozyrev&rsquo;s work forces us to visualize all physical objects of matter in the Universe as if they were sponges that are submerged in water.

	In all of these analogies, we should consider the sponges as having remained in water for a long enough period of time that they are completely saturated. Bearing this in mind, there are two things we can do with such sponges underwater: we can decrease the volume of water that they contain or increase it, by very simple mechanical procedures.

	
		Decrease: If a submerged, saturated sponge is squeezed, cooled or rotated, then some of the water inside of it will be released into its surroundings, decreasing its mass. Once the sponge is no longer disturbed, the pressure on the millions of tiny pores is relieved, causing it to again absorb water and expand back to its normal resting mass.
	
		Increase: We can also pump more water pressure into the sponge in its rest state, such as by heating (vibrating) it, thus causing some of the pores to expand with more water than they can comfortably hold. In this case, once we relieve the added pressure, the sponge will naturally release its excess water and shrink back down to its normal resting mass.


	

	Though it would seem impossible to most people, Kozyrev showed that by shaking, spinning, heating, cooling, vibrating or breaking physical objects, their weight can be increased or decreased by subtle but definite amounts. And this is but one aspect of his amazing work.

	

	1.3 BACKGROUND OF DR. N.A. KOZYREV

	Since the Western world is largely uneducated about Kozyrev, some biographical and research information is in order. This will establish that he was far from a &ldquo;crank&rdquo; or &ldquo;crackpot&rdquo; scientist, but was in fact considered as one of the pre-eminent Russian thinkers of the 20th century.

	Kozyrev&rsquo;s first scientific paper was published at the tender age of seventeen, and other scientists were amazed by the depth and clarity of his logic. His main work was in astrophysics, where he studied the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars, the phenomenon of solar eclipses and radiation equilibrium.

	By age twenty he had already graduated from the University of Leningrad with a degree in physics and mathematics, and by age twenty-eight Dr. Kozyrev was widely known as a distinguished astronomer who had taught at several colleges.

	Kozyrev&rsquo;s abundant life took a most unfortunate and difficult turn in 1936, when he was arrested under the repressive laws of Josef Stalin, and in 1937 he began eleven torturous years enduring all the known horrors of a concentration camp. Although he did not have access to scientific equipment during this time, he was given the most brutal of initiation experiences into hidden knowledge.

	To an already enlightened mind, such bone-jarring hardship can effectively burn off all desire for gratification from the material world, removing the resistance to higher consciousness so that a state of illumination is produced where universal truth can be immediately recognized and assimilated.

	From this state, he mused deeply upon the mysteries of the Universe, paying attention to all the patterns that existed in life, wherein so many different organisms show signs of asymmetry and / or spiraling growth.

	He knew that in the mid-1800s, Louis Pasteur discovered that the building block of life known as &ldquo;protoplasm&rdquo; is inherently not symmetrical, and that colonies of microbes grow in a spiral structure.

	These expanding proportions also underlie the structure of plants, insects, animals and people, as so many inheritors of the ancient tradition of the Atlantean Mysteries have written, when discussing &ldquo;sacred geometry&rdquo; such as the spiraling form known as Fibonacci, Golden Mean and / or &ldquo;phi&rdquo; spiral.

	

	
		
			
				
			
				
		
	


	

	Figure 1.2 &ndash; The &ldquo;Phi&rdquo; Spiral in the nautilus shell (L) and with geometrically inscribed triangles (R).

	

	From his illuminated observations in the prison camp, Kozyrev considered that all lifeforms might be drawing off of an unseen, spiraling source of energy, in addition to their normal properties of gaining energy through eating, drinking, breathing and photosynthesis. Later in this book we will see how comprehensive the data is on this point.

	Kozyrev theorized that things such as the direction of a shell&rsquo;s spiraling growth and which side of the human body will contain the heart are determined by the direction of this flow. Should there be an area somewhere in space-time where the energy flow was spiraling in the opposite direction, then he would expect shells to grow in the opposite direction and the heart to be in the opposite side of the body cavity.

	This concept of a spiraling energy in biology may seem unrealistic, but it has long been known in the mystery schools. The next image shows us how all the ratios of &ldquo;phi&rdquo; emerge naturally in the structure of the human arm, and this is but one example of a process that repeats all throughout the bodies of human beings as well as all other plants, animals and insects.

	Those few who acknowledge these relationships at all will typically state that they emerge simply because &ldquo;phi&rdquo; represents the natural, most efficient pattern in which growth can occur. Kozyrev suggested that life couldn&rsquo;t form any other way, because it is actively drawing off of this spiraling energy to sustain itself, and must therefore follow its proportions every step of the way.

	In this sense we can think of the skeletal system as an &ldquo;antenna&rdquo; for this energy.

	

	

	Figure 1.3 &ndash; The &ldquo;Phi&rdquo; proportions in the human arm.

	

	When Kozyrev was finally rehabilitated from the prison camp in 1948 and could return to his field of expertise, he made many advance predictions about the Moon, Venus and Mars, which were validated by Soviet space probes more than a decade later.

	This then earned him the distinction of being a major pioneer in the Soviet space race. Then, in 1958, Dr. Kozyrev again aroused worldwide controversy by proclaiming that the Moon exhibited volcanic activity in the Alphonsus crater.

	Should this notion have been true, which most astronomers and scientists flatly refused to believe, then it meant that the Moon possessed huge natural resources and sources of power that would make it an excellent stop-over point to propel humanity into the stars.

	U.S. Nobel Prize winner Dr. Harold Urey was among the narrow group who believed that Dr. Kozyrev&rsquo;s theory of volcanic activity on the moon was correct, and he urged NASA to conduct an investigation. As a direct result, NASA launched the enormous &ldquo;Moon Blink&rdquo; project, which later confirmed Dr. Kozyrev&rsquo;s assertions by finding significant gas emissions on the moon.

	However, not all of Kozyrev&rsquo;s work was quite so readily assimilated into the mainstream world of NASA. In the winter of 1951-1952, just three years after escaping the brutal initiation of the prison camp, Dr. Kozyrev began his foray into the world of exotic physics, with the first of what became an exhaustive series of 33 years&rsquo; worth of very intriguing and controversial experiments.

	His obvious desire in pursuing such research was to find validation for the spiritual truths that he had already experienced through the mystical process of preparation, illumination and initiation (as referred to in Rudolf Steiner&rsquo;s classic Knowledge of Higher Worlds and Its Attainment) under the most extremely challenging of circumstances.

	When he began publishing the results of these breakthrough studies, many Russian scientists and a scarce few in the West were prepared to listen, based on his past successes.

	As we said, the spiraling energy patterns in nature unveiled themselves to the initiated eyes of Dr. Kozyrev while in the concentration camp. His &ldquo;direct knowledge&rdquo; informed him that this spiraling energy was in fact the true nature and manifestation of &ldquo;time.&rdquo; Obviously, he felt that &ldquo;time&rdquo; as we now know it is much more than just a simple function for counting duration.

	Kozyrev urges us to try to think of a cause for time, something tangible and identifiable in the Universe that we can associate with time. After pondering this for a while, we see that time is ultimately nothing but pure spiraling movement.

	We know that we are tracing a complex spiraling pattern through space thanks to the orbital patterns of the Earth and solar system. And now, the study of &ldquo;temporology,&rdquo; or the science of time, is under continual, active investigation by Moscow State University and the Russian Humanitarian Foundation, inspired by Dr. Kozyrev&rsquo;s pioneering work. On their website, they state that:

	
		In our understanding, the &ldquo;nature&rdquo; of time is the mechanism [that brings about] appearing changes and occurring newness in the World. To understand the &ldquo;nature&rdquo; of time is to point to&hellip; a process, a phenomenon, a &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; in the material world whose properties could be identified or corresponded with those of time.
	
		


	This may seem strange at first glance, since a tree falling in your yard could be seen as a product of a strong wind, not the &ldquo;flow of time.&rdquo; However, you must then ask yourself what caused the wind to blow? Ultimately, the motion of the Earth on its axis is most responsible.

	Hence, all changes are caused by some form of movement, and without movement there can be no time. Several of the scholars whose papers are published through the Russian Institute of Temporology agree that if Kozyrev had changed his terminology and use of the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; to more common scientific terms such as &ldquo;the physical vacuum&rdquo; or &ldquo;the aether,&rdquo; then many more people would have been able to understand his work sooner in the ensuing years.

	It is not necessary at this point for the reader to fully grasp the philosophy of spiraling energy as a manifestation of time, as this will become far clearer as we proceed.

	One of very few media breaks that Kozyrev ever received in the West regarding his concepts was a chapter in Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeder&rsquo;s groundbreaking 1970 book, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, which has gained worldwide acclaim and is still being reprinted to this day with the shortened title Psychic Discoveries.

	Most of the above background biographical information on Kozyrev&rsquo;s early career experience has come from this source. In Chapter 13, entitled &ldquo;Time &ndash; A New Frontier of the Mind,&rdquo; the authors explain that even in his sixties, Kozyrev was tanned and athletic looking and gave off &ldquo;an impression of great calm, an almost spiritual quality.&rdquo;

	They also state that:

	
		In reputation and in work achieved, he is the most important scientist we met. He is attempting to elucidate a new world view, a new cosmogony. Under Kozyrev&rsquo;s new conception, psychic happenings would fall into place. They would no longer be, as they are in the current view of science, something outside the system, something that must be denied to protect the system.
	
		


	The connection of psychic phenomena to physics is well known and frequently discussed in the Russian literature that is now becoming increasingly available, and Kozyrev&rsquo;s work undoubtedly paved the way for it. One of the few Western researchers to notice Dr. Kozyrev&rsquo;s work was Dr. Albert Wilson of the Douglas Research Laboratories in California, who said,

	
		I feel that something very much like what Kozyrev has hypothesized will be established in physical theory within the next decade or two. Its implications will be revolutionary. It could take a generation of work before the leap he has taken can be incorporated into the body of scientific knowledge.
	
		


	Dr. Wilson&rsquo;s timing was about one decade too short, as now at the dawn of the 21st century we can finally put all the pieces together. In order to keep our terms consistent, we will use the common scientific terms &ldquo;torsion fields&rdquo; and / or &ldquo;torsion waves&rdquo; to describe the spiraling flow of &ldquo;time energy&rdquo; that Kozyrev discovered.

	[The word &ldquo;torsion&rdquo; essentially means &ldquo;spinning&rdquo; or &ldquo;twisting.&rdquo;]

	Many Western scientists who have explored these topics, most notably Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, call them &ldquo;scalar waves&rdquo;, but we feel that &ldquo;torsion waves&rdquo; is ultimately an easier term to use, since it continually reminds us of their spiraling nature. The reader should be aware that in all cases, what we are dealing with is simply an impulse of momentum that travels through the medium of the aether / ZPE / physical vacuum, and does not possess electromagnetic qualities.

	Before Kozyrev ever began conducting his experiments, a good, solid theoretical foundation was already in place to begin explaining his results. We will begin with a preliminary discussion of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, followed by Dr. Eli Cartan&rsquo;s additions to the model, which first established the existence of torsion fields in theory.

	

	1.4 EINSTEIN&rsquo;S GEOMETRIC MODEL OF GRAVITY

	On May 29, 1919, Albert Einstein supposedly proved &ldquo;&hellip;that we live in a curved four-dimensional space-time&rdquo; where space and time are somehow fused together into a &ldquo;fabric.&rdquo; He believed that an object such as the Earth spinning in space &ldquo;&hellip;would drag space and time along with it&hellip;&rdquo;, and that this space-time fabric curves inward around a planetary body. Thus, he said,

	
		Gravity is no longer a mysterious force acting at a distance, but [rather is] the result of an object trying to travel in a straight line through space [that is] curved by the presence of material bodies.
	
		


	Space that is curved? &ldquo;Wait&hellip;isn&rsquo;t space supposed to be empty?&rdquo; you ask. How can you curve something that is empty? As we can see, the significant problem in visualizing Einstein&rsquo;s gravity model is with the word &ldquo;curve&rdquo;, as this is something that a flat, elastic sheet would do.

	Indeed, most attempts to visualize Einstein&rsquo;s results picture planets as if they were weights that were depressing an imaginary flat rubber sheet that is stretched out in space as the &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; of space-time. An object such as a comet or asteroid simply follows the geometry of the sheet as it moves towards the Earth.

	The problem with this model is that any curvature of space-time would need to be moving in towards a spherical object from all directions, not just a flat plane. And furthermore, one still requires a force of gravity to pull a weight down into a flat rubber sheet. In a weightless space, the ball and the sheet would simply float around together.

	In reality, the word &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; is far more precise than &ldquo;curving,&rdquo; since in Convergence III we have demonstrated that gravity is actually a form of aetheric energy that is constantly flowing into an object.

	The equations for gravity do not specify which direction it must flow in, simply that it exists as a force that is responsible for objects not flying away from the Earth&rsquo;s surface. Such ideas can be traced to John Keely, Dr. Walter Russell and more recently Walter Wright with his well-established &ldquo;Push Gravity&rdquo; theory.

	Once we establish that all force fields such as gravity and electromagnetism are simply different forms of aether/ZPE in motion, then we have an active source for gravity and a straightforward reason for why it would exist. We see that every molecule in the entire body of a planet must be sustained by an ongoing in-flow of aetheric energy.

	The same energy that is creating the Earth is also creating and flowing into us. We are then caught up in the gigantic current of the river of energy that streams into the Earth, much as mosquitoes get stuck to a screen window while the air blows right through the screen.

	Our bodies cannot travel through solid matter, but the current of aetheric energy certainly can &ndash; and this is one of the many things that Keely, Tesla, Kozyrev and others demonstrated. A star or planet must continually draw energy from its environment in order to &ldquo;stay alive.&rdquo; Kozyrev had made very similar conclusions about our Sun back in the 1950s, concluding that stars acted as &ldquo;machines that convert the flow of time into heat and light.&rdquo;

	Almost all Western scientists believe that Einstein&rsquo;s general and special relativity theories eliminate the need for an aether &ndash; and indeed, Einstein advocated the rejection of an aether in 1910, which is where mainstream science still believes his thoughts ended on the issue. However, in 1920, Einstein actually stated that &ldquo;the hypothesis of the existence of the ether does not contradict the special theory of relativity.&rdquo; And in 1924, he wrote,

	
		&hellip;in theoretical physics, we cannot get along without the ether, i.e., a continuum assigned physical properties, because the general theory of relativity&hellip; excludes direct long-range action; and each theory of short-range action assumes the presence of continuous fields and, consequently, the existence of the &lsquo;ether.&rsquo; [emphasis added]
	
		


	1.5 TORSION PHYSICS

	In 1913, Dr. Eli Cartan was the first to clearly demonstrate that the &ldquo;fabric&rdquo; (flow) of space and time in Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity not only &ldquo;curved&rdquo;, but it also possessed a spinning or spiraling movement within itself known as &ldquo;torsion.&rdquo;

	This area of physics is typically referred to as Einstein-Cartan Theory, or ECT. Cartan&rsquo;s theory wasn&rsquo;t taken too seriously at the time, as it came out before the days of quantum physics, when elementary &ldquo;particles&rdquo; such as electrons were believed to rotate or &ldquo;spin&rdquo; as they orbited the nucleus.

	Most people are unaware that it is now generally accepted that the space surrounding the Earth and perhaps the entire Galaxy has &ldquo;right-handed spin,&rdquo; meaning that energy will be influenced to spin clockwise as it travels through the physical vacuum. In 1996, Russian Drs. Akimov and Shipov wrote that:

	
		To date, world periodicals reference to torsion fields amount to the order of 10,000 articles, belonging to about a hundred authors. Over one half of those theorists work in Russia alone.
	
		


	As we shall easily see, Dr. Kozyrev&rsquo;s work was the main influence for the more than 5,000 Russian papers on this subject as of 1996. In classical physics models, torsion fields were never considered to be a universal force on the level of gravity or electromagnetic energy, largely because they only existed theoretically.

	Cartan&rsquo;s original 1913 theory speculated that torsion fields would be some 30 orders of magnitude weaker than gravitation, and gravity is already known to be 40 orders of magnitude weaker than electromagnetic energy! With such a miniscule level of influence, so said the theories, the naturally-spinning &ldquo;torsion fields&rdquo; were basically an irrelevant footnote that would not make any noticeable contributions to the phenomena that we can observe in the universe.

	For those scientists who had maintained an open mind, the works of Trautman, Kopczyynski, F. Hehl, T. Kibble, D. Sciama and others in the early 1970&rsquo;s triggered a wave of interest in torsion fields. Hard scientific facts exploded Cartan&rsquo;s 60-year-old theory-based myth that such fields were weak, tiny and unable to move through space.

	The myth of the Einstein-Cartan theory was that the spiraling torsion fields could not move, (i.e. they would remain static,) and could only exist within a space far smaller than the atom.

	Sciama et al. demonstrated that these basic torsion fields expected in ECT did exist, and they were referred to as &ldquo;static torsion fields.&rdquo; The difference was that &ldquo;dynamic torsion fields&rdquo; were demonstrated as well, with properties far more remarkable than Einstein and Cartan had assumed.

	According to Sciama et al., static torsion fields are created from spinning sources that do not radiate any energy. However, once you have a spinning source that releases energy in any form, such as the Sun or the center of the Galaxy, and / or a spinning source that has more than one form of movement occurring at the same time, such as a planet that is rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun at the same time, then dynamic torsion is automatically produced.

	This phenomenon allows torsion waves to propagate through spaceinstead of simply staying in a single &ldquo;static&rdquo; spot. Thus, torsion fields, like gravity or electromagnetism, are capable of moving from one place to another in the Universe.

	Furthermore, as we shall discover in later chapters, Kozyrev proved decades ago that these fields travel at &ldquo;superluminal&rdquo; speeds, meaning that they far exceed the speed of light.

	If you can have an impulse that moves directly through the &ldquo;fabric of space-time&rdquo;, travels at super-luminal velocities and is separate from gravity or electromagnetism, you have a significant breakthrough in physics &ndash; one that demands that a &ldquo;physical vacuum&rdquo;, &ldquo;zero-point energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;aether&rdquo; must really exist.

	

	1.6 MASTER LIST OF PHENOMENA THAT CREATE KOZYREV&rsquo;S EFFECTS

	Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments began in the 1950s and were conducted since the 1970s with the ongoing assistance of Dr. V.V. Nasonov, who helped to standardize the laboratory methods and the statistical analysis of the results.

	It is important to remember that these experiments were conducted under the strictest conditions, repeated in hundreds or in many cases thousands of trials, and were written about in extensive mathematical detail. They have been rigorously peer-reviewed, and Lavrentyev and others have replicated the results independently.

	(We have omitted the mathematical / analytical analyses of Kozyrev&rsquo;s results in this book to enhance its readability.) Certain specially-made detectors using rotation and vibration were designed that would react in the presence of torsion fields, which Kozyrev called the &ldquo;flow of time.&rdquo;

	If we go back to our earlier analogy, we said that matter behaved somewhat like a sponge in water. If we do something to disturb the structure of the sponge, such as to squeeze it, spin it or vibrate it, then it will release some of its water back into its environment. Over the years, all of the following processes were discovered to create a &ldquo;time flow&rdquo; of torsion waves in the laboratory, due to their disruption of matter in some form:

	
		the deforming of a physical object
	
		the encounter of an air jet with an obstacle
	
		the operation of an hourglass filled with sand
	
		the absorption of light
	
		friction
	
		burning
	
		the actions of an observer, such as a movement of the head
	
		the heating or cooling of an object
	
		phase transitions in substances (frozen to liquid, liquid to vapor, etc.)
	
		dissolving and mixing substances
	
		the fading death of plants
	
		non-light radiation from astronomical objects
	
		sudden changes in human consciousness


	

	Other than the perplexing final item related to consciousness, we can readily see how each process is disturbing matter in some way, thus causing it to absorb or release minute amounts of its aetheric &ldquo;water,&rdquo; which fits perfectly with our sponge analogy.

	Even more importantly, the fact that strong emotional energy could also cause a measurable at-a-distance reaction has been repeatedly documented, not just by Dr. Kozyrev but many others, and this is where our concepts of psychic phenomena and consciousness come into the picture.

	Such concepts became even bigger news after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, when Dean Radin and his team at the Institute of Noetic Sciences were able to measure a tremendous change in the behavior of computerized random-number generators surrounding the time immediately before and after the attack:

	

	
	Figure 1.4 &ndash; Data from Radin / INS measuring a change in mass consciousness

	The graph shows that somehow, a change in the mass consciousness of humanity affected the behavior of electromagnetic energy in computer circuits around the world, especially those computers nearest to North America. Later we shall see that this is just the beginning of a whole new world of &ldquo;consciousness science.&rdquo; We will suggest that torsion waves and consciousness are essentially identical manifestations of intelligent energy.

	Returning to the more &lsquo;comfortable&rsquo; arena of physical matter, Kozyrev&rsquo;s work showed that torsion fields can be absorbed, shielded or sometimes reflected. For example, sugar can absorb, polyethylene film and aluminum can shield, and other forms of aluminum or mirrors can reflect.

	Kozyrev found that in the presence of this energy flow, objects that are rigid and inelastic will show weight changes, whereas flexible, elastic objects will show changes in their elasticity and / or viscosity.

	Kozyrev also showed that the weight of a spinning top will change if it is vibrated, heated or cooled or if it has an electric current passed through it. As we can see, all of the above behaviors fit in quite nicely with our analogy of the &ldquo;sponge&rdquo; of matter absorbing or releasing small amounts of energetic &ldquo;water&rdquo;.

	

	1.7 BUILDING A MECHANICAL DETECTOR FOR THE &ldquo;TIME FLOW&rdquo;

	Obviously, the biggest unanswered challenge at this point would be how such energy could be mechanically detected. After all, it has completely eluded the mainstream for well over a century. Here, it is important to remember that though the forces of torsion waves on matter are relatively small, they do exert a steady push.

	Research of Shipov, Terletskiy and other Russian theorists have directly associated the energy of torsion fields with the energy of gravity, thus leading to the term &ldquo;gravispin energy&rdquo; and the science of &ldquo;gravispinorics.&rdquo;

	In these new theories, gravity and spin are coupled in the same basic manner as electrostatics and magnetism join to form the electromagnetic wave. Though torsion waves can travel in any direction, they are most typically absorbed into the downward flow of the gravitational field.

	So, the strongest effects of the pressure of torsion waves would be a slight spiraling movement that is joined with gravity. Since it is a very subtle pressure, we do not typically notice any such movement in ourselves or in falling objects.

	Many of Kozyrev&rsquo;s mechanical detectors of torsion waves involved objects in motion, such as a rotating gyroscope or an asymmetrical swinging pendulum. A simple analogy helps us to begin to understand how such objects in motion were able to capture this gentle pressure.

	If you have a ship at sea and do not align your sails with the direction of the wind&rsquo;s flow, then your ship will not move. Your sails must align with the direction of the wind, and if the wind&rsquo;s current changes, then you must also move the sail to capture the new direction.

	Detecting torsion waves is a more difficult process than sailing, as the torsion waves are continually changing their direction in the form of a three-dimensional spiral. Somehow, you must create vibrations in the detecting object that will allow it to continually harness a three-dimensional, moving spiral of energy force.

	Kozyrev was able to capture the subtle pressure of the torsion waves by combining two different forms of vibration or movement at a time. We will discuss exactly how this was done in the following paragraphs. Under these special laboratory conditions, gyroscopes or pendulums could be used to interact with the &ldquo;time flow&rdquo; energy, as Kozyrev called it.

	In these cases, such detectors will exhibit weight variations or sudden angular movements in response to the energy.

	One of the most basic detectors of &ldquo;time flow&rdquo; energy that Kozyrev used was the &ldquo;torsion balance,&rdquo; meaning that it was a balance beam that could spin freely as it was suspended from a thread.

	As described in Kozyrev&rsquo;s first paper for the year 1971, the torsion balance did not have an equal distribution of weight on either side, as one end of the beam weighed ten grams and the other end was only one gram.

	Kozyrev suspended this beam with a string (filament) of capron that was 30 micrometers in diameter and 5-10 centimeters long. The string was attached much closer to the heavier end of the beam than the lighter end, so that the beam would remain in a perfect horizontal position under the effects of gravity. This positioning also created greater stress within the beam itself, making it move very easily.

	The lighter end of the beam was fashioned into a pointer, so that Kozyrev could measure on a protractor how many degrees the beam had moved at any time.

	In order to avoid being influenced by the atmosphere, the entire system was sealed under a glass cap so that all of the air inside could be vacuumed out. Furthermore, Kozyrev surrounded the cap with a metal net (similar to a Faraday cage) so that all known electromagnetic influences would be shielded.

	Most importantly, the top of the filament, where the beam balance was hanging from, was mechanically vibrated by an electromagnetic device.

	The experiments were not considered valid unless the beam would remain perfectly still even in the presence of the extra vibrations at the top of the string. However, these extra vibrations jiggling the top of the string created a greater sensitivity to outside vibration that would reverberate throughout the entire object.

	We already have an uneven set of weights that are carefully suspended on a thin string so that they remain horizontal, giving us a system that is under a lot of stress and will move very easily with the slightest touch. This is similar to the power of the lever to allow a person to lift up their entire car with the simple cranking up of the jack.

	Then, when you also add the stress of the vibrations moving up and down the string and into the balance itself, you have all the necessary ingredients to make the detector so extremely sensitive that the whisper-soft pressure of torsion waves can show a measurable effect. This is one of several clever ways to capture and detect these forces. (As another example, a gyroscope may be set in motion and then hung from a string that is vibrated.)

	In some senses this extra sensitivity works in the same way as an air hockey table, where you have a flat, rectangular surface with many tiny holes that shoot air straight upwards.

	The game is played with a light, flat puck that is knocked back and forth by two players. If the air is running on the table, (similar to the asymmetry of the balance and the extra vibrations on the filament in Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments,) then in this case, the gravity on the puck is counteracted by an upwards force, creating a more delicate balance between the two.

	The puck may remain perfectly still when left alone, but if you introduce new energy into the system by hitting the puck while the air is on, it moves extremely fast and with very little effort. When the air is off, the puck moves much more slowly and requires a greater force to set it in motion.

	The same is true with Kozyrev&rsquo;s detectors. If the extra vibrational energy isn&rsquo;t included, then you&rsquo;d be lucky to ever see a reaction, because the &ldquo;push&rdquo; of the torsion waves are not normally strong enough to move a stationary object. Many scientists who have tried to replicate Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments have often not succeeded, because they do not see the extra vibrations as being important.

	Naturally, you will not detect torsion waves with a pendulum if it is not asymmetrical and / or if you do not introduce vibrations into it at the top of the string. Another way to visualize this effect is our analogy from the prologue, regarding the difference between a drop of water that is placed onto cold metal as opposed to that which is placed on a hot skillet.

	The vibrations of the metal in the skillet will cause the water to zip around the pan, becoming very sensitive to the slightest change in pressure from any direction.

	For our spiritually-inclined readers, it is interesting to note that the teachings of the Initiates have referred to the need to &ldquo;raise your vibrations&rdquo; for thousands of years if you want to be capable of perceiving the unseen energy of the universe.

	As we have proven in some of our workshops, within a relatively short span of time, a human being can be trained to respond to the gentle pressure of torsion waves in the human &ldquo;aura&rdquo; by touch. With greater training such as is described in the works of Rudolph Steiner or Carlos Castenada, the human energy field can eventually be visually seen.

	In later works we will discuss the voluminous evidence to prove that the human energy field does indeed exist, as the torsion-wave component to our physical bodies.

	

	1.8 SIMPLE MOVEMENT CREATES TORSION WAVES

	Some of Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments seemed almost deceptively simple, considering the effects that he was able to achieve. For example, the simple raising and lowering of a 10-kg weight would exert torsional pressure on a pendulum at a distance of 2-3 meters, an effect which would even travel through walls.

	The pendulum that was used as a detector was shielded in glass under a vacuum, so this effect could not have been caused by the air. Again, the key component to the experiment was that the top of the string needed to be vibrated in order to introduce the extra tension and movement that would allow the pressure of the torsion waves to be picked up by the pendulum.

	This is another experiment that shows how the sheer mass of the 10-kilogram weight behaves like a sponge in water, creating &ldquo;ripples&rdquo; in the surrounding &ldquo;water&rdquo; when it is moved up and down. Again, this is a basic property of matter.

	

	1.9 WEIGHT INCREASE AND DECREASE CAUSED BY SIMPLE MOVEMENT

	In another similar experiment, Kozyrev had a typical beam balance that is used for weight measurements, where the right side had a fixed weight and the left side had a hook for suspending various objects.

	In this case, the objects Kozyrev hung from the left side were also just simple weights, only they were attached to rubber strips that allowed them to be easily mounted on the balance. Normally, with the weights on either side in a stable position, the beam would stay balanced at a certain weight that could be measured on its scale.

	Kozyrev would then stabilize the arm of the beam balance either with his hand or a clamp so it wouldn&rsquo;t move, and remove the object on the left from its hook. Then, he would shake the object up and down on the piece of rubber for about one minute. That&rsquo;s all!

	After doing this, when he would place the object back on the balance arm with perfect stillness, he would again measure its weight, which would be slightly higher than before. Then, the scales would show the measured weight of the object gradually decreasing, as it released the extra energy that it had taken in.

	He noted that it was important that his hand didn&rsquo;t heat the balance arm while holding it, so he would typically use a metal clamp to hold the bar instead.

	Interestingly, on certain days this test would work quite easily, whereas on other days it would work only with great difficulty or not at all. The same is true for the above experiment where a 10-kg weight was raised and lowered repeatedly. This is known as a &ldquo;time-variable&rdquo; phenomenon and will be discussed below.

	

	1.10 KOZYREV&rsquo;S RESULTS HAVE BEEN REPLICATED, NEVER DISPROVEN

	Many readers have expected that Kozyrev&rsquo;s effects are simply due to errors in his recording. Here, it is important to remember that no concrete disproof of N.A. Kozyrev and V.V. Nasonov&rsquo;s experimental results exists (Levich, 1996).

	In addition, independent groups of researchers have now reproduced and confirmed some of Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments. These include A.I. Veinik from the 1960s-1980s, Lavrentyev, Yeganova et al. in 1990, Lavrentyev, Gusev et al. in 1990, and Lavrentyev et al. in 1991 and 1992. American researcher Don Savage has also replicated much of Kozyrev&rsquo;s work and published it in Speculations in Science and Tech.

	Furthermore, without any knowledge of Kozyrev&rsquo;s work, in 1989 G. Hayasaka and S. Tekeyuchi discovered similar weight-loss effects with rotating 150-gram gyroscopes, and more recently obtained success by dropping the gyroscopes between two precision laser beam detectors.

	(Remember that a gyroscope that is being weighed in a rotating and non-rotating state will not show any measurable weight changes unless an additional process is introduced such as vibration, movement, (in this case dropping,) heat conduction or electric current transition.)

	The results of Hayasaka et al.&rsquo;s study, conducted on behalf of the Mitsubishi corporation, actually did make it into the mainstream media, surprisingly enough. Furthermore, they did indeed attribute their results to the effects of torsion fields.

	Many other researchers such as Dr. S.M. Polyakov, Dr. Bruce DePalma and Sandy Kidd have independently discovered gravitational changes with gyroscopes, but it appears that most of them have not fully understood the fluidlike nature of the aether, which always travels in the spiraling movement of torsion waves.

	

	1.11 ANTI-GRAVITY EFFECTS CAUSED BY THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION

	Many of Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments showed that the direction of the detector&rsquo;s movement was very important in creating measurable weight changes. He determined that a gyroscope that was vibrating, heating or conducting electricity would substantially decrease its weight when it was rotated in a counter-clockwise motion, whereas it would remain unchanged if it were rotated in a clockwise motion.

	Kozyrev concluded that this was caused by the &ldquo;Coriolis effect,&rdquo; where an object will indeed show a rotational movement as it is dropped towards the surface of the Earth. Ultimately, this is due to the subtle spiraling pressure of torsion that is imparted to the flow of aether (gravity) as it rushes into the earth, upholding the existence of all its atoms and molecules.

	In 1680 Newton and Hook confirmed that the Coriolis effect was real by dropping objects down long mine shafts, and the experiment was repeated many times thereafter.

	The Coriolis effect causes counter-clockwise movement in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise movement in the Southern Hemisphere, and is considered the major force behind the movement of weather systems. It also has to be factored in when firing long-range cannons at a specific target, which was a very confusing military problem before the Coriolis effect was discovered. It is another little-known fact of science that most people are unaware of.

	We remember that Kozyrev would first vibrate, heat or electrify his gyroscope in order to see his anomalous effects. Under these conditions, he would then move the gyroscope in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. If the vibrating gyroscope is moved in a counter-clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere, then it is moving in unison with the counter-clockwise current of the Coriolis effect.

	This causes the object to absorb some of the energy that would normally be pushing it down, and a small but definite decrease in its weight is then measured.

	The work of G. Hayasaka and S. Tekeyuchi, which we mentioned above, independently confirmed the same anomalous result. When their gyroscope was rotated counter-clockwise it would fall slower than expected, whereas if it were rotating clockwise they could detect no changes, thus verifying Kozyrev&rsquo;s findings. Naturally, Japan is also in the Northern Hemisphere.

	Kozyrev also found that additional torsion would be introduced in these experiments if his gyroscope was not kept 100% horizontal, which suggested to him that gravity, which moves straight down, is somehow joined with torsion waves, as later theorists confirmed. Without the existence of an aether and the phenomenon of dynamic torsion, none of these results would even be remotely possible.

	

	1.12 DEPALMA&rsquo;S SPINNING BALL EXPERIMENT

	

	

	Figure 1.5 &ndash; Data of Dr. Bruce DePalma&rsquo;s Spinning Ball Experiment 
	from Hoagland&rsquo;s 1992 UN Briefing

	

	A perfect example of harnessing torsion waves by rotation was discovered completely independently by Dr. Bruce DePalma, frequently cited by R.C. Hoagland et al. on the Enterprise Mission website. Within a complete vacuum, DePalma took two steel balls and catapulted them into the air at equal angles, with an equal amount of force.

	The only difference was that one ball was rotating 27,000 times per minute and the other was stationary. The rotating ball traveled higher into the air and then descended faster than its counterpart, which violated all known laws of physics.

	The only explanation for this effect is that both balls are drawing energy into themselves from an unseen source, and the rotating ball is thus &ldquo;soaking up&rdquo; more of this energy than its counterpart &ndash; energy that would normally exist as gravity, moving down into the earth.

	With the addition of torsion-field research we can see that the spinning ball was able to harness naturally spiraling torsion waves in its environment, which gave it an additional supply of energy.

	

	1.13 TIME-VARIABLE EFFECTS

	Kozyrev found that a time-variable effect is produced within his experiments. He discovered that these experiments worked best in late autumn and the first half of winter, but were next to impossible to perform in the summer. Kozyrev believed that the heating of the atmosphere in the summer was creating a disturbance that would interrupt the flow of the torsion waves.

	The extra heat would cause the air molecules to jiggle more vigorously, and this in turn would disrupt the subtle spiraling pressures as the torsion-waves traveled. As he himself explained it, &ldquo;the heating by solar rays creates an atmospheric loader, interfering with the [experimental] effects.&rdquo;

	Earlier in his career he thought that this time-variable effect was caused by the naturally-occurring growth of vegetation in warmer months, since he had already noticed that the simple presence of growing plants could interfere with his experimental results, as they would draw energy into themselves that would normally flow to the detectors.

	Clearly, the combination of the plants absorbing the energy for their sustenance in the summer and the increased chaos of vibrations in the warmer atmosphere could both be responsible for the difficulty in making such measurements during the warmer seasons.

	This seasonal experimental effect could also prevent American scientists who might be living in an area like Southern California from ever being able to replicate his results, as they never experience the late autumn and winter conditions that were most favorable for the experiments to be done.

	

	1.14 LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION

	Another overall implication of Kozyrev&rsquo;s work is that the geographical location of the experiment also makes a significant difference. His best results were obtained when he carried out measurements near the North Pole, the most adventurous being conducted on chunks of drifting ice with a maximum latitude of 84 15&rsquo;, the North Pole being at 90.

	This is a very important point, as it shows us that the greatest amount of torsion-wave energy is flowing into the Earth at the polar regions, growing weaker as we move towards the equator.

	Certainly, most readers will wonder why there would be any effects associated with the poles of the earth. The answer is found in a study of magnetism.

	In 1991-92, A.I. Veinik determined that the typical &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; iron ferrite magnets do not only have a collective magnetic field, but a collective torsion field as well, with a right-handed spin at the north pole and a left-handed spin at the south.

	Dr. G. I. Shipov demonstrated that all electromagnetic fields generate torsion waves. So, since we all know that the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is most concentrated at the poles, then we can see that the greatest strength of torsion-waves would be in the polar regions as well.

	In his books and website, Richard Pasichnyk has demonstrated that earthquake impulses travel faster from north to south than from east to west. Thus, the added pressure of the torsion waves, instreaming and outflowing in the polar regions, affects far more than just the typical north-south polarity of the magnetic field that can be measured with a compass.

	Kozyrev also determined that the torsional energy flows differently in the southern hemisphere of the earth as opposed to the northern, and this again is due to the Coriolis effect. He also discovered that the speed of gravitational acceleration changes slightly between the northern and southern hemisphere by a subtle factor of 3.10^-5.

	This appears to be caused by the little-known fact that the spherical shape of the Earth is actually flatter in the northern hemisphere as opposed to the southern!

	This has also been observed and measured in other planets such as Jupiter and Saturn. Kozyrev believed that since the surface of the southern hemisphere was slightly farther away from the Earth&rsquo;s center of gravity than the northern hemisphere, this was responsible for the subtle change in the speed of gravity&rsquo;s acceleration.

	

	1.15 LATENT FORCES EXISTING AFTER ENERGY STOPS BEING GENERATED

	The word &ldquo;latent&rdquo; means &ldquo;left over,&rdquo; and Kozyrev observed certain effects that continued for a time after he had stopped creating any torsion waves and / or disturbance to the measured objects. We remember that Kozyrev demonstrated how the simple shaking of a weight on a rubber strip would cause its weight to increase, and that it would slowly drop back down to its normal rest mass once it was placed back on the balance beam.

	The time that the object takes to return to its normal weight is how we measure the &ldquo;latent force&rdquo; that it is capable of holding.

	Certain objects will gain and lose weight faster than others in Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments. Kozyrev concluded that the rate at which an object gains or loses weight is actually based on its density, or thickness, not on its overall weight. He showed that the loss of weight occurs at an exponential rate, and the denser the material is, the quicker the residual forces will disappear. Here are some examples:

	
		Lead, at a density of 11, will lose its latent forces in 14 seconds,
	
		Aluminum, at a density of 2.7, loses its latent forces in 28 seconds, and
	
		Wood, at a density of 0.5, loses its latent forces in 70 seconds.


	

	If this seems hard to understand, we could think of the fact that a denser, thicker sponge such as the foam used in a mattress or seat cushion has much more of a &ldquo;spring&rdquo; to it than a lighter, thinner one, such as a tired old kitchen sponge.

	The more of a &ldquo;spring&rdquo; the material has, the quicker it can absorb and release energy. Kozyrev also tested these effects on copper, brass, quartz, glass, air, water, coal, graphite, table salt and others, and indicated that &ldquo;the largest effects, with maximum preservation times, were observed on porous materials like brick or volcano tuff&rdquo; (Nasonov 1985a, p.15).

	This should interest us, since the sponge in our analogy is also a porous material, meaning that it is filled with many pores or holes inside of itself.

	

	1.15.1 THE ASPDEN EFFECT

	Another example of latent forces existing in a system is found in the Aspden effect, discovered by Dr. Harold Aspden of Cambridge University. This experiment involved a gyroscope whose central wheel was fashioned from a powerful magnet.

	The normal amount of energy that would be required to rotate the gyroscope to a certain maximum speed was 1000 joules. Like a glass of water being stirred up with a spoon, the rotation of the gyroscope would cause the aetheric energy inside its central wheel to begin spiraling, and this churning movement would continue inside the object even once Dr. Aspden brought the gyroscope to a stop.

	Surprisingly, for up to 60 seconds after Aspden&rsquo;s gyroscope stopped rotating, it would take ten times less energy to return it to the same velocity as it had attained the first time &ndash; only 100 joules.

	This is another reproducible effect that has simply been ignored by the mainstream, because it &ldquo;violates the laws of physics.&rdquo; However, with Kozyrev&rsquo;s work as a background, we can hear the chuckles of Russian scientists as they read of Dr. Aspden&rsquo;s troubles in getting anyone in the West to acknowledge this effect.

	Now if you&rsquo;ve been paying attention, you might notice that Kozyrev showed that lead (Pb) maintained its latent forces for 14 seconds and aluminum for 28, and yet Dr. Aspden&rsquo;s gyroscopes would retain their forces for a full 60 seconds.

	This is due to the fact that extra aetheric / torsional energy is harnessed by the powerful permanent magnet making up the center of the gyroscope &ndash; and in The Science of Oneness we demonstrated how this basic property of rotating magnets has been used to create many different &ldquo;free energy&rdquo; devices.

	

	1.16 MASTER LIST OF NON-MECHANICAL DETECTORS

	Although we have discussed gyroscopes, pendulums and torsion beam balances so far, Kozyrev also discovered non-mechanical detectors that could pick up the energy of the &ldquo;time flow.&rdquo;

	What we mean by &ldquo;non-mechanical&rdquo; is that torsion waves could be detected without the moving parts normally required, which involved two different forms of mechanical vibration or motion, such as in the gyroscope, torsion balance and pendulum.

	Some of these non-mechanical detectors can demonstrate quite substantial changes in the presence of torsion fields, and in the case of tungsten and quartz, the effects of torsion fields on the material can be irreversible. All of the following will show changes in the presence of torsion-wave energy:

	
		the conductiveness of electronic resistors, especially those made from tungsten metal
	
		the mercury level in thermometers
	
		the vibrational frequencies of quartz crystal oscillators
	
		the electric potentials of thermocouples
	
		the viscosity of water
	
		the amount of electronic work that can be performed in a photoelectric cell
	
		the reaction rates of chemical compounds (such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky effect)
	
		the growth parameters of bacteria and plants


	

	A highly-detailed summary of Kozyrev&rsquo;s work, including the exact graphs, detailed statistics, analyses and descriptions of all the above detectors, can be found in &ldquo;A Substantial Interpretation of N.A. Kozyrev&rsquo;s Conception of Time,&rdquo; by A.P. Levich, 1996.

	

	1.17 CHERNETSKY&rsquo;S REPLICATION

	Some of these non-mechanical torsion-wave detectors were reproduced by the team of A.V. Chernetsky, Y.A. Galkin and S.N. Kolokoltzev, who also created a device that generated and stored this aetheric energy much like a capacitor, which is an electronic component that stores an electric charge. They referred to their invention as a &ldquo;self-generating discharge device.&rdquo;

	Like Kozyrev, Chernetsky et al. found that the level of resistance in an electronic circuit would change if a part of it was placed between the two capacitor plates of the device while it was in operation. Also, the vibrational frequency of a quartz oscillator could become 1000 or more times faster than it was before it was placed in between the plates.

	This should raise an eyebrow, as the reliability of quartz crystals to maintain a steady pulsating rhythm while having electricity pass through them is used to keep accurate time in the vast majority of digital watches and clocks in existence.

	

	1.18 LATENT FORCES IN THE VACUUM AND IN MATTER

	Chernetsky et al. also discovered that their &ldquo;self-generating discharge device&rdquo; could create a &ldquo;static&rdquo; or non-moving torsion field within the very structure of space-time itself. A flowing &ldquo;current&rdquo; can be created in the fluidlike aether even if no matter existed in the area.

	Chernetsky et al. could still measure the same torsion-field effects in the area that had been between the two plates of the machine, after the machine was turned off and far removed from the area! The latent effects would still be measurable with tungsten metal or quartz oscillators.

	Another similar effect was discovered by Donald Roth, which he called &ldquo;Magnetic Memory,&rdquo; and documented by the Institute for New Energy. Roth discovered that he could bring a magnet close enough to a beam balance that it would attract the balance to itself, and after about five days the magnet could be moved much farther away from the balance and still attract it the same way.

	The Russians refer to this concept as &ldquo;vacuum structuring,&rdquo; and it again shows us that there is &ldquo;something there&rdquo; in supposedly empty space &ndash; something that the inheritors of the Atlantean Mysteries knew as the &ldquo;aether.&rdquo;

	Kozyrev also discovered that a physical substance can become &ldquo;structured&rdquo; in the same way. As he wrote on page 217 of his 1977 paper,

	
		&hellip; A body placed for a certain time near a process [that generates torsion waves] and then brought to a torsion balance [would] produce the same effect on [the torsion balance] as [the original torsion-generating] process [produced by] itself. [The] memorizing [of] the action of processes is a feature of [all] different substances, except aluminum.


	

	In 1984, Dankachov showed that the &ldquo;memory&rdquo; or &ldquo;structuring&rdquo; effect could occur with water as well, and this is one experiment that does find its way into Western alternative scientific thinking from time to time. The &ldquo;memory of water&rdquo; experiments begin by utilizing one of the basic torsion-wave creating processes to cause the measured viscosity or thickness of water to decrease.

	Then, the treated water is placed next to another container of water, and the new water&rsquo;s viscosity will then decrease just like the original treated water. Other experiments, such as those of Jacques Beneviste, show that this &ldquo;memory of water&rdquo; effect is able to carry over into chemical effects as well, where torsion-wave generators are used to excite water with a certain chemical compound in it.

	Then, that compound can be energetically transferred to a sealed container of pure water, and the sealed water will acquire the same chemical characteristics as the original.

	

	1.19 SOLAR ECLIPSE ENERGY SHIELDING EFFECT

	As we already suggested in the prologue, the Sun is our obvious choice for being the primary source of torsion waves in our heliosphere, due to it having 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.

	In 1970, Saxel and Allen showed that during a solar eclipse, the presence of the moon shields the Sun&rsquo;s radiant torsion fields, and this causes an increase in the period of oscillation for a torsion balance.

	Meteorologists V.S. Kazachok, O.V. Khavroshkin and V.V. Tsyplakov were able to repeat this experiment during the 1976 solar eclipse and produce the same effect, which they then published in 1977. Others have obtained the same results through observing the simple deviations of a pendulum at the time of a solar eclipse.

	

	1.20 MOLECULAR ALIGNMENTS AIDING OR SHIELDING TORSION EFFECTS

	As we already mentioned, the Einstein-Cartan theory first established a theoretical basis for the existence of torsion fields in 1913. The theory predicts that there will either be right-handed or left-handed torsion in space, depending on the location.

	Subsequent discoveries in quantum physics related to the notion of &ldquo;spin&rdquo; confirmed that &ldquo;electrons&rdquo; will either have &ldquo;right-handed&rdquo; or &ldquo;left-handed&rdquo; spin, meaning that movement is detected that will either be clockwise or counterclockwise. All atoms and molecules maintain varying degrees of balance between right and left-handed spin.

	Kozyrev determined that strongly right-handed molecules such as sugar can shield torsion effects, whereas strongly left-handed molecules such as turpentine will strengthen them. Subsequent Russian investigations also determined that common polyethylene film acted as an excellent shield for torsion waves, and were used in many different experiments such as those discussed by Dr. Alexander Frolov.

	

	1.21 &ldquo;QUANTIZED&rdquo; CHANGES IN WEIGHT

	We discussed Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments where an object would be disturbed in various ways, and its changes in weight would then slowly return to balance over time. There is one important factor that emerged in these experiments that does not easily fit in with our convenient analogy of the sponge in water, and that is known as &ldquo;effect quantization.&rdquo;

	(We shall explain what causes it later.)

	When something is quantized, that means that it does not move or count smoothly, but only stepwise, in certain specific intervals. Simply put, the weight of an object would not increase or decrease steadily in the &ldquo;latent force&rdquo; experiments, but rather in sudden bursts. This is certainly a highly anomalous property for matter to have. As Kozyrev said,

	
		In the vibration experiments on a balance the weight reduction&hellip; occurs stepwise, beginning with a certain vibration power. As vibration frequency is further increased, the weight reduction&hellip; at first remains the same and then again grows stepwise by the same value&hellip; So far a realistic explanation of this phenomenon has not been found&hellip;
	
		Afterwards it turned out that effect quantization takes place in almost all the experiments. (Kozyrev 1971, p. 126)


	

	As a case in point, Kozyrev studied these effects on a 620-gram weight, which he would subject to vibrations, measured in hertz or cycles per second. We remember that cooling an object contracts it, whereas heating an object expands it.

	Both heating and cooling are functions of vibration, so depending on how we vibrate an object, we can either cause its weight to increase or decrease. In this experiment, the mass of the 620-gram weight would be slightly increased by subjecting it to high-speed vibrations.

	In order to give the experiments nice, clean numbers, Kozyrev and Nasonov later applied a straightforward mathematical function to &ldquo;renormalize&rdquo; the results from the 620-gram weight to the higher and simpler value of 1 kilogram. The numbers given in the next paragraph are renormalized to the 1-kilogram level.

	

	

	Figure 1.6 &ndash; Quantized increases in weight with growing vibrational frequency, 
	measured by beam balance.

	

	So as we can see from this chart, as the vibrations of the object rose to the threshold area of 16-23 hertz, (or cycles per second,) the object would show a stable weight increase of 31 milligrams. At this level, Kozyrev could increase the vibrations between 16 and 23 cycles per second and detect no further weight gain.

	Then suddenly, as he increased the vibrations on the weight to 24 hertz, its overall weight increase would spontaneously double to 62 milligrams. As he increased the vibrations from 24 to 27 hertz, no change in weight was registered.

	Yet, when the vibrations increased to 28 hertz, the net weight increase would again suddenly jump up by another 31 hertz to 93 milligrams. Each time that a new threshold would be reached, the initial gain of 31 milligrams would be added to the overall amount. As Kozyrev discovered,

	
		We succeeded in obtaining fivefold and even tenfold effects. (!)


	

	Let us not forget that this &ldquo;effect quantization&rdquo; occurred in almost all of Kozyrev&rsquo;s experiments, whether the overall weight of the object in question was either increasing or decreasing.

	In order for something like this to be taking place, the basic 31-milligram interval that was measured with the 1-kilogram object must be a function of its combined volume, density, weight and topology (shape), similar to the tone that you hear when striking a bell of a given size, shape and density. As Kozyrev rose the frequency of vibrations in the object, new intervals of weight increase were produced, but always in units of 31 milligrams.

	This &ldquo;effect quantization&rdquo; is actually a very important key to understanding the multidimensional nature of matter, illustrating that atoms and molecules maintain an onion-like structure of nested spherical waves. Our discussions in the next chapter will begin to show the context of this experiment and how it relates to new discoveries in quantum physics.

	

	1.22 DIFFICULTY IN COMBINING KOZYREV&rsquo;S VIEWS WITH MAINSTREAM SCIENCE

	Kozyrev&rsquo;s views are not quickly or easily assimilated by the mainstream scientific community, especially in the West, because the magnitudes of the effects he measured are quite small.

	For example, the additional forces that were introduced in his mechanical experiments changed the weight of the objects being studied by a mere factor of 10^-4 to 10^-5, such as the gyroscope that would only become 100 milligrams lighter when rotating and vibrating at the same time.

	In order to appreciate how small of a change this is, remember that a certain active ingredient that was added to a vitamin pill might have 100 milligrams of weight on the label.

	As Kozyrev himself puts it,

	
		&ldquo;The experimental results show that the organizing property of time exerts a very small influence on systems [of matter such as stars,] compared with the usual, destructive course of their development. Therefore it is not surprising that this&hellip; entity has been missed in our system of scientific knowledge. However, being small, it is distributed everywhere in nature, and only the possibility of its being stored is needed&rdquo; (Kozyrev 1982, p.71).

                      Dramatic scientific evidence that all of physical matter is formed by an aether of invisible, conscious energy has existed since at least the 1950s.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Renowned Russian astrophysicist Dr. Nikolai A. Kozyrev (1908-1983, pronounced Ko-zir-ev,) proved beyond any doubt that such an energy source had to exist, and as a result he became one of the most controversial figures in the history of the Russian scientific community.

                      The awesome implications of his work, and of all those who followed him, were almost entirely concealed by the former Soviet Union, but with the fall of the Iron Curtain and the advent of the Internet we are finally gaining access to Russias Best-Kept Secret.

                      Two generations of remarkable research by thousands of Ph.D. level specialists have emerged from Kozyrevs seed findings, which completely change our understanding of the Universe. With our prominent mention of him in this book, we hope to permanently establish his historical importance and impact to our colleagues and readers.

                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The word aether means shine in Greek, and the fundamental reality of such an unseen, fluidlike source of universal energy has long been a hallmark of the worlds secret mystery schools. The works of Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Plato discussed it at great length, as did the Vedic scriptures of ancient India, referring to it by several names such as prana and Akasha.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In the Orient, it is often known as chi or ki, and special emphasis is placed on its interactions with the human body, such as in the science of acupuncture. Masters and adepts who inherited the secret traditions could eventually learn to manipulate this energy to create miraculous results, such as levitation, teleportation, manifestation, instant healing, telepathy and the like.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Such results have been repeatedly documented in the 20th century and studied in the laboratory, as we wrote in Convergence: The Science of Oneness.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The aethers existence was widely accepted without question in scientific circles until the early 20th century, when the Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 was co-opted to prove that no such hidden energy source existed.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      However, more recent breakthroughs involving dark matter, dark energy, virtual particles, vaccum flux and zero-point energy, to name a few, have brought reluctant Western scientists to acknowledge that there must indeed be an unseen energy medium throughout the Universe.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      As long as you use a benign term like the quantum medium and not the forbidden word aether, you can talk about it in the mainstream press without much fear of ridicule.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The mainstream scientific establishment is very heavily polarized against anyone who gets too close to an aether theory, as they know that such a theory must be false and will therefore fight vigorously against it. However, such suppression only increases the desire and commitment that many others have put into solving the puzzle.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      One early example of proof for the existence of the aether comes from Dr. Hal Puthoff, a respected scientist from Cambridge University. Puthoff frequently mentions experiments from the early 20th century that were designed to see if there was any energy in empty space, conducted before quantum mechanics theory ever existed.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In order to test this idea in the laboratory, it was necessary to create an area that was completely free of air (a vacuum,) and lead-shielded from all known electromagnetic radiation fields by using what is known as a Faraday cage. This airless vacuum space was then cooled down to absolute zero or -273 C,the temperature where all matter should stop vibrating and thus produce no heat.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      These experiments proved that instead of an absence of energy in the vacuum, there was a tremendous amount of it, from a completely non-electromagnetic source! Dr. Puthoff has often called this a "seething cauldron" of energy in very high magnitudes.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Since this energy could still be found at absolute zero, this force was dubbed "zero point energy" or ZPE, whereas the Russian scientists usually call it the physical vacuum or PV. Recently, established mainstream physicists John Wheeler and Richard Feynman have calculated that:
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The amount of zero-point energy in the space volume of a single light bulb is powerful enough to bring all the world's oceans to the boiling point!
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Clearly, we are not dealing with some weak, unseen force, but rather a source of almost impossibly grand power, which would have more than enough strength to sustain the existence of all of physical matter.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In the new view of science that is emerging from aether theory, all four of the basic force fields, whether gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear or strong nuclear force, are all simply different forms of the aether/ZPE.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      To get another idea of how much free energy really exists all around us, Professor M.T. Daniels found that the density of the gravitational energy near the surface of the earth is equal to 5.74 x 10^10 (t/m^3). [Let us not forget that gravity would simply be another form of aether in this new model.]
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Prof. Daniels finding means that drawing a sizable 100 kilowatts of this free energy power from the gravitational field dips into an extremely tiny 0.001% of the natural energy that is being produced in that area. (New Energy News, June 1994, p.4)
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Research conducted by Nikola Tesla led to his statement in 1891 that the aether behaves as a fluid to solid bodies, and as a solid to light and heat, and that under sufficiently high voltage and frequency, it could be accessed  which was his hint that free energy and anti-gravity technologies were possible.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Let us pay special attention, again, to Teslas statement that the aether has a fluidlike effect when we are dealing with solid objects, as this ties in directly with the work of Dr. N.A. Kozyrev.

                       1.2 ANALOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING KOZYREVS FINDINGS
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In Chapters 3 and 4, we will explode the myths of quantum physics and show that the oft-cited particle model of the atom is seriously flawed. Just as Einsteins theory of relativity suggested, all of physical matter is ultimately made of pure energy, and there are no hard particles to be found in the quantum realm.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      More and more, the scientific community is being forced to accept that atoms and molecules are akin to candle flames, where the energy that they release (such as the heat and light of the flame) must be balanced by energy that they absorb (such as the wax of the candle and the oxygen in the air.)
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This candle analogy is a hallmark of Dr. Hal Puthoffs model, which he uses to explain why the hypothetical electron does not radiate away all of its energy and crash into the nucleus. This seemingly perpetual motion within the atom is simply explained away as the magic of quantum mechanics in the mainstream view.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In order to truly be able to get a grasp on Kozyrevs work and related findings, certain new analogies for physical matter are required. Rigorously, Kozyrevs work forces us to visualize all physical objects of matter in the Universe as if they were sponges that are submerged in water.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In all of these analogies, we should consider the sponges as having remained in water for a long enough period of time that they are completely saturated. Bearing this in mind, there are two things we can do with such sponges underwater: we can decrease the volume of water that they contain or increase it, by very simple mechanical procedures.
                     </p>
                     <ol>
                      <li class="orderedlist">
                       <strong>
                        <span class="bodysubtitle">
                         Decrease:
                        </span>
                       </strong>
                       If a submerged, saturated sponge is squeezed, cooled or rotated, then some of the water inside of it will be released into its surroundings, decreasing its mass. Once the sponge is no longer disturbed, the pressure on the millions of tiny pores is relieved, causing it to again absorb water and expand back to its normal resting mass.
                      </li>
                      <li class="orderedlist">
                       <strong>
                        <span class="bodysubtitle">
                         Increase:
                        </span>
                       </strong>
                       We can also pump more water pressure into the sponge in its rest state, such as by heating (vibrating) it, thus causing some of the pores to expand with more water than they can comfortably hold. In this case, once we relieve the added pressure, the sponge will naturally release its excess water and shrink back down to its normal resting mass.
                      </li>

                     <p class="body">
                      Though it would seem impossible to most people, Kozyrev showed that by shaking, spinning, heating, cooling, vibrating or breaking physical objects, their weight can be increased or decreased by subtle but definite amounts. And this is but one aspect of his amazing work.

                       1.3 BACKGROUND OF DR. N.A. KOZYREV
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Since the Western world is largely uneducated about Kozyrev, some biographical and research information is in order. This will establish that he was far from a crank or crackpot scientist, but was in fact considered as one of the pre-eminent Russian thinkers of the 20th century.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrevs first scientific paper was published at the tender age of seventeen, and other scientists were amazed by the depth and clarity of his logic. His main work was in astrophysics, where he studied the atmospheres of the Sun and other stars, the phenomenon of solar eclipses and radiation equilibrium.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      By age twenty he had already graduated from the University of Leningrad with a degree in physics and mathematics, and by age twenty-eight Dr. Kozyrev was widely known as a distinguished astronomer who had taught at several colleges.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrevs abundant life took a most unfortunate and difficult turn in 1936, when he was arrested under the repressive laws of Josef Stalin, and in 1937 he began eleven torturous years enduring all the known horrors of a concentration camp. Although he did not have access to scientific equipment during this time, he was given the most brutal of initiation experiences into hidden knowledge.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      To an already enlightened mind, such bone-jarring hardship can effectively burn off all desire for gratification from the material world, removing the resistance to higher consciousness so that a state of illumination is produced where universal truth can be immediately recognized and assimilated.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      From this state, he mused deeply upon the mysteries of the Universe, paying attention to all the patterns that existed in life, wherein so many different organisms show signs of asymmetry and / or spiraling growth.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      He knew that in the mid-1800s, Louis Pasteur discovered that the building block of life known as protoplasm is inherently not symmetrical, and that colonies of microbes grow in a spiral structure.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      These expanding proportions also underlie the structure of plants, insects, animals and people, as so many inheritors of the ancient tradition of the Atlantean Mysteries have written, when discussing sacred geometry such as the spiraling form known as Fibonacci, Golden Mean and / or phi spiral.

                     <p class="body">
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      From his illuminated observations in the prison camp, Kozyrev considered that all lifeforms might be drawing off of an unseen, spiraling source of energy, in addition to their normal properties of gaining energy through eating, drinking, breathing and photosynthesis. Later in this book we will see how comprehensive the data is on this point.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev theorized that things such as the direction of a shells spiraling growth and which side of the human body will contain the heart are determined by the direction of this flow. Should there be an area somewhere in space-time where the energy flow was spiraling in the opposite direction, then he would expect shells to grow in the opposite direction and the heart to be in the opposite side of the body cavity.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This concept of a spiraling energy in biology may seem unrealistic, but it has long been known in the mystery schools. The next image shows us how all the ratios of phi emerge naturally in the structure of the human arm, and this is but one example of a process that repeats all throughout the bodies of human beings as well as all other plants, animals and insects.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Those few who acknowledge these relationships at all will typically state that they emerge simply because phi represents the natural, most efficient pattern in which growth can occur. Kozyrev suggested that life couldnt form any other way, because it is actively drawing off of this spiraling energy to sustain itself, and must therefore follow its proportions every step of the way.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In this sense we can think of the skeletal system as an antenna for this energy.

                     <p class="body">
                      When Kozyrev was finally rehabilitated from the prison camp in 1948 and could return to his field of expertise, he made many advance predictions about the Moon, Venus and Mars, which were validated by Soviet space probes more than a decade later.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This then earned him the distinction of being a major pioneer in the Soviet space race. Then, in 1958, Dr. Kozyrev again aroused worldwide controversy by proclaiming that the Moon exhibited volcanic activity in the Alphonsus crater.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Should this notion have been true, which most astronomers and scientists flatly refused to believe, then it meant that the Moon possessed huge natural resources and sources of power that would make it an excellent stop-over point to propel humanity into the stars.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      U.S. Nobel Prize winner Dr. Harold Urey was among the narrow group who believed that Dr. Kozyrevs theory of volcanic activity on the moon was correct, and he urged NASA to conduct an investigation. As a direct result, NASA launched the enormous Moon Blink project, which later confirmed Dr. Kozyrevs assertions by finding significant gas emissions on the moon.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      However, not all of Kozyrevs work was quite so readily assimilated into the mainstream world of NASA. In the winter of 1951-1952, just three years after escaping the brutal initiation of the prison camp, Dr. Kozyrev began his foray into the world of exotic physics, with the first of what became an exhaustive series of 33 years worth of very intriguing and controversial experiments.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      His obvious desire in pursuing such research was to find validation for the spiritual truths that he had already experienced through the mystical process of preparation, illumination and initiation (as referred to in Rudolf Steiners classic Knowledge of Higher Worlds and Its Attainment) under the most extremely challenging of circumstances.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      When he began publishing the results of these breakthrough studies, many Russian scientists and a scarce few in the West were prepared to listen, based on his past successes.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      As we said, the spiraling energy patterns in nature unveiled themselves to the initiated eyes of Dr. Kozyrev while in the concentration camp. His direct knowledge informed him that this spiraling energy was in fact the true nature and manifestation of time. Obviously, he felt that time as we now know it is much more than just a simple function for counting duration.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev urges us to try to think of a cause for time, something tangible and identifiable in the Universe that we can associate with time. After pondering this for a while, we see that time is ultimately nothing but pure spiraling movement.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      We know that we are tracing a complex spiraling pattern through space thanks to the orbital patterns of the Earth and solar system. And now, the study of temporology, or the science of time, is under continual, active investigation by Moscow State University and the Russian Humanitarian Foundation, inspired by Dr. Kozyrevs pioneering work. On their website, they state that:
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">
                       In our understanding, the nature of time is the mechanism [that brings about] appearing changes and occurring newness in the World. To understand the nature of time is to point to a process, a phenomenon, a carrier in the material world whose properties could be identified or corresponded with those of time.
                      </p>
                      <p class="body">
                      </p>
                     </blockquote>
                     <p class="body">
                      This may seem strange at first glance, since a tree falling in your yard could be seen as a product of a strong wind, not the flow of time. However, you must then ask yourself what caused the wind to blow? Ultimately, the motion of the Earth on its axis is most responsible.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Hence, all changes are caused by some form of movement, and without movement there can be no time. Several of the scholars whose papers are published through the Russian Institute of Temporology agree that if Kozyrev had changed his terminology and use of the word time to more common scientific terms such as the physical vacuum or the aether, then many more people would have been able to understand his work sooner in the ensuing years.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      It is not necessary at this point for the reader to fully grasp the philosophy of spiraling energy as a manifestation of time, as this will become far clearer as we proceed.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      One of very few media breaks that Kozyrev ever received in the West regarding his concepts was a chapter in Sheila Ostrander and Lynn Schroeders groundbreaking 1970 book, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain, which has gained worldwide acclaim and is still being reprinted to this day with the shortened title Psychic Discoveries.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Most of the above background biographical information on Kozyrevs early career experience has come from this source. In Chapter 13, entitled Time  A New Frontier of the Mind, the authors explain that even in his sixties, Kozyrev was tanned and athletic looking and gave off an impression of great calm, an almost spiritual quality.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      They also state that:
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">
                       In reputation and in work achieved, he is the most important scientist we met. He is attempting to elucidate a new world view, a new cosmogony. Under Kozyrevs new conception, psychic happenings would fall into place. They would no longer be, as they are in the current view of science, something outside the system, something that must be denied to protect the system.
                      </p>
                      <p class="body">
                      </p>

                     <p class="body">
                      The connection of psychic phenomena to physics is well known and frequently discussed in the Russian literature that is now becoming increasingly available, and Kozyrevs work undoubtedly paved the way for it. One of the few Western researchers to notice Dr. Kozyrevs work was Dr. Albert Wilson of the Douglas Research Laboratories in California, who said,
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">
                       I feel that something very much like what Kozyrev has hypothesized will be established in physical theory within the next decade or two. Its implications will be revolutionary. It could take a generation of work before the leap he has taken can be incorporated into the body of scientific knowledge.
                      </p>
                      <p class="body">
                      </p>

                     <p class="body">
                      Dr. Wilsons timing was about one decade too short, as now at the dawn of the 21st century we can finally put all the pieces together. In order to keep our terms consistent, we will use the common scientific terms torsion fields and / or torsion waves to describe the spiraling flow of time energy that Kozyrev discovered.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      [The word torsion essentially means spinning or twisting.]
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Many Western scientists who have explored these topics, most notably Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, call them scalar waves, but we feel that torsion waves is ultimately an easier term to use, since it continually reminds us of their spiraling nature. The reader should be aware that in all cases, what we are dealing with is simply an impulse of momentum that travels through the medium of the aether / ZPE / physical vacuum, and does not possess electromagnetic qualities.
                     </p>

                      Before Kozyrev ever began conducting his experiments, a good, solid theoretical foundation was already in place to begin explaining his results. We will begin with a preliminary discussion of Einsteins theory of relativity, followed by Dr. Eli Cartans additions to the model, which first established the existence of torsion fields in theory.

                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      On May 29, 1919, Albert Einstein supposedly proved that we live in a curved four-dimensional space-time where space and time are somehow fused together into a fabric. He believed that an object such as the Earth spinning in space would drag space and time along with it, and that this space-time fabric curves inward around a planetary body. Thus, he said,

                      <p class="body">
                       Gravity is no longer a mysterious force acting at a distance, but [rather is] the result of an object trying to travel in a straight line through space [that is] curved by the presence of material bodies.

                      <p class="body">

                     <p class="body">
                      Space that is curved? Waitisnt space supposed to be empty? you ask. How can you curve something that is empty? As we can see, the significant problem in visualizing Einsteins gravity model is with the word curve, as this is something that a flat, elastic sheet would do.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Indeed, most attempts to visualize Einsteins results picture planets as if they were weights that were depressing an imaginary flat rubber sheet that is stretched out in space as the fabric of space-time. An object such as a comet or asteroid simply follows the geometry of the sheet as it moves towards the Earth.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The problem with this model is that any curvature of space-time would need to be moving in towards a spherical object from all directions, not just a flat plane. And furthermore, one still requires a force of gravity to pull a weight down into a flat rubber sheet. In a weightless space, the ball and the sheet would simply float around together.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In reality, the word flowing is far more precise than curving, since in Convergence III we have demonstrated that gravity is actually a form of aetheric energy that is constantly flowing into an object.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The equations for gravity do not specify which direction it must flow in, simply that it exists as a force that is responsible for objects not flying away from the Earths surface. Such ideas can be traced to John Keely, Dr. Walter Russell and more recently Walter Wright with his well-established Push Gravity theory.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Once we establish that all force fields such as gravity and electromagnetism are simply different forms of aether/ZPE in motion, then we have an active source for gravity and a straightforward reason for why it would exist. We see that every molecule in the entire body of a planet must be sustained by an ongoing in-flow of aetheric energy.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The same energy that is creating the Earth is also creating and flowing into us. We are then caught up in the gigantic current of the river of energy that streams into the Earth, much as mosquitoes get stuck to a screen window while the air blows right through the screen.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Our bodies cannot travel through solid matter, but the current of aetheric energy certainly can  and this is one of the many things that Keely, Tesla, Kozyrev and others demonstrated. A star or planet must continually draw energy from its environment in order to stay alive. Kozyrev had made very similar conclusions about our Sun back in the 1950s, concluding that stars acted as machines that convert the flow of time into heat and light.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Almost all Western scientists believe that Einsteins general and special relativity theories eliminate the need for an aether  and indeed, Einstein advocated the rejection of an aether in 1910, which is where mainstream science still believes his thoughts ended on the issue. However, in 1920, Einstein actually stated that the hypothesis of the existence of the ether does not contradict the special theory of relativity. And in 1924, he wrote,
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">

                       <strong>
                        we cannot get along without the ether,

                       i.e., a continuum assigned physical properties, because the general theory of relativity excludes direct long-range action; and each theory of short-range action assumes the presence of continuous fields and, consequently, the existence of the ether. [emphasis added]

                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In 1913, Dr. Eli Cartan was the first to clearly demonstrate that the fabric (flow) of space and time in Einsteins general theory of relativity not only curved, but it also possessed a spinning or spiraling movement within itself known as torsion.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This area of physics is typically referred to as Einstein-Cartan Theory, or ECT. Cartans theory wasnt taken too seriously at the time, as it came out before the days of quantum physics, when elementary particles such as electrons were believed to rotate or spin as they orbited the nucleus.

                      Most people are unaware that it is now generally accepted that the space surrounding the Earth and perhaps the entire Galaxy has right-handed spin, meaning that energy will be influenced to spin clockwise as it travels through the physical vacuum. In 1996, Russian Drs. Akimov and Shipov wrote that:
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">
                       To date, world periodicals reference to torsion fields amount to the order of 10,000 articles, belonging to about a hundred authors. Over one half of those theorists work in Russia alone.

                     <p class="body">
                      As we shall easily see, Dr. Kozyrevs work was the main influence for the more than 5,000 Russian papers on this subject as of 1996. In classical physics models, torsion fields were never considered to be a universal force on the level of gravity or electromagnetic energy, largely because they only existed theoretically.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Cartans original 1913 theory speculated that torsion fields would be some 30 orders of magnitude weaker than gravitation, and gravity is already known to be 40 orders of magnitude weaker than electromagnetic energy! With such a miniscule level of influence, so said the theories, the naturally-spinning torsion fields were basically an irrelevant footnote that would not make any noticeable contributions to the phenomena that we can observe in the universe.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      For those scientists who had maintained an open mind, the works of Trautman, Kopczyynski, F. Hehl, T. Kibble, D. Sciama and others in the early 1970s triggered a wave of interest in torsion fields. Hard scientific facts exploded Cartans 60-year-old theory-based myth that such fields were weak, tiny and unable to move through space.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The myth of the Einstein-Cartan theory was that the spiraling torsion fields could not move, (i.e. they would remain static,) and could only exist within a space far smaller than the atom.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Sciama et al. demonstrated that these basic torsion fields expected in ECT did exist, and they were referred to as static torsion fields. The difference was that dynamic torsion fields were demonstrated as well, with properties far more remarkable than Einstein and Cartan had assumed.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      According to Sciama et al., static torsion fields are created from spinning sources that do not radiate any energy. However, once you have a spinning source that releases energy in any form, such as the Sun or the center of the Galaxy, and / or a spinning source that has more than one form of movement occurring at the same time, such as a planet that is rotating on its axis and revolving around the Sun at the same time, then dynamic torsion is automatically produced.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This phenomenon allows torsion waves to propagate through spaceinstead of simply staying in a single static spot. Thus, torsion fields, like gravity or electromagnetism, are capable of moving from one place to another in the Universe.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Furthermore, as we shall discover in later chapters, Kozyrev proved decades ago that these fields travel at superluminal speeds, meaning that they far exceed the speed of light.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      If you can have an impulse that moves directly through the fabric of space-time, travels at super-luminal velocities and is separate from gravity or electromagnetism, you have a significant breakthrough in physics  one that demands that a physical vacuum, zero-point energy or aether must really exist.

                      Returning to the more comfortable arena of physical matter, Kozyrevs work showed that torsion fields can be absorbed, shielded or sometimes reflected. For example, sugar can absorb, polyethylene film and aluminum can shield, and other forms of aluminum or mirrors can reflect.

                      Kozyrev found that in the presence of this energy flow, objects that are rigid and inelastic will show weight changes, whereas flexible, elastic objects will show changes in their elasticity and / or viscosity.

                      Obviously, the biggest unanswered challenge at this point would be how such energy could be mechanically detected. After all, it has completely eluded the mainstream for well over a century. Here, it is important to remember that though the forces of torsion waves on matter are relatively small, they do exert a steady push.

                     <p class="body">
                      Research of Shipov, Terletskiy and other Russian theorists have directly associated the energy of torsion fields with the energy of gravity, thus leading to the term gravispin energy and the science of gravispinorics.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In these new theories, gravity and spin are coupled in the same basic manner as electrostatics and magnetism join to form the electromagnetic wave. Though torsion waves can travel in any direction, they are most typically absorbed into the downward flow of the gravitational field.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      So, the strongest effects of the pressure of torsion waves would be a slight spiraling movement that is joined with gravity. Since it is a very subtle pressure, we do not typically notice any such movement in ourselves or in falling objects.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Many of Kozyrevs mechanical detectors of torsion waves involved objects in motion, such as a rotating gyroscope or an asymmetrical swinging pendulum. A simple analogy helps us to begin to understand how such objects in motion were able to capture this gentle pressure.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      If you have a ship at sea and do not align your sails with the direction of the winds flow, then your ship will not move. Your sails must align with the direction of the wind, and if the winds current changes, then you must also move the sail to capture the new direction.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Detecting torsion waves is a more difficult process than sailing, as the torsion waves are continually changing their direction in the form of a three-dimensional spiral. Somehow, you must create vibrations in the detecting object that will allow it to continually harness a three-dimensional, moving spiral of energy force.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev was able to capture the subtle pressure of the torsion waves by combining two different forms of vibration or movement at a time. We will discuss exactly how this was done in the following paragraphs. Under these special laboratory conditions, gyroscopes or pendulums could be used to interact with the time flow energy, as Kozyrev called it.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In these cases, such detectors will exhibit weight variations or sudden angular movements in response to the energy.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      One of the most basic detectors of time flow energy that Kozyrev used was the torsion balance, meaning that it was a balance beam that could spin freely as it was suspended from a thread.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      As described in Kozyrevs first paper for the year 1971, the torsion balance did not have an equal distribution of weight on either side, as one end of the beam weighed ten grams and the other end was only one gram.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev suspended this beam with a string (filament) of capron that was 30 micrometers in diameter and 5-10 centimeters long. The string was attached much closer to the heavier end of the beam than the lighter end, so that the beam would remain in a perfect horizontal position under the effects of gravity. This positioning also created greater stress within the beam itself, making it move very easily.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The lighter end of the beam was fashioned into a pointer, so that Kozyrev could measure on a protractor how many degrees the beam had moved at any time.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In order to avoid being influenced by the atmosphere, the entire system was sealed under a glass cap so that all of the air inside could be vacuumed out. Furthermore, Kozyrev surrounded the cap with a metal net (similar to a Faraday cage) so that all known electromagnetic influences would be shielded.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Most importantly, the top of the filament, where the beam balance was hanging from, was mechanically vibrated by an electromagnetic device.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The experiments were not considered valid unless the beam would remain perfectly still even in the presence of the extra vibrations at the top of the string. However, these extra vibrations jiggling the top of the string created a greater sensitivity to outside vibration that would reverberate throughout the entire object.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      We already have an uneven set of weights that are carefully suspended on a thin string so that they remain horizontal, giving us a system that is under a lot of stress and will move very easily with the slightest touch. This is similar to the power of the lever to allow a person to lift up their entire car with the simple cranking up of the jack.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Then, when you also add the stress of the vibrations moving up and down the string and into the balance itself, you have all the necessary ingredients to make the detector so extremely sensitive that the whisper-soft pressure of torsion waves can show a measurable effect. This is one of several clever ways to capture and detect these forces. (As another example, a gyroscope may be set in motion and then hung from a string that is vibrated.)
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In some senses this extra sensitivity works in the same way as an air hockey table, where you have a flat, rectangular surface with many tiny holes that shoot air straight upwards.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The game is played with a light, flat puck that is knocked back and forth by two players. If the air is running on the table, (similar to the asymmetry of the balance and the extra vibrations on the filament in Kozyrevs experiments,) then in this case, the gravity on the puck is counteracted by an upwards force, creating a more delicate balance between the two.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The puck may remain perfectly still when left alone, but if you introduce new energy into the system by hitting the puck while the air is on, it moves extremely fast and with very little effort. When the air is off, the puck moves much more slowly and requires a greater force to set it in motion.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The same is true with Kozyrevs detectors. If the extra vibrational energy isnt included, then youd be lucky to ever see a reaction, because the push of the torsion waves are not normally strong enough to move a stationary object. Many scientists who have tried to replicate Kozyrevs experiments have often not succeeded, because they do not see the extra vibrations as being important.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Naturally, you will not detect torsion waves with a pendulum if it is not asymmetrical and / or if you do not introduce vibrations into it at the top of the string. Another way to visualize this effect is our analogy from the prologue, regarding the difference between a drop of water that is placed onto cold metal as opposed to that which is placed on a hot skillet.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The vibrations of the metal in the skillet will cause the water to zip around the pan, becoming very sensitive to the slightest change in pressure from any direction.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      For our spiritually-inclined readers, it is interesting to note that the teachings of the Initiates have referred to the need to raise your vibrations for thousands of years if you want to be capable of perceiving the unseen energy of the universe.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      As we have proven in some of our workshops, within a relatively short span of time, a human being can be trained to respond to the gentle pressure of torsion waves in the human aura by touch. With greater training such as is described in the works of Rudolph Steiner or Carlos Castenada, the human energy field can eventually be visually seen.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In later works we will discuss the voluminous evidence to prove that the human energy field does indeed exist, as the torsion-wave component to our physical bodies.

                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Some of Kozyrevs experiments seemed almost deceptively simple, considering the effects that he was able to achieve. For example, the simple raising and lowering of a 10-kg weight would exert torsional pressure on a pendulum at a distance of 2-3 meters, an effect which would even travel through walls.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The pendulum that was used as a detector was shielded in glass under a vacuum, so this effect could not have been caused by the air. Again, the key component to the experiment was that the top of the string needed to be vibrated in order to introduce the extra tension and movement that would allow the pressure of the torsion waves to be picked up by the pendulum.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This is another experiment that shows how the sheer mass of the 10-kilogram weight behaves like a sponge in water, creating ripples in the surrounding water when it is moved up and down. Again, this is a basic property of matter.

                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In another similar experiment, Kozyrev had a typical beam balance that is used for weight measurements, where the right side had a fixed weight and the left side had a hook for suspending various objects.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In this case, the objects Kozyrev hung from the left side were also just simple weights, only they were attached to rubber strips that allowed them to be easily mounted on the balance. Normally, with the weights on either side in a stable position, the beam would stay balanced at a certain weight that could be measured on its scale.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev would then stabilize the arm of the beam balance either with his hand or a clamp so it wouldnt move, and remove the object on the left from its hook. Then, he would shake the object up and down on the piece of rubber for about one minute. Thats all!
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      After doing this, when he would place the object back on the balance arm with perfect stillness, he would again measure its weight, which would be slightly higher than before. Then, the scales would show the measured weight of the object gradually decreasing, as it released the extra energy that it had taken in.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      He noted that it was important that his hand didnt heat the balance arm while holding it, so he would typically use a metal clamp to hold the bar instead.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Interestingly, on certain days this test would work quite easily, whereas on other days it would work only with great difficulty or not at all. The same is true for the above experiment where a 10-kg weight was raised and lowered repeatedly. This is known as a time-variable phenomenon and will be discussed below.

                     <p class="body">
                      Many readers have expected that Kozyrevs effects are simply due to errors in his recording. Here, it is important to remember that no concrete disproof of N.A. Kozyrev and V.V. Nasonovs experimental results exists (Levich, 1996).
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In addition, independent groups of researchers have now reproduced and confirmed some of Kozyrevs experiments. These include A.I. Veinik from the 1960s-1980s, Lavrentyev, Yeganova et al. in 1990, Lavrentyev, Gusev et al. in 1990, and Lavrentyev et al. in 1991 and 1992. American researcher Don Savage has also replicated much of Kozyrevs work and published it in Speculations in Science and Tech.

                     <p class="body">
                      Furthermore, without any knowledge of Kozyrevs work, in 1989 G. Hayasaka and S. Tekeyuchi discovered similar weight-loss effects with rotating 150-gram gyroscopes, and more recently obtained success by dropping the gyroscopes between two precision laser beam detectors.

                      (Remember that a gyroscope that is being weighed in a rotating and non-rotating state will not show any measurable weight changes unless an additional process is introduced such as vibration, movement, (in this case dropping,) heat conduction or electric current transition.)
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The results of Hayasaka et al.s study, conducted on behalf of the Mitsubishi corporation, actually did make it into the mainstream media, surprisingly enough. Furthermore, they did indeed attribute their results to the effects of torsion fields.

                      Many other researchers such as Dr. S.M.

                       1.11 ANTI-GRAVITY EFFECTS CAUSED BY THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Many of Kozyrevs experiments showed that the direction of the detectors movement was very important in creating measurable weight changes. He determined that a gyroscope that was vibrating, heating or conducting electricity would substantially decrease its weight when it was rotated in a counter-clockwise motion, whereas it would remain unchanged if it were rotated in a clockwise motion.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev concluded that this was caused by the Coriolis effect, where an object will indeed show a rotational movement as it is dropped towards the surface of the Earth. Ultimately, this is due to the subtle spiraling pressure of torsion that is imparted to the flow of aether (gravity) as it rushes into the earth, upholding the existence of all its atoms and molecules.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In 1680 Newton and Hook confirmed that the Coriolis effect was real by dropping objects down long mine shafts, and the experiment was repeated many times thereafter.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The Coriolis effect causes counter-clockwise movement in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise movement in the Southern Hemisphere, and is considered the major force behind the movement of weather systems. It also has to be factored in when firing long-range cannons at a specific target, which was a very confusing military problem before the Coriolis effect was discovered. It is another little-known fact of science that most people are unaware of.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      We remember that Kozyrev would first vibrate, heat or electrify his gyroscope in order to see his anomalous effects. Under these conditions, he would then move the gyroscope in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise motion. If the vibrating gyroscope is moved in a counter-clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere, then it is moving in unison with the counter-clockwise current of the Coriolis effect.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This causes the object to absorb some of the energy that would normally be pushing it down, and a small but definite decrease in its weight is then measured.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The work of G. Hayasaka and S. Tekeyuchi, which we mentioned above, independently confirmed the same anomalous result. When their gyroscope was rotated counter-clockwise it would fall slower than expected, whereas if it were rotating clockwise they could detect no changes, thus verifying Kozyrevs findings. Naturally, Japan is also in the Northern Hemisphere.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev also found that additional torsion would be introduced in these experiments if his gyroscope was not kept 100% horizontal, which suggested to him that gravity, which moves straight down, is somehow joined with torsion waves, as later theorists confirmed. Without the existence of an aether and the phenomenon of dynamic torsion, none of these results would even be remotely possible.

Hoagland et al. on the Enterprise Mission website. Within a complete vacuum, DePalma took two steel balls and catapulted them into the air at equal angles, with an equal amount of force.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The only difference was that one ball was rotating 27,000 times per minute and the other was stationary. The rotating ball traveled higher into the air and then descended faster than its counterpart, which violated all known laws of physics.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The only explanation for this effect is that both balls are drawing energy into themselves from an unseen source, and the rotating ball is thus soaking up more of this energy than its counterpart  energy that would normally exist as gravity, moving down into the earth.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      With the addition of torsion-field research we can see that the spinning ball was able to harness naturally spiraling torsion waves in its environment, which gave it an additional supply of energy.

                       1.13 TIME-VARIABLE EFFECTS
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev found that a time-variable effect is produced within his experiments. He discovered that these experiments worked best in late autumn and the first half of winter, but were next to impossible to perform in the summer. Kozyrev believed that the heating of the atmosphere in the summer was creating a disturbance that would interrupt the flow of the torsion waves.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The extra heat would cause the air molecules to jiggle more vigorously, and this in turn would disrupt the subtle spiraling pressures as the torsion-waves traveled. As he himself explained it, the heating by solar rays creates an atmospheric loader, interfering with the [experimental] effects.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Earlier in his career he thought that this time-variable effect was caused by the naturally-occurring growth of vegetation in warmer months, since he had already noticed that the simple presence of growing plants could interfere with his experimental results, as they would draw energy into themselves that would normally flow to the detectors.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Clearly, the combination of the plants absorbing the energy for their sustenance in the summer and the increased chaos of vibrations in the warmer atmosphere could both be responsible for the difficulty in making such measurements during the warmer seasons.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This seasonal experimental effect could also prevent American scientists who might be living in an area like Southern California from ever being able to replicate his results, as they never experience the late autumn and winter conditions that were most favorable for the experiments to be done.

                     <p class="body">
                      Another overall implication of Kozyrevs work is that the geographical location of the experiment also makes a significant difference. His best results were obtained when he carried out measurements near the North Pole, the most adventurous being conducted on chunks of drifting ice with a maximum latitude of 84 15, the North Pole being at 90.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This is a very important point, as it shows us that the greatest amount of torsion-wave energy is flowing into the Earth at the polar regions, growing weaker as we move towards the equator.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Certainly, most readers will wonder why there would be any effects associated with the poles of the earth. The answer is found in a study of magnetism.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In 1991-92, A.I. Veinik determined that the typical permanent iron ferrite magnets do not only have a collective magnetic field, but a collective torsion field as well, with a right-handed spin at the north pole and a left-handed spin at the south.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Dr. G. I. Shipov demonstrated that all electromagnetic fields generate torsion waves. So, since we all know that the Earths magnetic field is most concentrated at the poles, then we can see that the greatest strength of torsion-waves would be in the polar regions as well.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In his books and website, Richard Pasichnyk has demonstrated that earthquake impulses travel faster from north to south than from east to west. Thus, the added pressure of the torsion waves, instreaming and outflowing in the polar regions, affects far more than just the typical north-south polarity of the magnetic field that can be measured with a compass.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev also determined that the torsional energy flows differently in the southern hemisphere of the earth as opposed to the northern, and this again is due to the Coriolis effect. He also discovered that the speed of gravitational acceleration changes slightly between the northern and southern hemisphere by a subtle factor of 3.10^-5.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This appears to be caused by the little-known fact that the spherical shape of the Earth is actually flatter in the northern hemisphere as opposed to the southern!
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This has also been observed and measured in other planets such as Jupiter and Saturn. Kozyrev believed that since the surface of the southern hemisphere was slightly farther away from the Earths center of gravity than the northern hemisphere, this was responsible for the subtle change in the speed of gravitys acceleration.

                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The word latent means left over, and Kozyrev observed certain effects that continued for a time after he had stopped creating any torsion waves and / or disturbance to the measured objects. We remember that Kozyrev demonstrated how the simple shaking of a weight on a rubber strip would cause its weight to increase, and that it would slowly drop back down to its normal rest mass once it was placed back on the balance beam.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The time that the object takes to return to its normal weight is how we measure the latent force that it is capable of holding.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Certain objects will gain and lose weight faster than others in Kozyrevs experiments. Kozyrev concluded that the rate at which an object gains or loses weight is actually based on its density, or thickness, not on its overall weight. He showed that the loss of weight occurs at an exponential rate, and the denser the material is, the quicker the residual forces will disappear. Here are some examples:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                      <li class="list">
                       Lead, at a density of 11, will lose its latent forces in 14 seconds,
                      </li>
                      <li class="list">
                       Aluminum, at a density of 2.7, loses its latent forces in 28 seconds, and
                      </li>
                      <li class="list">
                       Wood, at a density of 0.5, loses its latent forces in 70 seconds.
                      </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p class="body">
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      If this seems hard to understand, we could think of the fact that a denser, thicker sponge such as the foam used in a mattress or seat cushion has much more of a spring to it than a lighter, thinner one, such as a tired old kitchen sponge.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The more of a spring the material has, the quicker it can absorb and release energy. Kozyrev also tested these effects on copper, brass, quartz, glass, air, water, coal, graphite, table salt and others, and indicated that the largest effects, with maximum preservation times, were observed on porous materials like brick or volcano tuff (Nasonov 1985a, p.15).
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This should interest us, since the sponge in our analogy is also a porous material, meaning that it is filled with many pores or holes inside of itself.

                     <p class="body">
                      Another example of latent forces existing in a system is found in the Aspden effect, discovered by Dr. Harold Aspden of Cambridge University. This experiment involved a gyroscope whose central wheel was fashioned from a powerful magnet.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      The normal amount of energy that would be required to rotate the gyroscope to a certain maximum speed was 1000 joules. Like a glass of water being stirred up with a spoon, the rotation of the gyroscope would cause the aetheric energy inside its central wheel to begin spiraling, and this churning movement would continue inside the object even once Dr. Aspden brought the gyroscope to a stop.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Surprisingly, for up to 60 seconds after Aspdens gyroscope stopped rotating, it would take ten times less energy to return it to the same velocity as it had attained the first time  only 100 joules.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This is another reproducible effect that has simply been ignored by the mainstream, because it violates the laws of physics. However, with Kozyrevs work as a background, we can hear the chuckles of Russian scientists as they read of Dr. Aspdens troubles in getting anyone in the West to acknowledge this effect.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Now if youve been paying attention, you might notice that Kozyrev showed that lead (Pb) maintained its latent forces for 14 seconds and aluminum for 28, and yet Dr. Aspdens gyroscopes would retain their forces for a full 60 seconds.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This is due to the fact that extra aetheric / torsional energy is harnessed by the powerful permanent magnet making up the center of the gyroscope  and in The Science of Oneness we demonstrated how this basic property of rotating magnets has been used to create many different free energy devices.

                      Although we have discussed gyroscopes, pendulums and torsion beam balances so far, Kozyrev also discovered non-mechanical detectors that could pick up the energy of the time flow.

                     <p class="body">
                      What we mean by non-mechanical is that torsion waves could be detected without the moving parts normally required, which involved two different forms of mechanical vibration or motion, such as in the gyroscope, torsion balance and pendulum.

                      Some of these non-mechanical detectors can demonstrate quite substantial changes in the presence of torsion fields, and in the case of tungsten and quartz, the effects of torsion fields on the material can be irreversible. All of the following will show changes in the presence of torsion-wave energy:

                      Some of these non-mechanical torsion-wave detectors were reproduced by the team of A.V. Chernetsky, Y.A. Galkin and S.N. Kolokoltzev, who also created a device that generated and stored this aetheric energy much like a capacitor, which is an electronic component that stores an electric charge. They referred to their invention as a self-generating discharge device.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Like Kozyrev, Chernetsky et al. found that the level of resistance in an electronic circuit would change if a part of it was placed between the two capacitor plates of the device while it was in operation. Also, the vibrational frequency of a quartz oscillator could become 1000 or more times faster than it was before it was placed in between the plates.

                      This should raise an eyebrow, as the reliability of quartz crystals to maintain a steady pulsating rhythm while having electricity pass through them is used to keep accurate time in the vast majority of digital watches and clocks in existence.

                     <p class="body">
                      Chernetsky et al. also discovered that their self-generating discharge device could create a static or non-moving torsion field within the very structure of space-time itself. A flowing current can be created in the fluidlike aether even if no matter existed in the area.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Chernetsky et al. could still measure the same torsion-field effects in the area that had been between the two plates of the machine, after the machine was turned off and far removed from the area! The latent effects would still be measurable with tungsten metal or quartz oscillators.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Another similar effect was discovered by Donald Roth, which he called Magnetic Memory, and documented by the Institute for New Energy. Roth discovered that he could bring a magnet close enough to a beam balance that it would attract the balance to itself, and after about five days the magnet could be moved much farther away from the balance and still attract it the same way.

                     <p class="body">
                      The Russians refer to this concept as vacuum structuring, and it again shows us that there is something there in supposedly empty space  something that the inheritors of the Atlantean Mysteries knew as the aether.

                      In 1984, Dankachov showed that the memory or structuring effect could occur with water as well, and this is one experiment that does find its way into Western alternative scientific thinking from time to time. The memory of water experiments begin by utilizing one of the basic torsion-wave creating processes to cause the measured viscosity or thickness of water to decrease.

                      Then, the treated water is placed next to another container of water, and the new waters viscosity will then decrease just like the original treated water. Other experiments, such as those of Jacques Beneviste, show that this memory of water effect is able to carry over into chemical effects as well, where torsion-wave generators are used to excite water with a certain chemical compound in it.

                      As we already suggested in the prologue, the Sun is our obvious choice for being the primary source of torsion waves in our heliosphere, due to it having 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.

                      In 1970, Saxel and Allen showed that during a solar eclipse, the presence of the moon shields the Suns radiant torsion fields, and this causes an increase in the period of oscillation for a torsion balance.

                     <p class="body">
                      As we already mentioned, the Einstein-Cartan theory first established a theoretical basis for the existence of torsion fields in 1913. The theory predicts that there will either be right-handed or left-handed torsion in space, depending on the location.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Subsequent discoveries in quantum physics related to the notion of spin confirmed that electrons will either have right-handed or left-handed spin, meaning that movement is detected that will either be clockwise or counterclockwise. All atoms and molecules maintain varying degrees of balance between right and left-handed spin.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Kozyrev determined that strongly right-handed molecules such as sugar can shield torsion effects, whereas strongly left-handed molecules such as turpentine will strengthen them. Subsequent Russian investigations also determined that common polyethylene film acted as an excellent shield for torsion waves, and were used in many different experiments such as those discussed by Dr. Alexander Frolov.

                       1.21 QUANTIZED CHANGES IN WEIGHT
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      We discussed Kozyrevs experiments where an object would be disturbed in various ways, and its changes in weight would then slowly return to balance over time. There is one important factor that emerged in these experiments that does not easily fit in with our convenient analogy of the sponge in water, and that is known as effect quantization.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      (We shall explain what causes it later.)
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      When something is quantized, that means that it does not move or count smoothly, but only stepwise, in certain specific intervals. Simply put, the weight of an object would not increase or decrease steadily in the latent force experiments, but rather in sudden bursts. This is certainly a highly anomalous property for matter to have. As Kozyrev said,
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">
                       In the vibration experiments on a balance the weight reduction occurs stepwise, beginning with a certain vibration power. As vibration frequency is further increased, the weight reduction at first remains the same and then again grows stepwise by the same value So far a realistic explanation of this phenomenon has not been found
                      </p>
                      <p class="body">
                       Afterwards it turned out that effect quantization takes place in almost all the experiments. (Kozyrev 1971, p. 126)
                      </p>
                     </blockquote>
                     <p class="body">
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      As a case in point, Kozyrev studied these effects on a 620-gram weight, which he would subject to vibrations, measured in hertz or cycles per second. We remember that cooling an object contracts it, whereas heating an object expands it.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Both heating and cooling are functions of vibration, so depending on how we vibrate an object, we can either cause its weight to increase or decrease. In this experiment, the mass of the 620-gram weight would be slightly increased by subjecting it to high-speed vibrations.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In order to give the experiments nice, clean numbers, Kozyrev and Nasonov later applied a straightforward mathematical function to renormalize the results from the 620-gram weight to the higher and simpler value of 1 kilogram. The numbers given in the next paragraph are renormalized to the 1-kilogram level.
                     </p>

                     <p class="body">
                      So as we can see from this chart, as the vibrations of the object rose to the threshold area of 16-23 hertz, (or cycles per second,) the object would show a stable weight increase of 31 milligrams. At this level, Kozyrev could increase the vibrations between 16 and 23 cycles per second and detect no further weight gain.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Then suddenly, as he increased the vibrations on the weight to 24 hertz, its overall weight increase would spontaneously double to 62 milligrams. As he increased the vibrations from 24 to 27 hertz, no change in weight was registered.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Yet, when the vibrations increased to 28 hertz, the net weight increase would again suddenly jump up by another 31 hertz to 93 milligrams. Each time that a new threshold would be reached, the initial gain of 31 milligrams would be added to the overall amount. As Kozyrev discovered,
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p class="body">
                       We succeeded in obtaining fivefold and even tenfold effects. (!)

                     <p class="body">
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      Let us not forget that this effect quantization occurred in almost all of Kozyrevs experiments, whether the overall weight of the object in question was either increasing or decreasing.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      In order for something like this to be taking place, the basic 31-milligram interval that was measured with the 1-kilogram object must be a function of its combined volume, density, weight and topology (shape), similar to the tone that you hear when striking a bell of a given size, shape and density. As Kozyrev rose the frequency of vibrations in the object, new intervals of weight increase were produced, but always in units of 31 milligrams.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      This effect quantization is actually a very important key to understanding the multidimensional nature of matter, illustrating that atoms and molecules maintain an onion-like structure of nested spherical waves. Our discussions in the next chapter will begin to show the context of this experiment and how it relates to new discoveries in quantum physics.

                      Kozyrevs views are not quickly or easily assimilated by the mainstream scientific community, especially in the West, because the magnitudes of the effects he measured are quite small.
                     </p>
                     <p class="body">
                      For example, the additional forces that were introduced in his mechanical experiments changed the weight of the objects being studied by a mere factor of 10^-4 to 10^-5, such as the gyroscope that would only become 100 milligrams lighter when rotating and vibrating at the same time.

                     <p class="body">
                      In order to appreciate how small of a change this is, remember that a certain active ingredient that was added to a vitamin pill might have 100 milligrams of weight on the label.

                       The experimental results show that the organizing property of time exerts a very small influence on systems [of matter such as stars,] compared with the usual, destructive course of their development. Therefore it is not surprising that this entity has been missed in our system of scientific knowledge. However, being small, it is distributed everywhere in nature, and only the possibility of its being stored is needed (Kozyrev 1982, p.71).

                         I came across "The Synchronicity Key" yesterday at a local bookstore and found myself instantly drawn to it. Although I've seen numerous books on the topic of synchronicity, my intuition told me that I had to have this one; no ifs, ands, or buts about it - get that book, now!Never have I been more pleased about following my intuition. So far I feel like I'm on a dizzying journey of trying to play catchup while all-the-while asking myself, how on earth did I ever miss this?I've been a psychic and a healer nearly all of my life with an ever so keen intellectual curiosity about how and why I understood the universe more as a hologram than a strict set of absolute constructs. This book has become a true linchpin for everything I've ever thought about on the subject and more.Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a wonderful masterpiece!

                             I am building one of Kozyrev's mirror tubes. I can buy the aluminum sheets with high purity and try to put a shine on them however the mirror roll is much less expensive. At 5mil thickness and 10ft x 4'7" the cost is 55 whereas the rolls of aluminum would be 200 (prices are before shipping costs) and need to be riveted.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             I can get the faraday canopy from an emf blocker site that makes various products one is for a bedroom to sleep inside which I plan to use to block the frequencies to increase the effectiveness.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Has anyone made one and tried the mirrors vs the aluminum? And what blocker did you use, from where? Saw David's show and hit the back...repeat when the part on this came up. It is my current project so anyone out there in the know I am curious on the best direction to go.

                             ey experiment was set up orthagonally to the drag of the ether, and so didn't detect it. I can't imagine those two physicists making such a fundamental error, but it did happen. Wolfgang Pauli, in the biography "No Time to Be Brief," said that "Einstein admitted to me that he must include k (gravitational constant) even in cases where there is zero mass." This is a fancy way of saying that there is an energy medium under stress regardless if any mass particles are present. In other words, even those scientists in the 1920's were aware that the aether was real. But is it conscious? Not sure, but it seems to be affected by something 'alive.'
