     truth
    </a>
    . He couldnt do it. If he couldnt define truth, how would he recognize it when he was exposed to it? Can you recognize truth? In Noah Websters original
    <em>
     1828 American Dictionary of the English Language,
    </em>
    truth is defined. In the latest sentence of Websters primary definition of truth, it reads: "Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth." John 17:17. [End of quote] Seek truth. Seek the face of God. Hes found in your majority-text King James Bible. Click onto "

    <br/>
    GOD SAID,
    <strong>
     Genesis 2:7
    </strong>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    GOD SAID,
    <strong>
     Genesis 7:22
    </strong>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    GOD SAID,
    <strong>
     Job 27:3
    </strong>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>

    MAN SAID: The Bible is not supernaturally written by holy men under the direction of the Holy Ghost. According to the skeptics, the Bible is a bunch of archaic hand-me-down information written by mere men and has no relative value for modern enlightened man.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now THE RECORD. This concept has been declared on GodSaidManSaid before and it surely bears repeating. For over 6,000 years, Satan, the spirit of rebellion, has harnessed the power of the worlds greatest carnal minds endeavoring to discredit the Word of God, but every time, the detractors have been found
    <a href="http://godsaidmansaid.com/topic3.asp?Cat2=244&amp;ItemID=633">
     liars
    </a>
    and have failed miserably. The Word of God is true and righteous altogether.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why the nostrils? Why does the Bible say, "and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul? Was this statement that was written thousands of years ago written by mere men? What natural man could know the enormous depths of this statement and know them many centuries before medical science would begin to know the reasons why? The answer is that it was not written by a man; only the Designer-Creator Himself could know such truth.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The mysteries of the statement found in
    <strong>
     Genesis 2:7
    </strong>
    , are expansive, and in this feature we will deal with only the physical ramifications of it. The nostrils play a very central and important role in lifephysically and spirituallyand the Word of God focuses on their importance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Except in emergencies, when heavily congested, when exercising rigorously or yawning, we were designed to breathe through our nostrils. The nostrils prepare the air for the lungs by removing foreign particles of dust and other contaminants from it, and by warming and humidifying it. Breathing through the nostrils is also very important for the proper mix of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood and overall general health. The Scriptures record that life is in the blood and the nostrils play a critical part.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    According to an article titled "Optimal Breathing," on the internet at
    <a href="http://www.breathing.com/">
     www.breathing.com
    </a>
    , nose breathing 24 hours per day is important if you desire a long and healthy life. The following excerpts are from that article:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      The lungs are a primary control of our energy level. They extract oxygen from the air we breathe primarily on the exhale. Because the nostrils are smaller than the mouth, air exhaled through the nose creates back pressure when one exhales. It slows the air escape so the lungs have more time to extract oxygen from them. When there is proper oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, the blood will maintain a balanced pH. If carbon dioxide is lost too quickly, as in mouth breathing, oxygen absorption is decreased.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And again, the article states:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      Lessening of the common cold is another good reason for nose breathing. The mucous (white blood cells that kill germs) membrane lining the nose extends all the way from the inner linings of the nostrils down the trachea to the bronchi that directly enters the lungs. Germs get caught and die in the mucous.
     </em>
     [End of quote]
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Nose breathing is also known to reduce hypertension and
    <a href="http://godsaidmansaid.com/topic3.asp?Cat2=244&amp;ItemID=591">
     stress
    </a>
    for most people and also reduces loud snoring, sleep apnea, and heart conditions. The Creator certainly knew His business when He chose the nostrils as the conduits for the "breath of life." You basically breathe through one nostril at a time. The time one nostril dominates is between one and three hours. This nasal rhythm is known to increase the EEG (electroencephalogram) amplitude in the brains opposite hemisphere. Medical science is just beginning to get a grip on this principle. The following excerpt is from an article found on the internet titled, "Cerebral Breathing:"
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      The consistent and selective effect of forced uninostril breathing in normal subjects on the general pattern of EEG activity in the hemispheres suggests the possibility of therapeutic approaches to states where hemispheric dysfunction have been known to occur. Schizophrenia is associated with greater left cerebral hemisphere dysfunction and depression and other affective disorders are associated with greater right hemisphere dysfunction. Cases of acute personality shift were also accompanied by an immediate shift in nasal dominance.
     </em>
     [End of quote]
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The physical reasons God chose the nostrils as the conduit of life are becoming more and more apparent as medical science continues to discover their mysteries.
