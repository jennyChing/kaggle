    Assorted Abrogations
   </h1>
   Tired of the same old dystopias? Randomized Dystopia suggests a right that your fictional tyranny could deny its citizens!
   <h2>
    Imagine a world without this right:
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
    <i>
     (Article 29, Sections 2 and 3)
    </i>
