         Obamas betrayal started before the start of this administration. Since then, Jarrett has carried on secret negotiations with Tehran, ending in the suicidal surrender plan we see today. Obama and Jarrett started six years ago

         Today Obama is boasting about this fabulous chance of a lifetime  to surrender the world to the mullahs.

         <span style="font-family:times new roman,times,serif">
          [Haaretz editor in chief] David Landau told US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a recent private dinner that Israel "wants to be raped by the US"  Landau, who was seated next to Rice, reportedly referred to Israel as a "failed state" politically that needed a US-imposed settlement.  Landau reportedly "implored Rice to intervene, asserting that the Israeli government wanted 'to be raped' and that it would be like a 'wet dream' for him to see this happen." In response, Landau told the New York weekly that this description was "inaccurate" and "a perversion of what I said," and that he had expressed his views with "much more sophistication." But, he went on, "I did say that in general, Israel wants to be raped - I did use that word - by the US, and I myself have long felt Israel needed more vigorous US intervention in the affairs of the Middle East."

         Please understand that what leftists say in public is only a pale reflection of what they rant about in private. And please understand that you dont become the editor in chief of the biggest socialist propaganda rag in Israel without telling your real thoughts to thousands of other lefties. David Landau wasnt just a lone fruitcake. He represented the old socialist establishment in Israel, which controlled Israels media for years. Today they hate Netanyahu because he is a democratic, free-market conservative. They hate conservatives because we dissent from the Party Line.

          [Haaretz editor in chief] David Landau told US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a recent private dinner that Israel "wants to be raped by the US"  Landau, who was seated next to Rice, reportedly referred to Israel as a "failed state" politically that needed a US-imposed settlement.  Landau reportedly "implored Rice to intervene, asserting that the Israeli government wanted 'to be raped' and that it would be like a 'wet dream' for him to see this happen." In response, Landau told the New York weekly that this description was "inaccurate" and "a perversion of what I said," and that he had expressed his views with "much more sophistication." But, he went on, "I did say that in general, Israel wants to be raped - I did use that word - by the US, and I myself have long felt Israel needed more vigorous US intervention in the affairs of the Middle East."

         Genocide is in the known character of the left and of Islamofascists. The left has always had a yen for genocide  look at North Korea, at Karl Marx himself, at Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot: 100 million human beings murdered in the 20

         As for Islamic fascists, the history of Muslim genocides goes back to Mohammed in the desert. Mohammed was a desert raider who did all the things desert raiders did: kill and rape the weak, and maybe trade with the strong if you had to. Preying on the weak is one of the oldest professions, and its not limited to Arabs.

         Still, the Koran is the only surviving warmongering scripture in this age of nuclear weapons. Warmongering beliefs are not unique in history  but just try to mix holy warmongering with nuclear weapons, and youve got a clear and present danger today. With the nuke-loving mullahs, Obamas left is now making sure the killing wont be confined to some faraway country in the Middle East.
