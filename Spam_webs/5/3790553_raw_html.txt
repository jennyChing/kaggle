       In January 1967, the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein hired playwright Joe Orton to write their third film. Orton produced a script called
       <i>
        Up Against It
       </i>
       , which was never produced. According to Paul McCartney:

       <i>
        Up Against It
       </i>
       wasn't because it was too far out or anything. We didn't do it because it was gay. We weren't gay and really that was all there was to it. It was quite simple, really. Brian was gay ... and so he and the gay crowd could appreciate it. Now, it wasn't that we were anti-gay -- just that we, The Beatles, weren't gay."
      </blockquote>

       "Wherever we went there's always a few seats laid aside for cripples and people in wheelchairs... they're pushing them at you like you're Christ or something. You'd open up every night, and instead of seeing kids there you'd just see a row full of cripples on the front... It seemed like (we were) just surrounded by cripples and blind people all the time. And when we'd go through corridors, everybody would be -- they'd be all touching us. It got
