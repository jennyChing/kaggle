        A woman has the right to decide what happens with her body. A fetus is not a human life, so it does not have separate individual rights. The government should provide taxpayer funded abortions for women who cannot afford them. The decision to have an abortion is a personal choice ofa woman regarding her own body and the government must protect this right. Women have the right to affordable, safe and legal abortions, including partial birth abortion.

        Human life begins at conception. Abortion is the murder of a human being. An unborn baby, as a living human being, has separate rights from those of the mother. Oppose taxpayer-funded abortion. Taxpayer dollars should not be used for the government to provide abortions.Support legislation to prohibit partial birth abortions, called the Partial Birth Abortion* Ban

        </strong>
        Due to prevalent racism in the past, minorities were deprived of the same education and employment opportunities as whites. The government must work to make up for that. America is still a racist society, therefore a federal affirmative action law is necessary. Due to unequal opportunity, minorities still lag behind whites in all statistical measurements of success.

       <div class=" col-md-6">
        <strong>
         Conservative
         <br/>
        </strong>
        Individuals should be admitted to schools and hired for jobs based on their ability. It is unfair to use race as a factor in the selection process. Reverse-discrimination is not a solution for racism. Some individuals in society are racist, but American society as a whole is not. Preferential treatment of certain races through affirmative action is wrong.

         Liberal
         <br/>
        </strong>
        The death penalty should be abolished. It is inhumane and is cruel and unusual punishment. Imprisonment is the appropriate punishment for murder. Every execution risks killing an innocent person.

       <div class=" col-md-6">
        <strong>
         Conservative
         <br/>

        The death penalty is a punishment that fits the crime of murder; it is neither cruel nor unusual. Executing a murderer is the appropriate punishment for taking an innocent life.

        </strong>
        A market system in which government regulates the economy is best. Government must protect citizens from the greed of big business. Unlike the private sector, the government is motivated by public interest. Government regulation in all areas of the economy is needed to level the playing field.

        </strong>
        The free market system, competitive capitalism, and private enterprise create the greatest opportunity and the highest standard of living for all. Free markets produce more economic growth, more jobs and higher standards of living than those systems burdened by excessive government regulation.

        School vouchers create competition and therefore encourage schools to improve performance. Vouchers will give all parents the right to choose good schools for their children, not just those who can afford private schools.

        Support the use of
        <em>
         embryonic stem cells
        </em>
        for research. It is necessary (and ethical) for the government to fund
        <em>
         embryonic
        </em>
        stem cell research, which will assist scientists in finding treatments and cures for diseases. An embryo is not a human. The tiny blastocyst (embryos used in embryonic stem cell research) has no human features. Experimenting on embryos/embryonic stem cells is not murder.
        <em>
         Embryonic stem cells
        </em>
        have the potential to cure chronic and degenerative diseases which current medicine has been unable to effectively treat.

If euthanasia were legalized, insurance companies could pressure doctors to withhold life-saving treatment for dying patients. Many religions prohibit suicide and euthanasia.
