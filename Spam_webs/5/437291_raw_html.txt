    A model of decentralized growth inspired by developmental biology and the physiology of nervous systems. Each individual artificial neuron is an autonomous unit whose behavior is determined only by the genetic information it harbors and local concentrations of substrates. The power of the artificial chemistry used is demonstrated by analyzing engineered (handwritten) genomes that lead to behaviors known from physiology.

    Discrete dynamical network state-space is connected into basins of attraction, ideas of modularity suggesting that the overall network is actually made up of semi-independent sub-network graphs. Each sub-network settles into one of a range attractors according to its current state, which if perturbed can cause the dynamics to jump to alternative attractors. This paper describes how such basins of attraction might provide a conceptual framework for biomolecular networks.

    A new conceptual framework is proposed to situate and integrate the parallel theories of Turchin, Powers, Campbell and Simon. A system is defined as a constraint on variety. This entails a 2x2x2  classification scheme for higher-order systems, using the dimensions of constraint, (static) variety, and (dynamic) variation. The scheme distinguishes two classes of metasystems from supersystems and other types of emergent phenomena.

    Hierarchical modularity is a familiar characteristic of a large class of natural dynamical systems.
Although modules may be sparsely connected, dynamical properties of modules may be
strongly interdependent, and if functional properties depend on dynamical properties then interactions between modules may be critically important and simple evolutionary processes
can be inadequate. This paper revews work on compositional evolution and describes its
relation to the dynamical properties of hierarchical systems.

    Prosocial emotions function in providing guides for action that bypass the explicit cognitive optimizing process that lies at the core of the standard behavioral model in economics. Empirical evidence is given suggesting that such emotions play a role in the public goods game. An analytical model and an agent-based simulation shows that reciprocity, shame, and guilt increase the level of cooperation in the group. An explanation of the long term evolutionary success of prosocial emotions, in terms of both the individual and group-level benefits they confer, is offered.

    This paper provides evidence challenging the self-interest assumption that
dominates the behavioral sciences and much evolutionary thinking. It shows that
many people have a tendency to voluntarily cooperate, if treated fairly, and to punish noncooperators. This 'strong reciprocity' cannot be rationalized as an adaptive trait by the leading evolutionary theories of human cooperation, e.g. kin theory, but is a powerful device for
the enforcement of social norms.

    A classic 1963 paper exploring the often neglected role of positive feedback in biological and human
systems in generating inhomogeneity, i.e. structure, from homogeneity (by what is now called the bufferfly effect). The balancing effect of combining both positive and negative feedback paths and
the role this plays in evolution is also discussed.

     The Systems Perspective: Methods and Models for the Future

    An introduction to the general systems perspective and a number of tools and models. Whilst
seeming ignorant of more modern complex systems ideas (e.g. Alife, GAs, NNs, Attractors)
this 1994 paper gives comparative information on employing the techniques of 'Interactive Planning', 'Living Systems Theory', 'Operational Research', 'Socio-Technical Systems', 'Soft Systems Methodology', 'System Dynamics', 'Total Quality Management' and 'The Viable Systems
Model'.

     Three Ways to Grow Designs:
A Comparison of Embryogenies for an Evolutionary Design Problem

    Exploration of the use of growth processes, or embryogenies, to map genotypes to phenotypes within evolutionary systems. External, explicit and implicit embryogenies are identified and explained and experimental comparisons with a standard GA performed. The results are surprising, with the implicit embryogeny outperforming all other techniques by showing no significant increase in the size of the genotypes or decrease in accuracy of evolution as the scale of the problem is increased.

    Interesting look at hardware evolution using redundant junk DNA, which uses neutral network search
and gene switching within a Species Adaptive Genetic Algorithm framework to improve evolutionary potential. This methodology exposes some erroneous ways of thinking about local optima and
suggests that the technique used can convert rugged landscapes into effectively smooth ones.

     Toward a Definition of Dynamical Hierarchies

    Hierarchical organization is omnipresent in natural systems. This paper attempts a definition of higher level emergence and considers the problems of applying this to current agent based models whose properties fail to show the same higher level interaction features as are evident in real world structures.

     Towards Anticipatory Agents

    This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of designing autonomous agents that is based 
on the idea of anticipatory systems. It is argued that systems based on causal reasoning only are too limited to serve as a proper base for designing autonomous agents. An anticipatory agent, on the other hand, will use reasoning from final cause to guide its current actions.

    The use of global forces to emulate physical laws and to allow self-assembly, fault tolerance and
self-repair to energe in conjunction with local interactions. This procedure is also shown to allow
distributed computation to occur and can create geometric self-organizing regularities.

    A brief overview at combining neural learning of clustering in data to support the development
