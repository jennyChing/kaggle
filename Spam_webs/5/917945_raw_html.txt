           The kitchen is an essential room in every home. It is where meals are made and eaten, and where the family connects after a busy day. All of this use unfortunately means that there will also be a lot of messes made in the kitchen. If its time that you gave your kitchen a thorough cleaning, here are a few tips that you can use to help get the busiest room of your home sparkling in no time:

            Step 1: De-clutter!

          </span>
         </p>
         <p class="p2">
          <span class="s2">
           The first step in cleaning any room is to get all of that clutter out! Anything that doesnt belong in your kitchen should be moved to its proper place, or (at the very least) put in a Lost and Found box. At this point, your kitchen should already be feeling a little more organized, but youre not nearly done yet. This cleaning may take a little while, but it will make sure that youre ready for company, or just make sure that your kitchen gets a good deep clean once in a while.

            Step 2: Dust and scrub all surfaces.

          </span>
         </p>
         <p class="p2">
          <span class="s2">
           Get out your rags and dust mops and make sure that all of your kitchen surfaces sparkle. Just remember to work from top to bottom  gravity will bring dust and grime down, so starting at the top will ensure that youre not doing double work for no good reason. We recommend dusting the area above your cabinets, then the top of the fridge, and move on to your countertops before cleaning barstools and other seats.

           occasionally. Take out all of the food (it helps if you check all of the expiration dates while you take things out) and place them on an empty counter. Once the fridge is bare, wipe down all surfaces inside before replacing everything. Anything that touches food directly (like your vegetable drawer) should get extra attention, and an extra hot bath to kill any potential germs.

         <p class="p2">

           </a>
           in your empty dishwasher, microwave a cup of water to steam off any stuck-on foods, and use a combination of baking soda and vinegar to clean stubborn stains off of your oven without harsh chemicals.

           Again, dirt and grime will travel under the influence of gravity. This means that any stray dirt that escaped your grasp during the cleaning process will end up on the floor. This is why the floor should always be the last thing that you clean. Vacuum up any debris, then disinfect with your floor cleaner of choice, whether its a traditional mop and bucket or a new sweeper with disposable pads.

Car insurance policies should be discussed and reviewed with your insurance agent. Although you may practice safe driving, you cannot account for everyone else on the road.\r\n\r\nAuto insurance policies usually provide these basic coverage options:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Medical Payments\/Personal Injury Protection&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Bodily Injury Liability&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Collision&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Property Damage Liability&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Uninsured\/Underinsured Motorist Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nIt is almost impossible to affordably own a vehicle without car insurance. No one is invincible and accidents and damages can be very costly. It is important to make sure you have adequate coverage that not only fits your lifestyle, but also your wallet. At the very least, most states require that you carry auto liability coverage, but it\u2019s important for your own benefit to have a policy that has much more.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc today and fill out our auto insurance quote form.","post_title":"Auto Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"auto","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 10:08:02","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 14:08:02","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":6,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=8","menu_order":1,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":25,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:21:29","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:21:29","post_content":"&lt;div class=\"video_container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"iframe_container\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/42724340?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"281\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\nDid you know that floods aren\u2019t covered in homeowners insurance policies in Massachusetts? If you want financial protection against floods and the destruction they cause, you need a flood insurance policy from Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc.\r\n\r\nWith the right flood insurance, Massachusetts home owners can protect property against damages caused by:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Heavy Rain&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Storm Surges&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Lengthy Rainfalls&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Snow Melts&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Blocked Drainage Systems&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;And More&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nSpeak to an Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc agent today to get help determining which type of insurance you need for your property. Low or moderate risk properties will typically need a preferred risk flood insurance policy, while properties at a higher risk for floods need standard flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t wait until it is too late! Floods are considered the number one hazard in the U.S., but protecting against the damage they cause is simple.

In most cases, this type of insurance is in the form of a package policy that covers the following:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;The structure of your home&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Your personal belongings&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Liability protection&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Additional living expenses should you be displaced from your home due to disaster&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nCoverage for these things varies depending on your policy. Typically, you can create a comprehensive policy with your insurance agent that provides adequate coverage in the areas you need it. Homeowners insurance ensures that you and your family will be safe from liability issues and property damage. Included in liability issues, typically, is injury or property damage that you or a member of your household causes to another person. Some policies will also include damage caused to other people by household pets. Your home is covered for damage caused by most disasters; however, floods, earthquakes, and normal wear and tear are excluded from homeowners plans. Supplemental policies can be purchased to cover floods and earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFor more information about homeowners insurance in Massachusetts, contact Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc today! We can offer you numerous options for creating a customized and comprehensive homeowners insurance policy. Filling out our free quote form can also help us better understand your insurance needs.","post_title":"Homeowners Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"homeowners","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 10:11:50","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 14:11:50","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":6,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=33","menu_order":2,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":45,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:30:58","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:30:58","post_content":"Accidents, injuries, and other mishaps are impossible to predict, but they can happen if you are not careful. But what if the current coverage you have is not enough to cover the costs of a disaster, such as a liability issue? This is where umbrella insurance comes into play. At Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc, we can provide you with policies to protect you from liability issues that go beyond the liability limits of standard insurance policies, such as your homeowners insurance, car insurance, and more.

Whether you own an ATV, golf cart, or even a dune buggy, not only should you make sure that you are adequately protected physically, but also when it comes to insurance. It may seem silly to insure an off road vehicle, but it is a lot more necessary than you may think. Even if your off road vehicle is simply a toy, insurance is important.\r\n\r\nAn off road vehicle insurance policy typically provides three basic coverage options:\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Liability Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Physical Damage Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Medical Payments Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\nWhen purchasing an off road vehicle policy, it is also important to keep in mind what kinds of activities you will be using the vehicle for. Do you compete or ride recreationally? These activities impact the type and cost of coverage. An off road vehicle can cost just as much, if not more, than a regular vehicle, so it\u2019s important to make sure you have adequate coverage. You can spend thousands building your off roader. What happens if you take it to the trail and something unexpected happens? What if you get into a crash and your beloved vehicle gets damaged? Don't you want the comfort of knowing that even if an accident does occur, you will be back on your ride in no time?\r\n\r\nLet an off road vehicle insurance policy from Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc give you confidence that every trip you take off the beaten path will be a good one. A specialized off-road insurance policy means that you are covered whether you're out enjoying the trail on your dirt bike, climbing dunes in your dune buggy, off-roading on your ATV, or taking a leisurely spin on your golf cart.\r\n\r\nContact us today for more information and fill out our free quote form for off road vehicle insurance in Massachusetts!","post_title":"Off Road Vehicle Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"off-road-vehicle","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 10:24:15","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 14:24:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":6,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=38","menu_order":6,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":43,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:30:11","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:30:11","post_content":"&lt;div class=\"video_container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"iframe_container\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/42717334?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"281\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\nRecreational vehicle insurance may function similarly to car insurance, but it is specialized for RVs.

For example, if you unexpectedly perish, leaving behind a spouse and young children, they will be monetarily supported through your life policy. This coverage will cover any financial obligations you have left behind.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay final expenses&lt;\/strong&gt; - Life insurance can cover funeral and burial costs, as well as final medical expenses and debts you may have as a result of your death.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an inheritance for your heirs&lt;\/strong&gt; - You can name your loved ones as beneficiaries on your life insurance policy to create an inheritance for them if you pass away.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make charitable contributions&lt;\/strong&gt; - You can name a charity the beneficiary of your life insurance policy. This contribution will be much larger than the cash equivalent donation.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a source of savings and earnings&lt;\/strong&gt; - Some types of life insurance can be paid as cash value if the policy owner outlives the coverage term.

This cash benefit can be withdrawn or borrowed at the owner\u2019s request.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nContact Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc to learn more about life insurance in Massachusetts.

It is a popular policy because it can secure large amounts of coverage for relatively low premiums.\r\n\r\nSome of the major reasons individuals take out term life insurance policies are as follow:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortgage Coverage&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 Through your term life insurance policy, you can arrange for your mortgage to be paid off.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Coverage&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 If you pass away, you want to be sure your family and loved ones will not suffer financially without your earnings.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childcare Coverage&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 Without you, who will take care of your children? If you are the primary childcare provider for your family, your passing could mean the addition of childcare expenses for your family.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education Coverage&lt;\/strong&gt; \u2013 If you, your spouse, or your children have educational fees, it is important that they can still be covered after your passing.&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nTo learn more about the available term life insurance plans in Massachusetts, contact the agents at Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc today.","post_title":"Term Life Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"term-life","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 10:53:00","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 14:53:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":6,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=44","menu_order":12,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:05:59","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:05:59","post_content":"&lt;div class=\"video_container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"iframe_container\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/46765946?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"281\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\nYou earn your money the old-fashioned way \u2013 you work for it.

A policy of this nature covers your business should a claim exceed the limits of your existing liability coverage. For example, if your general liability policy covers $1 million and a $1.5 million claim is brought against your company, an excess liability policy could take effect.\r\n\r\nEssentially, it picks up where your other business insurance policies leave off. If, for example, an employee gets in a horrendous accident while driving one of your company\u2019s vehicles, the costs associated could be huge. The costs could be much more than your commercial auto insurance policy covers. That\u2019s where excess liability insurance kicks in.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of such a policy include additional protection such as coverage for legal costs should a truly damaging lawsuit arise. Also, this type of insurance provides a lot of coverage typically at an affordable rate.\r\n\r\nTo find out how Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc can help protect your Massachusetts business with excess liability insurance contact us today by calling  617-298-0655 or filling out our free quote form.","post_title":"Excess Liability Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"excess-liability","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 15:32:00","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 19:32:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":9,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=24","menu_order":35,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":26,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:21:57","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:21:57","post_content":"&lt;div class=\"video_container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"iframe_container\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/42653392?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"281\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for business owners, the chances of getting sued have dramatically increased in the last decade.

Car insurance policies should be discussed and reviewed with your insurance agent. Although you may practice safe driving, you cannot account for everyone else on the road.\r\n\r\nAuto insurance policies usually provide these basic coverage options:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Medical Payments\/Personal Injury Protection&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Bodily Injury Liability&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Collision&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Property Damage Liability&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Uninsured\/Underinsured Motorist Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nIt is almost impossible to affordably own a vehicle without car insurance. No one is invincible and accidents and damages can be very costly. It is important to make sure you have adequate coverage that not only fits your lifestyle, but also your wallet. At the very least, most states require that you carry auto liability coverage, but it\u2019s important for your own benefit to have a policy that has much more.\r\n\r\nPlease contact Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc today and fill out our auto insurance quote form.","post_title":"Auto Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"auto","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 10:08:02","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 14:08:02","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":6,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=8","menu_order":1,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":33,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:25:02","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:25:02","post_content":"&lt;div class=\"video_container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"iframe_container\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/42724552?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"281\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\nHomeowners insurance is a policy that provides protection against disasters and other issues that can hurt you financially. In most cases, this type of insurance is in the form of a package policy that covers the following:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;The structure of your home&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Your personal belongings&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Liability protection&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Additional living expenses should you be displaced from your home due to disaster&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\r\nCoverage for these things varies depending on your policy. Typically, you can create a comprehensive policy with your insurance agent that provides adequate coverage in the areas you need it. Homeowners insurance ensures that you and your family will be safe from liability issues and property damage. Included in liability issues, typically, is injury or property damage that you or a member of your household causes to another person. Some policies will also include damage caused to other people by household pets. Your home is covered for damage caused by most disasters; however, floods, earthquakes, and normal wear and tear are excluded from homeowners plans. Supplemental policies can be purchased to cover floods and earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFor more information about homeowners insurance in Massachusetts, contact Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc today!

Whether you own an ATV, golf cart, or even a dune buggy, not only should you make sure that you are adequately protected physically, but also when it comes to insurance. It may seem silly to insure an off road vehicle, but it is a lot more necessary than you may think. Even if your off road vehicle is simply a toy, insurance is important.\r\n\r\nAn off road vehicle insurance policy typically provides three basic coverage options:\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Liability Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Physical Damage Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;li&gt;Medical Payments Coverage&lt;\/li&gt;\r\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\r\nWhen purchasing an off road vehicle policy, it is also important to keep in mind what kinds of activities you will be using the vehicle for. Do you compete or ride recreationally? These activities impact the type and cost of coverage. An off road vehicle can cost just as much, if not more, than a regular vehicle, so it\u2019s important to make sure you have adequate coverage. You can spend thousands building your off roader. What happens if you take it to the trail and something unexpected happens? What if you get into a crash and your beloved vehicle gets damaged? Don't you want the comfort of knowing that even if an accident does occur, you will be back on your ride in no time?\r\n\r\nLet an off road vehicle insurance policy from Vargas and Vargas Insurance Agency Inc give you confidence that every trip you take off the beaten path will be a good one. A specialized off-road insurance policy means that you are covered whether you're out enjoying the trail on your dirt bike, climbing dunes in your dune buggy, off-roading on your ATV, or taking a leisurely spin on your golf cart.\r\n\r\nContact us today for more information and fill out our free quote form for off road vehicle insurance in Massachusetts!","post_title":"Off Road Vehicle Insurance","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"off-road-vehicle","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2014-04-14 10:24:15","post_modified_gmt":"2014-04-14 14:24:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":6,"guid":"http:\/\/kickstart1.ast.wpengine.com\/?post_type=astcpt_product_off&#038;p=38","menu_order":6,"post_type":"astcpt_product_off","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":32,"post_author":"9","post_date":"2012-08-02 21:24:37","post_date_gmt":"2012-08-03 01:24:37","post_content":"&lt;div class=\"video_container\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"iframe_container\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/42724420?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"281\"&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\r\n\r\nSecuring a health insurance policy will help protect you from financial devastation if you become sick or injured.
