        Why Outta-Site?
       </h2>
       <p>
        It's really simple...we've run into a lot of awesome people during our time in business that we've really wanted to work with. They had great ideas and projects just waiting to be launched, but (alas) they had no sustainable budget for the work they needed. As much as we wanted to help them, we were unable to devote the necessary time and resources while taking care of our own overhead and other responsibilities.  We hate turning down good business with good people so we decided to try and come up with our own high-quality affordable solution that is...well...
        <strong>
         OUTTA-SITE!
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        For you, it's about receiving a great product for a great price.  With
        <strong>
         OUTTA-SITE
        </strong>
        we aim to be as transparent as possible with both our solution AND our process.  If you feel your budget is limiting your ability to be established online,
        <strong>
         OUTTA-SITE
        </strong>
        could be the solution you've been looking for.

        is an incredibly flexible and easy-to-use Content Management System (CMS) used by over 60 million people worldwide! Why is it so popular? Because you don't have to be a technical wiz to use it. The core software is maintained by hundreds of tech experts who constantly update it and add new features that make it both easier to use and consistently current with the constant changes in the Internet. Even better, these fine tech folks also develop new plugins and themes that make your web design options almost infinite.

        So It's A Template? I Thought Templates Suck?!
       </h2>
       <img align="left" src="http://www.minddevelopmentanddesign.com/wp-content/themes/newmind/images/templates-suck.jpg"/>
       <p>
        True dat. A lot of templates
        <strong>
         DO
        </strong>
        suck and many of them aren't built semantically correct,  i.e. they don't communicate properly with your browser, so they may look funky in a way that George Clinton would not approve.  Another problem with templates, especially the free ones, is there is nothing stating how updates work or even if an update will occur. Honestly, anyone with some knowledge of HTML, PHP and CSS could build their own WordPress template and add their own plug-ins. Heck, anyone with some knowledge of guitar chords could write a song. They could, you could, but if you had the knowledge and time you probably wouldn't have read this far.

       <p>
        Yesterday's hot trend is now today's absolute necessity. Responsive design is crucial now for your online presence. Responsive design is basically designing and building a website that "responds" to the device it's being seen through...almost like a different site was built for each device! Your
        <strong>
         OUTTA-SITE
        </strong>
        will display properly on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile devices. More than 40% of the Internet search market is mobile, so you could be missing out on a lot of business because your customers can't properly view your website on their mobile devices. Google also recognizes sites that are using responsive design and prefers them in search results. If your website is not optimized for mobile search, you are missing out significantly!

         <p class="answer">
          Well, let's see...the Wikipedia definition of social semantic refers to "a web of collective knowledge systems, which are able to provide useful information based on human contributions and which get better as more people participate."  In plain (not palin) English, there are some great information/data websites online like DBpedia, Wikipedia, Stumpedia and Semandeks that are proven reliable sources of information.  These sites keep getting better and more reliable with the input of knowledgeable folks and the critical checks-and-balances of the site moderators to ensure accuracy of information.

          Haha...we LOVE this. MIND dove headlong into responsive design because we saw the value and, yes, we thought it was waycool! A responsive website is a website that "responds" to the device it's being viewed on and sizes itself accordingly. This way your visitors don't have to scroll this way and that just to be able to see what site they're on and navigate. Your

          RDFa is an extention of HTML, which is the programming code of your website. Google made RDFa a part of their search engine algorithm starting in 2012. In base terms, RDFa is a code that makes it easy for the Google search engine to understand what your page is about by linking to trusted sources.

          WORDPRESS AND ASSOCIATED PLUGINS
         </strong>
         <br/>
         WordPress is an open-source project and therefore is 100% FREE. There are literally thousands of FREE WordPress Themes and plugins available at your disposal at various sites around the web. That being said, should you find issue with our use of WordPress, or it's plugins, or the fact that we use them to build these awesome sites, then you are more than welcome to deploy WordPress and build your own website on your own time. Please understand that we are not charging you to install or use WordPress, its plugins, or its core functionality. We are charging you for the years of education needed to design, build, and deploy your website quickly, efficiently and with as little impact on your bottom line.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          A FURTHER NOTE ON PLUGINS
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Many plugins are free to download and use and some you need to pay for -- It's important to note that you may include whatever other plugins you'd like once your build is complete, however, MIND will only troubleshoot and fix those issues  arising from the standard plugins that we install. Due to the structuring of this product any additional work, edits, or changes involving other third-party plugins would be handled in a separate work order and are invoiced accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          MAINTENANCE AND UPDATES
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Like many open-source projects, WordPress is updated and improved on a regular basis. Because of this we will keep our product up-to-date and compliant with all new versions of WordPress. Associated plugins that we install and use for these sites will also be on a similar schedule. We encourage our users to visit our blog often to stay informed about any updates to our product so they may also keep their site up-to date. We encourage our users to take advantage of our monthly maintenance contracts. Our maintenance contracts allow you to not have to worry about updates and upgrades, we'll do that for you! It's an easy and inexpensive way to maintain your website and keep it working properly.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          WHAT THE HECK AM I PAYING FOR?
         </strong>
         <br/>
         You are paying for our developers to build and configure your custom Outta-Site WordPress theme, the Outta-Site custom plugin, to setup and install WordPress itself and all of the recommended plugins, and for our help getting the rest of your site populated with content and training on using your new website.  We'll take care of the licensing of our recommended plugins, but you're on the hook for any you install yourself.  Once your Outta-Site has launched, you are free to do with it as you please, or you are welcome to get on contract with us and stick around for a while.  It's all up to you!  Whew, thank you for reading!
