     In this spirit do engineers, physicists concerned with
          thermodynamics, and the swarm of preoccupied draughtsmen tackle their
          work. In appearance, but only in appearance, they seem to be polishing
          surfaces and refining away angles, easing this joint or stabilizing
          that wing, rendering these parts invisible, so that in the end there
          is no longer a wing hooked to a frame-work but a form flawless in its
          perfection, completely disengaged from its matrix, a sort of
          spontaneous whole, its parts mysteriously fused together and
          resembling in their unity a poem.

     Translation is tricky
    </a>
    :
        should one strive to be literal, or to capture the "intent"?
        The Galantire translation is rather loose: the original
        paragraph is split in pieces and distributed around the chapter. The
        Rees translation is more "literal". Which is better?
   </p>
   <p>
    A French-as-a-second-language-speaking colleague of mine says that the
        whole book, despite being published in 1939, has a rather archaic style,
        and moreover is "very, very French". He also has a comment on
        the translation of that final
    <i>
     retrancher
    </i>
    in the original (rather
        than the
    <i>
     enlever
    </i>
    of the more widely quoted "simplified"
        version). Modern French-English dictionaries do say that
    <i>
     retrancher
    </i>
    means
    <i>
     to take away
    </i>
    or
    <i>
     to cut off
    </i>
    , but that may not be
        the best translation given the overall archaic style. A further
        colleague, a bilingual English-French software engineer, thinks that in
        this context it actually means much the same as
    <i>
     <a href="../../books/pages/f/MartinFowler.htm#refactor">
      refactor
     </a>
    </i>
    .
        So a "better" translation may well be:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <div class="quotation-translation">

          not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more

    I think that there is a moral to this story,

    <b>
     it is more important to have beauty in one's equations
        that to have them fit experiment
    </b>
    . If Schrdinger had been more
        confident of his work, he could have published it some months earlier,
        and he could have published a more accurate equation. It seems that if
        one is working from the point of view of getting beauty in one's
        equations, and if one has really a sound insight, one is on a sure line
        of progress. If there is not complete agreement between the results of
        one's work and experiment, one should not allow oneself to be too
        discouraged, because the discrepancy may well be due to minor features
        that are not properly taken into account and that will get cleared up
        with further development of the theory.

    The mind, in short, works on the data it
        receives very much as a sculptor works on his block of stone.

     In a
        sense the statue stood there from eternity. But there were a thousand
        different ones beside it, and the sculptor alone is to thank for having
        extricated this one from the rest.
    </b>
    Just so the world of each of us,
        how so ever different our several views of it may be, all lay embedded
        in the primordial chaos of sensations, which gave the mere *matter* to
        the thought of all of us indifferently. We may, if we like, by our
        reasonings unwind things back to that black and jointless continuity of
        space and moving clouds of swarming atoms which science calls the only
        real world. But all the while the world we feel and live in will be that
         which our ancestors and we, by slowly cumulative strokes of choice,
        have extricated out of this, like sculptors, by simply removing portions
        of the given stuff.
    <b>
     Other sculptors, other statues from the same
        stone! Other minds, other worlds from the same monotonous and
        inexpressive chaos!

    The following anecdote is well known in Paris,
        but has never been printed entire. Laplace once went in form to present
        some edition of his "Systme du Monde" to the First
        Consul, or Emperor. Napoleon, whom some wags had told that this book
        contained no mention of the name of God, and who was fond of putting
        embarrassing questions, received it with"M. Laplace, they tell
        me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and
        have never even mentioned its Creator." Laplace, who, though the
        most supple of politicians, was as stiff as a martyr on every point of
        his philosophy or religion (e. g., even under Charles X he never
        concealed his dislike of the priests), drew himself up and answered
        bluntly, "
    <b>
     Je n'avais pas besoin de cette hypothse-l.

    "
    <sup>

    Napoleon, greatly amused, told this reply to Lagrange, who exclaimed, "Ah!
        c'est une belle hypothse; a explique beaucoup de choses."

    Critics who treat "adult" as a term
        of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adults
        themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up
        because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish;
        these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in
        childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms.
        Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or
        even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of
        really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in
        secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now
        that I am fifty, I read them openly.

    But thirty thousand to the rest;

    An age at least to every part,
    <br/>
    And the last age should show your heart.

    For, lady, you deserve this state,

    <br/>
    Thy beauty shall no more be found,

    And while thy willing soul transpires

    At every pore with instant fires,

    <br/>
    And tear our pleasures with rough strife
    <br/>
    Thorough the iron gates of life.

    In the space of one hundred and seventy six

        per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can

     By relieving the brain of all unnecessary
        work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced
        problems, and, in effect, increases the mental power of the race.
    </b>
    Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was
        difficult, and the division even of integers called into play the
        highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world
        would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that ...
        a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the
        operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have
        seemed to him a sheer impossibility ... Our modern power of easy
        reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the
        gradual discovery of a perfect notation. [...] By the aid of symbolism,
        we can make transitions in reasoning almost mechanically, by the eye,
        which otherwise would call into play the higher faculties of the brain.
        [...] It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books
        and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should
        cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise
        opposite is the case.

     Civilisation advances by extending the number
        of important operations which we can perform without thinking about
        them.

    Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle --

    Even in physics, there is no infallible
        procedure for generating reliable knowledge. The calm order and
        perfection of well-established theories, accredited by innumerable items
        of evidence from a thousand different hands, eyes and brains, is not
        characteristic of the front-line of research, where controversy,
        conjecture, contradiction and confusion are rife.
    <b>
     The physics of
        undergraduate text-books is 90% true; the contents of the primary
        research journals of physics is 90% false.
    </b>
    The scientific system is
        as much involved in distilling the former out of the latter as it is in
        creating and transferring more and more bits of data and items of
        'information'.
