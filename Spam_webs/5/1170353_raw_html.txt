          A new study
         </a>
         shows that most teenage boys view teenage girls as actual human beings, not simple sex toys:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The stereotype of the 16-year-old boy is that he has sex on the brain. But a fascinating new report suggests that boys are motivated more by love and a desire to form real relationships with the girls they date.
         </p>
         <p>
          The report, published in this months Journal of Adolescence, paints a far different picture of teen boys than the stereotype of testosterone-fueled youth. Psychology researchers from the State University of New York at Oswego surveyed 105 10th-grade boys whose average age was about 16. The boys, most of whom said they were heterosexual, were given surveys asking them to select various reasons why they asked girls out, dated and pursued physical relationships. Most of the boys had dating experience, and about 40 percent were sexually active.
         </p>
         <p>
          The boys were asked their reasons for dating and were allowed to mark more than one answer. Notably, being physically attracted to someone wasnt the primary motivation they gave for dating. More than 80 percent of the boys noted I really liked the person. Physical attraction and wanting to get to know someone better were the second most popular answers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Among the boys who had been sexually active, physical desire and wanting to know what sex feels like were among the top three reasons they pursued sex. However, the boys were equally likely to say they pursued sex because they loved their partner. Interestingly, only 14 percent said they sought sex because they wanted to lose their virginity, and 9 percent did so to fit in with friends.

         The New York Times headline-writers, unfortunately, arent quite as evolved as the 16-year-olds in the study  they titled the piece Inside the Mind of the Boy Dating Your Daughter. Perhaps Im being nitpicky, but this kind of language about dating always creeps me out. The Boy is an individual person who is encroaching on
         <em>
          your
         </em>
         property; the whole thing rubs me the wrong way. But that aside, the article is an interesting read, and Im with this guy:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Lets give boys more credit, said study author Andrew Smiler, an assistant professor of psychology at the university. Although some of them are just looking for sex, most boys are looking for a relationship. The kids we know mostly arent like this horrible stereotype. They are generally interested in dating and getting to know their partners.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         And this is another thank feminism moment. The idea that boys just want sex (and girls dont) is at its heart conservative and essentialist  and its a stereotype that lays the groundwork for requirements of femininity that inevitably involve refusing sex until a big fat diamond enters the picture, and bartering virginity for financial and social security. Its not feminists who argue that boys are mindless animals only interested in sex; no, that argument comes from your anti-feminist social conservatives, who manage to inject it into abstinence-only sex education:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          One curriculum teaches that men are sexually aggressive and lack deep emotions. In a chart of the top five womens and mens basic needs, the curriculum lists sexual fulfillment and physical attractiveness as two of the top five needs in the mens section. Affection, Conversation, Honesty and Openness, and Family Commitment are listed only as womens needs.
         </p>
         <p>
          The curriculum teaches: A male is usually less discriminating about those to whom he is sexually attracted. . . . Women usually have greater intuitive awareness of how to develop a loving relationship.
         </p>
         <p>
          The same curriculum tells participants: While a man needs little or no preparation for sex, a woman often needs hours of emotional and mental preparation.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         (Source: The Waxman Report on abstinence-only sex education).
        </p>
        <p>
         In the conservative heyday that never actually was, women had to trick those over-sexed, brutish men into marriage by withholding sex. Fathers had to protect their daughters from boys who might disgrace them. And women who gave it up too easily were shameful sluts, while the boys they did it with were just, well, boys.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, boys are expected  and perhaps more importantly,
         <em>
          allowed
         </em>
          to have feelings. That certainly isnt universal, and theres still a whole lot of poisonous rhetoric around masculinity, but feminism has created a slightly larger space for boys and men to be people instead of masculine charicatures. I think thats a good thing. The right-wing Culture Warriors arent so much on board. In the conservative Golden Age, men didnt have many choices. As the primary bread-winners, they were forced into jobs that paid the bills and sustained their families; now that two-earner families are extremely common, men have more career opportunities and greater job flexibility. Further, marriage can be acceptably delayed until both partners are done with school and have their careers established, meaning that men dont have to take the first paying gig that comes along. Oh, and in those Golden 50s, one in four families lived in poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
         In her book How the Pro-Choice Movement Saved America, Cristina Page details the many ways that feminism has helped fathers. This passage in particular seems relevant:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Fathers increased involvement starts at the very beginning of their childrens lives: 90 percent of dads are present in the delivery room (compared to 10 percent in 1970).  Dads today are even more affectionate with their children: 60 percent hug their school-age kids every day, and 79 percent tell their children they love them several times a week. 
          <br/>
          <span id="more-6954">
          </span>
          <br/>
          All of this seems to have created a revolution in how men see themselves. Seventy percent of dads feel they would be just as effective staying home and raising children as their wives. The Gallup organization found that one in four men would actually
          <em>
           like
          </em>
          to stay home and take care of the house and family. Spike TV, the TV network for men, surveyed 1,300 men and found that the number considering staying home is even higher; the poll found that 56 percent of men would consider becoming stay-at-home dads. As the Spike TV pollsters explain, This is the first generation of men to feel the full effect of women entering the workforce. As women have become partners in the workplace, men are now adjusting to a more equal status at home. And record numbers of men are choosing to stay at home too. Today, statistics show that roughly 2.5 million dads nationwide stay at home to be their childrens primary caretaker.
         </p>
         <p>
          The unheralded result of women entering the workforce has been the rise of the real family man and the making of the more devoted father. It is to the point that hte vast majority of men today, 72 percent, say they would sacrifice pay and job opportunities for more time with their families. Spike TV found that most men would choose attending their kids sporting event over an important work obligation. The Spike TV pollsters explain, Theres been a paradigm shift. Men want involvement with kids. Even with infants, they get up at night. It was NEVER like this before. Theyre taking parenting seriously. New responsibilities with kids and in homes are enriching mens lives. Theyre excited by it, and proud.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Is it any shock that dads like these are raising sons who see women and girls as human beings instead of sex objects or servants?
        </p>
        <p>
         There is still lots of feminist work to be done with men and boys. Masculine stereotypes still do all kinds of harm to men and women and girls and boys alike, and theres a good argument to be made for the idea that men are much further behind women when it comes to embracing feminist ideals. But feminism has had some successes, and its been good for all involved  this is just one example of that. Theres still a long way to go, but hopefully studies like this will serve as reminders of who actually has the interests of human beings in mind, and who is solely dedicated to a dogma that doesnt fit into most peoples realities or ideals.

            Yes, yes, and again yes.

            I always love it when what seems to me like a healthy dose of simple reality (dont we all know this already?) is presented as this mind-blowing alternative theory:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a fascinating new report suggests that boys are motivated more by love and a desire to form real relationships with the girls they date.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Ohmigod!  Like, maybe oppositional gender is a
            <em>
             myth
            </em>
            ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, Im glad someones going to the trouble of actually proving it by encouraging boys to speak up about their personal experiences.

            But yes, youre absolutely right.  I file this under desire to control women so strong that it doesnt matter how much we have to insult men in the process.  Does anyone actually believe that the crap about teenage boys as sexual predators (when very few are, even if I was unfortunate enough to date one of them) is about genuine fear and disdain for young men?  I sure as hell dont.  Its about teaching teenage girls to lives their lives under the constant fear of sexual attack and/or disgrace and that sexuality is something to guard, not explore, and upholding the idea that men have some sort of innate right to sexual dominance, and by extension, rape.

And feel free to shoot me an email if you post a comment and it doesnt go up for a few hours (unless its like 4am, in which case, sorry, Im sleeping).

            As one who was once one of those adolescent boys Im glad to see a depiction of the reality I, and those around me, lived. Further, I find it heartening that there are many in my generation (of both sexes) who realize just how much misogyny has and is poisoning our world. What we have now is a world out of balance and so often it isnt even the real world, its a constructed normative reality were being told we live in. Maybe one day it will be ok, with the world at large, for young men and women to be open not only about the love they want, but also the sex they want as complex beings. But thats a story for another day
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the rest. I know that of all those men close to me (between the ages of 21 and 25) all would like the opportunity (if economically feasible) to stay home with the children they look forward to having. Weve a long way to go, but I think part of my generation knows what beauty equality can bring and we want it in our lives. So, Id like to thank parents who taught me what love, equality, and feminism can look like in action. But, just as their parents were involved in a struggle for civil rights that is still not over I fully expect that weve got a long road ahead, but at least were moving.

            Okay.  They get stuck in moderation sometimes, but when that happens I can still see the comment and it will say that it has to be approved . . . thus the confusion.  I did use some form of the word sexual four times in that comment, though.  Thats a possible explanation. *shrugs*

            Ha. Yeah, I didnt mean to infer that theyre

             over
            </em>
            , simply that theyve been challenged. I look at my family, and my grandpa used to rarely let my aunt out of the house. When he did let her socialize, hed follow her with his huge German shepherd. She ended up eloping at 18 just to get away from his protection.
           </p>
           <p>
            By contrast, my dad  her brother  never did the youre my daughters and my property thing. Both of my parents were a bit conservative when it came to my dating life, but I
            <em>
             never
            </em>
            heard anything about those boys dating my daughter. I dont think that would have flown in my house.

             Ha. Yeah, I didnt mean to infer that theyre over, simply that theyve been challenged. I look at my family, and my grandpa used to rarely let my aunt out of the house. When he did let her socialize, hed follow her with his huge German shepherd. She ended up eloping at 18 just to get away from his protection.
            </p>
            <p>
             By contrast, my dad  her brother  never did the youre my daughters and my property thing. Both of my parents were a bit conservative when it came to my dating life, but I never heard anything about those boys dating my daughter. I dont think that would have flown in my house.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Among my older cousins, the only difference I noticed in regards to dating was that my female cousins were bombarded more frequently with the same refrain given to all of us:
           </p>
           <p>
            Your primary purpose in high school/college is to study/work hard so you can graduate with flying colors and so the parental investment in your education is not squandered.*
           </p>
           <p>
            Though they do not explicitly SAY dating is discouraged in high school/college.the tone with which it is said makes it quite clearespecially if the grades started slipping.
           </p>
           <p>
            * Though I got the same speech as all my older cousinsit was far easier for me to ignore as the near-full college scholarship, small loan I took out on my own, and my freelancing meant a key component of their argument was fatally undermined.

            Interestingly, my dad, whos otherwise a Rush Limbaugh Republican, told me the same thing.  In fact, he told me multiple times when I was a teenager and in my early twenties that he didnt care if I ever got married.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, then, he has five very accomplished sisters (two with PhDs) and a very accomplished wife (my mother), so he was kinda pre-brainwashed.

            (My grandfather immigrated here from Italy when he was two years old, so technically my dad is a second-generation immigrant, at least on the paternal side.  Dont know if that has a whole lot to do with it.)

            My parents never said it quite that explicitly, but it was always understood in our house that they would rather my sister and I not get married at all than leap into a marriage where wed be miserable. This was borne out a few years ago when my sister was engaged to a guy she realized she just couldnt spend the rest of her life with, and my parents both told her she had to do what would make her happy in the long run. My sister broke off the engagement and is much the better for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think those kinds of wise decisions are the natural product of parents putting more emphasis on their kids having meaningful relationships and less on cramming their kids square pegs into the round holes of moldy social mores. In my familys case, they had to square off against the decrepit mores of both the deep South (where every little lady is supposed to find themselves a husband by 25 or die trying) and the Catholic church (where women are supposed to get married, pop out a dozen kids, and never even think of divorce no matter how miserable they are). But again, they trusted my sister to know on her own
            <i>
             what was right for her,
            </i>
            and as tough as it was, she made the right decision.

            Yes, yes, yes!
           </p>
           <p>
            But also, hang on a minute.
           </p>
           <p>
            While this post definitely describes how I see feminism being helpful to me, and to other men, I have a couple of quibbles:
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with this statement in theory:
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             The idea that boys just want sex (and girls dont) is at its heart conservative and essentialist  Its not feminists who argue that boys are mindless animals only interested in sex; no, that argument comes from your anti-feminist social conservatives
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            But I can tell you that as a male growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, I heard that message coming loud and clear from most feminists I encountered, and it just happened to fit well with the agenda of the conservative press as well.   It seems to underpin a huge element of 2nd-wave feminisms approach to sexuality, and that was what I was hearing as I grew up.
            <a href="http://afemanistview.blogspot.com/2007/08/teenagers-and-men-compare-and-contrast.html" rel="nofollow">
             I wrote about my experiences on my blog
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            My second quibble is with the last paragraph:
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             There is still lots of feminist work to be done with men and boys.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Forgive me if I have misinterpreted that remark, but it comes across as rather patronising, and actually seems to me to key back into the stereotype of men and boys as being somehow untamed animals that need to be broken in to make them amenable to what women want them to be, rather than seeing us as people and individuals in our own right.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope what you actually meant was, There is still a lot of work for feminists to do alongside a gender-liberating mens and boys movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             Masculine stereotypes still do all kinds of harm to men and women and girls and boys alike, 
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Agreed, but there seems to be a disconnect here with how feminists see it when men want to deal with these issues for themselves (as a recent thread about mocking manhood seemed to show!)
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             and theres a good argument to be made for the idea that men are much further behind women when it comes to embracing feminist ideals.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, this comes across as a colonialist type of remark  almost akin to Arabs are much further behind when it comes to embracing Western ideals.   Im hazarding a guess here, but I would say that most men, and even most feminist or pro-feminist men, DONT want to embrace feminist ideals as such; rather, we want (and need) to develop our own ideals and gender-liberation theory, that I would expect to end up being complementary and enhancing of feminist ideals and theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            For all the pretensions I have seen by feminists to have an all-encompassing world-view that explains all of gender, feminism still does not speak to me fully; the ideals and philosophy of feminism are not designed to explain my experience or my world in the way that they can a womans.
           </p>
           <p>
            For that, we need an approach that is formed by male thinkers and doers who are informed by, but not necessarily followers of, feminist ideas.   I would like to think I am one such person (but I have to leave that determination to others),
            <a href="http://www.realadultsex.com/" rel="nofollow">
             Figleaf of Real Adult Sex
            </a>
            I would definitely count in that category.
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             who is solely dedicated to a dogma that doesnt fit into most peoples realities or ideals.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Forgive me again, but I could certainly apply that description to many women who self-identify as feminist, and even some who view themselves (and indeed, are viewed by others) as feminist leaders.   And Im not just talking about not fitting into mens realities, either, but also other womens.

            Astraea: My husband has made a few of those comments as well, and our kids have never got past embryo stage.

           <p>
            Random aside, does anyone have any advice for weeding out the misogynistic programing in a man? My husband is a great guy, and for the most part a feminist. Problem is he lives in the real world and has internalized a lot of the stereotypes that were trying to dismantle. For instance, the idea that an extremely underaged girl can consent to sex. Or upon hearing about a rape immediately wondering if shes lying (got that one gone). Or most recently, that Hillary Clinton is a power hungry bitch.

            Libertarianchick, I agree.  While I was going through my predatory phase in my early 20s, I was astounded by how many guys might SAY they wanted no strings sex, but who would then try to convince me that what I really wanted with them was a relationship.

            Ashley, thats worth a post, and Ill see if I can come up with something helpful.
            <br/>
            And Jill is right  to the extent that we are witnessing a real change in how young men speak about their feelings and give themselves permission to have feelings, feminism deserves a substantial amount of the credit.

            <p>
             Forgive me if I have misinterpreted that remark, but it comes across as rather patronising, and actually seems to me to key back into the stereotype of men and boys as being somehow untamed animals that need to be broken in to make them amenable to what women want them to be, rather than seeing us as people and individuals in our own right.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope what you actually meant was, There is still a lot of work for feminists to do alongside a gender-liberating mens and boys movement.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Well, yes and no. I dont see feminism as solely a womens movement, so maybe the issue is that our terminology is off. I dont think that men and boys need to be broken in, but I do think that there needs to be a lot of consciousness-raising and educational work about male privilege, identity, and masculinity. A lot of that work has to be done for men by men; I consider that feminist work.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Again, this comes across as a colonialist type of remark  almost akin to Arabs are much further behind when it comes to embracing Western ideals. Im hazarding a guess here, but I would say that most men, and even most feminist or pro-feminist men, DONT want to embrace feminist ideals as such; rather, we want (and need) to develop our own ideals and gender-liberation theory, that I would expect to end up being complementary and enhancing of feminist ideals and theory.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Thats all fine and good, but I dont think you can separate that from feminism  and I dont think that your colonialist argument works at all, considering that men are generally a more powerful class of people. This is more akin to anti-colonialist or anti-racist movements telling powerful countries or white people to please listen to us; please recognize your privilege; please realize that our values and our views are valid. I like the idea of gender liberation theory, but Im skeptical of it for the same reason that Id be skeptical of a white person espousing race liberation theory  there exist entrenched power structures and hierarchies that matter a whole lot, and I worry that such realities become may obscured under such theories.

            I agree with Jill.  I dont understand why you think there needs to be a separate theory for men.  Feminism isnt all about women Men can certainly contribute and leave their mark.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, your post kind of seemed to me like you were saying that feminism isnt good enough for men, or men can do it better.  Or maybe its just because feminism is associated with women.  Im not sure, your post just rubbed me the wrong way.

            But I can tell you that as a male growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, I heard that message coming loud and clear from most feminists I encountered
           </p>
           <p>
            Im guessing, however, that most of the feminists you encountered  especially the ones saying such things  were the ones that, like me, were your age.  Which means that they likely didnt know all that much more about feminist theory than you did, they just knew that something was wrong and yet had still internalized a lot of the same crap that you had.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that I said a lot of stuff at that age that I cringe to think of now, and I said it simply because I didnt have the right tools and words to describe what I saw.  While this is a problem that needs to be addressed, its a rather different problem than the one you are suggesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            re: men and feminism
           </p>
           <p>
            While we obviously need more men doing gender deconstruction   for the same reasons that feminism lead only be men is counterproductive  I would caution you against thinking that just because something speaks to you, its more true than what doesnt.  Figleafs got some great stuff, but a lot of it doesnt speak to women (er, me) the way that you are saying feminism doesnt speak to men.  We dont just need gender deconstruction from both sides, what we also need is something that bridges that gap and speaks to everyone.

            I had slightly better sex ed since it was a few years before the whole abstinence-only craze was accepted by the mainstream.  But we still got the message that boys were obsessed with sex and girls were obsessed with romance.  The every 7 seconds thing was a big deal at the time.  I remember it made me feel like a freak because I thought about sex

            Bunny  Id guess that they were in the hospital but not in the room. Fathers used to be discouraged from being in the room because theyd get in the way, or get upset/faint and then the staff would have to take care of them too. (my mother kicked my dad out of the room when he suggested a game of mastermind to pass the time while she was in labor)
           </p>
           <p>
            I cant believe only 79% of dads tell their kids theyre loved on at least a weekly basis! WTF! My dad is not the most sensitive guy (clearly, see above) but we heard I love you everyday growing up.

            Regarding this posts topic, maybe I was a freak in high school/college.  As a dude, however, I was far too busy keeping my head above academic water, doing extracurriculars, attending afterschool tutoring, and working an afterschool/weekend job to even think about dating/sex/romantic relationships.  In many ways, my behavior in high school and to some extent, college was more typical of high school/college students in 1950s/60s era Republic of China (Taiwan) according to accounts presented by older relatives and parents.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Interestingly, my dad, whos otherwise a Rush Limbaugh Republican, told me the same thing. In fact, he told me multiple times when I was a teenager and in my early twenties that he didnt care if I ever got married.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The odd thing was that they would say that.and then miraculously yet expect my older cousins to then find a compatible person to marry and then have kids a few years out from college.  It is a common complaint I keep hearing from children of immigrants, especially fellow Asian-American and some more conservative Jewish classmates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortunately, my older aunts became more flexible after seeing how counterproductive badgering was when an older cousin married before he was ready at 26 and divorced less than two years later.*
           </p>
           <p>
            While those of us who are single still get badgered, the fact we can immediately cite that cousin as a good example of what rushing someone into marriage can do tends to shut my older relatives up good.  :)
           </p>
           <p>
            * Though he has stated recently he is now ready to be married to someone he has been dating, the older relatives and his parents are trying their best to avoid pushing him so they do not get a repeat of what happened with his first marriage 20 years ago.

             This is more akin to anti-colonialist or anti-racist movements telling powerful countries or white people to please listen to us; please recognize your privilege; please realize that our values and our views are valid.

            Okay, this is the problem, right here.   Women seem to want to be the ones saying that, about everything (including what men do, and think, and experience).   Im saying that men need to be saying this right back at you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women have privilege.   The existence of feminism, an intellectual and practical approach to dealing with gender issues that has been developed from a female perspective, means you have something we dont.   It makes you privileged.   Youre talking down to us all the time, and ignoring our views of the world.   This is what I experience a lot of the time even now when I intersect with feminist writing.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many areas of life and politics and thinking and activism, where feminism is precisely about anti-colonialism.   However, when it comes to men figuring out that the patriarchal structures are damaging to us, we cant have it dictated to us just because you ladies have it all figured out already from your side of the divide.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the frustration that was behind my original interpretation of your feminist work remark.
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             I dont understand why you think there needs to be a separate theory for men. Feminism isnt all about women Men can certainly contribute and leave their mark.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            The reasons I think it needs to be distinct and developed for men and by men (I dont think it can be separate, we need to borrow some of the tools that feminism has developed over the past century or so) are twofold.   One, because if men start our debate within feminism, then it will be perceived by many as being colonialism and men trying to tell women how to do feminism.   Thats not helpful to anyone.   Two, because men need to figure it out for ourselves as much as possible, and however well-meant it may be, women trying to tell men how to solve the problems men experience with gender, is just as bad as men trying to tell women how to do feminism.
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             Honestly, your post kind of seemed to me like you were saying that feminism isnt good enough for men, or men can do it better. Or maybe its just because feminism is associated with women. Im not sure, your post just rubbed me the wrong way.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, to me that sounds a bit like saying that a hammer isnt good enough for fastening screws, or a screwdriver isnt good enough for hammering in nails.   I wouldnt say men can do it better but rather, that it will be better once men and women are debating on genuinely equal terms (and thats a long way off for now).
           </p>
           <p>
            <i>
             I would caution you against thinking that just because something speaks to you, its more true than what doesnt.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, I wonder what feminists would make of that sort of line if a MRA came out with such a justification of his point of view!?   Please, think carefully and if the thing youre going to say would sound wrong if a man said it about feminist thinking, then perhaps you should consider it in more depth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would answer your caution by saying that what I experience seems more real to me than something that someone elses theory says I experience.   And if someone else comes along with a theory that says something closer to what I experience, then yes  Im going to say that thats a better theory.
           </p>

            <i>
             Figleafs got some great stuff, but a lot of it doesnt speak to women (er, me) the way that you are saying feminism doesnt speak to men. We dont just need gender deconstruction from both sides, what we also need is something that bridges that gap and speaks to everyone.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with this.   I just dont think we have the necessary pieces in place to construct that bridge yet.   Men are playing catch-up right now, and your remark, didnt have the right tools and words to describe I think accurately represents where men are at (in general) regarding our own situations.   I think that feminism has a lot of those tools and words, but men are still going to have to construct the descriptions and conclusions for ourselves, using those tools in our own way, before we are in a position to take a look at what weve got, and how to create a Grand Theory of Everyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I absolutely dont think that the male side should be separate from feminism, I would like to think that there would be a lot of flow of ideas between the two (especially since feminism has so many tools we need).

            Bunny  I know that at least in some communities, it was actually considered extremely bad form for a man to be there.   The James Herriot books, for example, explain how he was severely told off by the midwife for turning up during labour rather than waiting until the baby was born.

            The historian in me takes issue with this. The role of fathers in their childrens lives has not always been about absence. This is a relatively new phenomenon. There have been long periods in history in the West where fathers were seen as central care-givers. Even in the 19th cent, advice writers such as William Cobbett recommended that men take there share of getting up in the night to care for babies. It was only a hundred years ago that women got the legal right to their children in a separation or divorce , which were previously by default the property of their fathers.

             Okay, this is the problem, right here. Women seem to want to be the ones saying that, about everything (including what men do, and think, and experience). Im saying that men need to be saying this right back at you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Women have privilege. The existence of feminism, an intellectual and practical approach to dealing with gender issues that has been developed from a female perspective, means you have something we dont. It makes you privileged. Youre talking down to us all the time, and ignoring our views of the world. This is what I experience a lot of the time even now when I intersect with feminist writing.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Well, some women are more privileged than others, but I think its hard to argue that feminism is prove that women as a class are privileged. Is critical race studies proof that people of color are privileged? Anti-colonialist activism proof that people in colonized countries are privileged? The existence of an ideology is not necessarily a mark of privilege.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I really dont think women ignore mens views of the world;
            <em>
             we dont have that option
            </em>
            . Mens views of the world are standardized and normalized; we cant very well escape them even if we want to.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There are many areas of life and politics and thinking and activism, where feminism is precisely about anti-colonialism. However, when it comes to men figuring out that the patriarchal structures are damaging to us, we cant have it dictated to us just because you ladies have it all figured out already from your side of the divide.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This, of course, I agree with  it isnt up to women to dictate to men how patriarchy hurts them. And I do believe that patriarchy hurts men too, and men certainly have the right (and the burden) of parsing through that. But that said, patriarchy also
            <em>
             benefits
            </em>
            men in a lot of ways, and thats what I worry is being lost in your vision of gender liberation theory. Men as individuals may be hurt by patriarchy, but a patriarchal system also privileges and benefits men as a class, just like white supremacist systems may do harm to individual white people, but on the whole greatly benefit white people. I think a failure to recognize that is really troubling, and I think its impossible to recognize that unless men are willing to step back in certain spaces, listen to women and believe our experiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            That doesnt mean that men shouldnt also have their own spaces to work through these issues; they should. I understand your point when you say that men want to be able to tell women to listen and learn as well, but Im hoping that you see the significant power imbalance inherent to that request, and that you arent assuming men and women are equally privileged.

            No, thats not what happened, as anyone can verify. Thomas, a man, and JackGoff, a man, to name a few, were dealing with those issues quite handily on the thread in question, despite your objections. One way to deal with them is through self-aware light-heartedness. Feminist men mock manhood sometimes, and its good for all of us. Cope.

           <p>
            Theres a lot of theory that needs to be worked out on these issues, that I dont have the tools yet to manage all of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I think the short version is that, while male privilege is granted by mens social attitudes, female privilege is granted also by mens attitudes, and that makes a big difference in the nature and types of privilege that each side get.   It also certainly means that male privilege is much greater and more certain than female privilege.
           </p>
           <p>
            In particular, the privilege that feminism gives, is not something that I see as comparable to other movements, and it exists basically in a particular statement.   Ive heard it said that the oppressed understand the oppressor better than the oppressor does themselves and seen that used as a means by which to silence male involvement in a debate, which concept I feel ignores that the majority of men are tools of oppression rather than oppressors themselves, and are thus oppressed to some degree as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what I mean when I say that women in general, and feminists specifically, do not see the world view that men have.   The world view that women cannot ignore is one that is imposed from without, it is not (in general) the world view that men share; and just as women cannot ignore it, for different reasons men cannot ignore it either.   It might be a malekind world view as opposed to individual mens world view, and it is just as inescapable for men as it is for women.
           </p>

           <p>
            I think its impossible to recognize [male class privilege] unless men are willing to step back in certain spaces, listen to women and believe our experiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            That doesnt mean that men shouldnt also have their own spaces to work through these issues; they should. I understand your point when you say that men want to be able to tell women to listen and learn as well, but Im hoping that you see the significant power imbalance inherent to that request
           </p>
           <p>
            I definitely agree with all of this: as I said before, I think that any male movement will need to take on board a lot of what feminism has already worked out.   I think that it is impossible for us to take a realistic look at our own circumstances until we have done exactly as you suggest  step back in certain spaces, listen to women and believe [womens] experiences.   I can only see its harm to me because of listening to women and questioning my own experiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the power imbalance goes, I think it cuts both ways, but in different ways and on different levels.   On a social and personal level, in fact, on every level except one, I agree that men have the power to create such spaces for themselves and to exclude women.   That men have the social ability also to drown out womens contributions if they wish.   Obviously, none of this would be very helpful if we did it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But on an intellectual level, women have a power advantage, because feminism has been working at gender issues for a long time, and is now very advanced; when it comes to debating and considering these issues for ourselves, men are still in our infancy.   I think the point I was making is that we need feminists to be teachers, not mothers  that is, I think our need is to be able to ask for advice, rather than be given answers.

            I said several times that men have things to learn from feminism.   But for the same reasons that men cannot lead feminism, feminists cannot lead men to answers that are relevant to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            But never let the truth get in the way of a good snark, huh?

            Okay, whenever I see a phrase like that, previous experience of the context tells me that very often the person writing it means, obedient feminist men who agree with me and do what I say.   That may or may not be what you mean, but let me reflect your words back to you:
           </p>
           <p>
            Reasonable women, who exist in great numbers and whom you do not speak for, dont have these problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you see how that sounds?   Do you get my point now?
           </p>
           <p>
            Im not responsible for the opinions of other men, and I dont have agree with them.   I can have different opinions and not be in the wrong.   I believe that mocking manhood is harmful and not good for all of us, and Im willing to stand up and say so.   You have a tokenist approach to assessing the views of men.

            Boo Hoo for the Obamas.  What do they think, the right wing is going to continue to embrace and support them as they have until now because Obama is challenging their biggest fear,(Hillary Clinton) ?  If your going to step up to the plate then step up to it.  This is dirty pool and its not new.  Just ask the Clintons.

            Wow. This was pretty enlightening and quite a relief. So its those who are overly conservative telling me Im a sexually obessed demon, with no greater function but to want sex? While my sister thankfully has taught me much good truth about feminism, it was usually female P.E. teachers teaching me I was a subhuman for being male and teaching the girls good, lessons for avoiding pigs. As a seventh grader, it was very difficult for me to discriminate between the one face of a demonizing P.E. teacher and the other face of the loving feminist seeking to teach protective behavior, just because it was the same person.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I wouldnt mind an e-mail about my next question. It is pretty demoralizing and hurtful when all I hear from my sisters feminist friends, is how to hurt their future male rapists. In front of me, I hear about how they suggest how to properly taser, kick in the balls, hurt, kill, and do other forms of damage to other humans (males  generally). I treat everyone 50/50, but I dont see why people should talk about how to hurt other people. Yes, rapists should be tasered, hurt, properly fended off and punished, but this whole prevention thing seems to be turning into an overbearing topic. Its hard to go a day without hearing how my gender is made of chauvinists pigs, and so-forth. Even if they arent talking about you, its hard not to feel the victim of sexism.
