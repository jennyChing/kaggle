       To add to this unexpected good fortune, news arrived that Ptolemy had
dismissed his mother and children, bestowing upon them presents and honors; and
also that his daughter Stratonice, whom he had married to Seleucus, was remarried
to Antiochus, the son of Seleucus, and proclaimed queen of Upper Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Antiochus, it appears, had fallen passionately in love with Stratonice,
the young queen, who had already made Seleucus the father of a son. He struggled
very hard with the beginnings of this passion, and at last, resolving with himself
that his desires were wholly unlawful, his malady past all cure, and his powers of
reason too feeble to act, he determined on death, and thought to bring his life
slowly to extinction by neglecting his person and refusing nourishment, under the
pretence of being ill. Erasistratus, the physician who attended him, quickly
perceived that love was his distemper, but the difficulty was to discover the object.
He therefore waited continually in his chamber, and when any of the beauties of
the court made their visits to the sick prince, he observed the emotions and
alterations in the countenance of Antiochus, and watched for the changes which he
knew to be indicative of the inward passions and inclinations of the soul. He took
notice that the presence of other women produced no effect upon him; but when
Stratonice came, as she often did, alone, or in company with Seleucus, to see him,
he observed in him all Sappho's famous symptoms,
       <a href="#ode">
        *
       </a>
       - his voice faltered, his face
flushed up, his eyes glanced stealthily, a sudden sweat broke out on his skin, the
beatings of his heart were irregular and violent, and, unable to support the excess
of his passion, he would sink into a state of faintness, prostration, and pallor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Erasistratus, reasoning upon these symptoms, and, upon the probability of
things, considering that the king's son would hardly, if the object of his passion had
been any other, have persisted to death rather than reveal it, felt, however, the
difficulty of making a discovery of this nature to Seleucus. But, trusting to the
tenderness of Seleucus for the young man, he put on all the assurance he could, and
at last, on some opportunity, spoke out, and told him the malady was love, a love
impossible to gratify or relieve. The king was extremely surprised, and asked, "Why
impossible to relieve?" "The fact is," replied Erasistratus," he is in love with my
wife." "How!" said Seleucus, "and will our friend Erasistratus refuse to bestow his
wife upon my son and only successor, when there is no other way to save his life?"
"You," replied Erasistratus, "who are his father, would not do so, if he were in love
with Stratonice." "Ah, my friend," answered Seleucus, "would to heaven any
means, human or divine, could but convert his present passion to that; it would be
well for me to part not only with Stratonice, but with my empire, to save
Antiochus." This he said with the greatest passion, shedding tears as he spoke; upon
which Erasistratus, taking him by the hand, replied, "In that case, you have no need
of Erasistratus; for you, who are the husband, the father, and the king, are the
proper physician for your own family." Seleucus, accordingly, summoning a general
assembly of his people, declared to them, that he had resolved to make Antiochus
king, and Stratonice queen, of all the provinces of Upper Asia, uniting them in
marriage; telling them, that he thought he had sufficient power over the prince's
will, that he should find in him no repugnance to obey his commands; and for
Stratonice, he hoped all his friends would endeavor to make her sensible, if she
should manifest any reluctance to such a marriage, that she ought to esteem those
things just and honorable which had been determined upon by the king as necessary
to the general good. In this manner, we are told, was brought about the marriage of
Antiochus and Stratonice.
