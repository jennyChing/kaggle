  <meta content="Anger is an emotion. It relates to feelings of fear, vulnerability, hurt, loss and greatcaring. It may be a rational reaction to a real threat or injustice, or it may be an emotionalreaction to a perceived threat or injustice. Minority women often feel anger at realinjustice which contributes to their depression. Anger is an energizing response designedto regain control. It can be expressed in three different ways: directly, indirectly andcovertly.
 1. Direct Anger
 Direct anger is the most healthy form of anger and expressed appropriately will usually
 resolve the feeling..How do you feel when you are angry? You may feel irritated, upset, hurt, disappointed,frustrated, stubborn enraged, vengeful? bitter, explosive. People often use words otherthan  I feel angry because they are easier to say, but all these words represent anger.What thoughts would an angry person have? Naturally, you think about the cause of youranger and how you can express it. 
 To express anger directly, 
 1) Realize that you are angry and why.
 2) Find an appropriate moment to confront the person. You may approach the personyoure angry with as soon as possible, but with a sensitivity for timing and setting. 
 3) Use I statements, talking with him/her about how you feel.
 4) Stick with the immediate issue and to stay in the present. This is not the time todredge up things from the past.
 5) Observe nonverbal behaviors that occur when you are talking. A red flushed face, araised voice, tightened muscles, large gestures, increased blood pressure and pulseindicate anger. Be perceptive.
 6) If the other person is becoming enraged, cool it until a better time to settle the issue.Some women have provoked men into a rage that results in their being physicallyattacked.
 7) Think ahead about how the individual may react and plan how you must handle theconsequences.
 Direct anger is honest. It means you do let people know when you are upset, irritated orangry. But dont read the word honest as meaning you have the right blow up, orexpress uncontrolled rage. It is important to be aware of your anger, accept it, deal with it- openly, directly and appropriately. Dont stuff your feelings, holding them inside.To build strong honest relationships, learn to express your anger appropriately butcalmly. 
 2. Indirect Anger
 How do you experience indirect anger? When you experience angry feelings, your mindcensors them. You recognize and feel anger, but it does not seem acceptable toexperience the feeling toward a certain person or situation, or to express the feeling. Itisnt right to feel angry at God,  or If Bill does that one more time then Ill get mad,or Its really not that important, or I was brought up to be a lady; I wont fight.
 If you feel angry but your thoughts do not allow you to express anger directly, then youusually behave in one of three ways. 
 1) First, if expressing anger toward a certain person is not acceptable, you may displaceit. For example, a man who is angry towards his boss may express his anger byyelling at his wife, children, dog, or by kicking car tires. 
 2) Second, you may try to forget, squelch, or sit on your anger. Trying to repressanger is usually not successful. It will leak, and you will express it throughcoldness, back-stabbing, sarcasm, or avoiding interaction. Repressing feelings mayalso cause physical problems such as high blood pressure, ulcers or arthritis. 
 3) After trying to keep the lid on your anger you may reach the point of explosion, thethird set of behaviors. You say or do something with more intensity than isappropriate in the situation. Name-calling, yelling, insulting, pounding fists, hitting,or other physical abuse may be included in explosion.
 Indirect anger is probably the most common form of expression in our society becausefor a long time being angry was not acceptable social behavior. We were taught that&quot;good&quot; people always controlled their tempers. With the current emphasis on self awareness and mental health, this unrealistic attitude seems to be changing. As is truewith other feelings, anger is not good or bad; it is just another human emotion whichdeserves direct but appropriate expression.
 3. Covert Anger
 Have you ever had something happen to you and a few hours or days later you realizethat you are angry about it? Actually, you were angry all along but for some reason thatanger was unacceptable and so it stayed unconscious for a while. During that period oftime when you did not recognize that you were angry, either emotionally or cognitively,you were experiencing covert anger. Perhaps as a child you were angry at your parentsbut you had been taught to love and obey them. These feelings arein congruent, so one isrepressed. Children who have been victims of incest often experience this kind ofunconscious anger. They may have felt invaded and furious at the parent, but could notfeel their anger until they learned that sex between parents and children is wrong andunlawful. 
 The person who expresses anger indirectly feels the emotion and then censors it. But aperson feeling covert anger believes that anger is so unacceptable that she will not evenallow herself to feel, think, or act angry. The anger stays unconscious. The woman says,Oh, I never get angry. So how can you recognize covert anger? Usually the only wayto recognize it in yourself is by looking back at something and realizing that you wereangry but not conscious of it. Sometimes you can recognize it in other people when theydont seem to be acting normally in situations that would understandably incite anger.
 An example of such a situation would be indifference toward the death of a loved one.Anger, if not expressed directly, is turned against the self. Any anger that is held in willeventually express itself in the form of depression. Indirect anger will lead to agitateddepression, and covert anger will lead to retarded depression " name="twitter:description"/>

You recognize and feel anger, but it does not seem acceptable toexperience the feeling toward a certain person or situation, or to express the feeling. Itisnt right to feel angry at God,  or If Bill does that one more time then Ill get mad,or Its really not that important, or I was brought up to be a lady; I wont fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel angry but your thoughts do not allow you to express anger directly, then youusually behave in one of three ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) First, if expressing anger toward a certain person is not acceptable, you may displaceit. For example, a man who is angry towards his boss may express his anger byyelling at his wife, children, dog, or by kicking car tires.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Second, you may try to forget, squelch, or sit on your anger. Trying to repressanger is usually not successful. It will leak, and you will express it throughcoldness, back-stabbing, sarcasm, or avoiding interaction. Repressing feelings mayalso cause physical problems such as high blood pressure, ulcers or arthritis.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) After trying to keep the lid on your anger you may reach the point of explosion, thethird set of behaviors. You say or do something with more intensity than isappropriate in the situation. Name-calling, yelling, insulting, pounding fists, hitting,or other physical abuse may be included in explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indirect anger is probably the most common form of expression in our society becausefor a long time being angry was not acceptable social behavior. We were taught that"good" people always controlled their tempers. With the current emphasis on self awareness and mental health, this unrealistic attitude seems to be changing. As is truewith other feelings, anger is not good or bad; it is just another human emotion whichdeserves direct but appropriate expression.
      </p>
      <p>
       3. Covert Anger
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever had something happen to you and a few hours or days later you realizethat you are angry about it? Actually, you were angry all along but for some reason thatanger was unacceptable and so it stayed unconscious for a while. During that period oftime when you did not recognize that you were angry, either emotionally or cognitively,you were experiencing covert anger. Perhaps as a child you were angry at your parentsbut you had been taught to love and obey them. These feelings arein congruent, so one isrepressed. Children who have been victims of incest often experience this kind ofunconscious anger. They may have felt invaded and furious at the parent, but could notfeel their anger until they learned that sex between parents and children is wrong andunlawful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person who expresses anger indirectly feels the emotion and then censors it. But aperson feeling covert anger believes that anger is so unacceptable that she will not evenallow herself to feel, think, or act angry. The anger stays unconscious. The woman says,Oh, I never get angry. So how can you recognize covert anger? Usually the only wayto recognize it in yourself is by looking back at something and realizing that you wereangry but not conscious of it. Sometimes you can recognize it in other people when theydont seem to be acting normally in situations that would understandably incite anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example of such a situation would be indifference toward the death of a loved one.Anger, if not expressed directly, is turned against the self. Any anger that is held in willeventually express itself in the form of depression. Indirect anger will lead to agitateddepression, and covert anger will lead to retarded depression
