        Set (Seth, Setekh, Sut, Sutekh, Sety) was one of the most ancient of the Egyptian gods and the focus of worship since the
        <a href="predynlist.html">
         Predynastic Period
        </a>
        . As part of the
        <a href="ennead.html">
         Ennead
        </a>
        of Heliopolis he was the son of
        <a href="nut.html">

        and
        <a href="geb.html">

        and
        <a href="nephthys.html">
         Nephthys
        </a>
        . He was a storm god associated with strange and frightening events such as eclipses, thunderstorms and earthquakes. He also represented the desert and, by extension, the foreign lands beyond the desert. His glyph appears in the Egyptian words for "turmoil", "confusion", "illness", "storm" and "rage". He was considered to be very strong but dangerous, and strange. However, he was not always considered to be an evil being. Set was a friend of the dead, helping them to ascend to heaven on his ladder, and he protected the life giving oases 
of the desert, and was at times a powerful ally to the pharaoh and even the sun god

     The earliest representation of Set can be found on a carved ivory comb from the Amratian period (Naqada I, 4500BC - 35BC, orthodox dates) and he also appears on the famous Scorpion mace head. His worship seems to have originated in one of the most ancient settlements in the town of Nubt (Kom Ombo), in upper (southern) Egypt. Nubt (near modern Tukh) lies near the entrance to the Wadi Hammammat, the doorway to the eastern desert and its gold deposits, and the city took its name from the word for
     <a href="colouryellow.html">
      gold
     </a>
     , Nbt (which also means ruler or lord). As a result Set was sometimes called "He of gold town". Nubt was the most important of the ancient settlements, and was located close to the site of the Naqqada settlement from which this early culture takes it name. Pre-dynastic worship of Set was also evident in the

     At this point in history, Set was clearly associated with
     <a href="nomesupper.html">
      Upper Egypt
     </a>
     and was a popular and esteemed god. However, by the Second Intermediate Period he was associated with the
     <a href="hyksos.html">
      Hyksos
     </a>
     (who probably saw a similarity between Set and Baal) and so he became seen as a force for evil. He was then "rehabilitated" during the
     <a href="newkingdom.html">
      Nineteenth Dynasty
     </a>
     pharaohs (notably Seti I whose name means "man of Set") only to be recast as an evil deity by Greek, Roman and Christian theologists.
    </p>
    <p>
     Set was the black boar who swallowed the moon each month, obscuring its light. He was also identified with the hippopotamus, crocodiles, scorpions, turtles, pigs and donkeys - all animals which were considered to be unclean or dangerous. Some fish were considered to be sacred to Set (most notably the Nile carp and the Oxyrynchus) as they had apparently eaten the penis of
     <a href="osiris.html">
      Osiris
     </a>
     after Set had dismembered the dead king. However, he was most often depicted as a "Set animal" or a man with the head of a "Set animal". The Set animal (sometimes known as a"Typhonian animal" because of the Greek identification with Typhon) is a dog or jackal like creature, but it is not clear whether it exactly represented an extinct species, or was a mythological beast uniquely associated with Set himself.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Osirian mythology he was married to
     <a href="nephthys.html">
      Nephthys
     </a>
     , but their marriage was not a happy one. However, Set had many other wives/concubines. According to one myth he lived in the Great Bear, a constellation in the northern sky - an area which symbolized darkness, and death. He was restrained with chains  and guarded by his wife
     <a href="tawret.html">
      Taweret
     </a>
     , the hippo goddess of childbirth. He was given the two foreign goddesses
     <a href="anat.html">
      Anat
     </a>
     and Astarte (war goddesses from the Syria-Palestine area and daughters of
     <a href="ra.html">
      Ra
     </a>
     ) as wives in compensation for
     <a href="maat.html">
      Maat's
     </a>
     (or
     <a href="neith.html">
      Neith's
     </a>
     ) ruling that
     <a href="horus.html">
      Horus
     </a>
     should rule Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, he had no children, despite being married to the goddess of childbirth and a Cannanite fertility goddess as well as
     <a href="nephthys.html">
      Nephthys
     </a>
     and
     <a href="neith.html">
      Neith
     </a>
     . This was considered to be very unconventional by the Egyptians. Not only was he infertile, but one of his testicles had been torn off by Horus when Set tore out Horus' eye. He only ate lettuce, which was sacred to the fertility god Min because it secreted a white, milky substance that the Egyptians linked to semen and he was considered to have odd sexual habits. He was bisexual, and tried (and failed) to rape both

        </a>
        ), if not always his ally. Horus represented the sky during the daytime, while Set represented the night time sky. When these two gods were linked, the two were said to be Horus-Set, a man with two heads - one of the hawk of Horus, the other of the Set animal.

     Although they fought, neither party could win and it was believed that they would continue to fight until the end of time when
     <a href="maat.html">
      Ma'at
     </a>
     was destroyed and the waters of
     <a href="nun.html">
      Nun
     </a>
     (chaos) engulfed the world. However, once Set had been recast as an evil entity, the story changed to record that Horus had won their battle, and thus good had triumphed over evil. Some historians have argued that the battle between Set and Horus was a mythological representation of the struggle to unite Egypt under one ruler. According to this theory, the followers of Horus were successful and so Set was pushed into the background.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is interesting to note that the pharaoh
     <a href="Sekhemib.html">
      Sekhemhib
     </a>
     displayed his name in a serekh topped by a Set animal, not a falcon (representing Horus), while
     <a href="Khasekhemwy.html">
      Khasekhemwy's
     </a>
     serekh included both a Set animal and a falcon. This has been taken as evidence that the battle between
     <a href="nomesupper.html">
      Upper
     </a>
     and
     <a href="nomeslower.html">
      Lower

     Egypt had been won and the ruler wished to appease both factions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as an infant he was dangerous and unpredictable. According to the
     <a href="pyramidtext.html">
      pyramid texts
     </a>
     he ripped himself violently from his mother's womb instead of being born normally like his siblings. Set was jealous of his brother
     <a href="osiris.html">
      Osiris
     </a>
     . Two reasons are given for this jealousy. The first is that
     <a href="osiris.html">
      Osiris
     </a>
     was made Pharaoh of Egypt after
     <a href="geb.html">
      Geb
     </a>
     resigned the throne. Set felt that he should have been given this accolade, and wished to usurp the throne. The second reason is that, according to one myth, his wife
     <a href="nephthys.html">
      Nephthys
     </a>
     tricked Osiris into having sex with her (by disguising herself as her sister
     <a href="isis.html">
      Isis
     </a>
     , the wife of Osiris), and bore him a son -
     <a href="anubis.html">
      Anubis
     </a>
     . Set was understandably unhappy about the situation but seems to have held his grudge against his (more handsome) brother Osiris rather than his unfaithful wife. Whatever the reason, Set decided 
that his brother had to die.
    </p>
    <p>
     He made a great feast, supposedly in honour of
     <a href="Osiris.html">
      Osiris
     </a>
     , and offered a beautifully carved chest to whichever guest would fit into it. Of course, the chest was built to fit Osisris, and when he lay down inside it, Set's followers nailed the lid shut and threw the chest into the Nile. Isis managed to find the chest and bring it back to Egypt. However, Set discovered the chest and dismembered the corpse of his brother, spreading the parts all over the country. Isis and Nepthys began their search for the pieces of Osiris, but his penis could not be found (because it was swallowed by a fish in the Nile). Undaunted, Isis reassembled the pieces and magically conceived her child, Horus. When he grew up he fought with Set, essentially adopting the position of
     <a href="heru-ur.html">
      Horus the Elder
     </a>
     as the enemy of Set. This of course, added to the confusion between
     <a href="heru-ur.html">
      Horus the Elder
     </a>
     and
     <a href="horuschild.html">
      Horus the son of Isis
     </a>
     and Set's 
role changed from being an equal to his brother Horus the Elder, to the evil uncle of his nephew Horus the child.

        Despite the role he was given in the death of
        <a href="Osiris.html">
         Osiris
        </a>
        , Set was considered to be the defender of the sun god

         Ra

         Apep
        </a>
        . Yet even when he was acting to protect Ra, the negative side of his personality was apparent. He often boasted that he was the only one of the gods brave enough to stand against
        <a href="apep.html">
         Apep
        </a>
        and demanded that he be treated with great respect. He even threatened Ra that if he was not treated well enough he would bring storms against him. Ra eventually tired of his taunting and expelled Set from his barque, relying on the help of the other gods to complete his nightly journey.

     He was thought to have white skin and red hair, and people with red hair were thought to be his followers. He was associated with the desert (which takes its name from the Egyptian word "dshrt" - the red place). He represented the fierce dry heat of the sun as it parched the land, and was infertile like the desert. Initially he probably represented the desert near Nubt, but soon he represented all deserts and foreign lands, becoming a god of overseas trade. Set had been associated with the desert and foreigners for some time before the
     <a href="hyksos.html">
      Hyksos
     </a>
     took over parts of lower Egypt. However, when they took him as their main god, this broke Set's association withLower Egypt. His name was erased from monuments and his statues destroyed. All of his negative attributes were emphasised and his positive side was ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Set's fortunes soon changed. The Pharaohs of the
     <a href="newkingdom.html">
      Nineteenth Dynasty
     </a>
     were from the Delta area where worship of Set was still popular. It is also interesting that both Seti I (who even named himself after Set) and Ramesses II seem to have had red hair. Although
     <a href="amun.html">
      Amun
     </a>
     was the state god, Set was more highly venerated in the Delta. Ramesses II's divided his army into four divisions, and named one after Set. When he fought the Hittities he was described as being "like Set in the moment of his power" and "like Set, great-of-strength". He even named his daughter Bint-Anat (Daughter of Anath, Set's wife).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Greeks associated Set with Typhon, the largest monster ever born. Typhon was the son of the Earth and Tartarus (the place of torture in Hades), and thoroughly evil. Both were storm gods associated with the colour red and with pigs (whose meat was considered to be unclean by many cultures including the Egyptians). However, unlike Typhon Set had a protective role and even in his negative aspects the Egyptians understood his place in the world. He was dangerous and unpredictable, but could be a powerful friend. During the
     <a href="greaco.html">
      Ptolemaic period
     </a>
     a temple to both Horus and
     <a href="sobek.html">
      Sobek
     </a>
     (who was often associated with Set as both took the form of a crocodile) was built south of Nubt and named Ombos (now known as Kom Ombos) after the god of the ancient city - Set.
