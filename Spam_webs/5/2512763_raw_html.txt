        Introduction
       </div>
      </a>
      Today I was fortunate enough to sneak out of work for a few hours to hear
His Holiness the Dalai Lama began a lecture on the Heart Sutra. This is a
three day class and I'm going to sneak out of some work tomorrow and
Attend Saturday during the day as well. I thought I'd share some of what
he said (as interpreted through my notes) with everyone.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Please forgive my spelling, my crutch... er, spell checker is not working
currently.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Tickets for the three day class were $150.  He also taught a class Saturday at 5:30
pm called "Peace through Inner Peace" and a "Medicine Buddha" class on
Sunday 9am at Shoreline in Mountain View. Tickets were available through
ticketmaster.com for the Shorelines event. Tickets for Sunday are $45 for lawn seats.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His Holiness started this morning talking about the diversity of
religions and then even the diversity of views within buddhism. This set
a backdrop for his history of the sutras, and how we end up with the
Heart Sutra and where it fits into the greater picture of Buddhist
scriptures. By the end of today, he had begun going through the Heart
Sutra line by line.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I want to point out that these are just my notes of H.H.'s lecture as seen through me.
All omissions and errors are most definitely mine.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I missed some of the afternoon session, couldn't sneak out of work for
the whole thing, but I'll summarize as much detail as I have.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a name="s1">
       <div class="h6">
        His Holiness Does Shoreline...
       </div>
      </a>
      The shoreline stage was decorated with a large backdrop picture of the
palace in Lhasa, with a small decorated throne like chair in front for
the fourteenth Dalai Lama to sit on. Thulka paintings hung on either side
of the stage, but it was a simple display. His Holiness sat on his seat,
with about 160 monks in crimson and orange robes seated facing him to
either side; they were there to hear his teachings too. I had a seat
assignment but found it more comfortable sitting in the shade on the
lawn. The sun was beating down on us painfully.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He started his lecture in English. He has a charming voice. He later
switched to Tibetan with the help of a translator so he would have the
strength to teach for all four days. The Secret Service mulled in and out
of the crowd, some in plain clothes but still with little ear microphones
and cords descending into their shirts. Some disguised as TV camera men
setup and appeared to be taping His Holiness but they were really taping
the audience. I generally feel threatened by such security, but this time
I felt more thankful for their presence. They were protecting him. No
pagers, cell phones, cameras, or binoculars were allowed. Metal detectors
lined the entrance for more security. In a way this was really nice, we
had to "let go" of these possessions before coming to class.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a name="s2">
       <div class="h6">
        Diversity
       </div>
      </a>
      The majority of people, His Holiness believes, are not part of a faith
religion currently. Yet there are positive qualities which faith religion
has helped us promote in ourselves. We must consider new ways to promote
those same positive qualities, for so many which are not part of a
religious tradition.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many faith religions have complicated and evolved philosophical bases,
some have deep ethical bases, but all seem to have a dimension that is
metaphysical or philosophical explaining "why" or "what is." They also
typically have a second dimension that is ethical derived from the first
dimension. The many religions have much diversity in the first dimension,
but most arrive at a similar ethical endpoint in some way encompassing
love and compassion, etc.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Why is there diversity between many religion's philosophical bases? The
Buddha's teachings are diverse. The Buddha believed that there was an
appropriateness to each teaching to the recipient. He taught differently
to different people, what was suitable for each. By judging the
effectiveness of a teaching to a recipient, one can be effective. It is
like in medicine, picking the right remedy and strength for an individual
patient. Although a specific medicine may be a good medicine and potent,
it may not be appropriate for that patient and may do harm instead of
good. With this understanding it is easy to see how different religions
serve different recipients. Having many religions is important given the
diversity of peoples. With this understanding, the appreciation for
diversity is increased. It is important to realize that other religious
traditions serve millions of people.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Each religion has a unique perspective and strengths. A Christian brother
pointed out that the growth of monasteries in Nepal over the last thirty
or forty years. But there has not been an increase in schools or
hospitals, which is a shame. If those were Christian monasteries, there
would be many more schools and hospitals. A Buddhist can only respond
that "yes, that is true."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many Christians are interested in the Buddhist concept of Emptiness. H.H.
warns that this is somewhat of a Buddhist business and perhaps they
should not go deeply into it.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Many people here today may be pursuing a path that is grounded both in
Christianity and Buddhism, but at a certain point we must specialize in
one or the other. Like in teaching, one after a certain point must dive
in deep into a specialty.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We've talked about the diversity of religions being a valid viewpoint,
but how is this reconciled with the idea that there is only one truth or
one valid religion. H.H. does not see a problem here. one truth/one
religion is valid from the perspective of the individual, many
truths/faiths is valid in the context of the greater society.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a name="s3">
       <div class="h6">
        Buddhist Perspective
       </div>
      </a>
      There are two world camps. One is theistic - with a creator - and one is
non-theistic - without a creator. Buddhism, Jainism, and one branch of
Samkia fall into the latter. In this second branch, there are two camps.
One accepts that there is an eternal principle, a unitary, unchanging
principle of self or "atma" or soul. The other camp is Buddhism, which
rejects this concept of soul. Also there is a distinction around
reincarnation, which Buddhism believes. And there is a distinction of
salvation being in the physical plane or not - and Buddhism believes that
salvation is from the point of view of a state of mind, on the physical
plane.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      These teachings this weekend, are from the Buddhist perspective.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There are three camps on the chronology of Buddhism, when did the first
Buddha give his teachings and live. One camp says 2500 years ago, another
over 3000 years, and a third says 2900 years. H.H. believes this is
somewhat of a heresy that we do not really know when Buddha came to the
world. He has suggested that we use modern techniques to test relics and
conclude this. &lt;the audience laughs...&gt;
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The Buddha Sukyamuni endured many hardships and lived for six years as an
ascetic. All leaders of religions pursued the spiritual path through
hardship. There is a lesson here. If people follow the spiritual path of
their faith, they should expect hardship too. There is often a belief
among Buddhist monks that although the Buddha went through these
hardships, that they will not need to. This is wrong.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      His Holiness then spent time talking about Buddha's first teaching, about
the four noble truths and the 37 aspects of the path to enlightenment. I
couldn't write down all the details on the 37 aspects, but I did catch
that there are two major categories of this approach:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <ul>
       <li>
        single point of mind
       </li>
       <li>
        penetrative insight
       </li>
      </ul>
      The principle obstacles for attaining these two qualities are an
excitement or laxity of the mind. The practices and traditions in
Buddhism aim at overcoming these obstacles, of stripping the mind of the
distracting objects. The 37 aspects are grouped as a progression, the
first developing a foundation of mindfulness, which leads to an
enthusiasm allowing development of the next aspects: reducing harmful
acts and encouraging positive actions. Then comes skill development to
enhance your focus and capacity to concentrate on a single object - which
helps develop faculties and spiritual strengths... leading to the ability
to apply the eight practices of enlightenment.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a name="s4">
       <div class="h6">
        The Scriptures
       </div>
      </a>
      His Holiness spent a fair amount of time describing the different
scriptures, including the first turning of the wheel of dharma: the
direct teachings of Buddha, the second turning of the wheel of dharma:
the sanskrit sutras for perfection wisdom, and the third turning of the
wheel of dharma: the later teachings of perfection wisdom. These later
teachings were for students of the mahayana path, who were not suitable
for hearing the earlier teachings of Emptiness, for they were at risk for
falling into Nihilism. The first set of sutras from this third turning of
the wheel were for them. The second set of sutras were about clarity of
mind plus arguments about the authenticity of the mahayana scriptures in
general. There must have been doubts about their authenticity because
they were not well known.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      H.H. spent more time explaining the arguments for the authenticity of the
mahayana teachings. The chief argument was this: there were only a few
years in which time the Buddha attained wisdom and then enlightenment.
There are two aspects involved that are separate. The continuum of
consciousness which attains enlightenment and the negative aspects of
mind which must be reduced through wisdom. The latter has an antidote in
the teachings and attainment of wisdom, which is only a matter of time.
The former is not something attained through accumulation of wisdom, so
it is unreasonable that Buddha developed enlightened consciousness in six
years -- there must be a continuum of consciousness which preexists and
continues. Therefore, later scripts written can have the same validity as
the original instruction.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      How we as practitioners validate the teachings however the reverse of
this. First came the authentic scriptures - directly from the Buddha.
Then came the authentic commentary about the scriptures, then came the
authentic teachers - actualized / realized teachers. Then spiritual
experiences grew in the practitioners. This is the progression of
Buddhism. But in validating these teachings the reverse is true.
Practitioners need a degree of authentic experience first. For example,
as we practice Bodhicitta [Ed: open or loving heart] we can feel in our
heart the ordinary spiritual experience. It has an impact. It leaves a
change. It gives us a taste - and we can develop a sense of validity for
the teachings of the Lamas and develop a conviction for that validity.
This is the only way open for us. Inference is blind, and can only touch
tangible objects through some direct experience.

        Heart Sutra
       </div>
      </a>
      H.H. then spoke more specifically about the sutras, their translation
from sanskrit to tibetan and the validity of that translations. Their
structure and organization.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      He then began talking about the sutra, in what appeared to be a line by
line fashion. Here are some random scribbling of notes, I couldn't quite
follow it line by line like that:
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In the sutra, Buddha is described as someone who has "conquered" the four
mayas or obstructive forces. He entered into the "profound" - the
emptiness or way that things really are - because of his wisdom and its
focus on attaining enlightenment. He was a bodhisattva which translates
to "enlightened hero" and in tibetan has another word for bodhisattva
translates into two different terms than "enlightened" and "hero", but
into "realization of knowledge" and "overcoming negativity". The term
itself implies the key qualities: always with compassion, always with an
eye to all sentient beings with compassion.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This endeavor is the engagement of the perfection of wisdom.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There are three kinds of scriptures, those spoken by the Buddha, those
approved by the Buddha, and those inspired by the Buddha. The Heart Sutra
is the third kind. It is written as a commentary between two monks, one
the direct disciple of Buddha (or those using his name), inspired by the
Buddha.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Any noble son or daughter who wishes to engage in the perfection of
wisdom should train in this way."

        Gender
       </div>
      </a>
      H.H. then took a minute to talk about gender. He feels that the original
principles, and then later the monastic principles, do not include any
distinction of gender. In fact, the monastic tradition has ordination for
both men and for women. But there is differences in the position of fully
ordained men and women. This is not a bias based on the fundamental
principles, but on the current monastic tradition based on the culture
which it is based in. Perhaps this tradition should be looked at
carefully now. &lt;applause from the audience&gt;
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Some have asked, "Why don't you - the Dalai Lama - decree that women be
equal." But our tradition is one of consensus of the entire monastic
tradition and not decree.

        Heart Sutra (continued)
       </div>
      </a>
      "Noble son" implies an inclination or motivation to pursuit of attainment
of enlightenment. This includes some qualities of the individual like a
modest desire, a sense of contentment, etc.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The pollutants which obscure our vision of reality are separable. And
they are based on an erroneous view that there is a basis of substance.
It is this erroneous view that leads us to attach, cause emotional
affliction, and so on. Focusing on recognizing the natural emptiness of
the mind, practicing the natural nirvana, begins to unravel the erroneous
views. That leads to the true nirvanas, including the final Buddha
nirvana where the duality between samsara and nirvana also drops away.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "They should seek incessantly, repeatedly, that even the five aggregates
are devoid of substance".
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There is an emphasis on "even". So too that a person made up of the five
aggregates are devoid of substance. So too the "I" reading this is devoid
of substance, and all the elements of the "I" including the mind are
devoid of intrinsic existence. Even the emptiness itself is devoid of
intrinsic existence. So too are the Buddhas who have attained nirvana
devoid of substance.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "So... have we arrived at the point where nothing exists?", His Holiness
chuckled. "Even I who is experiencing this hot sun am not here? Yet we
still feel that something is there, that can be felt, that we can hold."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Because of the difficulty of these concepts of emptiness and what we
experience, we see the diversity of thought even in the non-theistic
traditions. There are those that believe in soul or atma and even in
Buddhism those that believe in no-self in reference to phenomenon, and so
on.

        Closing Day 1
       </div>
      </a>
      At this point the day was at an end, and His Holiness thanked us and said
we would continue tomorrow morning. And when he stood the entire audience
stood in respect, as we had done at lunch so he could leave first out of
respect. But instead of walking out with his handlers, he walked to the
front of the stage and raised his hands together and he bowed to us.
