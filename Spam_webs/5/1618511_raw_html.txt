Its a utopian dream, not based on the Gospels, always monstrous when attempted, and premised more on resentment than godly generosity, writes Tooley. But its a message that will always have an audience in a covetous world.

                  When asked whether a Christian can join Occupy Wall Street in good conscience, televangelist Pat Robertson said no and, possibly confused on the motives behind the movement, urged that Christians instead should demonstrate to lift the yoke of oppression rather than join a movement he called

Well, is it right for a Christian to get involved in a protest of anger? If youre going to demonstrate, demonstrate for righteousness, demonstrate to lift the yoke of oppression, demonstrate to help those that are poverty stricken. But dont just go out and mess up a park and just scream and tear up things. Why would you get involved in something like that? Its formless, it has no purpose, but it could be used for radicals who want to destroy this nation, and thats the bad part of it.

Encampments in major cities, including Washington, DC, are not only a nuisance, a health hazard and an embarrassment [sic] to thinking Americans, they are increasingly becoming violent. Ideological anarchists intimidate and abuse bystanders, damage automobiles, jump on and in front of moving vehicles, urinate and defacate [sic] on private and public property, go naked and perform sex acts in public, produce tons of garbage that taxpayers have to collect and haul away, etc. Yet the mainstream press, which villainized [sic] the Tea Party movement, after long ignoring it, flagrantly idealizes the Occupiers and ignores the damage and ugly crimes happening in most places where an occupation is in progress. Fortunately the movement is "losing its bloom," and beginning to die out. The honeymoon among these diverse activists may be coming to an end.

                  One of the biggest smears of the Occupy Wall Street movement has been the claim that the activists are anti-Semites motivated by a hatred of Jews. Conservative groups such as the Emergency Committee for Israel have played and replayed footage of a few people who attended one rally making anti-Semitic remarks, and claimed that the despicable comments of a handful of protestors speak for the whole movement.

                  that these claims of anti-Semitism are dishonest and deceptive and are an attempt to use the words of a few fringe protestors to cast aspersions on a burgeoning and diverse movement: There are a few Jew-baiters at Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan, though they are marginal, particularly compared to the large numbers of Jewish activists taking part. Yet the leaderless, diffuse nature of the movement, in some ways its greatest strength, also makes it hard to police bigots, bullies, and cranks.

                  Whether it's the Occupy Wall Street protesters, rioters in Greece, public workers defacing the State Capitol in Madison, Wis., or thugs tearing down the city of Oakland, brick by brick, they are all focused on the same objective: equal distribution of wealth and a classless society. They may not use the word communism, but communism is precisely what they yearn for.

                  Nevertheless, Obama and his class-warfare pals can win. The more obvious their failure becomes, the more angry and panicked the wealth redistributors, especially in Washington, D.C., will be. Their bull slinging is easy enough to laugh off, but if it doesn't work  if it becomes clear that the Democrats are going down to defeat in 2012  look for them to go to their weapon of last resort and use brute force to "temporarily" suspend elections.

The economic justice movement has brought attention to not only the issue of the massive influx of corporate money in politics but also the countrys exacerbating income inequality and the continued lack of accountability and oversight on Wall Street.

                  Naturally, the Right sees Occupy Wall Street as a threat not just to their political standing but also their financial interests, and right-wing politicians and media outlets are doing all they can to dismiss and demonize Occupy Wall Street. The right has charged the movement with attempting to spark a violent revolution, dismissed the protesters as non-ideological, lazy whinerswho happen to be anti-Semitic Communists, and even claimed that the movement is anti-Christian.

                  After trumpeting and funding tea party protests for over a year, the Radical Right has suddenly lost its appetite for public demonstrations. Many of the advocates who vocally supported the tea party movement now claim that rallies are breeding grounds for violence.

                  , in a blog post promoted by Tea Party Nation, Appeals to freedom of speech have their limits when it comes to efforts to undermine and destroy the nation. Caruba charged:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  You don't solve unemployment by embracing tyranny.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Further back in history, one recalls the mobs that brought down the Weimar Republic in Germany and opened the doors to the Nazi movement. Earlier, mobs led by Bolsheviks deposed the Russian czar and imposed some seventy years of Communist control there. It is not surprising, therefore, that so many communist organizations and nations support the Occupy movement or that Wall Street is its target.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  In time we shall learn who the organizers of this spontaneous movement truly have been, but for now public safety must be asserted to rid Zuccotti Park of this gang of useful idiots and wherever else they show up.

Even though right-wing activists malign Occupy Wall Street demonstrators as both violent mobs and lazy slackers, conservatives contend that the movement is promoting communism in its call for corporate accountability.
