       We must take care NOT to meet the onslaught of terrible tragedies, the multiple people like Ezell Ford being killed by police each day, by becoming monsters ourselves. Rather, we must meet it bravely with love, sympathy and thoughtfulness, and a desire to change the system not scapegoat and hate other human beings. When we achieve that, I think it becomes clear to us that the problem is systemic. [...]

        What kind of sick person could be happy or satisfied in this world?!
       </strong>
       This world in which children starve by the thousands each day? In which billions live in absurd poverty? In which homes sit vacant next to the homeless and food sits expiring on shelves down the street from the starving? In which millions of nonviolent people rot in prisons for twisted political and financial reasons, marijuana possessors for instance? In which millions if not billions want jobs but are denied them. In which millions or billions of people including children want education but are denied? In which oil wars and racism and misplaced hate and violent destructive profiteering plague all? A world in which there is more than enough food to feed the hungry and more than enough resources to provide food, clothes, clean water, shelter, healthcare and education to everyone, but in which so many people go without not because of their own laziness and not by their own choice but for no good reason and through no fault of their own.

       Every human life is valuable and the killing of it deserves to at least be questioned.

       I believe it is in most people's self-interest to help others, not only because others may return the favor, but also because we naturally love each other. We empathize and sympathize with each other. We feel good when we observe others feeling good. [...]

       [...] the intrinsic conflict of happiness manifests as the pervasive inner-conflict of humans, which we often call the human condition. That inner-conflict explains why omnipotence would not make a human happy and why too much power and pleasures tend to drive a person insane. [...]

       I would not have our hearts break any less for any one of those poor children at Sandy Hook, the dead and the unimaginably scarred living.

       Many try to brush off incidents like these by blaming the victim, often with calling them a criminal as if criminal means bad person. We see this throughout the country with statist-sympathizers saying things like, "Breathe easy; don't break the law," or "instead of criticizing the police, stop breaking the law". Of course, that is nothing but a plain fallacy, unjustifiably mixing up the concept of 'criminal' with the concept of a 'bad guy'. However, let's not forget that Martin Luther King was a criminal. Henry David Thoreau was a criminal. Rosa Parks was a criminal. The Germans who hid Jews in their attic were criminals. [...]

Whether you believe this love is endowed by a godly creator or not, let yourself act on that quintessential love. By helping others you help yourself. [...]
