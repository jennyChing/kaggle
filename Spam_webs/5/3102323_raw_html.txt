       ICD-10 was scheduled to make its grand debut in October 2014. To the great relief of physicians and medical office administrators everywhere, that date has been delayed by a year. Even so, the ICD-10 code set is imminent  and theres not much that can stop it. 

While transition to ICD-10 is good thing  and long overdue  it doesnt mean it is going to be easy. There are sure to be quirks to work out as adjustments are made. To ensure downtime and delays in billing can be kept to a minimum, you should prepare your office well in advance.
       <h3>
        Why Switch?
       </h3>
       The ICD-9 code set is about three decades old. While it has been expanded many times, current medical knowledge, techniques, and treatments have made the code set almost obsolete. Moreover, it would be impossible to update ICD-9 in a way that is both workable and understandable and still include every diagnosis and treatment that it needs to. That is why the ICD-10 code set is needed  it adds in excess of 50,000 new codes over the ICD-9 set.

The transition to ICD-10 is not voluntary. All medical-related practices and services covered by HIPPA must switch to the new coding system in October 2015, and some non-HIPPA entities will as well. Any healthcare provider, clearinghouse, or payer not using ICD-10 at that time will have their transactions rejected as non-compliant. CMS ICD-10 training will be absolutely crucial as the date of implementation draws nearer in order to minimize complications and downtime.

Providers who are using Version 5010 standards will have an easier time making the transition than providers who do not, since 5010 is compatible with ICD-10 codes. Since Version 5010 has been required for all electronic claims since 2012, the only providers who might have a problem with this are those who do not submit claims electronically. Ensuring the use of Version 5010 is a good first step toward making the transition, but certainly not the only one.

       <h3>
        Preparing for the Transition to ICD-10
       </h3>
       <img src="http://www.vistacollegepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ICD-10-2.png" style="float:left; margin: 0 15px 15px 0;"/>
       Obtaining a good CMS ICD-10 implementation guide for all pertinent personnel members will be essential. Before you can take meaningful steps toward making a plan, you will need education about what the new code set will require. It may take several weeks for all staff members to understand the new requirements, so be sure to allow ample time for learning. If you can, enroll in a training course or a self-guided study in your practice.

When everyone has a clear picture of ICD-10s requirements, its time to come up with a plan. Youll want to assess the probable impact that the implementation will have on your practice. You will also want to brainstorm ways to minimize problems. For example, if you expect the switch will be particularly disruptive, you might consider closing your practice to appointments for several days as the implementation date draws near.

Because the transition to ICD-10 will affect virtually everyone with whom you communicate regarding billing, it will be vital to talk to those entities and find out what their implementation plans are. The software you choose will need to be compatible with the software of your billing service or clearinghouse. Glitches and setbacks are bound to happen, but some of these can be avoided simply by opening a line of communication among your peers and partners.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Making a Plan
       </h3>
       <p>
       </p>
       <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ICD-10-3.jpg"/>
       <p>
       </p>
       In all likelihood, making a plan for becoming compliant with the ICD-10 code set will be an ongoing event. The most important factors youll want to consider are your budget for new software, equipment, staff, contracted specialists, and timeline for implementation. 

Compliance date may seem like its far off, but you should not procrastinate in preparing for the switch. Failure to accurately assess just how long implementation will take could force you to shut down until you are compliant or else not be reimbursed for services rendered.

Its a good idea to designate a project leader to handle the majority of planning. You might choose yourself, another experienced physician, a physicians assistant, the office manager, or another administrative staff member. Whoever you choose, the leader should have total access to all aspects of the practice.

This person can be wholly dedicated to learning about ICD-10 requirements and how they relate to your practice. All staff members, from physicians to receptionists, will need to know the basic aspects of the new coding standards, but not all staff members need to know everything. Planning is likely to be much more efficient when there is a team with a leader who can delegate tasks and assign training on an as-needed basis.

With regard to establishing a timeline, it can be helpful to work backwards from the date of compliance. Be sure to allow plenty of time between phases for setbacks, such as network outages and software bugs. The quicker you can put a plan into action, the less stressful and hectic the transition to ICD-10 is likely to be. If you begin early and take gradual steps, you can ensure plenty of time to deal with unexpected snags, as well as allow your staff to acclimate to smaller changes over a period of time.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Financing Your Transition
       </h3>
       Theres no question that the transition to ICD-10 will be costly for everyone involved. How costly will depend largely on the size and type of your practice, the amount of equipment and software that youll need to purchase, and the possible addition of new staff members, whether permanent or temporary. 

When establishing a strategy for the transition, youll need to know what you can realistically support from a financial standpoint versus what your ideal solutions are. If you have a general fund for upgrades, youre probably already off to a good start. If your cash flow and expenses are managed on more of a monthly or quarterly basis, youll need to start budgeting now for the extra expenses.

This is another benefit of planning early and implementing gradually  you wont have to cover all of the costs all at once. Even so, these funds must be secure and earmarked for compliance, whether theyre coming out of a specified fund or being managed on an as-needed basis.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Preparing the Billing Staff
       </h3>
       <p>
       </p>
       <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ICD-10-4.jpg"/>
       <p>
       </p>
       You may find that it is more economical and efficient to hire additional personnel who have special CMS ICD-10 training, particularly if you handle all of your billing internally. The ICD-10 code set is designed to have a familiar feel to it, but it is still a completely new standard containing several additional characters over the old code. 

If your budget will not allow for specialists, youll want to be sure your entire billing department participates in CMS ICD-10 training specific to billing practices. Furthermore, youll want to start this training as early as possible to give your staff plenty of time to adjust, especially if your staff is well seasoned in ICD-9 practices. During the transitional period, your staff will have to switch between both code sets, which has the potential to become quite confusing. The more time they have to learn, the easier the final switch will be.

If you use a third-party billing agency, youll need to find out what their compliance protocol will be. That way you can coordinate your strategies. Keep in mind that third parties usually have many clients so it will be much easier for healthcare practices to conform with their plans than it would be the other way around. If you simply do not like the proposed protocol or cannot find a workable way to implement a system that works with theirs, you may need to find a different agency or consider bringing your billing internal.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Assess Your Current Systems, Software and Hardware
       </h3>
       It is possible that you wont need to invest in as many new items as you initially believed. Take a hard look at what you already have implemented and make an assessment of every single system that may be affected by the new ICD-10 code set requirements. 

Can your current LAN support the software you need? Is your current software compatible with the new standards? If it is, you may not need a completely new system  only upgrades to your current system. Depending on your vendor or software provider and the license you have, these upgrades may already be covered. Check before you purchase something totally different.

Hiring a networking specialist or IT professional can be a good investment before deciding on the route youll take. He or she can help you determine the most cost-effective solutions that your current setup can handle before you make an investment in items that you dont need or cannot use. Additionally, this professional may be able to help you optimize current issues that can make your practice run more smoothly, such as boosting computer performance and speed and maximizing communication between stations.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Test Everything Well in Advance
       </h3>
       <p>
       </p>
       <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ICD-10-5.jpg"/>
       <p>
       </p>
       As the structure of your strategy begins to take form, its important you test each aspect and addition intensively. While theres no way to really know how your new system will perform in a live situation, simulations can be incredibly useful in working out glitches and bugs before you are required to be compliant. This can significantly reduce the amount of lost productivity and delayed payments after implementation. 

Each practice will have to determine its own methods of testing as there is no one-size-fits all solution. You may choose to have occasional drill or practice days, such as a half-day on Saturdays or specific week days where you minimize the number of appointments. This can give your staff a chance to practice using the new coding standards without significantly impacting the operations of your practice. Encourage staff members to make notes of challenges they faced and items they dont understand. That way youll know which areas need more attention.

Certain components will require more intensive testing than others. For example, training staff to use a new medical records software program by giving them hands-on experience will likely not be as disruptive as installing a completely new system or upgrading a server. Try to schedule changes that are likely to bring productivity to a halt on light load days or on days during which you are not open for business. Obviously a hospital will not be able to completely shut down, whereas a dental practice could. Keep this in mind when making your plan and testing your new setup.

Start testing transmissions with payers and clearinghouses as early as possible. Privately owned entities may have varying options for doing this. Medicaid and Medicare will be opening up a readiness testing platform, but only for a few days  and you must be registered to participate. Find out the protocol for your area and register to take advantage of it.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Educate Everyone
       </h3>
       Outside the obvious CMS ICD-10 training that will be required, youll likely have to spend some time educating non-clinical staff members about various aspects of human anatomy, physiology, diagnoses and procedures. Because the ICD-10 code set is specifically designed to offer more details about these aspects of care than ever before, terminology that non-clinical staff are not normally familiar with will become more commonplace. 

It is worth providing extra education and training to these staff members to ensure a smooth transition. After all, it is difficult to enter the correct codes for diagnoses and procedures you arent familiar with. Youll want to prevent stopping to ask the physician or physicians assistant what certain notes mean. This would have negative effects on overall productivity. To streamline the transition, you will need ongoing training and education  but it will be worth the effort in the long term.
       <p>
       </p>
       <h3>
        Commit to the Change
       </h3>
       While there may be great temptation to map current codes over to the ICD-10 code set rather than completely relearning the standards, it is in everyones best interest not to take shortcuts. While some ICD-9 codes, especially those which were added late, may transfer over well, others will not. The new standards were designed to be as similar to the old as possible in terms of category and familiarity  however, it is a totally new code set for a reason: its is notably different than the old code set.
 
Its important that everyone  from the chief physician to the administrative staff  understand the transition to ICD-10 will not be a quick and easy one. Since its not going away, however, the quicker that everyone commits to learning how to implement and use the new system, the fewer headaches there will be on everyones part. There is no denying this transition will be a challenge. Everyone must unlearn the old system while still using it. At the same time, they must also learn a completely new one before being allowed to use it. 

For that reason, you should consider enrolling your entire staff in a
       <a href="/healthcare/icd-10/">
        ICD-10-CM training program
       </a>
       , such as the one offered by Vista College Pro. The course is conveniently online, cost effective, and counts toward everyones Continuing Education Credits. It shows students how to use their current ICD-9 knowledge with the new system, while also letting go of knowledge that is no longer relevant. Its a valuable resource for anyone in the healthcare industry and we encourage you to learn more about it today.
