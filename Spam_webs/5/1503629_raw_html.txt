         <em>
          To assist the Abbott Government with its communication woes, Ben Pobjie has prepared this Semi-Official Glossary of Government Terminology, Jargon, and Democratic Phraseology.
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no doubt that the current Australian Government is having some communication problems: it just doesn't seem to be able to get the populace to take its message on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        This must be incredibly frustrating for Tony Abbott and his team, especially given that, in keeping with a tradition that goes back over 100 years, this is not at all the Government's fault.
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem is, simply, that the voters refuse to educate themselves. The Australian people are wilfully neglecting their democratic duty to learn what the government is all about. If they only understood exactly what government ministers mean when they say things, it would clear everything up and the Coalition agenda would be proceeding a lot more smoothly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, there is no excuse anymore, because I have taken it upon myself to provide a helpful guide to governmental messaging. Please find hereunder the Semi-Official Glossary of Government Terminology, Jargon, and Democratic Phraseology: a list of common terms used by Coalition MPs and their meanings in plain English. Here we go.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Cuts:
        </strong>
        not cuts.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Not cuts:
        </strong>
        cuts (see above).
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Budget Emergency:
        </strong>
        Julia Gillard wants you dead.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Direct Action:
        </strong>
        "Oooh, global warming! I'm soooooo scared!"
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Climate change:
        </strong>
        "Oh God, shut UP already! You are SO boring."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Coal:
        </strong>
        The provider, the sustainer of life, that which makes us whole and grants us our humanity, the essence of love and the elixir of happiness.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Minister for Education:
        </strong>
        A sort of high-pitched whining sound, like imagine someone who doesn't know how to play the clarinet but is trying to anyway? Like that.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Lower taxes:
        </strong>
        "My calculator needs a new battery."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "Nothing but bush":
        </strong>
        "Deep and abiding concern for the plight of Indigenous peoples to the point where sometimes I even talk to some of them."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Indigenous Australians:
        </strong>
        Australians who are from Australia, like Slim Dusty or Alf from Home and Away.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Illegal arrivals:
        </strong>
        People who try to come to Australia without going through the proper channels. Or people who try to come to Australia by going through the proper channels. Or just generally anyone who looks like they might drive property values down.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "On-water operations"
        </strong>
        : "The sea is a strange and fickle mistress. Who can really tell what mysteries she holds? Some things man is not meant to know."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Australian values:
        </strong>
        They are far too numerous to list here, but wow, they are pretty great. There are some absolutely just fantastic values we have and we will be getting around to informing you of them in due course.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Media balance:
        </strong>
        When a paper has the guts to publish both Greg Sheridan AND Janet Albrechtsen vehemently disagreeing with each other over what the Prime Minister's best feature is.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Unions:
        </strong>
        "A pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the world, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."

           Thank you Ben for a very entertaining take on the idiots we have in Govt.. No wonder the electorate have no idea what the politicians mean when they use double talk like you have shown.
           <br/>
           The biggest problem is that when they use it they also effectively bamboozle themselves to such an extent they also can't understand what they are saying, so they try &amp; cover it up with lies.

           I really like the ABC site for reading some well thought out, interesting and even witty articles.  Unfortunately, it seems that Ben Pobjie is devoid of any of these attributes based on this article and his past contributions - what a waste of time.

             Give it a rest, pointless.
             <br/>
             Of course, when he gives out a guide to Bill Shorten's jokes, it will be great, won't it?

             It's a comedy piece, designed to lighten people up.

               Absolutely not - I am loathed to think that the ABC would allow Ben to move ahead with his proposed next piece about Bill Shorten.  The fact that this writer is not funny or entertaining is quite removed from political persuasions.  Your assumption that I have a problem with the article (if that's what you want to call this terrible composition) because I'm an LNP supporter is extremely incorrect.  I just have a problem with very poor journalism - it detracts from what are usually the very high standards of the ABC.

             I hope the Salvos don't introduce any "price signal"... or the masses of starving poor under the Government Abbott leads may start getting some strange ideas about how to stay alive....

               At least they will be able to stay warm, under Gillard pensioners were too scared to use electricity because of the massive bills. Apparently government providing energy subsidies for millionaires and smashing the poor is a really good thing. Its just a pity that Abbott didn't do it.

               At least Abbott has not had to lower the integrity of the entire parliament by supporting a criminal just to retain power.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               At least he did not participate in a secret scheme to help a friend steal over $500K.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               At least he did not sell workers out to get a better deal for a union when his job was to protect the worker.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Whatever you might say of Abbott he is 10 times the person that Gillard or Shorten.

           GP co-payment: a tax collected by medicos to deter sick people from seeing medicos ; applies to specialists and pathologists and lots of other health professionals, but "GP" makes it sound less scary, and less than $21 if you have to see 3 medicos.
           <br/>
           Sometimes prefixed with $7, a minuscule amount to everybody except the sickly poor, and certainly more than the petrol excise the poor don't pay because they don't drive cars.
           <br/>
           The $7 figure was worked out on the back of an envelope and will rise, but will still be called the $7 co-payment.
           <br/>
           The $7 co-payment has been abandoned, but will be introduced.

             good thing there is a safety net in place for such people. Not that anybody would know thanks to the dishonest reporting from increasingly nasty left wing media.

               <br/>
               The so-called "safety net" was only a last-minute inclusion and is totally useless to the genuinely needy because it only kicks in after you paid the co-payment 10 times. If you can't afford to pay it once, the "safety net" is irrelevant to you.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Like most things the Tories come up with, the idea of a co-payment is not new. It has already been thoroughly investigated AND ABANDONED because of the extra pressure it would put on hospital emergency departments and the devastating impact it would have on the efforts of health professionals to shift the emphasis to preventative care and away from expensive and often unsuccessful responsive or restorative care. You know the sort of thing: the best way to manage your diabetes is not to get diabetes in the first place.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The co-payment idea raised by Abbott and Hockey has nothing to do with lowering the cost of health to the government. The money is not going to be spent on the health system - but being put in a so-called Medical Research Fund that a future Tory government can raid to fund electoral bribes a-la John Howard.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The principal aim of the co-payment is to weaken and ultimately dismantle the public heath system and, in particular Medicare. The Tories hate public health because it works and, in so doing, demonstrates the advantages of doing stuff for ourselves as a nation rather than contracting stuff out to the corporate sector. But they have a problem. The Australian people WANT a good public health system, and they have shown over and over again that they WANT universal health insurance and are prepared to fund it with their taxes. So Abbott cannot take any overt steps to dismantle public health in Australia. ANd this is where the co-payment comes in.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               The man is a total coward. If he had any guts at all he would dismantle public health and take the electoral consequences.

             Why are the ABC publishing him? Has it been a conservative tweeting the disgusting comment about Gillard, they would be up in arms in outrage. The left would be calling for boycotts, wreck the joint would be on a rampage.

             Strangely the left is silent. Lacking both the moral integrity and courage to call this grub out. Sadly given past behaviour of the ABC this comes as no surprise.

                 I would rather have the truth, thanks all the same.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 To be honest, I'm not all that impressed with formula-driven "comedy" pieces. I suppose that they provide a bit of light relief, but there is a depressing sameness in them. I would rather see more informative and scholarly work being published here. The only problem is that any serious analysis of the government's performance is likely to be met with howls of "ABC bias" and "Abbott bashing" from the Abbottjugend.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 The truth is never "balanced" - if it were, it would not be the truth.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 And how far do you take this "balance" thing anyway? Should anti-smoking advertisements be "balanced" by ads from Big Tobacco telling us how healthy and cool it is to inhale toxic fumes? Should nightly weather reports be "balanced" by the predictions of clairvoyants? Should comedians strain to find something negative to say about Bill Shorten every time Abbott makes a fool of himself?
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Balance is a really important thing if you happen to be crossing Niagara Falls on a tightrope. But when it comes to reporting the news and current affairs, I prefer the truth, however badly this may reflect on Abbott and his band of brigands.

                 v, you are making the assumption that all issues are black and white and right/wrong.  most government decisions are grey - how much funding for the ABC?  how much funding for medicare?  how much funding for welfare? how to deal with boat people?  there are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers to these (and i'm assuming we're not discussing no money for the ABC etc, just the appropriate level).
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 people naturally fall on either side of the fence, and note that both sides can claim truth in different respects.  so there is always a counter case in that grey and decisions typically come down to values and, unfortunately, making the least worst decisions.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 balance requires the counter case be shown/discussed and allowed in the debate and it rarely is.  we are not calling for balance to say smoking is good for you or any such thing.  but i suspect you know this.

                 The available evidence is that you, TheDumbMany and others are doing an Abbott misrepresentation, a Johnston rhetorical flush or a Turnball misapplication of context.

                 <br/>
                 Namely, you are falsely insinuating that Pobjie made a joke in bad taste about the death of Phillip Hughes.  If I am mistaken I am happy to be corrected by being pointed to evidence that shows otherwise.

                 anote, not at all.  the joke was in terrible taste pre the tragic death of phil hughes.  it's not good enough to say, the worst hadn't happened as yet.  he collapsed on the pitch, had cpr beside the field and then went into a coma.  unfortunately the worst was a very forseeable outcome and always a possibility given the circumstances.   so no, i am not misrepresenting what he ben did.  you can have your opinio and i have mine.  to me, that is just downright disgusting and he can take it like the big man he is.

                 Actually dangermouse, I can understand how Pobjie might have thought that the injury was not serious.  After all, to be as smart as he is, you have probably been repeatedly hit in the head by something at least as hard as a cricket ball.

                 Withdraw?  Are you serious?  Claiming that you were not aware of the possible consequences of such an injury is only a withdrawal if and only if your intellectual capacities prevent you from understanding simple concepts, such as serious head injuries can result in death, and only acceptable to those whose intellectual capacities allow them to think that is a reasonable excuse for someone who can clearly string more than two words together and still make sense.
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Oh yes, my apologies.  You are serious.

           Bullseye Ben. You have really got the LNP faithful up in arms.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           You'd think they would have realised by now what a joke Abbott's government is and yet there is another year and a half to go. What fun we will have deciphering whether or not there will be a $7 co-payment, or a PPL scheme, or what in heavens name their position really is on climate change, and the big one will Abbott still be the PM come election time.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The future is bright for those with a sense of humour but it really must be dreadful seeing your dreams of an Abbott dynasty going down in howls of giggles.

           Ben thanks for a brilliant glossary, I would like to add a few, if I may No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. = Cuts to education, cuts to health, changes to pensions, changes to the GST and cuts to ABC &amp; SBS.

             Didn't Abbott say something about 'We will do what we say, and say what we mean'.  I suppose this equates to 'We will do the opposite of what we say and we will say the opposite of what we mean, (if we say anything at all).

               No Cloud.  "We will say what we mean" means just that with the rider "...what you thought you heard me say wasn't what I said or, if it was (eg because someone taped it and can prove it was), it wasn't what I meant.
