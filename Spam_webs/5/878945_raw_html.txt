            Bioethics at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. He is the author 
            of
        <i>
         Animal Liberation

        , which can be considered the Bible of 
            the animal rights movement. Recently, he has been instrumental in 
            the formation of the
        <i>
         The Great Ape Project
        </i>
        , which seeks to 
            extend personhood and legal rights to the Geat Apes.

          extracts from 'In Defence of Animals':
         </b>
        </p>
        <p>
         Why do we lock up chimpanzees in appalling primate research centres 
              and use them in experiments that range from the uncomfortable to 
              the agonising and lethal, yet would never think of doing the same 
              to a retarded human being at a much lower mental level? The only 
              possible answer is that the chimpanzee, no matter how bright, is 
              not human, while the retarded human, no matter how dull, is.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is speciesism, pure and simple, and it is as indefensible 
              as the most blatant racism. There is no ethical basis for elevating 
              membership of one particular species into a morally crucial characteristic. 
              From an ethical point of view, we all stand on an equal footing 
              -- whether we stand on two feet, or four, or none at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         The animal liberation movement . . . is not saying that all lives 
              are of equal worth or that all interests of humans and other animals 
              are to be given equal weight, no matter what those interests may 
              be. It is saying that where animals and humans have similar interests 
              - we might take the interest in avoiding physical pain as an example, 
              for it is an interest that humans clearly share with other animals 
              - those interests are to be counted equally, with no automatic discount 
              just because one of the beings is not human. A simple point, no 
              doubt, hut nevertheless part of a far-reaching ethical revolution.

         The sphere of altruism has broadened from the family and tribe 
              to the nation, race, and now to all human beings. The process should 
              be extended ... to include all beings with interests, of whatever 
              species. But we cannot simply propose this as the ultimate ethical 
              standard and then expect everyone to act accordingly. We must begin 
              to design our culture so that it encourages broader concerns without 
              frustratiug important and relatively permanent human desires.

         various extracts from 'Animal Liberation':
        </b>
        <p>
         This book is about the tyranny of human over nonhuman animals. 
              This tyranny has caused and today is still causing an amount of 
              pain and suffering that can only be compared with that which resulted 
              from the centuries of tyranny by white humans over black humans. 
              The struggle against this tyranny is a struggle as important as 
              any of the moral and social issues that have been fought over in 
              recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing 
              to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature 
              of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering 
              be counted equally with the like suffering - in so far as rough 
              comparisons can be made - of any other being. If a being is not 
              capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, 
              there is nothing to be taken into account. So the limit of sentience 
              (using the term as a convenient if not strictly accurate shorthand 
              for the capacity to suffer and/or experience enjoyment) is the only 
              defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others. To mark 
              this boundary by some other characteristic like intelligence or 
              rationality would be to mark it in an arbitrary manner. Why not 
              choose some other characteristic, like skin color?
        </p>
        <p>
         The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater 
              weight to the interests of members of his own race when there is 
              a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another 
              race The sexist violates the principle of equality by favoring the 
              interests of his own sex. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests 
              of his own species to over ride the greater interests of members 
              of other species. The pattern is identical in each case.
        </p>
        <p>
         The practices discussed . . . involve . . . in one ease tens of 
              millions of animals, and in the other case, literally billions of 
              animals every year . . . we cannot pretend that we have nothing 
              to do with these practices. One of them - experimentation on animals 
              - is promoted by the government we elect, and largely paid for out 
              of the taxes we pay. The other - rearing animals for food - is possible 
              only because most people buy and eat the products of this practice. 
              That is why I have chosen to discuss these particular forms of speciesism. 
              They are the central ones. They cause more suffering to a greater 
              number of animals than anything else that humans do. To stop them 
              we must change the policies of our government, and we must change 
              our own lives, to the extent of changing our diet. If these officially 
              promoted and almost umversally accepted forms of speciesism can 
              he abolished, abolition of the other speciesist practices cannot 
              be far behind.

         How can a man who is not a sadist spend his working day heating 
              an unanesthetized dog to death, or driving a monkey into a lifelong 
              depression, and then remove his white coat, wash his hands, and 
              go home to dinner with his wife and children? How can taxpayers 
              allow their money to be used to support experiments of this kind? 
              And how can students go through a turbulent era of protest against 
              injustice, discrimination, and oppression of all kinds, no matter 
              how far from home, while ignoring the cruelties that are being carried 
              out on their own campuses?
        </p>
        <p>
         The answers to these questions stem from the unquestioned acceptance 
              of speciesism. We tolerate cruelties inflicted on members of other 
              species that would outrage us if performed on members of our own 
              species. Speciesism allows researchers to regard the animals they 
              experiment on as items of equipment, laboratory tools rather than 
              living, suffering creatures. -Sometimes they even refer to the animals 
              in this way. Robert White of the Cleveland Metropolitan General 
              Hospital, who has performed numerous experiments involving the transplanting 
              of heads of monkeys, and the keeping alive of monkey brains in fluid, 
              outside the body, has said in an interview that:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         Our main purpose here is to offer a laboratory tool: 
              a monkey "model" in which and by which we can design new operative 
              techniques for the brain.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         And the reporter who conducted the interview and observed White's 
              experiments found his experience
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         a rare and chilling glimpse into the cold, clinical world 
              of the scientist, where the life of an animal has no meaning beyond 
              the immediate purpose of experimentation. (Scope, Durban, S.A., 
              30.3.1973)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         This "scientific" attitude to animals was exhibited to a large 
              audience in December 1974 when the American public television network 
              brought together Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick and three scientists 
              whose work involves animals. The program was a follow-up to Fred 
              Wiseman 's controversial film Primate, which had taken viewers inside 
              the Yerkes Primate Center, a research center in Atlanta, Georgia. 
              Nozick asked the scientists whether the fact that an experiment 
              will kill hundreds of animals is ever regarded, by scientists, as 
              a reason for not performing it. One of the scientists answered: 
              "Not that 1 know of." Nozick pressed his question: "Don't the animals 
              count at all?" Dr A. Perachio, of the Yerkes Center, replied: "Why 
              should they?" While Dr D. Baltimore, of the Massachusetts Institute 
              of Technology, added that he did not think that experimenting on 
              animals raised a moral issue at all. ("The Price of Knowledge" broadcast 
              in New York 12.12.1974.)
        </p>
        <p>
         When are experiments on animals justified? Upon learning of the 
              nature of many contemporary experiments, many people react by saying 
              that all experiments on animals should be prohibited immediately. 
              But if we make our demands as absolute as this, the experimenters 
              have a ready reply: Would we be prepared to let thousands of humans 
              die if they could be saved by a single experiment on a single animal?
        </p>
        <p>
         This question is, of course, purely hypothetical. There never 
              has been and there never could be a single experiment that saves 
              thousands of lives. The way to reply to this hypothetical question 
              is to pose another: Would the experimenter be prepared to carry 
              out his experiment on a human orphan under six months old if that 
              were the only way to save thousands of lives?
        </p>
        <p>
         If the experimenter would not be prepared to use a human infant, 
              then his readiness to use nonhurnan animals reveals an unjustifiable 
              form of discrimination on the basis of species, since adult apes, 
              monkeys, dogs, eats, rats, and other mammals are more aware of what 
              is happening to them, more self-directing, and, so far as we can 
              tell, at least as sensitive to pain as a human infant. Ibid.
        </p>
        <p>
         At present scientists do not look for alternatives simply because 
              they do not care enough about the animals they are using.
        </p>
        <p>
         For most humans, especially those in modern urban and suburban 
              communities, the most direct form of contact with nonhuman animals 
              is at meal time: we eat them. This simple fact is the key to our 
              attitudes to other animals, and also the key to what each one of 
              us can do about changing these attitudes. The use and abuse of animals 
              raised for food far exceeds, in sheer numbers of animals affected, 
              any other kind of mistreatment. Hundreds of millions of cattle, 
              pigs, and sheep are raised and slaughtered in the United States 
              alone each year; and for poultry the figure is a staggering three 
              billion. (That means that about 5,000 birds - mostly chickens - 
              will have been slaughtered in the time it takes you to read this 
              page.) It is here, on our dinner table and in our neighborhood supermarket 
              or butcher's shop, that we are brought into direct touch with the 
              most extensive exploitation of other species that has ever existed.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a matter of strict logic, perhaps, there is no contradiction 
              in taking an interest in animals on both compassionate and gastronomic 
              grounds. If a person is opposed to the infliction of suffering on 
              animals, but not to the painless killing of animals, he could consistently 
              eat animals that had lived free of all suffering and been instantly, 
              painlessly slaughtered. Yet practically and psychologically it is 
              impossible to be consistent in one's concern for nonhuman animals 
              while continuing to dine on them. If we are prepared to take the 
              life of another being merely in order to satisfy our taste for a 
              particular type of food, then that being is no more than a means 
              to our end. In time we will come to regard pigs, cattle, and chickens 
              as things for us to use, no matter how strong our compassion may 
              be; and when we find that to continue to obtain supplies of the 
              bodies of these animals at a price we are able to pay it is necessary 
              to change their living conditions a little, we will be unlikely 
              to regard these changes too critically. The factory farm is nothing 
              more than the application of technology to the idea that animals 
              are means to our ends. Our eating habits are dear to us and not 
              easily altered. We have a strong interest in convincing ourselves 
              that our concern for other animals does not require us to stop eating 
              them. No one in the habit of eating an animal can be completely 
              without bias in judging whether the conditions in which that animal 
              is reared caused suffering.
        </p>
        <p>
         The people who profit by exploiting large numbers of animals do 
              not need our approval. They need our money. The purchase of the 
              corpses of the animals they rear is the only support the factory 
              farmers ask from the public. They will use intensive methods as 
              long as they continue to receive this support; they will have the 
              resources needed to fight reform politically; and they will be able 
              to defend thcmselvcs against criticism with the reply that they 
              are only providing the public with what it wants
        </p>
        <p>
         Hence the need for each one of us to stop buying the produce of 
              modern animal farming - even if we are not convinced that it would 
              be wrong to eat animals that have lived pleasantly and died painlessly. 
              Vegetarianism is a form of boycott. For most vegetarians the boycott 
              is a permanent one, since once they have broken away from flesh-eating 
              habits they can no longer approve of slaughtering animals in order 
              to satisfy the trivial desires of their palates. But the moral obligation 
              to boycott the meat available in butcher shops and supermarkets 
              is just as inescapable for those who disapprove only of inflicting 
              suffering, and not of killing. In recent years Americans have boycotted 
              lettuce and grapes because the system under which those particular 
              lettuces and grapes had been produced exploited farm laborers, not 
              because lettuce and grapes can never be produced without exploitation. 
              The same line of reasoning leads to boycotting meat. Until we boycott 
              meat we are, each one of us, contributing to the continued existence, 
              prosperity, and growth of factory farming and all the other cruel 
              practices used in rearing animals for food.

         It is at this point that the consequences of speciesism intrude 
              directly into our lives, and we are forced to attest personally 
              to the sincerity of our concern for nonhuman animals. Here we have 
              an opportunity to do something, instead of merely talking and wishing 
              the politicians would do something. It is easy to take a stand about 
              a remote issue, but the speciesist, like the racist, reveals his 
              true nature when the issue comes nearer home. To protest about bull-fighting 
              in Spain or the slaughter of hahy seals in Canada while continuing 
              to eat chickens that have spent their lives crammed into cages, 
              or veal from calves that have been deprived of their mothers, their 
              proper diet, and the freedom to lie do with their legs extended, 
              is like denouncing apartheid South Africa while asking your neighbors 
              not to sell the houses to blacks.

         Vegetarianism brings with it a new relationship to food, plants, 
              and nature. Flesh taints our meals. Disguise it as we may, the fact 
              remains that the centerpiece of our dinner has come to us from the 
              slaughterhouse, dripping blood Untreated and unrefrigerated, it 
              soon begins to putrefy and stink. When we eat it, it sits heavily 
              in our stomachs blocking our digestive processes until, days later, 
              we struggle to excrete it. When we eat plants, food takes on a different 
              quality We take from the earth food that is ready for us and does 
              not fight against us as we take it. Without meat to deaden the palate 
              there is an extra delight in fresh vegetables taken straight from 
              the ground. Personally, I found the idea of picking my own dinner 
              so satisfying that shortly after becoiming a vegetarian I began 
              digging up part of our backyard and growing some of my own vegetables 
              - something that I had never thought of doing previously, but which 
              several of my vegetarian friends were also doing. In this way dropping: 
              flesh-meat from my diet brought me into closer contact with plants, 
              the soil, and the seasons.

         All the arguments to prove man's superiority cannot shatter this 
              hard fact: in suffering the animals are our equals.

         Animal Liberation will require greater altruism on the part of 
              human beings than any other liberation movement. The animals themselves 
              are incapable of demanding their own liberation, or of protesting 
              against their condition with votes, demonstrations, or bombs. Human 
              beings have the power to continue to oppress other species forever, 
              or until we make this planet unsuitable for living beings. Will 
              our tyranny continue, proving that we really are the selfish tyrants 
              that the most cynical of poets and philosophers have always said 
              we are? Or will we rise to the challenge and prove our capacity 
              for genuine altruism by ending our ruthless exploitation of the 
              species in our power, not because we are forced to do so by rebels 
              or terrorists, but because we recognize that our position is morally 
              indefensible?

         The way in which we answer this question depends on the way in 
              which each one of us, individually, answers it.
