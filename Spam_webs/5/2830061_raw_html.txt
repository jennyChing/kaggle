             We are living in a broken world, a world almost void of YHVHs principles. Did you know that YHVH gave us instructions on life in his Word? He is very practical, and if we were to search, we would find answers to all the problems we are facing today: broken marriages, unwanted children, poverty, too many to mention. To correct these problems would, however, require some changes on our part
            </p>
            <p>
             In everything we do, there are two choices: the worldly way and YHVHs way. We tend to do what we have always done, without questioning how it should be done according to YHVHs way. Dating is a good example. It is not strange to see two young people out on a date. No-one thinks it unusual, not even if they afterwards go to a secluded placeit has become an acceptable practice, but is this practice acceptable to YHVH?
            </p>
            <p>
             You may think this article is about arranged marriages, well its not. The point of this article is to show you that we have to protect our children by not allowing them to date, as in going out with succesive partners and forming intimate relationships with each of them before finding the right one and settling down. Marriage is too precious for that and even more importantly, they are too precious for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             We want to show you YHVHs way and we have something special to share with you. This is especially for the young people, but everybody will enjoy. We will be sharing with you the story of two young adults Jay and Britney, who chose the biblical way of courtship over the worldly way of dating. They are happily married now and have two beautiful little children. However, before we share their love story with you, let us have a look at dating from a historical point of view and then how it was done in biblical times.

               is a form of courtship consisting of social activities done by two people with the aim of each assessing the others suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or as a spouse. While the term has several meanings, it usually refers to the act of meeting and engaging in some mutually agreed upon social activity in public, together, as a couple.

             Before the 1700, marriages were mostly arranged, but then things started to change, at least in some cultures.

               From about 1700, according to professor David Christian of Macquarie University in Australia in a course entitled Big History, a worldwide movement perhaps described as the empowerment of the individual took hold, leading to the emancipation of women and the equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. Women won the right to vote and own property and receive equal treatment by the law, and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. Parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decideon their ownwhether they should marry, who they should marry, and when they should marry.

               A few centuries ago, dating was sometimes described as a courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a chaperone,

               but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, dating varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings.

               In the mid twentieth century, the advent of birth control as well as safer procedures for abortion changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without having to deal with children. Information about human sexuality grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up.

             From the above quote we see how immorality increased to the point it is now at, and we know it will further decline, because people are drifting further and further away from YHVHs truth.

             Our young people are very smart and very knowealable. They have internet and can access information very fast. This makes it possible for them to make informed choices, in their eyes. However, we know that you cant trust or believe everything you read on the internet, but what is their filter? How do they discern truth from error?
            </p>
            <p>
             They are under enormous pressure and it is our responsibility as parents to provide them with a strong Scriptural foundation to make it possible for them to navigate through all this and still make the right choices. Without a foundation grounded in the Bible, they are lost in this world of technology, peer pressure and immorality. They end up being confused and just do what their peers do or whatever they have read somewhere.

            <p>
             So, what is the Biblical way?

            <p>
             Most young people get into and out of one relationship after another, without realizing the physical or spiritual implications of this. I dont think they or we realize just how much YHVH values marriage. The Bible opens and closes with a marriage scene. In Genesis, marriage was instituted by YHVH, Himself and He called it good (Gen 2:18-24.) In Rev19:7-9, the marriage between the Lamb (Yshua) and his bride (us) is described. YHVH often refers to Israel using marriage imagery, a good example is in the book of Ezekiel, but we will get to it later. Yshua is called our groom, we are His bride (2 Cor 11:2).
            </p>
            <p>
             You may wonder why all these quotes about marriage when we are taking about dating. We need to understand the importance and process of marriage, in order to understand why dating is not scriptural. Marriage is holy, because it was instituted by YHVH, therefor the courtship that precedes it, should also be holy in order to preserve the holiness of marriage. We shall furthermore show you that marriage is a covenant, a blood covenant, not to be taken lightly. We shall go into more detail further along in this study. We shall first look at how it was done in Biblical times.

             Is this not an amazing love story? YHVH chose a bride for Isaac!
            </p>
            <p>
             There are a few things that stand out from this passage:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Firstly, Abraham, gave his trusted servant Eliezer the task of choosing a wife for Isaac
             </li>
             <li>
              the bride was to be chosen from Abrahams people, not from the Caananites
             </li>
             <li>
              Eliezer, being a godly man, asked YHVH for guidance in this choice
             </li>
             <li>
              The brother of the bride and the representative or the groom father , came to an agreement
             </li>
             <li>
              The bride-to-be had free choice in the matter
             </li>
             <li>
              The bride-to-be and groom would come together and then become one flesh (Gen 2:24)
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             We find another courtship example in Genesis 25 and 26.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Jacob received the blessing from Isaac, Esau wanted to kill him. Jacob was sent to Haran by his mother to live with his uncle Laban for a while. Laban had two daughters Rachel and Leah. Jacob liked Rachel and made an agreement with Laban to work for him for seven years in order to marry her. He was deceived and was given Leah instead. We know the rest of the story. The similarities are striking. Jacob chose a bride from his own people. An agreement was reached between him and Laban, the father of the bride-to-be. After the terms of the agreement were met, Jacob was able to marry Rachel (however he was tricked into marrying Leah instead). Another agreement was reached and he married Rachel 7 days later.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are not going to search for every example in Scripture. These two, especially the example of Isaac and Rebecca, give us a good idea how courtship took place.

             This covenant, a blood covenant, is ratified when the marriage is consummated. The blood that is shed is the blood of the covenant and the sheet on which it was shed was kept as proof of the brides purity. This blood is shed when the hymen is broken and this happens only once, the first time. If there was no blood, the young woman was accused of harlotry. The groom had a legal right to divorce her, and she was to be stoned.

            <p>
             We see a pattern similar to what we have seen in the narrative of Isaac and Rebecca when we look at the ancient Hebrew marriage practice. This is how it was done in the time of Yshua. The bride was chosen; and if she agreed to the marriage, she then became betrothed to the man. This betrothal is as binding as the marriage, it can only be broken with a letter of divorce.

               Among the ancient Hebrews the betrothal was a spoken covenant. Ezekiel pictures GOD as marrying Jerusalem, and the following words are used of her: I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the LORD GOD, and thou becamest mine (Ezekiel 16:8).

               After the exile, the betrothal included signing a written document of marriage. The ceremony of betrothal. The Jewish betrothal in CHRISTs time was conducted thus: The families of the bride and groom met, with some others present to serve as witnesses. The young man would give the young woman either a gold ring, or some article of value, or simply a document in which he promised to marry her. Then he would say to her: See by this ring [or this token] thou art set apart for me, according to the law of Moses and of Israel. Difference between betrothal and marriage. The betrothal was not the same as the wedding. At least a whole year elapsed between the betrothal and the actual wedding. These two events must not be confused. The Law said, What man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? (Deuteronomy 20:7). Two events are differentiated here: betrothing a wife, and taking a wife, i.e., in actual marriage.

             During this period of betrothal, the man goes to prepare a place for them and the bride prepares her wedding garments and herself. They do not have any physical relations, but are considered married. After this period, the groom comes for his bride.

               Sometimes the brides relations would conduct her from her fathers house to the house of her fiance, where her new home was to be. But more often, as was the case of the Ten Virgins in CHRISTs parable, the bridegroom himself went in person to bring her to his home for the wedding festivities to take place there. Before leaving the house that had been her home, she would receive the blessing of her relatives. Thus Rebekahs relatives sent her away with a typical Oriental marriage blessing, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them (Genesis 24:60). The bride left her fathers house adorned and perfumed, and with a crown on her head. Ezekiels description of the bride is very appropriate) I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head (Ezekiel 16:11, 12).

              Jay and I met on September 20, 2009. I had met his mom, Bev, three days before. She was bringing her little ones to our house for a home school day with the horses. It was too wet for them to come, so Mom e-mailed everyone to let them know we were canceling. Bev didnt get that e-mail; she came anyway. It was a miracle we even met her that day.

            <p>
             <i>
              She and my mom continued e-mailing and Bev invited our family to their house for the Feast of Trumpets (Lev. 23:24,25). Thats when I met Jay. It was definitely not love at first sight, no goose bumps, no fireworks. He seemed like a nice guy, but we didnt have anything in common. We talked, but really didnt hit it off.

            <p>
             <i>
              There were some major differences between us, the main two being that our families believed very differently, and we didnt eat the natural foods like they did. The first of those differences was taken care of within a week. The Father had changed my familys hearts and opened their eyes to keeping His law. After that happened, I started taking notice of Jay.
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              We got to know one another by spending time with each others families and playing board games. We never spent time alone, and didnt send private e-mails for several months. I played an on-line version of our favorite board game, every night at nine oclock, with Jay and his little sister. We rarely talked about anything serious, just goofed off.
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              When our families got together, we usually studied some in the Scriptures. During those times I could really see what kind of man Jay was, how he had a heart after Yahweh and His Word. I really respected Jay as a man.
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              I always felt like I could be myself with Jay. I never needed to dress, act, or talk a certain way. I was at peace with him.
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              Around the first of March, 2010, I started realizing I was in love with Jay. I really started seeking the Father, wanting to know if this was His will or not. Little did I know, that on March 21, Yahweh was going to tell Jay that he was going to marry me! The Father never told me Himself that Jay was definitely the one, but He never said He wasnt either!
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              Around that time we started writing e-mails, and they kept getting longer and longer. We talked about some silly stuff, like our inside jokes, but we also talked about important things, like the Scriptures and parenting. I found out a lot more about him that way.
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              Jay started changing after the Father told him he was going to marry me, he started working much harder, and taking life a little more seriously. He didnt really love me in the romantic, emotional way, until late April. Thats when things really started progressing. We got closer and closer, just as friends, still spending all our time together with our families.

             <i>
              On the Feast of Weeks (Lev. 23:15-21), Jays dad decided it was time to approach my dad about Jay and I entering into courtship. My parents told me that night, I was ecstatic! I wasnt sure what this meant though, did it mean he knew I was the one? Or did he just want to court for a while to make sure? I didnt have to wait long to find out.
             </i>
            </p>
            <p>
             <i>
              The next evening, we went to Jays house. He came out the door, wrapped his arms around me, and told me he loved me! I was so surprised, but I knew then that he was sure about our future together. All that night he kept calling me his future wife.
             </i>

              Two days later, Jay and his parents came to

              my house to discuss the parameters of our courtship. While they were inside talking, Jay and I were outside discussing exactly what to call our relationship. After praying, we decided we were engaged and would get married in the fall! We went inside the house to tell everyone, and his mother asked if he had formally proposed to me. He said he hadnt. So he pulled me aside there in my parents living room, surrounded by our families, and got down on one knee. He took my hands and said, Britney, I love you with all of my heart. You have my heart. Will you marry me? Of course, I said Yes! So our rather unconventional, official courtship lasted only two days.

            <p>
             <i>
              Our engagement was five months long, it was such a wonderful time. Getting to know Jay and his family better, planning a wedding, and working made for a busy but exciting summer! It was a time of growth in our relationship, but we did have a few bumps along the way. We learned some of each others strengths and weaknesses, and how to deal with conflicts. I think that time has contributed so much to the smoothness of our relationship now, since we learned to relate to one another during those months.

              We were married on October 24, 2010, in an open field with the fall colors in full array. It was the happiest day of my life. It turned out more wonderful than I could have ever imagined, I just relaxed and enjoyed the day. I married the man of my dreams, without a doubt the one that Yahweh intended for me to spend the rest of my life with. I couldnt have asked for more!

              Yahweh blessed our relationship from beginning to end, aligning our lives with His calendar and His timetable. We continued to keep our focus on Him, and He most definitely directed our paths. I wouldnt have it any other way.

             From this beautiful love story, we see that it is still possible to be done in YHVHs way. We hope the beauty and purity of this would inspire many young people to follow YHVHs way instead of the worlds. He is glorified when we do. For those young people who made mistakes by following the worldly way, do not be discouraged, give your life to YHVH, He will forgive you and make something beautiful of your life.

              The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the center of the court,

               4

              they said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught in adultery, in the very act.

              They were saying this, testing Him, so that they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on the ground.

              But when they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up, and said to them, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.

              When they heard it, they began to go out one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the center of the court.

               10
              </sup>
              Straightening up, Jesus said to her, Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?
              <sup>
               11
              </sup>
              She said, No one, Lord. And Jesus said, I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more.]

                   Thank you for your comment Elvira. What exactly is your concern with the Christian dating websites? Could you please elaborate a bit more? Much appreciated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I believe if it is done in a modest way in order to help people to meet other people, it would be ok. I dont know exactly how it is done or presented, therefor my question to you to elaborate more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Shalom
