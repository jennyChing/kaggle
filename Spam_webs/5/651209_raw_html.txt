A glass aquarium with a secure ventilated top (screen wire or perforated metal) makes a satisfactory cage. Most adults could live out their lives quite happily in an enclosure the approximate size of a 20-gallon long aquarium. Pythons do well on aspen bedding or newspaper substrate. 
Clean water should be available at all times in a glass or ceramic bowl. A ball python will eat mice its entire life. One appropriately sized mouse per week is an adequate feeding schedule. Older and larger snakes may eat two or three mice or one small rat a week.
Ball pythons seem to do best if kept in the mid-80s Fahrenheit. It is good if the cage has a temperature gradient with one side warmer than the other. Ball pythons can better tolerate temperature extremes if they do not have food in their stomachs.

Arrange rocks and branches to provide several basking levels. Full-spectrum fluorescent lamps that emit both ultraviolet A and B wavelengths should be suspended over the cage. Perches should be set up so they can bask within 12 inches of these lights. The cage substrate can be newspaper.
Young hatchlings should be sprayed with water every day. They should be fed insects every day to achieve optimal growth. Nontoxic plant leaves and vegetation should also be provided as they are a main source of hydration for the bearded dragon. As bearded dragons grow they can take larger food items and more vegetable matter in their diet. Calcium supplements should be provided for good bone growth.

Corn snakes have an attractive checkerboard pattern on their ventral surfaces. Color of the ventral scales is usually black and white.

Paper towel orchid bark or newspaper work well as substrate materials. Water should be provided in a shallow lid or bowl. Leopard geckos will also benefit from a hide box.
Captive leopard geckos are best fed mealworms or crickets. It is important to power feed such food items for a day or two to make sure that the gecko gets a nutritious balanced diet.
The cage should be kept off the floor at a temperature between 82 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit during the day nighttime temperatures can drop as low as 64 degrees with no ill effects. Heat can be provided by heat tapes hot rocks or a 40-watt light bulb placed on top of the cage's screen top.

            <a class="tagclouds level5" href="/reptile-ad-tags/carpet-python" title="The vernacular of Atherton Tableland carpet python is frequently used for this snake. Although having the smallest range of any of the several subspecies the bright colors and small adult size of jungle carpet python has made the snake a hobbyist favorite. Although it may be brown and cream in color most examples bred by hobbyists are black (or deep brown) and a truly bright yellow. It is the only of the carpet pythons (excluding the diamond python) to be so hued.
Jungle carpet pythons are rather slow moving powerful constrictors that as babies (even captive hatched babies) may strike at an approaching hand and bite but with just a little bit of growth and some handling this tendency diminishes. This snake often basks quietly by day and is most active in the evening and nighttime hours.
Because carpet pythons are slow and almost methodical in their movements they can be maintained in terraria smaller that those recommended for many other snakes of similar size. One or two babies may be temporarily housed in a 10 or 15 gallon capacity terrarium. A pair of adults may be kept in a 50 or 75 gallon capacity terrarium.
The terrarium should contain a hide box and assorted visual barriers (such as cork bark or sterilized drift wood). Jungle carpet pythons climb agilely and if provided with firmly anchored limbs of no less diameter that the girth of the snake they will do so. An elevated platform large enough for the snakes to coil on will also be well utilized. Cypress fir aspen chips or bark shards provide an easily cleaned and inexpensively replaced substrate. A temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit at night and 82 degrees during the day is ideal for these snakes. A daytime basking spot warmed by an overhead bulb to a temperature of 90 to 95 degrees will be used periodically. A bowl of clean water should always be present and if the receptacle is large enough the pythons may crawl in and soak as they begin their shedding cycle. This python will thrive on a diet of prekilled rodents.
Although the average clutch size is just about half of the maximum clutch size a large healthy female Jungle Carpet Python can produce up to 28 eggs in a single clutch. Hatchlings are about 15 inches long.">

The crested geckos ability to lay two eggs multiple times per year with relative herpetocultural ease has made them the new favorite in the saurian world of pets.
Give the crested gecko an enclosure well-supplied with a tangled assortment of climbing branches including at least one hollow section large enough to hide inside of during the day. Cillies love to climb; sticky toe pads and a tail that acts like a fifth-leg help them make use of every bit of arboreal habitat you can provide for them. Crested geckos will reward you with hours of evening entertainment watching their arboreal antics.
Offer a variety of live insects such as crickets mealworms waxworms etc. at dusk when the crested gecko normally becomes active. This is also a good time to use a misting bottle to leave large droplets of water on the branches and plants which will quickly be lapped up by the thirsty geckos. Fruit-flavored baby food a couple times per week with a vitamin/mineral supplement mixed in will substitute for the nectar crested geckos would enjoy in the wild. Commercial crested gecko meals are also available that provide all necessary nutrition.
Crested geckos are relatively slow-moving which makes them excellent candidates for frequent handling by pet enthusiasts. Be careful not to tug on their tails too hard  they may break!

Caution should be exercised when acquiring an imported Russian tortoise because they are usually stressed and heavily parasitized.

Russian tortoises make great pets because they are relatively small and very active in captivity. They are very cold tolerant but do not do well in cold and damp environments. They will develop respiratory problems rather quickly if kept under cool and damp conditions for any extended length of time although they do handle cool dry conditions very well at which time they will be inclined to hibernate.
These tortoises are opportunistic feeders taking dark leafy greens and fibrous vegetables. Fruits such as pears and apples in addition to berries can be fed to add variety but should be fed sparingly. Russian tortoises will also take insects and carrion.

Both wild caught and captive bred bullsnakes are readily available in the pet trade. Hatchlings vary from about 11 inches (small-sized adults) to 16 inches (large adults). A clutch normally contains from 4 to 15 large eggs. Occasional females may lay up to 26 eggs and double clutching has been documented.
Bullsnakes are rather slow moving powerful constrictors that are easily approached in the wild. They are active in the evening and nighttime hours. Bullsnakes seek sanctuary in rodent burrows old buildings or piles of debris.
Because they are not speedsters they can be maintained in terraria smaller that those recommended for other snakes of similar size. One or two babies may be temporarily housed in a 10 or 15 gallon capacity terrarium. A pair of adults may be kept in a 50 gallon capacity terrarium.
The terrarium should contain a hide-box and assorted visual barriers (such as cork bark or sterilized drift wood). Bullsnakes can climb well and if provided with firmly anchored limbs of no less diameter that the girth of the snake they will do so. Cypress fir aspen chips or bark shards provide an easily cleaned and inexpensively replaced substrate. A temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit at night and 85 degrees during the day is ideal for these snakes. Although they may not bask a hot spot of 90 to 95 degrees is provided for several hours a day. A bowl of clean water should always be present and if the receptacle is large enough the bullsnakes may crawl in and soak as they begin their shedding cycle.">

            <a class="tagclouds level1" href="/reptile-ad-tags/amazon-tree-boa" title="This species is also referred to as the Garden Tree Boa by experienced hobbyists as ATBs and in error as Cooks Tree Boa (a different species). Although hobbyists now breed many of the more desirable colors (red orange yellow and combinations of these colors) the majority of the less coveted colors (brown tan olive gray charcoal and combinations) are collected from the wild and imported. Brightly colored examples are usually considerably more expensive than those of duller color. Both captive bred and imported individuals are usually readily available in the pet trade.
Amazon tree boas will bite readily and their long teeth render this an unpleasant experience. They are often best handled with a snake hook.
Baby and imported tree boas may become dehydrated during transportation. Immediate rehydration is very important. When misted freshly collected examples often drink beadlets of water from their bodies and nearby leaves more readily than from cage bottom drinking bowls. High cage humidity will help reduce dehydration but does not replace the need for the snakes to drink. Elevating the drinking bowl and roiling the water surface with an aquarium air stone (activated by a small vibrating pump) will often induce the snake to drink. Dehydration can result in regurgitation or refusal to eat. Imported snakes may also bear endoparasites. A stool sample should be analyzed by a veterinarian and if necessary purging should be carried out.
Birds are an important prey item of wild specimens. Captives should be fed weekly and usually accept prekilled mice proffered on forceps. The mouse should not be larger in diameter than the width of the boas head. When hungry a tree boa will usually prowl actively in its cage or lie coiled with head and neck extended downward in a sinuous S striking-curve.
Relatively high cage humidity should be provided these boas. Live plants can add beauty to a cage and also help elevate humidity. Baby Amazon tree boas can be maintained in a 5 to 10 gallon capacity terrarium. Adults should have a terrarium of at least a 20 gallon capacity and a 30 to 50 gallon size is probably better. A temperature gradient of 75 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit should be provided. Although they do not always climb horizontal perches of about the same diameter as the snakes body and climbing space should be provided. Amazon tree boas will usually choose a forked branch on which to coil. When the snakes are in elevated positions they usually anchor themselves with their prehensile tail.">

Most snakes will climb if branches or platforms are provided. Hideboxes should also be provided. All captive snakes require fresh water to drink in bowls made of nonporous materials.
As a general rule most pythons and boas will do fine in temperatures ranging between 86 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 80 degrees Fahrenheit at night. It's a good idea to provide a basking spot 5 to 7 degrees warmer than the rest of the cage that the snake can voluntarily choose to enjoy. 
Because of its potential size it is critical to the health of these individual snakes that they be maintained in suitably large cages similar to the space requirements of other python species of similar weights. 
Boas and pythons are carnivorous animals that will feed on rodents such as mice rats hamsters and gerbils. Most pythons and boas are fed once a week.">

Maintaining good water quality is key to keeping healthy softshell turtles. Sand substrates should be provided so that spiny softshells can bury themselves yet reach the surface to breathe using their long neck.
Filtration is essential although bottom filters may be quickly clogged with sand. Basking sites can be constructed from plastic egg crates as these can be placed at a slanting angle into the water and allow the turtle to choose whether to emerge completely from the water or bask partially submerged. A basking light that provides warmth of at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit as well as multi-spectrum lighting is also important. In the wild spiny softshells often bask on sandbars within inches of the waters edge.
Spiny softshells like other softshells may injure each other when kept together or with other species of turtles.">

The Aldabra tortoise because of its potential large size requires a good deal of space and special consideration. Moving a tortoise that is more than 200 lbs is bad enough but moving one that is more than 400 lbs can be problematic especially if the animal does not want to move or cannot. The Aldabra tortoise is only protected as far as trade so no special permits are required to keep and maintain these in captivity.
Aldabra tortoises are adaptable and seem to be very cold tolerant but they are still going to require supplemental heating to maintain a recommended temperature of 75 to 100 Fahrenheit. These tortoises while being able to withstand low temperatures do seem to prefer higher temperatures.
The diet for the Aldabra tortoise in the wild consists mostly of weeds and grasses with occasional brows mixed in. In captivity they will eat almost anything. The suggested diet is a variety of dark leafy greens and grasses in addition a good mix of vegetables. Its recommended to restrict the feeding of cabbages because of the propensity to develop thyroid problems among the giant tortoises due to a lack of dietary iodine. Providing as varied a diet as possible will usually alleviate any dietary deficiencies.
Water should be provided at all times. Captive Aldabras consume great amounts of water if it is available.

            <a class="tagclouds level1" href="/reptile-ad-tags/leopard-tortoise" title="There is currently one species of leopard tortoise recognized but there are at least two distinct forms. There is a southern form and a northern form. The easiest way to distinguish the two forms is in the spotting seen on hatchlings. The southern form is going to have multiple spots on each scute and in the northern form there is going to be one or less spots on each scute.
Most if not all of the leopard tortoises encountered today are captive bred due to heavy restrictions on exportation from the country of origin. In the United States it is no longer allowed to be imported due to a parasite (tick) the tortoise can carry which is known to carry a disease (heartwater) which is harmful to cattle. A health certificate is required to transport even captive born leopard tortoises from state to state in the United States.
Leopard tortoises are very prone to respiratory problems if temperatures are not properly maintained. The most acceptable temperature range is 75 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. These tortoises do not tolerate cold temperatures at all although the southern form is more cold tolerant than the northern form.
The Leopard tortoise is a known grazer so grasses should be its main staple but its diet can be supplemented with dark leafy greens and some fibrous fruits such as apples pears and the like. Fresh water should be provided at all times.

The black and white tegu or Argentine tegu emerges with the warming sun and actively prowls its territory in search of any small animals that its capable of catching and devouring. Prey is subdued in the black and white tegus powerful jaws until all struggling ceases. Large food items are ripped apart with the aid of sharp claws; smaller items are swallowed whole.
In captivity domestic rodents can provide the bulk of the black and white tegus diet. Raw eggs chicks or other small animals can supplement the diet. Keep your fingers clear when offering food because black and white tegus often display a voracious feeding response to anything that moves. Aside from feeding time black and white tegus often tame down well and may make docile pets.
A spacious cage or outdoor pen will allow for black and white tegus to dig with their strong claws. Black and white tegus typically retire to their burrows for many months each season when temperatures dip below the low 70s Fahrenheit whether you want them to or not. Black and white tegus may remain completely dormant refusing food and often stay hidden the whole time.
Females deposit 12 to 30 eggs which they guard jealously. Hatchlings are finger-thick and 7 to 10 inches in length. Black and white tegus often sport brilliant green coloration which gradually fades to tones of black and white as they mature over several years.">
