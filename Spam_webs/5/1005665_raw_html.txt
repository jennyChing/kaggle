         Parents have the right to understand what is being put into their childs body. The production of vaccines uses many disgusting ingredients. Additionally, the components used during the manufacturing process may violate your personal, religious, or ethical beliefs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lastly, remember that whatever colorful language is used by the scientific community (using such words as purified), using such substances can come with an enormous cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you read this list, understand cell lines and vaccines do become contaminated. This is often hidden under the term adventitious agents.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Disgusting Ingredient #1: Cells From Aborted Fetus
        </h3>
        <p>
         Aborted fetal cells, listed on vaccine package inserts as Human Fetal Diploid Cells. Two aborted fetal cell lines, WI-38 and MRC-5, have been grown under laboratory conditions since the 1960s.
        </p>
        <p>
         The cells are used to grow viruses used which are then collected from the cell cultures and processed further to produce the vaccine itself.

         Disgusting Ingredient #2: Serum From Aborted Calf Fetus Blood
        </h3>
        <p>
         One of the more grotesque methods involved in vaccine manufacturing is the collection of fetal bovine serum. The purpose for serum is providing a nutrient broth for viruses to grow in cells.
        </p>
        <p>
         How is the blood collected?
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the Humane Research Australia website:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          After slaughter and bleeding of the cow at an abattoir, the mothers uterus containing the calf fetus is removed during the evisceration process (removal of the mothers internal organs) and transferred to the blood collection room. A needle is then inserted between the fetuss ribs directly into its heart and the blood is vacuumed into a sterile collection bag. This process is aimed at minimizing the risk of contamination of the serum with micro-organisms from the fetus and its environment. Only fetuses over the age of three months are used otherwise the heart is considered too small to puncture.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          Once collected, the blood is allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum separated through a process known as refrigerated centrifugation.

         The FDA approved the Flublok vaccine on January 16, 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
         This new technology is being touted as the wave of the future. It utilizes an insect cell line (expresSF+) that is derived from cells of the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda.

         Disgusting Ingredient #4: Cells From Monkey Kidneys
        </h3>
        <p>
         As mentioned above, monkey kidney tissue is used to support the growth of certain viruses used in vaccine production. There remains a huge controversy over using these cells and their role contaminating the polio vaccine in the 1950s.
        </p>
        <p>
         The story is best told in the Congressional papers of a courageous scientist, Bernice Eddy.
         <em>
          The Executive Reorganization and Government Research of the Committee on Government Operations United States Senate, Ninety-Second Congress, Second Session
         </em>
         [1972] states on page 500:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          The next and only serious vaccine crisis that has occurred since the polio episode was the realization in mid-1961 that a monkey virus later shown to cause tumors in hamsters was contaminating both polio and adenovirus vaccines. The virus, known as SV40, was entering the vaccines and, just as in the polio case were surviving the formalin treatment.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          There were several states by which the full extent of the SV40 problem became known. First was the discovery in 1959-1960 by a DBS scientist, once again Bernice Eddy, that an unknown agent in the monkey kidney cells used to produce polio and adenovirus vaccines would cause tumors when the cells were injected into hamsters.
         </em>
        </p>
        <p>
         Page 502:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
          In 1954 Eddy, as a polio control officer, found live virus in supposedly killed polio vaccine; in 1955 she was relieved of her duties as polio control officer  After her discoveries concerning the SV40 virus, her staff and animal space were reduced and she was demoted from head of a section to head of a unit.

         Page 505:
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
         <em>
            even when the contaminating virus was found to be oncogenic [cancer causing] in hamsters, the DBS [Division of Biologics Standards] and its expert advisory committee decided to leave existing stocks on the market rather than risk eroding public confidence by a recall.

         Viral vaccines prepared in tissue culture or mouse brain have been used in many Asian countries. According to the CDC website, the inactivated mouse brain-derived JE vaccine used in the United States since 1992 is no longer available. [6]
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, with any vaccine, the adverse reactions are rarely tracked and downplayed by medical authorities. However, the injuries from vaccines can be quite serious. [7, 8]

             The truths sets you free, but furst it pisses you of. Trust yourself, trust your childrens strength. While i was pregnant, i said to the the little baby groeing indide me that i was confident that the baby is wise and healthy and i trust their decisions are wise. That i stand behind them and support him ( second is a she) and her :)
             <br/>
             We live on a small sanctuary farm, we live the peaceful way ( vegan) cause love life. The children are doing very well, both. They are rarely sick have no allergies and are mostly happy!
             <br/>
             Needles to say they are unvaccinated.
             <br/>
             We live organic also
            </p>
            <p>
             The best thing to do is love yourself and all around you, going mad is logical and you are allowed to.
             <br/>
             But please do not stay in this being mad condition, try to see everything is energy, everyone wants to be happy, just some persons ( chose in charge) do not seem to get it how they can truly get happy, they try to pull us down too, in many ways, through education, media, medicine, politics, food(additives) etc.
             <br/>
             And even if their job isnt fir the good of all beings living on earth and earth herself
             <br/>
             They, the persons in power( which are just a tiny dot in comparance to the rest of humanity) are doing their job pretty good.
             <br/>
             Cause we let us be pulled down too in energy of bring afraid, angry and sad and feelings of guilt.
             <br/>
             Best thing is, love yourself, go inside your body, read and watch sone Eckhart Tolle for example and Michael Tsarion, go out and love yourself and every being. Love heals everything, make your own decisions, believe in yourself and share your insights

             Barbara  Thats the darkness for you theyve had the run of this earth for thousands of years and now with this great spiritual shift for humanity that we are going through We as a whole are shifting them out Big time most are unaware of it as we speak. More of what Light has disclose to Us:
            </p>
            <p>
             ..The new receptivity of individual consciousness is bringing an awareness
             <br/>
             that man is  much more than just a servant for those holding world
             <br/>
             power.  Illusion  increasingly dissolves with each soul who hears and
             <br/>
             heeds their inner voice  and begins to awaken to the truth of who they
             <br/>
             really are.  Most of the world does not yet understand the spiritual
             <br/>
             nature of the energetic changes taking place.  They desire change
             <br/>
             because  living as they have always known and accepted,  no longer
             <br/>
             resonates with them and  many  are finding their voiceexperiencing a
             <br/>
             new courage and strength with which to communicate and live in  new
             <br/>
             ways. onenessofall.com

             Years ago, California turned a religious exemption into a personal beliefs exemption and now is about to turn the personal beliefs/ religious exemption into a medical one on Jan 1,2014 by requiring a doctor or nurse to sign off on your personal beliefs waiver. Do you see what they did and what they are about to do? If this article doesnt get you back in the mood to file a religious exemption and put this thing back in the first amendment section where it belongs, I dont know what will. And this IS WHAT THEY ARE TELLING YOU IS IN THOSE THINGS?

             An Australian Government Election was held in September and this is the current situation in Australia regarding vaccine compliance.
            </p>
            <p>
             The previous government promised,if elected,to take away a parents right to receive The Family Tax Benefit Supplement unless they agreed to have their children fully vaccinated.This move targets those least able to afford to lose more than $2000 in government payments. The new Prime Minister Tony Abbott  has promised to to do the same thing. Removing or limiting the Childcare Benefit to parents who object to vaccinatioin is also being considered. The party spearheading all of this is the Australian Greens who have stated that they want to remove all religious and conscientious exemptions,leaving parents no choice whatsoever.The only people with the choice then will be the doctors.

             Of course these ingredients are entirely misleading. The cells mentioned arent actually IN the vaccines, they are cell lines that are used to develop, test and produce the vaccines. And Disgusting Ingredient #2: Serum From Aborted Calf Fetus Blood is really funny. They make it sound like people are going around giving cows abortions and stealing the fetuses! In actuality, fetal calf serum comes from slaughterhouses when the occasional slaughtered cow happens to be pregnant. And the fetal calf serum isnt actually put IN the vaccines either, it is an essential ingredient in cell culture medium. We use it in our culture media all of the time at our lab. Cell culture is not only a vital part of producing vaccines, but is also integral for the genetic testing we do as well as vital to the development, testing and production of most modern drugs and chemo-therapies. These anti-vaccine zealots are determined to return us to the days of children dying from measles, mumps, etc and living in iron lungs and wheelchairs from polio.

             Mark  Do some research on history of diseases and vaccines. Also, the anti-vaccine community is made up of many thousands of professional doctors and researchers, (who know how to research subjects objectively),
             <br/>
             with advanced degrees who do not have a monetary vested interest in vaccines and have researched vaccines more than you could ever do in your lifetime. You can not convince me of your point of view because you do not have any peripheral vision what so ever on the subject, and your rationalizing your vested interest in vaccinations. You are not objective and you do not study history and statistics. You only do lab work.

             Marvin,
             <br/>
             For you being objective is being anti-vax. Research has consistently shown vaccines to be the greatest medical achievement of the last century. Its clear you have not done any work in studying basic statistics to recognize this. A university education would help.
             <br/>
             PS. I laugh at the fact that you think there are thousands of actual medical doctors and scientists who are anti-vax.

             Thank you VacTRUTH, for the very important info I can include with the laminated cards I make to give out to unsuspecting pregnant mothers I see everywhere so they open their eyes and decide if they want this monstrosity injected into their newborns. All the ones Ive talked to afterwards cant thank me enough for the information websites Ive given them and the bonus is, they are spreading the word amongst their friends and family too! ;-)  Hows that for mission accomplished!
            </p>
            <p>
             Paul Revere style is the only way to go. Journalism died a long time ago, and everything media puts out is a lie. Fortunately people are now seeing vaccine damage with their own eyes, so its easy for them to believe the truth websites Ive given them on these cards.
            </p>
            <p>
             Spread the word folks. Its easy, and the best we can do to sabotage the diabolical vaccine agenda. I find more and more people are receptive to my info and are turning against the vaccine agenda. Best of all, others are also giving out these websites. Create a movement in your area and experience positive response.

             Whos research  Jim Bob??
            </p>
            <p>
             for example, Jim Bob
             <br/>
             GlaxoSmithKline Inc.  one of the worlds leading research-based pharmaceutical and health-care companies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vaccine corporations ie. GlaxoSmithKline do their own research (get it Jim Bob?) and when the gov does their research they use GlaxoSmithklines data and resources.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is some research for ya Jim Bob
             <br/>
             Vaccines Did Not Save Us  2 Centuries Of Official Statistics
             <br/>

             Would you jab your own arm Jim Bob with my vaccine that I make in my own corporation?
             <br/>
             Dont worry, the research has been done (by me).
             <br/>

             Have the saboteurs here ever looked at an excipient list and seen vero cells. Have you ever looked at a vaccine manufacture protocol and if so do you take comfort in the
             <br/>
             standard for vaccine production that calls for removal of
             <br/>
             substrate-cell DNA to a level equivalent to not more than 10 ng per single human dose, unless
             <br/>
             otherwise prescribed.??  And can you please tell us what degradation products are?  Thank you. That would make us all feel so much better.  Cheers numbnuts.  I hope they pay you well to donate your soul to the prince of the earth.

             I do my best.  My medium for sharing has been facebook.  Ive heard of some having their profiles deleted because of what they share but so far I havent had that happen.  I have however had someone mad at me for what I share.  I guess I hit a nerve.  I find it hard to get people to listen and actually understand what Ive shared but I do what I can do.

             The fact is that injecting babies within the first 12 hours of birth with toxic substances is insane.  These ingredients are just a few along with a number of other ingredients which are extremely toxic to the human body and cause inflamation of the brain and can be a big contributor to childhood cancer and other diseases that were not prevalent in children 30, 40, even 50 years ago.  The autism rate has gone from 1 in somewhere around 100,000 to 1 in 54 children today.
             <br/>
             I hope you are not saying that this cocktail along with other ingredients that are present in childhood vaccines is safe.  Consider the fact that at 2 months a child can get up to 8 or 9 vaccines in one doctor visit and an untold number of them experience adverse reactions while theyre still in the doctors office.

             Well okay then Mark.  Tell you what, you take all the vaccines that they give children today in one visit and tell me what kinds of reactions you experience.  You can also have all my flu shots because I have not gotten one and will never get one.  The worst part is what the medical profession is doing to children is criminal.  Babies cannot tell you what they are experiencing and many of them die.  Hows that for SCAREMONGERING BS???????!!!!!!!

             Maybe you would feel differently if your child had a seizure after they were vaccinated. Not one of my children ,3 of them. Doctors lied to us. That might be ok with you its not ok for us. Ill take my chances with the measles and the mumps thanks. After all they are MY children not yours of the government. Vaccines are toxic if they werent the government would not have to have millions in a vaccine injury fund now would they. Vaccines are about money not health.

             Just talked three weeks ago to a mom of a severely autistic child.  What she said was that she had a perfectly beautiful baby one day and an autistic child the next.  The baby had been vaccinated.

             Mark, you couldnt be any wronger. But lets suppose youre correct Please tell us how a mixture of weakened or killed pathogenic viruses, cells from other animals when injected into a human body, coupled with formaldehyd, ethylenglycol (antifreeze), aluminum, mercury, detergent, etc. (100+ noxious and toxic ingredients) wont adversely interact in any shape or form with the host (human) cells, etc.? And in spite of the huge increase of autism, aspergers, chrones, ADHD, dyslexia, cancer, and stroke amongst children? Most believe Americans are the healthiest whilst the U.S. ranks 50.
             <br/>
             And a bonus question for Mark: We dont recall back in the day when droves of children dying from measels, mumps, etc and living in iron lungs We remember out of millions only a few with already weakened immune systems and medically poisoned underwent hardship. Its somewhat ok to believe your paradigm is the best. Its a really big thing to force it upon all.

             Thats essentially the basis of this article. There is zero information or evidence here that points to how any of the above mentioned items are apparently bad or cause harm other than in name created to invoke fear. This is known as fear mongering.

             What a poor, simple article this is.

             Actually the evidence of vaccine contamination shows us that there is no way that the vaccines are ever actually nor entirely purified, and any in any way you look at it, vaccines pose a major risk for injecting contamination from any source the vaccine is made from. Complete purification of a vaccine is impossible and clearly no purification step process to date, has ever eliminated the risk.

             The government is not game enough to take away our rights and remove the religious or conscientious exemption forms. Families can still receive family benefits even after submitting their forms (but keep a copy on file).

             We parents still have a right to stop doctors/nurses/paediatricians injecting our babies with these insidious vaccines.

             The big time and false scare and fear mongering is actually on the part of the CDC, who refuse to admit that current outbreaks of such as pertussis and measles actually involve 80% or more that are fully vaccinated, not unvaccinated. They refuse to admit that those two vaccines have increasingly become a failure. Instead the CDC  again and again falsely blames the unvaccinated, when the truth is that the vaccines are not working in any way shape or form, the way they were advertised and intended to.

             Actually Mark, historical stats repeatedly show that death from infectious
             <br/>
             diseases such as measles plummeted drastically well before the introduction  of vaccines due to improved sanitation, proper drinking water,
             <br/>
             better nutrition and living conditions  common sense measures that
             <br/>

             I had to be vaccinated with the tb shot as a cna and  I felt this excruciating sharp pain in my temple it scared me also I got sick to my stomach  and had diarrhea well I was supposed to continue with the series because its mandatory for working in a nursing home I never went back iam leaving the healthcare field I will never get that vaccine ever again! I hadnt had the flu vaccines or others for 6 years and the only thing I ever had to deal with was a cold of short duration.

             Your first statement is all the more interesting considering that most people dont start off anti-vax as they were auto-pilot indoctrinated to believe vaccines were a godsend
             <br/>
             Years ago, when I was avidly pro-vaccine, I probably would
             <br/>
             have been regarded as objective NEVERMIND I never took one iota of effort to seriously question the gospel of officialdom that I had been fed ad nauseum It took three separate events to finally shake me up to actually question
             <br/>
             the my blind faith in vaccination. A faith that based on
             <br/>
             the fallacy that as you put it, vaccinesare the greatest
             <br/>
             medical achievement of the last century.. A bogus
             <br/>
             assertion based on PR and historical manipulation
             <br/>
             and deception rather than bona fide scientific integrity

(without the usual suspects such as mercury, aluminium, formaldehyde and the above) As stated below by Roxanne historical stats repeatedly show that death from infectious diseases such as measles plummeted drastically well before the introduction of vaccines due to improved sanitation, proper drinking water, better nutrition and living conditions  common sense measures that support healthy immune function Absolutely goddamn right, just check the graphs.

             Theres much more to this vaccine madness than just big bucks and that absolutely would fit in nicely with the eugenicists depopulation agenda by making people sick and sterile. Ill as usual let old (scumbag) Bertrand tell it like it is..

             Scientific societies are as yet in their infancy. . . . It is to be expected that advances in physiology and psychology will give governments much more control over individual mentality than they now have even in totalitarian countries. Fitche laid it down that education should aim at destroying free will, so that, after pupils have left school, they shall be incapable, throughout the rest of their lives, of thinking or acting otherwise than as their schoolmasters would have wished. . . . Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible. . . .-Bertrand Russell,1953

             Lowell, thanks so much for this information. I can use these links.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just looked at Scientific proof that the known cancer causing SV40 virus, a previous contaminant in the polio vaccine, is obviously either contagious; or the virus is still in the vaccine/sand its loaded. There are 4 more links at the bottom of the article too.
            </p>

             Youre only evidence against this is that there is a conspiracy fixing all the data to promote vaccines. And guess whatstill no evidence of a cover-up.

             I get a kick out of stupid people tripping over their own stupidity. As it turns out, the anti-vax community is full of em. I just wish the consequences of anti-vax stupidity wasnt so high.

             Excellent article.
             <br/>
             CDC admits that there is a problem regarding presence of foreign DNA in vaccines and that it is impossible to remove the DNA contaminants. Although weight limits for contaminating DNA were set by the FDA as far back as 1986, vaccine makers have never been able to reach that goal.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CDC decided to limit their weight recommendation to cancerous cell lines and then increase the other DNA contamination allowance one hundred-fold. However, these limits are only recommendations and, therefore, the FDA is unable to enforce them. Vaccine manufacturers continue to have the freedom to take scientific measures to reduce contaminants only if they wish.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wheres the logic?
             <br/>
             It is thought provoking that doctors and nurses swab the skin with disinfectant to remove some microbes, then jab and force into our children a contaminated, poisonous, genotoxic, disease and cancer causing vaccine soup!

             Hi Sandy, your valuable comment brought to mind the following observations made by Dr. Butttram:
            </p>
            <p>
             Certain vaccines called recombinant, subunit and naked DNA use methods of genetic engineering in their productions.  These techniques  pose major concerns because of the unknown interaction of the vaccine and human proteins/DNA.  The FDA actually acknowledges this concern where mutations take place through the activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressor genes allowing cancers to thrive A detailed and technical report which details the many cancerous and genetic consequences of vaccine CONTAMINATION notes that each vaccine dose is allowed 100,000,000 allowable pieces of DNA, not including the DNA in the viral and viral-contaminated portions.  We believe that any allowable piece of DNA is a risk.
            </p>

             Yes, Russells telling quote Though the following quote doesnt speak directly of injections, it alludes to that same twisted mentality of mass control
             <br/>
             We need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society. The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated. The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of view. . . Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. . . . We must electronically control the brain. Someday armies and generals will be controlled by electronic stimulation of the brain.

             Lets hope and pray it stays that way. I never expected the Greens to be so willing to take away peoples freedom of choice.

             Oh, is it? The immunesystem wil develop allergie against all substance wich is injected with a chronic inflamation process as result and a skewed Th1/Th2 immunesystem as result.  Inform yourself please. How is MS introduced to labanimals? google EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis). It is done by injecting Adjuvants with proteins of myeline. Know the mechanism and you know auto-immune disease is a lie. Why the rise in allergie? It is because of alumin adjuvants based vaccines. This screws the Th1/Th2 balance to the Th2 arm wich leaves you with a supressed Th1 arm. (Cellulair immunity). This opens the door for bacteriel and viral infections. Its a mild form of aids induced by aluminium containing vaccines. (Sorry for bad english, 3rd language)

             Roxanne,
             <br/>
             Im glad you included the word theoretically in your comment, because most anti-vaxxers try to twist this into saying that Paul Offit said an infant should be injected with 10,000 vaccines. That, of course, is a falsehood.
             <br/>
             Heres a link to the published article that you are referring to:

            </p>
            <p>
             See the paragraph where the calculation of how many antigens could be handled at one time is discussed. This is done, of course to illustrate how insignificant the number of antigens received at one time through routine vaccination is to the bodys capacity to respond.
             <br/>
             Can you point to any flaw in their logic or refute any of the data they use?
             <br/>

             it might give you a new insight to why the Goverment can tell you what to do with your children or even come into your house and tell you what you can do and not do.Its not bull in Australia they are trying to encourage the Aboriginals to become part of the constution if they do they will loose their soverenty. Mind you if they fill in a birth certificate they may have already lost it.  Also checkout Servant King. This game has been going for centries. The elite have always thought that the poor or middle class can not look after themselves. Histroy has all the answers you only have to find them. Humans are worth nothing and we cost too much to run. Check out NASA the end of mankind too on youtube. We are living in interesting times and to be asleep now is not a good time to do it.

             Every single individual on this earth is from Source We Are Spiritual Beings, Beings of Light Always Were Always Have Been Always Will Be Eternal. When We leave this body We EXPAND back to our TrueSelves, We Are One and We Are VAST! The Elite are of the darkside and it is the darkside that is being removed from this earth as we speak. They have been here for thousands of years the time is NOW for them to go. When people realize who they actually are then more of the darkside will be removed for it is in their minds and head and throughout. More and more are waking up realizing this. This is how we are making this transition. Dont need no answers from yesteryear for that was the darksides playground. You need to look within yourselves because the answers have always been thererealize who you truly are and where you truly come from

             ..there is. Up there where We Are From the Love and Reality up there We are bringing it down here. This woowoo world that weve been in for far too long is being removed by Us as we wake up and realize who we truly are and where we truly come from. This is the first time that earth has been in this situation and is a first timer for Us and it is how We go forward that will determine our future. A better way of living yes and great changes will be made by Us yes but under a different Love rather than the love from the darkside that we have endured for these thousands of years. And Yes We have been back and forth for generations after generations lifetimes after lifetimes with the choice to come back here for more so great times ahead folks we just need to wake the others up and therefore release the darkside from ourselvesand wow hello future or NOW..

             Interesting thoughts there Phyl.  You sound very enlightened.  I guess its not just a battle of the flesh but spritually as well.  We are under spiritual attack in these times more than ever Ive read somewhere that fluoride destroys or calcifies the peneal gland.. which is suppose to be our spritual centre It makes me think they are trying to destroy and stop us from achieving our conscious awakening .I sure hope enough of us awaken as we are in a world of trouble if we dont.  All these dark forces are battling to bring us down in more ways than one Just my thoughts :)  Love and light.

             Umrates of change and some basic calculus will explain why vaccines are effective even though vaccine preventable diseases were beginning to decline prior to the advent of  vaccines. Moreover, it still doesnt explain why these diseases pop-up as soon as vaccine rates decline.

             Firstly, the body already has formaldehyde. So its not really that difficult for the body to handle it.
             <br/>
             And aluminum and mercury exposure occurs daily without vaccines, so the body handles it the same way.
             <br/>
             Its okay to force a correct paradigm against false illusions and magic woo.

             If it was just vaccine companies doing research, I would agree. But every public health agency in the world believe in vaccinations. Not too mention, that every medical school teaches public health and the science behind vaccines.

             Its beyond reprehensible that any so-called medical professional such as Offit, who has sworn to uphold the Hippocratic Oath (Thou Shalt do No Harm), could make such an irresponsible statement. Please get your facts straight, Angus. You clearly have a lot to learn about the acute vulnerability of a newborn babys brain &amp; central nervous system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given the number of antibody-producing cells in a childs bloodstream, and the number of immunological components contained in vaccines, it is reasonable to conclude that babies could effectively make antibodies to about 100,000 vaccines at one time.

             Hmmm.this sounds exactly like what an anti-vax person would do except with vaccine preventable diseases. Since you support the spread of vaccine preventable diseases, I suppose you would support the spread of AIDS.

             Why? If your children are vaxed then there is no worry is there?

             How bout keep YOUR children away from everyone else.

             Outbreaks of vax preventable diseases occur frequently among vaxed children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The polio vaccine temporarily
             <br/>
             reversed                     disease declines that were underway before
             <br/>
             the vaccine was                     introduced; this fact was
             <br/>
             deliberately covered up by health                     authorities. In
             <br/>
             Europe, polio declined in countries that both
             <br/>
             embraced and rejected the vaccine.

             Do you know any people with autistic children?
             <br/>
             That is the most common story among them. The child was fine and then after the round of shots the child is very different All of these parents just missed early development signs that suggest autism because autism doesnt just turn on.

             So questioning anything makes you a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist?

             Public Health agencies rely on private corporate resources for their research because they do not have near the same resources as private industry. When a new drug hits the market do you think the FDA replicates all the research the Drug Company does? They do NOT have the money or resources so most of the data comes from the very corporation looking for the approval.

              Not too mention, that every medical school teaches public health and the science behind vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who do you think supplies the Medical schools with their curriculum??? Doctors prescribe drugs at warp speed increasing amounts every year WHERE do they get the training to administer them? The very companies that make them!

             rates of change and some basic calculus will explain why vaccines are

             effective even though vaccine preventable diseases were beginning to
             <br/>
             decline prior to the advent of  vaccines.

             A little fear of what the powers that be are doing to us might help you at least do some checking.  If you dont question how will you ever know the truth?  You believe blindly everything that the medical profession says about vaccines, drugs, surgery and you wont live for long, or youll be dependent on them for life.  Their plan is to kill as many of us as they can.  Wake up!!!

Up there they are cheering for Us simply because this has never been achieved before and We Are Doing It. The darkside believe you me they ARE being shifted out BIG time by Us.

             Almost any vaccination can lead to noninfectious inflammatory reaction involving the nervous system. The common denominator consists of vasculopathy (disease of the blood vessels) that is often associated with demyelination (permeation of the critical electrical insulator of the brain cells). Charles M. Poser, Harvard Medical School Department of Neurology, 1947

             In a model of aluminum-mediated intoxication imposed to mice during pregnancy and early development, a 72% higher content of lipid peroxidation products was found in brain myelin. Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, 08/15/1997
            </p>
            <p>
             Note: Lipid peroxidation is associated with cellular damage resulting from oxidative stress (or Ischemia), which inhibits the capacity of cellular antioxidants, vital to natural immunity, by the unleashing of free radicals.  Scientific verification of demyelination linked to mitochondrial breakdown, caused by the intervention of aluminum on early childhood development in the brain.

             Two primary factors here, in determining the extent of vaccine derived neurological &amp; corresponding neuro-developmental damage (including the host of typical auto-immune failure responses) which are often overlooked in Medical circles? Timing &amp; synergy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Timing is CRITICAL. A newborn lacks sufficient protection to guard against premature damage to the blood barrier (physiological mechanism that alters the permeability of brain capillaries so that some substances, such as certain drugs, are prevented from entering brain tissue, while other substances are allowed to enter freely) on the brain  so that vital, unfinished area is still completely raw.

             A babys blood-brain barrier takes no less than 7 months in utero (latter stages of third trimester) to establish its primary protective shielding:
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been established that by week 28 of the intrauterine development the process of the structural and functional establishment of the BBB (blood-brain barrier) had been over as evidenced by the lack of specific alpha-1-globulin in umbilical blood of the neonates of the given gestation age.

             The Myelin Sheath is also significantly under-developed at birth. In fact, a baby undergoes continuous Myelin formation well after birth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Myelination appeared to occur earliest in the posterior fossa, with the middle cerebellar peduncle identifiable at only 3 months. By the age of 1 year, all major white matter tracts including the corpus callosum, subcortical white matter, and the internal capsule were well defined. However, due to subtle changes in appearance, the refined configuration of the adult brain was not attained until early adolescence. B A Holland, D K Haas, D Norman, M Brant-Zawadzki and T H Newton

             Similarly, the Meninges layering is designed to insulate the brain &amp; spinal cord from injury  notwithstanding the accumulative barrage of synergistic toxicity associated with early childhood vaccines. Probably no field in embryology has been less explored than that relating to the meninges. Lewis H. Weed

             Argus! For the pro-vaccine loons and denialist shills, I found this description of their mindset, that I find was really well fitting. What do you think of that? It is in reality just the opposite of what you claim it is.

             Denialism

             From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
            </p>
            <p>
             In human behavior, denialism is exhibited by individuals choosing to deny reality as a way to avoid dealing with an uncomfortable truth.[1] Author Paul OShea remarks, [It] is the refusal to accept an empirically verifiable reality. It is an essentially irrational action that withholds validation of a historical experience or event.[2] Author Michael Specter defined group denialism as when an entire segment of society, often struggling with the trauma of change, turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie.[3]
            </p>
            <p>
             In science, denialism has been defined as the rejection of basic concepts that are undisputed and well-supported parts of the scientific consensus on a topic in favor of ideas that are both radical and controversial.[4] It has been proposed that the various forms of denialism have the common feature of the rejection of overwhelming evidence and the generation of a controversy through attempts to deny that a consensus exists.

             Focusing on these things can backfire as grossness is subjective.  I find focusing on the toxic adjuvants included in vaccines to be a more effective eye opener for people not in the know.

             Actually Argus, Paul Offits study fails on all levels because what that study is is nothing more than a hypothesis and none of it is proven fact based on any actual human physiology. Offits study as well misses the mark on multiple levels because what he is always referring to is in regard to natural immunity, and that is an entirely different situation than what is involved in the use of vaccines, and in regard to vaccine derived immunity. Even when speaking of natural immunity, does not Offit even have as much comprehension ability to realize that 10,000 pathogens introduced into the human body at one time would be far more than would be needed to create a cytotoxic storm, and certain death? And he thinks in scientific terms that any human body and its immune system could handle that? Just because you are exposed to bacteria and pathogens in the environment, is certainly not the same thing as injecting all of those into the human body in one day. Such a claim is preposterous, and just as preposterous as Offits claims that eating a tuna sandwich creates more mercury exposure and risk than Thimerosal containing flu vaccine. Just as preposterous as well as his claim that eating a muffin with baking soda in it creates as much or more more aluminum exposure as an aluminum adjuvant containing vaccine, and/or multiple aluminum adjuvant containing vaccines. When was the last time Offit spoke of the science he has in relation to development of blood brain barrier in regard to an infant and/or young child; or even an adult? This is limit of the level of Offits actual vaccine safety science? This is what individuals and parents should trust?

             Original Antigenic Sin
            </p>
            <p>
             Original antigenic sin, also known as the Hoskins effect,[1] refers to the propensity of the bodys immune system to preferentially utilize immunological memory based on a previous infection when a second slightly different version of that foreign entity (e.g. a virus or bacterium) is encountered. This leaves the immune system trapped by the first response it has made to each antigen, and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during subsequent infections. The phenomenon of original antigenic sin has been described in relation to influenza virus, dengue fever, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to several other viruses.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             This phenomenon was first described in 1960 by Thomas Francis, Jr. in the article On the Doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin.[3][4] It is named by analogy to the theological concept of original sin. According to Thomas Francis, who originally described the idea, [3] and cited by Richard Krause:[4]
            </p>
            <p>
             The antibody of childhood is largely a response to dominant antigen of the virus causing the first type A influenza infection of the lifetime. [] The imprint established by the original virus infection governs the antibody response thereafter. This we have called the Doctrine of the Original Antigenic Sin.

             Excerpt: Unlike a computer, you cant reboot, or reinstall immune system programming to correct the glitch. Once the programming is set by the vaccine, thats how the programming stays from that point on, and thats why it is and should be called. original antigenic sin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Original antigenic sin, is a very graphic term and its no wonder its been removed from their vocabulary, because it implies a man-made problem.

            <p>
             Strategies to alleviate original antigenic sin responses to influenza viruses.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this study the only solution they appear to have found is in administering vaccines with a highly reactive squalene-based oil-in-water nanoemulsion in it, and then as well as they state,
            </p>
            <p>
             we also found that repeated immunization with the second viral strain relieved the effects of original antigenic sin.
            </p>
            <p>
             First of all squalene oil is highly reactive and damaging to the proper workings of the immune system, and is as well known to trigger autoimmune reactions to the bodys own tissues and organs. That is why the US to this point has not used it in their vaccines. Squalene oil is said as well to have been an ingredient in the flu vaccines in other countries that allow use of squalene oil, that caused large numbers of children with vaccine induced narcolepsy.

             Medical deception
             <br/>
             So what are some of the true reasons for the decrease in disease in the last century? From his book Health and Healing, Dr. Andrew Weil said it best with the following statement:
            </p>
            <p>
             Scientific medicine has taken credit it does not deserve for some advances in health. Most people believe that victory over the infectious diseases of the last century came with the invention of immunizations. In fact, cholera, typhoid, tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, etc, were in decline before vaccines for them became available  the result of better methods of sanitation, sewage disposal, and distribution of food and water.

             The absurdity of Offits mumbo jumbo theories should be obvious to anyone who hasnt had all common sense inoculated out of them.  The immunological challenges that a baby faces in a normal day to day environment are vastly different then  having multiple disease strains (not to mention all the other  toxic ingredients) forcibly injected directly into the body BYPASSING the critical frontier barriers of the immune system all at one go a recipe for an ever sicker generation as is all too apparent.

             So, what you are saying Jim Bob, is that just like big pharma does with their vaccine and drug clinical trials, that if your spin the numbers enough perhaps through again multiple end point numbers, that you can produce any positively desired result that you want.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reality of the situation is that if and when these said so called diseases pop up again, the minute vaccination coverage slightly declines; is only a further testament to the vaccines not working and being ineffective. It is likely as well that any claimed slight reduction in vaccine coverage actually had nothing to do with it, for two reasons. One, the CDC is not telling you that nor of the outbreaks that were found to be in 80% or more that were fully vaccinated, and with only a small portion if any outbreak in the small in number unvaccinated groups. These outbreaks have occurred as well while the required vaccine uptake was at the so called desired herd immunity for vaccines level.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two, vaccine derived herd immunity is a complete myth, and an impossibility. It is NOT the same thing as naturally derived herd immunity, and never can be. Review the below information in regard to vaccine derived herd immunity, and realize what I state this.

             Three, vaccines do shed, and opposed to the CDCs claim that they do not, and as well in their claim that there is no issue there. Vaccines in fact and in likely far more than my opinion, have created the situation where such as measles and pertussis can and will not ever be eradicated as long as vaccines are used. All those vaccines are doing is creating more antigenic shift, (further evading an usefulness of the existing vaccine) and as well vaccines cause an increase in the virulence of other like pathogens. That said increase in virulence of other strains was as well found in even as much as the Gardasil clinical trials, as per the FDA VRBPAC Preapproval document; and later was simply ignored, in favor of fast track approval of this now known potentially very harmful and dangerous vaccine.

             And as always Argus, obviously you have never even bothered to read the account of that situation, and what Eleanor McBean actually stated in regard to those said, and yes existing vaccines in that time period of history. She never stated it was due to any existing Spanish flu vaccine, but the existing and crude vaccines during WW1, and prior to the said what was assumed to be the and a Spanish flu outbreak in 1918.
            </p>
            <p>
             As always Argus, you need to have this stuff pushed right under your nose, because you refuse to educate yourself to the evidence.

             The 1918 Influenza Epidemic Was a Vaccine  Caused Disease
            </p>
            <p>
             Excerpts:
            </p>
            <p>
             If we check back in history to that 1918 flu period, we will see that it suddenly struck just after the end of World War I when our soldiers were returning home from overseas. That was the first war in hich all the known vaccines were forced on all the servicemen. This mish-mash of poison drugs and putrid protein of which the vaccines were composed, caused such widespread disease and death among the soldiers that it was the common talk of the day, that more of our men were being killed by medical shots than by enemy shots from guns.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most people believe their doctors and government officials, and do what they say. The result was, that almost the entire population submitted to the shots without question, and it was only a matter of hours until people began dropping dead in agony, while many others collapsed with a disease of such virulence that no one had ever seen anything like it before. They had all the characteristics of the diseases they had been vaccinated against, the high fever, chills, pain, cramps, diarrhea, etc. of typhoid, and the pneumonia like lung and throat congestion of diphtheria and the vomiting,
             <br/>
             headache, weakness and misery of hepatitis from the jungle fever shots, and the outbreak of sores on the skin from the smallpox shots, along with paralysis from all the shots, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             The doctors were baffled, and claimed they didnt know what caused the strange and deadly disease, and they certainly had no cure. They should have known the underlying cause was the vaccinations, because the same thing happened to the soldiers after they had their shots at camp. The typhoid fever shots caused a worse form of the disease which they called
             <br/>
             para-typhoid. Then they tried to suppress the symptoms of that one with a stronger vaccine which caused a still more serious disease which killed and disabled a great many men. The combination of all the poison vaccines fermenting together in the body, caused such violent reactions that they could not cope with the situation. Disaster ran rampant in the camps. Some
             <br/>
             of the military hospitals were filled with nothing but paralyzed soldiers, and they were called war casualties, even before they left American soil.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a shorter war than the vaccine-makers had planned on, only about a year for us, so the vaccine promoters had a lot of unused, spoiling vaccines left over which they wanted to sell at a good profit. So they did what they usually do, they called a meeting behind closed doors, and plotted the whole sordid program, a nationwide (worldwide) vaccination drive using all their vaccines, and telling the people that the soldiers were coming home with many dread diseases contracted in foreign countries and that it was the patriotic duty of every man, woman and child to get protected by rushing down to the vaccination centers and having all the shots.

             Tending Nurse Claimed Spanish Influenza Outbreak of 1918 Caused byVaccinations
             <br/>
             CHAPTER 2 THE SPANISH INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC OF 1918 WAS CAUSED BY VACCINATIONS
            </p>
            <p>
             The people believed them because, first of all, they wanted to believe their doctors, and second, the returning soldiers certainly had been sick. They didnt know it was from doctor-made vaccine diseases, as the army doctors dont tell them things like that. Many of the returned soldiers were disabled for life by these drug-induced diseases. Many were insane from postvaccinal encephalitis, but the doctors called it shell shock, even though many had never left American soil.
            </p>
            <p>
             The conglomerate disease brought on by the many poison vaccines baffled the doctors, as they never had a vaccination spree before which used so many different vaccines. The new disease they had created had symptoms of all the diseases they had injected into the man. There was the high fever, extreme weakness, abdominal rash and intestinal disturbance characteristic of typhoid. The diphtheria vaccine caused lung congestion, chills and fever, swollen, sore throat clogged with the false membrane, and the choking suffocation because of difficulty in breathing followed by gasping and death, after which the body turned black from stagnant blood that had been deprived of oxygen in the suffocation stages. In early days they called it Black Death. The other vaccines cause their own reactions  paralysis, brain damage, lockjaw, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             When doctors had tried to suppress the symptoms of the typhoid with a stronger vaccine, it caused a worse form of typhoid which they named paratyphoid. But when they concocted a stronger and more dangerous vaccine to suppress that one, they created an even worse disease which they didnt have a name for. What should they call it? They didnt want to tell the people what it really was  their own Frankenstein monster which they had created with their vaccines and suppressive medicines. They wanted to direct the blame away from themselves, so they called it Spanish Influenza. It was certainly not of Spanish origin, and the Spanish people resented the implication that the world-wide scourge of that day should be blamed on them. But the name stuck and American medical doctors and vaccine makers were not suspected of the crime of this widespread devastation  the 1918 Flu Epidemic. It is only in recent years that researchers have been digging up the facts and laying the blame where it belongs.

             You have been drinking to much of the Paul Offit misinformation and no actual physiological science to back it up, Kool-AidJim Bob!
            </p>
            <p>
             Chemically manufactured formaldehyde is obviously not the same substance as is produced small amounts of in the human body, through metabolism. Also you are again failing to realize that there is a big difference and no comparison to rationally be made in the comparison of naturally occurring substances in the human body, and that of unnaturally injecting them. it is not the same thing, nor does the body process it in the same way, nor the immune system. You circumvent every natural and biological process in doing so, and the misunderstanding of that is just one more nail in the coffin in any belief in and/or in thinking and believing that vaccine developing immunologists have any real clue as to the actual immune system and in and as to the harm they are doing.  they are clearly yet in the dark ages, as is Offit by choice. They know what the real science would show, and it is far to late to ever do those studies, as the result would and could potentially level the entire vaccine industry.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eating a muffin with aluminum containing baking powder in it, is NOT the same thing as injecting an aluminum adjuvant containing vaccine, nor in regard to multiple vaccines. Eating a tuna sandwich is not the same thing as injecting Thimerosal, nor is any of handled by the human body and nor eliminated from the body and nor detoxed in the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fact that the CDC has NEVER had any vaccine aluminum adjuvant safety studies, nor to rely on, can easily be understood as to why, in the below expose on the said issue.

             This below is a commonly told parental account of vaccine harm, and that which and as it has happened to previously healthy children, and as well in the numerous accounts of the downward spiral into autism (ASD). There is no way anyone in these situations is born with this, nor without environmental and specifically vaccine causation factors in place. Jim Bob, read carefully.

             My daughter (name withheld for privacy). Letter to Congress to be On the Record for the Federal Response to Autism Hearing.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would like to share with you my daughters vaccine injury story for the record. My story is a lot like others, same time frame and order of symptoms, vomiting, so called gastrointestinal virus, then the fever, then banging of her head, constant screaming and aggressive and repetitive behaviors and now autism and chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction. Similar to Hannah Poling.
            </p>
            <p>
             My daughter was born a beautiful baby girl on (xxxx). She was always the sweet loving little girl I had hoped for her sister. They were the best of friends always there for each other. On (xxxx) I asked her father take her to get her shots, oddly this was the VERY FIRST time I had made him take her to the Doctor. I usually did that, but that day, I felt something in the pit of my stomach. I didnt want to see her get her shots.again, I felt guilty I guess. To this day I remember that feeling in my gut. But she was already behind She was 15 months and NEEDED her one year vaccinations, so I thought. He took her in, she got her vaccinations, she got HEP B, POLIO, DTaP, Hib, MMR, VARICELLA, and the Pneumonia vaccine. If you can count, you will see thats 11 vaccines for 11 diseases combined into 7 shots.
            </p>
            <p>
             She came home and took a nap. That day changed everything, my beautiful little girl (xxxx), went from a sweet ultra-loveable child to 2 days later, vomiting projectile exorcism-like vomit through her nose and mouth almost choking her even while sleeping and with nothing to eat or drink. I had never seen her like this. She wouldnt take milk anymore. I called the nurse hot line and they assured me it was nothing. Keep her hydrated.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was very sick for about a week of projectile vomiting and AFTER she had gotten over the so called gastrointestinal virus, she had a high fever for 3 days. After that she had a cough and congestion along with being VERY FUSSY and CRYING ALL THE TIME. Keep in mind for the last 2 weeks, I am up EVERY HOUR, every night. Her dad couldnt console her, and barely could I, she would arch her back and just SCREAM, and SCREAM, and SCREAM, til no end. Not every 2 or 3 hours, but every hour. She started banging her head on the tile floor holding her head in her hands as if she was in pain. It was horrible, I had no idea what was happening to her. The drs just kept telling me, she has a stomach bug, she will be ok, she has a cold, shell be ok, this is normal. About a week later and 14 days after her vaccinations she broke out in a rash all over her arms, legs, butt and face but not on her trunk, we now are pretty sure it is the same rash as Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome which is proven to be a known side effect after receiving IMMUNIZATIONS and studies cite that associated immunizations are the Polio, Diphtheria, Influenza, Pertussis, Measles, Smallpox, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, H1N1. It has also been long known that there is an association between Gianotti-Crosti syndrome and vaccination with the rash appearing days to weeks after immunization.

             We took her to the pediatrician about the rash and she said she must have sensitive skin and asked if we changed our laundry soap, because she sees this a lot in fair skinned children I hadnt changed soap or anything. The rash got worse, so I took her to the Emergency room. There the Dr concluded it was virally related and to just let the rash run its course. The MMR live viruses need incubation time and this exactly adds up to getting the virus from the vaccinations. Keep in mind for the last 2 weeks, I am up EVERY HOUR, every night. Her dad couldnt console her, and barely could I, she would arch her back and just SCREAM, and SCREAM, and SCREAM, til no end. Not every 2 hours, every hour. It was horrible, I had no idea what was happening to her. The drs just kept telling me, she has a stomach bug, she will be ok, she has a cold, she will be ok, this is normal.
            </p>
            <p>
             It wasnt normal. My daughter was so sick and I couldnt comfort her at all. The drs made me feel like I was an over worried mom.
            </p>
            <p>
             I tried to comfort her the most I could and helped her get plenty of rest. She eventually started getting over the sicknesses. But that week started displaying unusual behavior we had NEVER seen before, she was outside with her sister, walked up to her for no reason and punched her and walked away. She became aggressive. She became obsessive with toys, repeating the same things over and over, lining up toys and cars, putting her shoes or socks on over and over and over. She started walking on her toes. She stopped saying mama and da-da for 3 months. She stopped playing with other children at get togethers. She started standing straight in front of the tv screen like she couldnt see and wouldnt respond to her name. Her favorite papa and grandma, she no longer knew, she was scared to death around people who didnt live with her. She had an extremely close bond with her grandma before this. She was grandmas favorite, now she was afraid of grandma? She became someone different. A child frightened of being around other people, and playing with others her age. To this day, over a year and a half later, she still walks on her toes and spins all day in circles, she still throws absolutely HORRIBLE temper tantrums, its like she cant communicate what she wants or needs to us, even though she can speak more now than right after her vaccinations. My daughter would never drink milk for a year after her shots. When I reintroduced it, she displays greater autism symptoms.We cant get her to brush her teeth without holding her down and her screaming bloody murder, its like the feeling of it bothers her. She plays with the same toys in the same way over and over, like a puzzle, she puts it together over a hundred times for an hour. We try to go to church and she will not allow us to leave her in the nursery WITH HER OWN SISTER, she is scared to death and crys and screams because of other children she doesnt know. She constantly spins and walks on her toes. She still has left over raised bumps on her upper arms and elbows from that rash that flares up if she gets sick. She has constant bowel problems, she has lots of diarrhea and constipation. My daughter is not the same daughter I had on 7/22/2011. My dad, her grandpa says no matter what anyone says, I saw (XXX) change, and I agree. The vaccinations changed my daughter for life.I did the right things, I listened to the pediatrician, I took my child for all her vaccinations, and this is what happened. My child is paying the price. This is not some theory this is the reality of what vaccinations are doing to our precious children. Allow us to skip vaccinations without pediatricians firing us and giving us the talk like we are the bad ones. Demand that America continue to allow us to exempt from these if we the parents choose to. Help us to get bio-medical care for autism instead of pharmaceutical symptom cover up medications. Allow us to freely go to naturopathic and DAN Drs who have shown to help children like my child. Help our children get better. They did not ask for this.

             What are you worried about ?  If everyone else is vaccinated they are fully protected  from disease,right? But not to worry if you have a vaccine reaction upon receiving your next vaccine injecting aborted fetal tissue ,monkey kidney tissue and formaldehyde into your blood stream that leaves you mentally or physically impaired the FACT is the U.S. government has a nice big fat vaccine injury account with millions of dollars in it for those Americans injured by vaccines.Ask yourself if vaccines are not dangerous then why does the U.S. gov. have a vaccine injury account?Oh!  vaccines dont cause injuries or death its  just our imagination. F.Y.I  The U.S. constitution protects the rights of my children to attend any school they choose vaccinated or not! My children will go WHEREVER they please. If you dont like it keep your kids at home!!

If children are to acquire these actually survivable illnesses, they need to have an intact and well working immune system unhindered by vaccine toxicity and all the polluted contamination that are inevitably and potentially present in vaccines. We as well dont need vaccinated children causing antigenic shift in any of the typical and basic illnesses vaccinated for.
            </p>
            <p>
             We dont need vaccination as well causing shift in the dominant strains of these pathogens, and creating increased virulence of similar strains of pathogen that previously were not an issue, but now are. Example, the shift in B para-pertussis now becoming more dominant than B pertussis in the current vaccine.

             Acellular pertussis vaccination enhances B. parapertussis colonization
            </p>
            <p>
             An acellular whooping cough vaccine actually enhances the colonization of Bordetella parapertussis in mice; pointing towards a rise in B. parapertussis incidence resulting from acellular vaccination, which may have contributed to the observed increase in whooping cough over the last decade.

             Reply: They are just simply all mislead by 100 years of medical mafia fraud and control of information. Once you realize the reality of the true history pharmaceutical medicine, all the rest as to how and why then clearly falls into place, as to being understood the how and why everything is as it is. As well in understanding why it remains so failed, and as to why it will obviously continue to remain that way, and without any real improvements.

He even went and wrote about titled, Do You Believe in Magic; which of course entirely out of context and failing to see the much bigger picture he ran down and attacked any and all means to alternative health practices, supplements, and vitamins, but to leave standing of course only those practices involving chemical drugs and toxic potentially contaminated vaccines. He has since also had media coverage in all major media sources further promoting his standing and the sale of his book. He also has promoted numerous articles on the internet promoting the same message.

             The truth is quite clear that he has been quite irrational and very much wrong about it all, and as well the reality of it all, and the real independent science, is NOT on his, Offits side. He as well wants to continue with all the needless suffering, quite obviously. Just so he can continue to have his piece of the that delusional pie.

            <p>
             The following is a list of important Clinical Studies that document the paramount importance of micronutrients and nutrition in maintaining optimum health.
            </p>
            <p>
             Together with our Cellular Health and WHO Documents pages, it will be hard for you to find a more comprehensive library on the health benefits of vitamins, micronutrients and nutrition in the battle against todays most common diseases of the industrialized and the developing world.
            </p>
            <p>
             In documenting these studies and reports we have taken great care to include studies from the earliest years possible. We did this to document that an abundance of knowledge and scientific data on natural health has been available for 50, 60, 70 even 80 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is no coincidence that this knowledge was ignored, hidden and even obstructed. All this happened in the interest and on behalf of a growing influence of the pharmaceutical investment business with disease. This influence reached out to the medical schools, media and politicians worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine, if this natural health information had not have been suppressed by the business with disease for decades. How many lives could have been saved?
            </p>
            <p>
             Dont you think it is time for change? We encourage you to use the following health information whether you are a patient, health professional or politician, whether you are living in an industrialized country or in a developing country.

             You see, this right here is what Offit suffers from; and because of that depraved condition, thus there is no spokesman at the CDC competent enough to be worthy of ever being taken seriously nor ever listening to.

             Quite obviously this is not only a problem with this type of vaccine, but it is a problem with all vaccines, regardless of the source of animal origin as to and regarding the specific vaccine production. The issue of adventitious agents remaining in vaccines has been and has remained a problem ever since it was known of the SV 40 contamination in the early polio vaccine. Potential unwanted contamination continues to be a potential problem for all vaccines, based on other such vaccine contamination that has as well been noted in the literature and data. There is simply no known way by any current vaccine purification step process, to screen for all such potential contaminants. Even specifically known of and potential contaminants can not all be purified from or screened out vaccine production, much more the largely unknown contaminants. The CDC has known this for decades, and they have admitted to the potential and unknown risk to health. But you wont read about that on the CDC site itself, but a subset of pages that was once available.

             Evaluation of the Human Host Range of Bovine and Porcine Viruses that may Contaminate Bovine Serum and Porcine Trypsin Used in the Manufacture of Biological Products
            </p>
            <p>
             Abstract
             <br/>
             Current U.S. requirements for testing cell substrates used in production of human biological products for contamination with bovine and porcine viruses are U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 9CFR tests for bovine serum or porcine trypsin. 9CFR requires testing of bovine serum for seven specific viruses in six families (immunofluorescence) and at least 2 additional families non-specifically (cytopathicity and hemadsorption). 9CFR testing of porcine trypsin is for porcine parvovirus. Recent contaminations suggest these tests may not be sufficient. Assay sensitivity was not the issue for these contaminations that were caused by viruses/virus families not represented in the 9CFR screen. A detailed literature search was undertaken to determine which viruses that infect cattle or swine or bovine or porcine cells in culture also have human host range [ability to infect humans or human cells in culture] and to predict their detection by the currently used 9CFR procedures. There are more viruses of potential risk to biological products manufactured using bovine or porcine raw materials than are likely to be detected by 9CFR testing procedures; even within families, not all members would necessarily be detected. Testing gaps and alternative methodologies should be evaluated to continue to ensure safe, high quality human biologicals.

             Current U.S. requirements for testing cell substrates used in production of human biological products (*VACCINES*) for contamination with bovine and porcine viruses are U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 9CFR tests for bovine serum or porcine trypsin. 9CFR requires testing of bovine serum for seven specific viruses in six families (immunofluorescence) and at least 2 additional families non-specifically (cytopathicity and hemadsorption). 9CFR testing of porcine trypsin is for porcine parvovirus. Recent contaminations suggest these tests may not be sufficient. Assay sensitivity was not the issue for these contaminations that were caused by viruses/virus families not represented in the 9CFR screen. A detailed literature search was undertaken to determine which viruses that infect cattle or swine or bovine or porcine cells in culture also have human host range [ability to infect humans or human cells in culture] and to predict their detection by the currently used 9CFR procedures. There are more viruses of potential risk to biological products manufactured using bovine or porcine raw materials than are likely to be detected by 9CFR testing procedures; even within families, not all members would necessarily be detected.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cell-culture derived vaccines for human use were developed in the 1950s. Since fetal calf serum and bovine or porcine trypsin were used in cell culture, the 9CFR tests developed for veterinary use to screen for viruses that can infect cattle and swine were implemented by the authorities regulating human vaccines. However, many viruses not of significant concern to the cattle and swine industry are not addressed by the 9CFR testing. Today, over half a century after cell culture-derived vaccines were initially developed, the human biologics industry is still using the methods specified in the 9CFR regulations for testing FBS and porcine trypsin.

             How much does Paul Offit get paid for his unscientific and bogus speaking engagements, Argus?
            </p>
            <p>
             There is now way it can be argued that modern medicine is superior to naturopathic protocols and as well natural supplements and vitamins; when modern medicine has the obviously failed record that it does. To do that and make that said claim is entirely hypocritical, and majorly delusional. But only they pharma, have the corrupt with fraud clinical trials so called science to back all their more benefit than harm done claims, right Argus? Only they have and can fund the follow up studies proclaiming no problem found, and which further promotes the damage done, unabated.
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems to be your hypocritical view of the world, Argus; that only toxic vaccines and pharmaceuticals retain any scientific success value. So, lets look at the actual success that has in reality actually had. And this well done evaluation does not even count into the official body count those deaths from vaccines, and nor the level of physical harm done by vaccines.

             Death by Medicine
            </p>
            <p>
             By Gary Null, Ph.D., PhD; Carolyn Dean MD, ND; Martin Feldman, MD; Debora Rasio, MD; and Dorothy Smith, PhD
            </p>
            <p>
             A definitive review and close reading of medical peer-review journals, and government health statistics shows that American medicine frequently causes more harm than good. In fact is has now been determined to be a leading cause of death in the US, if not the actual leading cause of death.

             [A very small Ruling Cabal uses the power of the National Security State which emerged after WW2 and Roswell to implement an Alien Agenda which is so evil it is incredulous to even those who are briefed on it.

             The bottom line is that a very small secret Ruling Cabal of top

             Policy-Makers are able to impose their agenda upon the earths masses

             some insiders have called an Alien Agenda to depopulate the earth of

             Best to know what data you would accept first.  If you see a conspiracy at every turn, for example, would it matter what I presented?   I can contact a colleague of mine in charge of influenza surveillance who can provide me with all the data and studies you want, but I fear it would be a futile exercise.
             <br/>
             A glance at some of your writing suggests to me that you want something that is proven conclusively to be 100% safe with 100% efficacy.  You might be waiting for awhile.  There is a potential risk in everything in medicine and no one denies that.  It should be always asked whether the benefits outweigh the harms.
             <br/>
             Have you heard of acrylamide in deep fried foods or aflatoxin in peanut butter?  I can easily build a case against these foods using your tactics. You referenced six sources and that is to supposed to embody our current understanding of things?  Forgive me but that is the same tactic used by young earth creationists regarding evolution, geology, cosmology etc.
             <br/>
             I really have no interest in an ongoing debate with you.  If you have something published in a peer- reviewed, reputable scientific journal , I would like to read it though. I doubt your claims would withstand the scrutiny brought forth by the scientific community.
             <br/>
             I still dont understand the disclaimer.  This is not intended as medical advice? Sure sounds like that to me.

             Oh dear!  You just demonstrated my point and it did not take you very long.
            </p>
            <p>
             1) you did not mention what data you would accept that would convince you that flu vaccines are efficacious.  I doubt there is any in your mind.  For me, if a population before and after immunization gets the same rate of influenza that suggests the vaccine is not working.  Pretty simple.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) You cited two studies, one suggesting a possible link between maternal inflammation and autism, and another suggesting a) tendency toward greater inflammatory responding to immune triggers may predict risk of adverse outcomes b) milder inflammatory reactions caused by vaccines compared with actual infection and c) milder reaction may not be benign.  Where to begin?  1) This has absolutely nothing to do with the challenge you posed to me!  2) Have you been evaluated for your ability to synthesize scientific literature?  What you have done would get you an F in any undergraduate science course  3) Inflammation is a generic response to many insults to our body.  A cold, exercise, pregnancy itself.  The list is endless.  Furthermore, the irony of this is that the study you cited supports vaccines because of its lower inflammatory response.  Are you suggesting then that these women should get influenza, have a major inflammatory response, and then cause autism in their child?  That is essentially where your flawed logic would lead you.  Fortunately, there is no evidence for this but that does not seem to bother you.
             <br/>
             I cannot comment on the food and viruses book but your use of the first two references suggests to me that you would have misunderstood that too.
             <br/>
             I really am speechless regarding your response.  Is there anything or anyone that can convince you to step back and think about your conclusions?  Or have you convinced yourself that you have mastered the art of critically appraising scientific literature?
             <br/>
             My analogy of having a debate with a young-earth creationist stands even more firmly after reading your reply.   I can also now see why people have said the things they have about you.  See ya!

             Oh Sam, another conspiracy theorist are we?  Only vaccinated people get sick?  Surprised that financial gain drives innovation, sometimes even in medicine?  Science and medicine will advance despite people like you.  Your time will come, if it hasnt already, where you will benefit from the efforts of those who apply reason, logic, and the scientific method.

             Hmm Never heard back re. what you said about Dr. McBean and the influenza vaccine re. 1918  Here is what she actually said in an article she wrote about the 1918 epidemicthe 1918 Spanish Influenza was a vaccine-induced disease caused by extreme body poisoning from the conglomeration of many different vaccines . She offers

             I took note of that one an eye opener from even way back then:
            </p>
            <p>
             The Flu 1918 and Now  Eleanor McBean PhD, ND. Swine Flu Expose, Chapter2 excerpts:
            </p>
            <p>
             I WAS AN ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVER OF THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC. All the doctors and people who were living at the time of the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic say it was the most terrible disease the world has ever had. Strong men, hale and hearty, one day would be dead the next. The disease had the characteristics of pneumonia, smallpox, paralysis and all the diseases the people had been VACCINATED WITH immediately following World War 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practically the entire population had been injected SEEDED WITH A DOZEN OR MORE DISEASES  or toxic serums. When all those doctor-made diseases started breaking out all at once it was tragic.
            </p>
            <p>
              That pandemic dragged on for two years, kept alive with the addition of more poison drugs administered by the doctors who tried to suppress the symptoms. As far as I could find out, THE FLU HIT ONLY THE VACCINATED. Those who had refused the shots ESCAPED THE FLU. My family had REFUSED all the vaccinations so we remained well all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             THE REST IS HISTORY
             <br/>
              50 million people died worldwide
             <br/>
              So the evidence strongly suggests the Spanish Flu of 1918 was actually created and then spread through vaccinations !
             <br/>
              But, the panic-stricken public DEMANDED A VACCINATION, not realizing that was the way in which the disease was spreading. Will history repeat itself ?
            </p>
            <p>
             If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it  Joseph Goebbels (Jewish Virtual Library. American  Israel Cooperative Enterprise)
            </p>
            <p>
             The only safe vaccine is a vaccine that is never used  Dr James.A.Shannon (national institutes of health Director)

             If you dont believe that the elite are capable of carrying out a biological attack (virus/disease) on the population. then you obviously have learned nothing from history. They will use this inflated Swine Flu scare and/or other flu/viruses to take away your guns and your liberty. Scientists tell us this SWINE FLU is a newly mutated virus, a combination of swine, bird and human flu virus [U.S. journalist gathers evidence swine flu virus began life in lab49:18min].

             MMR contains  Chick Chicken Embryo, it not listed as a Vaccine, under Chicken Embryo #7 -as one that contains it. My daughter was 12 mos old, she I was introducing  foods to, and yes I introduced to her,  a scrambled egg, nothing added, simply the egg it self. One tiny bite,  reactions galore instant negative reactions. Her eyes began running syrupy tears, her nose water leaking, she then gasping, as yes her throat was closing, a dose of Benadryl Stat. A call to her Pediatrician he to say, she will be fine, as the Benadryl did work. This was one bite of scrambled egg the size of a dime. She was to go in, same time for her 12 month check, and yes  her Vaccines. This was the very next day, her appt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Her Pediatrician was sage, he near 70, he an old school doctor, he who also was high ranked at our major main Childrens Hospital. He and I did not discuss his personal opinions on vaccines.  He was no bones, no glitter, no modern lingo, he was a Doctor who believed in balance. Medicine and Man, as in parenting goes a long way, vs he being one to  tell a parent you have to, as the powers say I am to tell you, this is what you have to do. He to educate me as a parent, giving me the power of options was him. * He examining my perfectly healthy 12 month old, he piped up*
            </p>
            <p>
             You did good mom, you may have, I should say, You saved your daughters life, by giving her egg. I was confused. He to say, she is scheduled for her MMR vaccine today, and she is NOT going to get it. He to say, in fact, she may never have it, ever. Your daughter is  highly allergic to Chicken Embryo,  Egg  and Chicken Embryo is the base of the MMR. Had you not given her Egg yesterday, me to immunize her with the MMR, she would have gone into Anaphylactic shock before our eyes, and she to possibly suffer even worse affects as this is a unpredicted,  once it were to enter her body. * I remember my knees feeling weak, that I stared at him,  a chicken embryo this an ingredient within an immunization that could have, would have possibly maimed my daughter.for life, or even killed her. I Thank GOD  Dr. Miller was her doctor, and he was awake, and aware, and listening, that he was  above the vaccine, that he instantly reacted with  NO and Never. Not, patronizing me, it may have been something else, that caused her reactions yesterday. Lets put her on trial and make a bet on her life, roll the dice,  lets give it to her anyway as this is why she is here.
            </p>
            <p>
             NO he used a Bolded marker and he wrote inside her file and on her papers  EGG ALLERGY  Do not administer any vaccines, nor medications with Chicken Embryo  he to initial it. He to tell me, they day will come, if you are to enroll her into a preschool and or etc, you can have them personally contact me. As they will demand her records of immunization. She not having her MMR, they will patronize you, this isnt of your control, this is her life protected  by not being immunized he to say, its to come, Mom. Its to come, that you will be put into a position they will attempt to use her lack of Immunizations against you and her.
            </p>
            <p>
             Give them my phone number, and I will gladly speak with who needs answers, that they feel you are not able to satisfy them. As this is what they do, the day will come, as again, as my professional opinion is, She should NEVER be Vaccinated -injected with the MMR vaccine. Not until its proven, that she is no longer allergic to Chicken Embryo, which could take years to determine.
            </p>
            <p>
             * Sigh, Dr. Miller Retired, before my daughter was preschool age. He instilled into me  priceless empowerment, he to say, YOU know whats best for your daughter, read, educate yourself, do not allow any Doctor to tell you, that You are NOT the final decision maker within your daughters health, As you are her Voice, not theirs. Do not accept Ambiguous information, persuasive pressuring as Medically necessary for her to be subjected to (Vaccines). ASK Questions.  Keep it factual, remain as you have been present to Me her doctor  TALK, Speak Communicate with her future doctors, when there is  real issues  as many (human nature) become hypochondriac over every little thing, this when the doctor  cannot decipher from the parent,  what is of scale,
             <br/>
             Insignificant to  life threatening  the lines and roles become blurred, and the one who suffers  Is baby/child/children  NOT a risk worth taking, as it could be a detriment they suffer forever.
            </p>
            <p>
             -I share my experience here, for Parents, grandparents, and care takers. Reporting Food Reactions is a necessary  as we ARE the last to know until it is presented to us, pending on ? how educated our childrens doctors are?
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to know before, not during, not after. Thank you for your website. * I am a new Grandma, and my infant granddaughter is her Mothers focus,  she has refused her Vaccines as her Dr. is wanting to Jab away at her -she is 4mos old, how long will her Doctor  allow this refusal  or it may be, my daughter needs to  change doctors vs Submitting.. to one  DR who finds her refusal defiance, and or even illegal? as if she is committing a crime. This is persuasive language using fear tactics. If you do not  there will be consequences
            </p>
            <p>
             Parents who withhold Vaccines should be  held   held to what?  WE are Held as were are the Parent,  our children are our responsibility, we are responsible 24/7. We are responsible, OUR LIABLE only when our Baby/child has a life threatening reaction to a Vaccine, You mother you okd it, you  approved the injection, no one twisted your arm. A very sticky messy double edged sword isnt it.

            </p>
            <p>
             Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies of childhood, with a prevalence of 1% to 3% in children under 3 years of age. It is often associated with eczema in infants and asthma in young children. As most children outgrow their egg allergy, the prevalence in adulthood is much lower and is estimated at 0.1%. The most common egg allergy is to egg white. Cross-sensitivity with egg yolk and chicken protein has been described.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vaccines that contain small quantities of egg protein can cause hypersensitivity reactions in some people with allergies to eggs. In Canada, there are several vaccines manufactured by processes involving hens eggs or their derivatives, such as chick cell cultures. This manufacturing process may result in the following vaccines containing trace amounts of residual egg and chicken protein:
            </p>
            <p>
             measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines
            </p>
            <p>
             measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine
            </p>
            <p>
             influenza vaccines
            </p>
            <p>
             tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine
            </p>
            <p>
             RabAvertrabies vaccine
            </p>
            <p>
             yellow fever (YF) vaccine
            </p>
            <p>
             Hypersensitivity reactions occurring following receipt of these vaccines varies considerably in relation to the amount of residual egg and chicken protein in the vaccine.
            </p>
            <p>
              READ more and or research it on your own, as this is from a Canadian Web, they do or do not use the same  identical vaccines provided by Pharma  as we know manufacturers may vary, dependent upon laws of agency  :

             Thats awesome they are letting Paulie Offit write articles on the subject.  We both used to pimp together back in the mid 90s.  That gives me hope that I can be somebody one day.  Go Paulie, youre an inspiration to all the other pimps like me who feel like we will be slapping hoes for the rest of our lives.  Thank you Argus for sharing, you truly know how to cut to the core of me.

             No, yall leave Paulie alone.  When we was pimpin he never one slapped one of his hoes.  Paulie Offit was a pimps pimp.  Dude could work like 5 blocks by himself.  Which was a big deal when you drive a Ford Pinto.  Argus, tell them.  Tell them Paulie is a good man.  He even paid his hoes half of the money they hustled.  If that aint a good man, I dont know one.

             JimBob is not saying anything.  He just repeats stuff he got off of Wikepedia.  He and Argus ask for scientific evidence but gives none to back up his side.  He has no brain, cant think outside of the box and has the personality of a dry mop.

             I think you are a good judge about loony due to your extreme loonieness.  You are a poet and a scholar Argus, I dont care how the pharma companies talk about how you give great face.  Im not talking about that.  Argus, I understand you.  Its okay that you cant think outside of the box and can only follow orders.  I was once a government troll as well but got tired of getting my back side pounded by the governments vein cane.  You will get tired of it too one day.  But for now, enjoy the fog.

             Firstly you are a dumbass.  Formaldehyde has been classified as a known human carcinogen (thats cancer causing substance) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and as a probable human carcinogen by the EPA.  From cancer.gov, Im not disagreeing with you JimmyB, just throwing that out there.  And how often does our body get injected with mercury and aluminum daily?  Are there little mercury Mosquitos and aluminum chiggers injecting us with their metallic saliva?

             I hear you JimmyB, I also wish the consequences of the pro-vax community wasnt so high.  Then we wouldnt have so many brain dead idiots like yourself spouting out lies that they read on Wikipedia.  JimmyB can only post shit he has read, he never comes up with his own information.  Keep getting your yearly flu shot Jimmy, speed up your dieing process so we dont have to hear you steal information from other brain dead idiots anymore.

             So according to you, 3 of the 7 disgusting things are used in the rabies vaccine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Am I correct in assuming that you would rather die a horrible, agonizing, completely undignified death, than receive the lifesaving (albeit painful) series of vaccines?? Once the symptoms of rabies appear, death is inevitable. This vaccine has saved countless lives, but you would apparently prefer death over something disgusting. Just want to make sure were on the same page here.

             Write-up: Case number PHHY2013EG084610 is an initial literature report from the health authority received on 06 Aug 2013. The authors presented a fatal case of vaccination failure of rabies vaccine. This report refers to a 09-year-old patient whose gender was not provided. The patients medical history was not reported. The patient received four doses of rabies vaccine (manufacturer unknown, so conservatively coded as RABIPUR INN, batch number: not reported) on an unknown date. It was reported that the first dose of rabies vaccine was administered in the gluteal muscle instead of the deltoid (inappropriate site) and the third dose was received on day 8 instead of 7 (inappropriate schedule). On an unknown date before receiving the fifth dose of rabies vaccine, the child developed rabies symptoms and died. It was reported that the vaccination failure was likely due to administration errors. The author reported that this was a fatal case of vaccination failure of rabies vaccine.

             It was reported that the vaccination failure was likely due to administration errors.
            </p>
            <p>
             I.e. NOT due to the ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was a one-in-a-million case. Are you seriously telling me that, if you were bitten by a rabid animal, you would prefer to take the 99.99% certain death by not vaccinating, rather than the 0.0001% chance of death by vaccinating?
            </p>
            <p>
             Hell, even a *suspected* rabid animal. By not vaccinating youd be flipping a coin for a 50/50 shot of death, versus an absurdly small chance of vaccine complications.

             It appears that not only has science failed you, but math as well.

             Human rabies is rare in the United States. There have been only 55 cases diagnosed since 1990. However, between 16,000 and 39,000 people are treated each year for possible exposure to rabies after animal bites.
            </p>
            <p>
             That means an estimated 660,000 people received the rabies vaccine. Since you can only come up with ONE death, the risk is 1 in 660,000. Please forgive me for rounding up to 1 in a million.

             You do realize that, when it comes to rabies, diagnosis = death, right? When you start to show symptoms, its already too late. So if you get bitten, you get vaccinated, unless you can trap the animal and prove that its clean. Otherwise, youd have to be incredibly foolish to take your chances.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now please answer my very simple question: if bitten by a rabid animal, would you vaccinate? Yes or no? Would you take the 1 in 660,000 chance of death, or the certainty of death?

             Save your life. Thats when you get it: AFTER youve been bitten. Clearly you didnt do your homework before writing this, as this is common knowledge. I learned this stuff when I was 11 or 12.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortunately, in the event you get bitten, this would be explained to you by a qualified medical doctor, at which point rationality would overrule your pre-conceived notions, and you would allow medical science to save your life, despite disgusting ingredients.
            </p>

             Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. Disease prevention includes administration of both passive antibody, through an injection of human immune globulin and a round of injections with rabies vaccine. Once a person begins to exhibit signs of the disease, survival is rare. To date less than 10 documented cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been reported.

             MOST vaccines are preventative, yes. The rabies vaccine is different. There is no preventative version. It is administered AFTER infection. Again, this is basic stuff that you really should know before writing an article like this an engaging in a debate about it. This would be like debating politics without knowing who your congressman is.

             Thats two of your questions that Ive answered sufficiently, that youve accused me of not answering. Either you dont understand, or youre being willfully ignorant. Whichever it is, I cant answer much simpler than I already have. Most vaccines are preventative, but some (including rabies) are effective after infection. Its called postexposure prophylaxis. I provided you with links that explain this clearly, which you did not read. I can give more, if you wish. You are trying to paint all vaccines with the same brush, which betrays your ignorance on the subject.

             P.S. Its not some in the medical community. Its an overwhelming consensus of well over 99% of qualified doctors and scientists, based on 200+ years of evidence-based medical research. Youre using weasel words in an effort to make your side look scientifically legitimate, which it isnt.

             Ill add something to what Craig was saying. There is currently no way to know if you have rabies or not after being bitten. No tests exist to diagnose it. The only way to truly know is by doing test on corpses or when the onset of symptoms start at which time it is already too late to do anything. So vaccination is necessary to prevent death.

             Some people are ethically against things in vaccines and indeed would choose to not get them. Also, people have a right to know what they might be putting into their bodies in order to make an informed choice. You are free to continue to get vaccines, just like other people are free not to. Lastly, the fact vaccines help people does not make their ingredients any less disgusting-though what constitutes disgusting is subjective.

             The big question, why do they use the ingredients they do? Heres some info on polysorbate 80 another questionable vaccine ingredient. Of course no company will explain why because of proprietary greed and of couse they take the 5th because they might inseminate themselves.

             When the whole purpose of a vaccine is to incite the immune system into building  defences against viral or bacterial exposures, how do numerous ingredients NOT connected or related to any virus come into play?

             Its likely egg in vaccines cause the allergies in the first place by forcing the immune system to go into emergency response after the assault of vaccines unnatural injection. Anaphylaxis, fainting, seizure, and death after vaccinations SCREAMS this is problematic folks.

             I a old enough to make that decision, knowing the consequences. Its the mothers of infants that most times are not even told what shots their newborns receive after birth and are browbeaten into giving up to 8 vaccines within 4 months of birth,  YOU A SHILL CRAIG, you sound like one, or you are just a dumb bot.
