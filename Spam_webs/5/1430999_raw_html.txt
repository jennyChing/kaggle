           The last time someone called me a nigger, I was standing at a bus stop in Las Vegas at the corner of Maryland Parkway and East Sahara, waiting for the bus to take me home from work.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="4fa0" name="4fa0">
           How I came to be standing there is relevant to my emotional state, to the context of the encounter, and my notion of self at the time.

          <p class="graf--p" id="b32c" name="b32c">
           So forgive me a scene-setting indulgence and Ill return to the action shortly.

           It was a few months after I had arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada, following a job offer, only to end up staying at the Budget Suites of America on Boulder Highway, doing in-bound telemarketing for work.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="7000" name="7000">
           The hours were long, the work was tedious, and after walking into the support line room, which was just a desk with dozens of ringing phones on it that no one picked up, I was wearily questioning whether I could afford the morality to quit.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="6e13" name="6e13">
           The rent was overdue, we had almost run out of food in the house, and payday was still three days away.
