      Preface

    </font>
    <p align="justify">
     The   `Question  Corner'  column  published  in  the  Science  and
Technology pages of The Hindu since 1995 is one of the widely read
features of the paper. It appeals to the general public interested
in  science and students alike and this can be gauged by the  keen
interest  readers  take  in both raising questions  and  answering
them. The feature is by design aimed at addressing phenomena  that
one encounters everyday. While it encourages the enquiring mind of
the general reader, it promotes a scientific temper in the young.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
     An overwhelming response from our readers to the earlier book "The
Hindu Speaks on Scientific Facts", a compilation of questions  and
answers  that appeared in `Question Corner' column has reconfirmed
the  place such a book will have in the public mind.  We are  sure
that  this  second volume, like the earlier one, will serve  as  a
ready reference for all.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
     Apart  from being a compilation of questions that cover many areas
in science, this book contains a select number of articles written
by  Dr. D. Balasubramanian, a well known molecular biologist  with
the  L.V.  Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad, and a popular  science
writer  for  the  `Speaking of Science' column  published  in  the
Science  and  Technology pages.  He was also a former Director  of
the  Centre  for  Cellular &amp; Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.   These
articles  address some of the fundamental issues in life  sciences
and  will  always  be relevant. We hope the list  of  Nobel  Prize
winners during the century will serve as a reference material.

     This book, Volume II on Scientific Facts, is broadly divided under
the following heads:
