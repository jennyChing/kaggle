Orton is a famously good singer, as evidenced by the three albums that have so 
conspicuously built her worldwide reputation over the past decade. Not even that 
illustrious body of work, however, can properly prepare you for the 
extraordinarily personal, almost naked and most certainly honest emotional 
qualities of 'Comfort of Strangers', Beth Orton's new album released in February 
2006. Its production values are deceptively uncomplicated. Deceptive, because 
the album's stripped-down sonics allow the emotional complexities of Beth 
Orton's performances - and particularly her premiership talents as a songwriter 
- to flourish; at times sad, funny, playful and poignant, romantic, always 
lyrical and on occasion even a touch sentimental. Indeed, coming after her 
opening trilogy of albums, 'Comfort of Strangers' represents a total sense of 
reinvention, a fabulous alchemy resulting from a set of simple rules that Beth 
Orton decided for the new CD. In 2004, when she was contemplating the direction 
for her next album, Orton determined it would be an analog recording with sparse 
arrangements and a spontaneous, almost live, feel. It would be also recorded 
quickly with minimal overdubs; an intimate new route map for her music. These 
rules coincided with a remembered guitar sound from a few years before. Beth 
Orton recalled the dexterous fingerpicking style of American guitar virtuoso Jim 
O'Rourke on his 1999 recording, 'Halfway to a Threeway', a sound and ambiance 
that demonstrated many of the qualities she had in mind for her own album. Since 
the time of the 'Halfway' EP, O'Rourke had joined the legendary Sonic Youth and, 
in addition to his own acclaimed solo albums, worked on recordings by such 
diverse groups as Wilco, Stereolab, Smog as well as the noted American guitarist 
John Fahey - a career trajectory that curiously complemented Orton's own history 
of restless experimentation and eclectic tastes in collaborators.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Orton and O'Rourke met in January 2005, listening to all the songs she had lined 
up for the album. Instead of being simply a hired gun guitarist on the album 
O'Rourke volunteered to produce 'Comfort of Strangers, insisting he required 
only five days in the studio. In the event, it took two weeks to finish the 
recordings, created in the immediacy of the moment. It's mostly a one take CD - 
two takes maximum, with minimal overdubs. Nothing has been second-guessed and 
everything complies with Beth Orton's self-imposed rules for the album. Recorded 
at New York's Sear Sound studio in the spring of 2005, 'Comfort of Strangers' 
comprises 14 songs all composed by Beth Orton with the title track written in 
partnership with O'Rourke and singer-songwriter M. Ward. Perhaps it's ironical, 
but Jim O'Rourke plays very little guitar on the album. 'Comfort of Strangers' 
features Beth Orton on guitar, piano and harmonica with O'Rourke on bass, piano 
and marimba and the American percussionist Tim Barnes - whose credits include 
work with Wilco, the Silver Jews and Neil Hagerty - on drums. The album is 
completed with occasional overdubs from the Tin Hat Trio's pianist, Rob Burger.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Orton's debut came as one half of the duo Spill, a one-off project with Orbit 
recording a cover version of John Martyn's 'Don't Wanna Know About Evil'. She 
also worked with Orbit on his 1993 'Strange Cargo' project, co-writing and 
singing 'Water From a Vine Leaf'. Beth's path towards a solo career was further 
signposted when Orbit produced 'Superpinkymandy', a rare recording released only 
in Japan. As a consequence of her rising reputation Beth Orton was asked to sing 
'Alive Alone', a stand out track on the Chemical Brothers' astonishing1995 debut 
album, 'Exit Planet Dust'. She also worked with the freak-beat jazz combo Red 
Snapper, providing the vocals for their first singles, 'Snapper' and 'In Deep', 
before setting about the serious business of recording her own worldwide debut 
album. 'Trailer Park', released in October 1996, was an intriguing step forward, 
blending Beth Orton's guitars with samples and beats on an album of starkly 
personal and sensual songs. Produced by Victor Van Vugt (of Tindersticks and 
Nick Cave fame) and Andrew Weatherall (responsible for Primal Scream's classic 
'Screamadelica', an album that Beth Orton claims introduced her to dance music), 
'Trailer Park' suggested the emergence of a new kind of rhythm-fuelled folk - a 
significance recognised when it was shortlisted for the UK's prestigious Mercury 
Music Prize in 1997, with the judges claiming Beth to be the "queen of the 
heartbreak vocal". The album also marked the start of Beth Orton's long musical 
partnership with guitarist Ted Barnes. The year 1997 proved very productive for 
Beth. She toured incessantly, supporting the likes of John Martyn, Tindersticks, 
John Cale, Mark Eitzel and Everything But The Girl before selling out her own 
headline tours and playing her first Glastonbury Festival. Beth Orton also made 
her American debut, playing with Sheryl Crow and Emmylou Harris on the Lilith 
Fair tour before headlining her own dates in the autumn, the overwhelmingly 
favourable response to which saw the start of her enduring reputation in the 
United States.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Back in the studio, Orton collaborated with the Chemical Brothers once again, 
contributing a vocal to their smash hit number one album, 'Dig Your Own Hole', 
before recording her own 'Best Bit' EP, its soulful sound highlighted by Orton's 
two duets with the folk-jazz legend, Terry Callier. Beth's second album, 
'Central Reservation', was released in the spring of 1999. Terry Callier was 
again featured together with guest appearances from the likes of Dr. John, Ben 
Harper, Mazzy Star's David Roback and Ben Watt of Everything But The Girl. The 
album was far more reflective than 'Trailer Park', with dance beats exchanged 
for a purer folk sound. The result, however, was equally captivating. 'Central 
Reservation' was a popular and critical hit, with Beth Orton again being 
shortlisted for the Mercury Music Prize. The following year, 2000, Beth Orton 
won the Best British Female accolade at the UK's Brit Awards. In 1999 she 
returned to America for the annual Lilith Fair tour, followed by such 
prestigious dates as the Newport Folk Festival and, in 2000, her own headlining 
concert series, all of which came as she was riding a wave of commercial and 
critical success - indeed, 'Stolen Car' from 'Central Reservation' was Beth's 
first American hit. It was to take another two years for Orton to release her 
third album, which came in July 2002. 'Daybreaker' was epic in its scope and 
ambition with a massive soundscape ranging from the Chemical Brothers-produced 
title track to the country inflections of 'God Song', a tune that featured guest 
vocalist Emmylou Harris. 'Daybreaker' was distinguished by an impressive array 
of producers, mixers and musicians. In addition to the Chemical Brothers, Beth 
Orton invited old friends and new conspirators William Orbit, Ben Watt, Johnny 
Marr, Jim Keltner, Ryan Adams and Victor Van Vugt to help shape the album's 
widescreen qualities.
It was an immediate success on both sides of the Atlantic, the accolades 
complemented by the applause for Beth Orton's powerful live show that toured 
Europe - including a sell out concert at London's Royal Albert Hall - and 
America in the wake of the album's release. By this time Beth Orton's reputation 
as both a songwriter and performer was such that her place in modern music was 
assured. Just as significantly, however, for Beth Orton 'Daybreaker' came as the 
closing statement, the final chapter, in her opening trilogy of albums. Her next 
recording would be very different indeed.

    You touched my hand
    <br/>
    Said, "Follow me
    <br/>
    I'll be your eyes when you cannot see"
    <br/>
    Now the only blindness that I'm gonna choose
    <br/>
    Is ignorance to all your misuse
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There was a time when you held all the cards
    <br/>
    And you delt them all evenly 'cause I couldn't see
    <br/>
    You read my mind
    <br/>
    Left yourself so hard to find
    <br/>
    I thought you knew me better than I knew myself
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down
    <br/>
    When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down
    <br/>
    When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down [you touched my hand]
    <br/>
    When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down [I'll be your eyes]
    <br/>
    When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I could try talkin' to you but I already learned all I need to
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down
    <br/>
    Don't listen to a word then you throw me a frown
    <br/>
    To catch the eye of a stranger is nothing new
    <br/>
    I was just waitin' for something to do
    <br/>
    It was a twisted pair but now I'm through
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down [you touched my hand]
    <br/>
    When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry [said it's faith that will carry]
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down [I'll be your eyes]
    <br/>
    When it's plain to see it's faith that will carry
    <br/>
    Spend your time cutting me down [you read my mind]
    <br/>

    You walked into my 
house last night
    <br/>
    I couldn't help but notice
    <br/>
    A light that was long gone still burning strong
    <br/>
    You were sitting
    <br/>
    Your fingers like fuses
    <br/>
    Your eyes were cinnamon
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You said you stand for every known abuse
    <br/>
    That was ever threatened to anyone but you
    <br/>
    And why should I know better by now
    <br/>
    When I'm old enough not to?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    While every line speaks the language of love
    <br/>
    It never held the meaning I was thinking of
    <br/>
    And I can't decide over right or wrong
    <br/>
    I guess sometimes you need the place where you belong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Some may sing the wrong words to the wrong melodies
    <br/>
    It's little things like this that matter to me
    <br/>
    Others feel that you should stand
    <br/>
    For every known abuse to hand
    <br/>
    And all the things that they could never see
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You said you stood for every known abuse
    <br/>
    That was ever promised to anyone like you
    <br/>
    Don't you wish you knew better by now
    <br/>
    When you're old enough not to?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When every line speaks the language of love
    <br/>
    It never held the meaning I was thinking of
    <br/>
    And I can't decide over right or wrong
    <br/>
    You left the feeling that I just do not belong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    (Do not belong, do not belong, do not belong)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    One drink too many
    <br/>
    And a joke gone too far
    <br/>
    I see a face drive like a stolen car
    <br/>
    Gets harder to hide
    <br/>
    When you're hitching your ride
    <br/>
    Harder to hide what you really saw
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Oh yeah, you stand for every known abuse
    <br/>
    That I've ever seen my way through
    <br/>
    Don't I wish I knew better by now?
    <br/>
    Well I think I'm starting to
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When every line speaks the language of love
    <br/>
    It never held the meaning I was thinking of
    <br/>
    And I've lost the line between right or wrong
    <br/>
    I just want to find the place where I belong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Why should you know better by now
    <br/>
    When you're old enough not to?
    <br/>
    I wish I knew better by now
    <br/>
    When I'm old enough not to

    So much stays unknown till the time you are strong.
    <br/>
    Did you imagine you could ever feel so strong,
    <br/>
    And all your pain just turns into relief? (mmmm)
    <br/>
    All your doubt becomes your own belief? (mmmm)
    <br/>
    Though tears don't come to cry some grief away,
    <br/>
    The years will help to keep your need at bay.

    When the devil comes blowing through your door
    <br/>
    You'll know there's trouble
    <br/>
    And he's coming back for more
    <br/>
    You better keep what is precious
    <br/>
    Hidden under the floor
    <br/>
    Or you better treat it so good
    <br/>
    It will never want for more

    But looking back in retrospect
    <br/>
    Did you ever really get what you'd expect?
    <br/>
    Trying to rectify
    <br/>
    Got lost a little further
    <br/>
    Well, you've been trying to justify
    <br/>
    Find out how and from where it came
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Devil was your angel
    <br/>
    But it's not no more
    <br/>
    The devil was your angel
    <br/>
    When you weren't sure
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Do I tempt trouble to break through all these doors
    <br/>
    Just to put a face to the voice which always haunts?
    <br/>
    To fight for what is precious, to know what's under the floor
    <br/>
    If I could treat it so good I swear I'd never want for more
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I found my peace
    <br/>
    There were still mistakes
    <br/>
    However painfully your wearing every step I take
    <br/>
    Trying to rectify

    Well, I've been trying to justify
    <br/>
    Find out how and from where it came
    <br/>

    The devil was my angel, now I'm just not sure.
    <br/>
    To travel as my angel there's always my whore (?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Gonna take it back down
    <br/>
    And I won't feel no shame
    <br/>
    Till my dreams are my own again

    Gonna take it right down

    And I'll take the blame

    Till my dreams are my own again

    Here I am again

    <br/>
    Now you're sitting on a Paris train
    <br/>
    Laughin' at your own jokes again
    <br/>
    Sun splits the trees into beautiful broken light
    <br/>
    Never cry more tears than you could hold in your hands
    <br/>
    When all the world's airbrushed
    <br/>
    It's a sacred bond of trust
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    I see right through the scenery
    <br/>
    The first place that's on my mind
    <br/>
    The last place I find each time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    I swim beyond the scenery
    <br/>
    The last place that's on my mind
    <br/>
    The first place I find each time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now I'm sitting on a Paris train
    <br/>
    Molten ash falls like rain
    <br/>
    Fire burns the trees
    <br/>
    It's a beautiful fatality
    <br/>
    I love the way you stand your ground
    <br/>
    Sea moves as mercury
    <br/>
    To break its perfect skin
    <br/>
    To dare to die from within
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    I see much more than's good for me
    <br/>
    The first thing that's on my mind
    <br/>
    The last place I look each time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    I slip inside imagery
    <br/>
    And the last thing that's on my mind's
    <br/>
    The first thing I'll do each time
    <br/>
    Each time
    <br/>
    Each time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Stars racing to burn out
    <br/>
    Just stars racing to burn out
    <br/>
    A storm waiting to break
    <br/>
    Trees standing black against the sky
    <br/>
    This was inevitable
    <br/>
    This was inevitable
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    We can see beyond our history
    <br/>
    The last place you hope to find
    <br/>
    The one that's been there all the time
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    Sometimes
    <br/>
    We can swim beyond the scenery
    <br/>
    The first place that's on your mind
    <br/>
    The first place you'd find each time
    <br/>
    Each time
    <br/>
    Each time
    <br/>
    Each time

    Each time

    Don't do too much talking

    Frankie was a good girl
    <br/>
    Everybody knows
    <br/>
    She'd pay one hundred dollars
    <br/>
    For Albert's suit of clothes
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He's her man and he did her wrong

    Frankie went down to the corner saloon
    <br/>
    And she didn't go to belong
    <br/>
    She peeped through the key hole in the door
    <br/>
    Spied Albert in Alice's arms
    <br/>
    <br/>
    He's my man and he's doing me wrong
    <br/>
    He's my man and he's doing me wrong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Frankie caught old Albert
    <br/>
    Albert said that I don't care
    <br/>
    If you don't come to the woman you love
    <br/>
    I'm gonna haul you out of here
    <br/>
    <br/>
    'Cause he's my man and you was doing me wrong
    <br/>
    'Cause your my man and you keep doing me wrong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Frankie shot old Albert
    <br/>
    And she shot him three or four times
    <br/>
    Let me blow the smoke of my gun
    <br/>
    Let me see it fall by stein
    <br/>
    <br/>
    'Cause he's my man but he keeps doing me wrong
    <br/>
    He's my man but he keeps doing me wrong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Frankie and the judge walked down the stein
    <br/>
    Walked up side by side
    <br/>
    The judge says to Frankie
    <br/>
    Your gonna be justified
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For killing your man 'cause he done you wrong
    <br/>
    Killing your man and he done you wrong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dark was the night
    <br/>
    Cold was the day
    <br/>
    The last words that Frankie said was
    <br/>
    "I laid old Albert down"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    'Cause he's my man and he was doing me wrong
    <br/>
    Yeah he's my man and he kept doing me wrong
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Ain't gonna tell no story
    <br/>
    I ain't gonna tell no lies
    <br/>
    But Albert passed here 'bout an hour ago
    <br/>
    With a girl named Alice fine
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And he's your man but he kept doing you wrong
    <br/>
    He's your man but he was doing you wrong
    <br/>
    He's my man but he was doing me wrong
    <br/>
    He's my man but he kept doing me wrong

    They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on

    Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long

    Yes you who must leave everything that 
you cannot control

    It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul

    Well i've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned
    <br/>
    When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
    <br/>
    And they touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
    <br/>
    If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
    <br/>
    They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
    <br/>
    Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
    <br/>
    And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night
