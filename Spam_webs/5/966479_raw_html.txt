        </p>
        <p>
         One of the larger categories of App Store rejections is probably plain bugs. If the app crashes during the review testing it will be rejected. Test your app thoroughly before you submit it. Make sure you test it on multiple devices, different OS versions and specifically under varying network conditions. Since all developers hate testing their own code, write unit test code for your regression testing.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         HIG
        </h3>
        <p>
         Discoverability is a problem with touch interfaces. (Hover with your finger above a button and see if you get any hints as to what the button does) Users know how UI:s work by convention and they have been trained by Apples built-in apps. If you use a button image or a UI metaphor in an unconventional way, you will confuse users. This is why adherence to the HIG is so important, and why Apple is so nitpicky in enforcing it.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Here are some concrete examples of HIG violations:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Tapping an action button (a rectangle with an arrow coming out of it) must result in an action sheet where the user can select an action or cancel.
         </li>
         <li>
          The same holds true for all built-in icons. Make sure that your app behaves exactly as Apples apps to when you tap one of these icons.
         </li>
         <li>
          Dont leave activity indicators spinning forever. This can easily happen if you dont trap errors properly.
         </li>
         <li>
          TableViewCells must not have state, i.e. make sure that the highlight is removed when the selection action is done. If you use a UITableViewController rows are automagically cleared for you when the screen is shown. If youre rolling your own, add this to your code:
         </li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="c">
         - (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated
{
	NSIndexPath *tableSelection = [self.tableView indexPathForSelectedRow];
	[self.tableView deselectRowAtIndexPath:tableSelection animated:NO];
}
        </pre>
        <pre class="c">
        </pre>
        <h3>
         Lite Versions
        </h3>
        <p>
         The rules surrounding Lite versions of apps are murky at best. I have not had any issues with this, but here are some items Ive heard from other developers:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          A Lite app cannot appear to be crippled. For example visually disabled buttons or sections of the app are not allowed.
         </li>
         <li>
          You cannot prompt the user to upgrade to the full version.
         </li>
         <li>
          You cannot display the price of the full version inside the Lite app.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Internet Connectivity
        </h3>
        <p>
         If your application depends on Internet connectivity and its not available, then you must display a message to the user. This is actually trickier than it sounds to implement in your code. Most people base their connectivity checks on Apples Reachability code, which is using that sample code for the wrong purpose. If you need to get data from a specific server, then try to download some data from that domain. If thats successful then you have the necessary connectivity. A special case to test for is WiFi hotspots that require a login to get online. Go to your nearest Starbucks and test your app. The Starbucks WiFi hotspots also have the additional quirk of allowing access to the apple.com domain, which may be what your connectivity test uses if you just copied Apples sample code.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is my experience that Apple always tests applications under no connectivity conditions. Save yourself some approval time and test this yourself first.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Excessive Bandwidth Usage Over Cellular Networks
        </h3>
        <p>
         Bandwidth hogs was on Apples original list of forbidden fruit when the SDK was introduced. Unfortunately they have never defined exactly what the limits are. If you streaming or downloading a lot of data, make sure your application knows what type of network is in use and it has the ability to throttle or switch to a stream with a lower bit rate if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Device Capabilities
        </h3>
        <p>
         There are a few differences between the various iPhone and iPod Touch generations. Dont assume that the device running your app has a particular capability. In one app I had a settings screen where the user could turn off vibrations. That setting obviously has no effect on an iPod Touch, and the app was thus swiftly rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Private API:s
        </h3>
        <p>
         Calling private API:s has always been verboten. Some developer have tried to argue that some API components are more private than others. For example it seems less nefarious to pass in an undocumented parameter value to a public API than linking to a private framework. In the long run I think such distinctions are futile. If your business depends on your app being approved, then stay clear of anything that is not documented as official by Apple.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the beginning a lot of apps got away with breaking this rule. Now Apple has more sophisticated scripts that scan your code looking for violations.
        </p>
        <p>
         One particular API has been the source of some amusement: the private Coverflow API. Several developers, myself included, have had apps rejected for using this API when we in reality had spent a lot of time and effort in building a reasonable implementation of Apples coverflow user experience. I guess we should be flattered that Apple mistook our implementation for their own.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         No Interpreted Code
        </h3>
        <p>
         You cannot create an app that downloads and executes code that was not present in the app bundle submitted to Apple. This rule puts the kibosh on emulators (NES, C64, etc) and effectively kills alternative web browsers (you would want to run JavaScript in the browser) as well as Flash.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Limited Functionality
        </h3>
        <p>
         This was a common rejection before the fart category was approved. In the beginning of the App Store it was not uncommon to see apps that simply opened a web view to a companys web site. The goal was to get traffic to the web site, with the idea that competing with a few hundred apps was much easier than competing with millions of other web sites. With 140k apps, being noticed in the App Store is probably as difficult as on the web. In any case, Apple will reject simple UIWebView apps without any additional functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Duplicates Functionality
        </h3>
        <p>
         This is a tricky one. There have been several high-profile cases where an app has been rejected for duplicating functionality of a built-in app. But having built a
         <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=298505665&amp;mt=8" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=298505665&amp;mt=8']);">
          web browser app
         </a>
         with parental controls that was approved without any major delay, I dont know where the line goes.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Contests and Sweepstakes
        </h3>
        <p>
         Apple now allows both contests and sweepstakes within applications. The new rule, found in section 3.3.17, states, Your Application may include promotional sweepstake or contest functionality provided that You are the sole sponsor of the promotion and that You and Your Application comply with any applicable laws, adding that developers must clearly state in binding official rules for each promotion that Apple is not a sponsor of, or responsible for conducting, the promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Handling of User Data
        </h3>
        <p>
         If you collect any user information and that data is sent to a server then you need to explain to the user what is about to happen and give an option to opt out. This applies, for example, to highscore and leaderboard liets. And even if the information submitted is just a bogus name that the user enters specifically for this purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
         If your app uses Core Location for the sole purpose of serving ads or user tracking, then your app will be rejected. The use of Core Location needs to provide some benefit to the user. See Apples

        <h3>
         Copyrighted Content
        </h3>
        <p>
         It goes without saying that you must have the rights to the content that you include in your apps. Recently Apple has begun checking and enforcing this more seriously. You need to know your copyright and trademark law to stay clear of violations. For example there have been several cases where developers have replicated old console games on the iPhone and the original owners of the game have complained to Apple resulting in the removal of the app from the App Store.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Use of Trademarked Images
        </h3>
        <p>
         If you display an image of an iPhone, or any other Apple product, inside your app it will be rejected unless you have received written approval from Apple to use that image. What exactly constitutes iPhone likeness? Some developers have reported that removing the home button circle is enough.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Objectionable Content
        </h3>
        <p>
         This is another big and sticky one without any clear guidelines from Apple. Heres my experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Nudity is off limits, even with a 17+ rating.
         </li>
         <li>
          For women in bikinis, images are rejected seemingly at random. One reviewer will object to a particular image and pass others, the next reviewer will find an objectionable image in the batch that the first reviewer passed. And on it goes.
         </li>
         <li>
          Anything related to politicians will most likely be rejected.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The app reviewers seem to go to great lengths to find objectionable content by explicitly searching for swear words, or seeking out specific ebooks to download which may contain anything objectionable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another source of hilarity is content that actually doesnt exist in the app. Remember the Twitter client that was rejected for displaying a trending hashtag that contained a bad word? To the app reviewers defense I must say that it can often be very difficult to know what content comes from the app itself and what is coming from a different source. The result seems to be that the source doesnt matter. If its displayed within your app, youre responsible for it. See also the next section about web views.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         UIWebViews
        </h3>
        <p>
         If your application has a web view that allows unrestricted access to the Internet where scary things lurk, then you are automatically slapped with a 17+ rating. Why the built-in Safari app is not consequently shielded from minors is a mystery. But those are apparently the rules.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now unless you are building a web browser, it seems unnecessary for you to allow full and unrestricted access to the Internet from within your app.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Transactions Outside The App Store
        </h3>
        <p>
         Apple doesnt want you to conduct any commerce outside the App Store. Before In-App Purchasing was available we developed an app that allowed the user to purchase additional credits using a third party payment service. That feature had to be removed. Another of our clients has a calling card type app. If you have a calling card you typically have an account that you may want to check the balance of, and you may want to add more money to it using your credit card. It took several submissions to get the wording surrounding these features to Apples liking. In the end all references to an account were removed and all links to the vendors web site opened Safari instead of an internal web view.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Price Information
        </h3>
        <p>
         Do not display the price of an application inside your app or in your application description. The very reasonable explanation for this is that App Store prices/currencies vary from country to country.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         App Icon and App Store Image
        </h3>
        <p>
         The 5757 application icon and the 512512 App Store Image must depict the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Application Description
        </h3>
        <p>
         This doesnt have to do with development per se. But when write the App Store description make sure that you are describing the application correctly. If you describe a feature that is not there, then you will be rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The same is true for the update notes. If your app update doesnt exactly address the things you list in the whats new in this version notes, you will be rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         App Store Keywords
        </h3>
        <p>
         The keywords you enter for your application have to be relevant,
         <em>
          as Apple sees it
         </em>
         . If your app is about football, dont use a basketball keyword just because you think theres an overlap in the demographics. And dont use trademarked words, e.g. ESPN, or names of other App Store apps.
        </p>
        <p>
         The punishment is that youre app will be rejected, not just the description. You have to resubmit the binary and go to the end of the line.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>
         Updates Are Reviewed As New Apps
        </h3>
        <p>
         Just because your app was approved once doesnt mean that the original features are safe when you submit an update. It appears that all updates are reviewed as if they were brand new apps. A HIG violation that has been approved 5 times may be caught and rejected on your 6th app update.

         Unfortunately this list is not complete, as only Apple knows the extent of the hidden rules. Also, with a few exceptions that are anecdotal or widely known, the items on this list are rejections that I and my colleagues have personally experienced.

        <p>
         Here is a list of tips from Apple:
         <a href="https://developer.apple.com/iphone/news/appstoretips/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://developer.apple.com/iphone/news/appstoretips/']);">
          App Store Submission Tips
         </a>
         . It only contains a handful of items at the moment, but its a good sign from Apple. Since this should count as the official word from Apple, I sincerely hope that this list will grow to encompass all the hidden rules that have been painstakingly discovered by developers over time.
        </p>

          First, I understand that you are trying to pool all the possible rejection reasons into one location, but if you are going to copy text with links in them and not supply the actual link, I would suggest either editing out the [link] text or actually supply the link. Your Duplicates Functionality item has this example in it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Also, part of your Lite Versions is pretty much not a rejection reason any more. Or at least hasnt been used in quite some time. The latest example of an app not rejected for prompting the user to upgrade to the full version is an app called Arctic Shuffle 2 Lite. I downloaded this app to check it out. Before every level it nags the user to upgrade to the full version (which isnt available currently). I have seen quite a few other free/lite/demo apps that also this.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over all, a resource like this for developers to be kept up on rejection reasons is a very good idea. I just dont know how useful it is when the true reasons for rejections are kept secret by Apple. Its kept me away from actually developing a few applications myself. I fear that if I spend a year developing an awesome app only to have it rejected because it was submitted on a Blue Moon, Ill do something Ill regret, like dump my iPhone for a Palm Pre. :shiver:

          I have tons of Free Apps or Lite version apps that have pop ups that instruct me to buy the Paid version of that particular game or App.
          <br/>
          Are you sure about the second point of your Lite versions section?
          <br/>
          i can show you at least 10 games on my phone that are lite versions that has this happening on them.

          @Julian: First let me state that Im not sure of any of the above since Apple doesnt publish the full set of rules. What I have compiled on this page are all the rejection reasons I have personally experienced at one time or another, and those of other developers I know. The approval process is not exactly known for consistency, so for each rejection reason I can also point to several apps in the App Store that violate that rule.
         </p>
         <p>
          So whats a developer to do? Use this page as a checklist. Make sure youre not unknowingly breaking any of the rules. When there are business reasons for doing something different, then by all means go for it. I can definitely see that you may want to be more aggressive in promoting your paid app inside a lite app. Have a backup plan ready, so you can quickly resubmit if Apple rejects your first attempt.

          Transactions Outside The App Store  is it allowed to place a buy now button in an App that will open a website (in Safari) which allows the user to purchase a product?
         </p>
         <p>
          Im going to re-read the dev agreement but theyre not always easy to understand, let alone not knowing how Apple interprets their own rules.

          @GamingHorror: The key is to read section 3.3.3 where it states something to the effect of: you cannot unlock features in your app using a mechanism other than iTunes.
         </p>
         <p>
          I interpret this to permit apps that take credit cards to purchase physical goods. Examples of apps that Ive worked on that do this are
          <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chipotle-ordering/id327228455?mt=8" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chipotle-ordering/id327228455?mt=8']);" rel="nofollow">
           Chipotle Ordering
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/california-blooms/id351992710?mt=8" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/california-blooms/id351992710?mt=8']);" rel="nofollow">
           California Blooms
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Another app that we developed is
          <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-access-by-callingcards/id310650650?mt=8" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-comment','http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/world-access-by-callingcards/id310650650?mt=8']);" rel="nofollow">
           World Access by CallingCards.com
          </a>
          . This app was rejected several times because of a buy now button, even though the button opened Safari. The result of a purchase was that more minutes were added to your account, which I guess Apple interpreted as unlocking or enabling additional features in the app. In the end they accepted a different wording on the button that did not directly imply a purchase.

          You should add screenshots that dont match the current submission. My first application was denied because of look-and-feel issues so I worked hard to update my look and feel and resubmitted my app. But I didnt think about the fact that my screenshots were still from my original look-and-feel and so it got rejected again because the screenshots didnt match the current look-and-feel.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course if Apple actually displayed the screenshots on the submission page instead of just listing the file names, it would be easier to realize that your screenshots are out of date. Oh well.

          I just had an app rejected for inaccurate/unclear description
         </p>
         <p>
          The application description for the application states that the user can choose the length of conversation, however, using the slider on the main view has no affect on the call (see screenshot).

          There used to be a problem with static libraries that contained only categories. I thought it was fixed in the latest Xcode, but try adding linker flags to the project for -ObjC, see this note here:
