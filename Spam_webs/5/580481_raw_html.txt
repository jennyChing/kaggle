          May 1st: The Forum is here to help you &gt;
         </h2>
         <p>
          We get a lot of emails from people who just found our site. They have a legal problem. Suspended driver's license, DUI, property rights issue... the list is endless.
         </p>
         <p>
          These people find us because they used their favorite search engine to research their problem, and found an article in our Reading Room, or a forum post here which discusses their problem. If you're reading this now, you may be one of those people.  You are welcome here.  May this site be a blessing to you.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you read articles here, dealing with your issue, well-written, obviously well-studied, you may naturally assume we will know exactly how to help with your case.  You will be tempted to email us directly to ask us to handle your case, help you with your paperwork, or give you that magic
          <i>
           Silver Bullet

          brief which will vanquish your enemies once and for all.

         <p>

           Please resist that temptation.

          Our staff is knowledgeable about many topics. This does not mean we are the last or best word on anything.
          <i>
           The Lawful Path
          </i>
          is a place to study, learn, and share knowledge, wisdom, and procedure, among other things.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           We do not give legal advice.
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          We may give suggestions in the line of, "If I were in exactly your position (as you've led me to ken it, which may or may not be your actual position) here is what I might do."  If we give that kind of help, it will nearly always be in the Forum, and not by private email. If you email us, we will direct you to the Forum.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Here is Why:
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Forum is here to help you, and to afford you the blessing of being able to help others.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you ask a question in the Forum it gives our readers the chance to respond, many of whom may have been lurking quietly for years, waiting for just such a chance.  The questions and answers posted on the Forum will stay here for years, as long as we're able to maintain the site. This becomes a ready-reference for study in many fields.  The Forum will be as useful as the value of the work its readers put into it.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you email us directly with a question about your case, you rob our readers of the chance to gain the blessing of helping you.  By asking for our help directly, the quality of the answer you will receive is limited by many factors-- the bounds of our knowledge, the limited time we have to help, and maybe even whether or not the one who is manning the emails today is in a good or a bad mood. We have many intelligent and insightful readers. You may easily like another reader's answer better than my own.
         </p>
         <p>
          It seems odd to me that such a small percentage of people who email me with such questions will post them to the Forum when we respond directing them there.  It's not as though you have to use your real name. The forum doesn't reveal your email address to other members, only the staff can see it-- and you've already emailed us. It takes only a few minutes to register, and in posting your question where others can see it and respond, you are giving something back.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           This is how you pay for your answer.

         <p>
          By not using our Forum, eventually you rob yourself of the blessings you'll find in helping. If you know anything about open source software (FOSS), ask yourself if it would have acheived anywhere near the successes it has, if not for free and open sharing of knowledge over the Internet?
         </p>
         <p>
          We are oppressed by criminal syndicates, masquerading as government. These syndicates do their best to control the education you and your children receive, the news you are allowed to hear, and in every way to shape your perception of reality.  The current race riots are a perfect example. This is all scripted, intended to divide us into smaller, weaker groups who cannot offer opposition.  The federal government wants to federalize all local police forces, and give them military weapons.  Intentionally inciting these riots is their way of convincing the American people to beg the military to take over local law enforcement.

          We must learn to help each other, and to take best advantage of the tools in front of us. For now, we have a free and open Internet. That will probably not last forever-- maybe not even for much longer.

         <h2>
          November 5th: How to get published on The Lawful Path
         </h2>
         <p>
          From time to time we get emails from budding journalists who want to publish an article with us.  Some have already written an article, and send it for consideration. Others are people who recognize the trend I outlined in "Advertising in the Forum".  They are offering to write an article on any topic we choose, on the condition they can include one link back to a site they are promoting.
         </p>
         <p>
          The latter is a curious phenomenon.  I wonder how many of them are entrepenuers, and how many are hired by an ad agency?  Does anyone have statistics on this?
         </p>
         <p>
          Here's an example of one such email:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <font face="Courier,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif">
           Subject: I'd like to collaborate with you
           <p>
            Hi,
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope you are well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would you be interested in collaborating with me on a free high-end article for publication on your site lawfulpath.com?
           </p>
           <p>
            All of my articles are of high-end editorial quality and will be 100% unique to you. I will provide a genuine piece that your readers will enjoy reading and will include one link in the body of the article.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there any particular area you'd like to see covered on the site? I have a number of topic ideas that I'd be happy to discuss with you further.
           </p>
          </font>
         </blockquote>
         <p>
          Here was my reply:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <font face="Courier,Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif">
           Subject: Re: I'd like to collaborate with you
           <p>
            We get offers like yours from time to time. Most of the articles we get as a result do not have enough meat to justify publication.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to give it a shot, here is a topic we're interested in covering:
           </p>
           <p>
            2012 Presidential campaign.  Document statistics and backstory on the various dirty tricks Republicans used in primaries and caucuses to block Ron Paul's nomination.  Include statistics on attendance at rallies for other Republican candidates.  Reference contextual links to videos available on public media sites such as Youtube and Vimeo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've seen a lot of this data, enough to prove conspiracy to defraud, but it needs to be compiled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bring me something with some meat in it, and The Lawful Path will publish it.
           </p>
          </font>
         </blockquote>
         <p>
          I'm still waiting for someone to accept this challenge.  Show me you're serious, and we'll publish your article.
         </p>
         <h2>
          October 10: The Ebola Breakout Coincided with UN Vaccine Campaigns
         </h2>
         <p>
          From an article by Yoichi Shimatsu, appearing in the Liberian Observer:
         </p>
         <p>
          The ebola pandemic began in late February in the former French colony of Guinea while UN agencies were conducting nationwide vaccine campaigns for three other diseases in rural districts. The simultaneous eruptions of this filovirus virus in widely separated zones strongly suggests that the virulent Zaire ebola strain (ZEBOV) was deliberately introduced to test an antidote in secret trials on unsuspecting humans.
         </p>
         <p>
          The cross-border escape of ebola into neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia indicates something went terribly wrong during the illegal clinical trials by a major pharmaceutical company. Through the lens darkly, the release of ebola may well have been an act of biowarfare in the post-colonial struggle to control mineral-rich West Africa.

          October 8: Advertising in the Forum
         </h2>
         <p>
          Here at The Lawful Path, we get lots of emails asking if we know of an honest attorney; someone who knows the
          <b>
           real
          </b>
          law, and isn't afraid to stand up to a crooked system.  The answer is almost always, "No, sorry."
         </p>
         <p>
          At the same time lots of lawyers try, unsuccessfully, to advertise here in our forum.  We don't allow spam, so their ads are never seen by readers.
         </p>
         <p>
          It seems there may be an opportunity being missed.  People want to hire lawyers, but are afraid of getting one who is incompetent, crooked, lazy, or who will sell them out.  Lawyers want clients, but even if they're honest and competent, how can they make contact with the clients, when sites like ours won't let them advertise?
         </p>
         <h3>
          Spam Kills Opportunity
         </h3>
         <p>
          Spam, or bulk advertising, is a huge problem on all forums.  If a forum owner allows spam to get in the way of genuine information, then readers will abandon the forum in favor of a friendlier place.  Forum owners know this, and most of them do their best to reduce or eliminate spam.
         </p>
         <p>
          Most spam these days is done with computers, automated systems or, if you prefer, robots.  That's why we limit posts to registered users, and registration requires you to answer a question that is simple to you, but hard for a robot.  That way, the majority of spam posts never happen in the first place.
         </p>
         <p>
          Spam protection is also why registered users must get three posts approved by a moderator before their posts will appear immediately, without further approval.  It establishes trust.
         </p>
         <p>
          So the question I'm going to answer for you today is, "How can a lawyer begin to establish trust, so that he can get his name into the hands of the readers of this Site?"
         </p>
         <h3>
          A Change of Perspective
         </h3>
         <p>
          Let's put ourselves in the lawyer's shoes for a moment.  Let's say I'm one of these smart, honest, hard-working lawyers who's not afraid to stand up and risk my bar card to get justice for my client.  How do I spread the word, so people know they can come to me?  How do I make myself known and establish trust?
         </p>
         <p>
          The answer is simple.  In online forums, how does anyone make themselves known, and establish trust?  Become a regular participant in the forum.  Share valuable information at no cost.
         </p>
         <p>
          You ask, "But how can a lawyer make money by giving away his time and information?"  As an example, let's look at a company called
          <u>
           Red Hat
          </u>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Red Hat produces a top-notch computer operating system, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  They have many full time employees, and spend a great deal of time and money improving, fixing, and furthering development of this software.  Anyone who wants the software (yes you, me, ANYONE) can legally get it absolutely free.  Yet for the past four years in which I found their financial information readily available online, they have averaged a BILLION dollars in profit EVERY YEAR for the past four years.
         </p>
         <p>
          How do they make their money?  Service.  Red Hat offers a great product, which people can obtain free, and use to their heart's content, for both personal and commercial purposes.  Red Hat also offers various support contracts, including phone support, online help, and onsite visits.  People can use and test their software free.  No one is ever required to buy their services.  But enough people value their services to have put them over the Billion dollar mark for at least four years in a row.
         </p>
         <p>
          Similarly, here on The Lawful Path, I offer a book for sale called
          <u>
           How to Survive Hospital Costs Without Insurance
          </u>
          .  The book explains how hospitals charge a variable rate for services, with insurance companies paying as little as twelve cents ($0.12) on the dollar compared to what they charge an uninsured patient.  This book shows people how to save literally thousands of dollars, the very first time they use it.
         </p>
         <p>
          How much do I sell this book for?
          <b>
           I give it away for free.
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          Lots of people download the free book.  Lots of people also send me $49.95.  They don't have to, so why do they do it?  Because I provide an additional service.  Using my book requires writing some carefully worded letters to the hospitals, and sometime doing the same for collection agencies.  The free book contains all the information people need to write those letters, and people are free to do so if they want.  Some of them probably do.  But there are many people who, after reading my free book, decide they're willing to pay fifty bucks for my letters.
         </p>
         <p>
          Red Hat and I do our business the same way.  First we establish trust by offering something of real value at no cost.  Then, for those who want it, we charge a reasonable amount for a valuable service.
         </p>
         <p>
          So this is the challenge.  I'm throwing down the gauntlet.  Are there any attorneys who are willing to go the extra mile to get clients?  I can say with fair certainty that most of our readers are not dummies.  They know that any lawyer who is too lazy to first gain their trust, is probably also too lazy to perform a reliable service once hired.
         </p>
         <p>
          There may be lots of lawyers out there who who have studied conflict of law, and the differences between the unaligned man and the 14th Amendment Citizen; who are willing to take a stand.  Just because I don't know any, doesn't mean they don't exist.  I've never seen bigfoot either, but I'm willing to admit the possibility he may be real.  After all, gorillas were only a myth until they were officially discovered in 1902.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you're a lawyer and you think you might be up to the challenge, here are a few pointers.
         </p>
         <h3>
          The Wrong Way
         </h3>
         <p>
          Here is an example of a bad post.  Our moderators have killed scores of posts very much like this one:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          "The best [Miami dui defense] lawyers are able to get a DUI charge expunged leaving you with a license and a clean record to police as well as employers."  (The area inside the brackets is a link to a law firm somewhere in Miami.)
         </blockquote>
         <p>
          This is a perfect example of what not to do.  The only person who will ever see such a post is the moderator, just before he kills it.
         </p>
         <h3>
          The Right Way
         </h3>
         <p>
          Here's a post that convey's information:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          <b>
           Title IV-D of the Social Security Act
          </b>
          <p>
           Title IV-D is lingo you must learn if you are to effectively work towards understanding, changing, or fighting the family law (domestic relations) system. If you receive a monthly child support statement from the state payment center, and if you make your support payments to the state instead of directly to the other parent, then your family problems are no longer a private matter; and rightly or wrongly, your private problems have become a public matter, under the control and heavy hand of the government, and you are a Title IV-D case. Over 77% of the current Title IV-D cases may not belong in the public system, and your case might be one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           The states have domestic relations law for individuals to handle their family law issues privately. The federal government provides aid to children when the parents are unable. Because the program is taxpayer funded, the federal government has specific laws the states must follow regarding children for whom the government has determined they must take charge, in lieu of the parents ability to do so themselves.

         </blockquote>
         <p>
          The above example is an ctual post on our forum.  It was not posted by a lawyer (so far as I know), and did not contain a link to an attorney's website.  However, if it
          <b>
           had
          </b>
          contained something like the following message, I probably would have allowed it:
         </p>
         <blockquote>
          "My name is John Smith, and I am an attorney in Oregon specializing in family law, including divorce, guardianship, and child custody cases.  If you have a problem in these areas I may be able to help.  I am honest, and hard working, and will not sell you out.  If you contact me I will listen to your problem, and will only agree to work for you if I think I can help.  I will explain every part of my plan, and go only as far as you direct me.  When I am your attorney, I work for you.  My website is at:

          The better the articles you write, and with more frequency, the more trust you will generate among readers.  What's more, the forum itself will become more useful and, therefore, attract more readers.

         <h3>
          The Way of the Future
         </h3>
         <p>
          Avenues for traditional advertising are disappearing with alarming speed.
         </p>
         <p>
          Newspapers are dead, or soon will be.  With a steadily declining readership they are now jacking up the prices to their advertisers.  In turn, the advertisers see they are paying more money while fewer readers are seeing their ads.  Eventually they stop advertising.
         </p>
         <p>
          Television is expensive.  More often than ever, people are using Netflix or watching rented movies.  Many fewer ads of any kind are viewed with each passing year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Even radio is declining, as it has become easier to play music with today's mobile devices.
         </p>
         <p>
          That leaves social media such as our forum, as the way in which advertising will be done in the future.  The days of a short ad message are over.  Site owners have no incentive to carry such ads unless they are paid, and sites such as ours will not carry paid ads.
         </p>
         <p>
          Advertising will go the way of open source software.  I think it's a change for the better.
