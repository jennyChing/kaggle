      How the marble pump works
     </h2>
     The marble pump is the heart of the Lego marble machine, as well as the wooden marble machine 1.
The pump is always the thing that looks like magic, because the pump itself occupies a very small
space.  In order to guide the pieces and the marbles, most of the movement and working is hidden
from view.  All the observer sees is that marbles fall into a hole, and then somehow rise up
this stack.  The piston (shown in green) is completely hidden.

        The green piston is mounted on a crank at the point shown with the black spot.  In the position
shown at left, the piston is in its bottom most position of its circular motion, and moving
towards the right.  As it follows the circle that the crank moves it in, once it is on the 
right, it moves up.  This forces all the marbles above to be pushed up, and the marble above
the piston to eventually be pushed into the column as the piston moves towards the top of its
circular path.
        <p>
         Once the piston is at the top, it moves left again, but this time its top is level with
the block shown in red.  Thus, as it moves left, it does
         <i>
          not
         </i>
         take a marble back to 
the left.  Once it is on the left, it starts its downward motion again, allowing for a marble
to descend into the hole.
        </p>
        <p>
         The whole mechanism, so long as there is always marbles at the intake, works very smoothly.  
It gets a bit noisy if the intake runs out of marbles, because the space above the piston
will then be empty as it moves right, allowing the column on the right to fall down into
the empty space.

      Lots of people have difficulty understanding the pump, even with this diagram, so don't feel dumb
if you don't get it.  However, if this is not intuitively obvious to you, you should definitely
not attempt to build your own marble machine.  Marble machines are tweaky to debug, and take a
lot of intuition about mechanisms to get working smoothly.
