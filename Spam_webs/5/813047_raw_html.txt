     As every Christian knows, without God's
  blessings upon us, we could not live, much less move a finger
  or a toe. The faithful know that God's grace allows His people
  to give blessings to other Christians and to receive them back.
  Although receiving blessings provides us with a precious eternal
  gift, Jesus says that "It is more blessed to give than to
  receive" (Acts 20:35). If so, then what better gift to give
  than a blessing itself?

    <font face="Arial">
     Usually we give blessings through our prayers
  but prayers are not heard by our recipients. It is better to
  give blessings from our own voice, but even here sometimes our
  fellow believers tend to forget that we gave them our blessings.
  So what better way to establish a long lasting remembrance of
  our blessings than to provide them with a written contract, an
  official blessing certificate?

    <font face="Arial">
     Not only would it serve God's grace to
  give our blessings to Christians, but why not give a blessing
  certificate to our ministers, priests and evangelists? All True
  Christians know that blessings are
     <i>
      far
     </i>
     more valuable than
  money because as the Bible says:

     Churches have given blessings for centuries.
  Why not give the same back? Putting
     <b>
      MONEY

     in their collection
  baskets only adds to the evil root of loving
     <b>

  give them an official signed certificate of your eternal blessing.

     Blessing Certificates also work great at
  work. Have you ever been hounded by superfluous requests for
  donations to baby showers, birthday presents, etc. for people
  whom you don't even know? Well, then respect them by giving your
  priceless blessing instead of cash. You can also write them a
  Blessing Check:

      Tip:

    </b>
    <font face="Arial">
     If
  you've ever been hounded by irritating Jehovah Witnesses at your
  doorstep, greet them with your blessings and offer to pay them
  with a check. JWs used to avoid receiving donations, but after
  1990 the JWs began to openly solicit money from the public. If
  they aggravate you, and you have the time, it might prove fun
  to get back at them.
