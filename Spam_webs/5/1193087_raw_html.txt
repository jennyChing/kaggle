of the class said that it didn't work.  It turned out, when the instructor

    I use to hang around at a little volunteer computer help forum at an online
community, here in Norway. I stumbled upon a young girl who was having
problems with a worm.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">
      Girl:
     </span>
     "I have a worm thing on my computer, and my anti-virus program couldn't delete it. But it gave me a link so that I could read about the worm. So I followed the removal instructions I found on that page, and it said: 'Download the removal patch, unzip it, and execute the removal patch. And I did what it told me."
    </li>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">
      Me:
     </span>
     "Well, did you do exactly as the instructions told you to? Those worm removal patches seldom fail to remove the infection."

     <span class="speaker">
      Girl:
     </span>
     "Yes. I downloaded the patch, unzipped it, and deleted it."
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    I reckon she misunderstood the term "execute" as to mean "delete."
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    Back in the 70s, disk drives were about the size of
washing machines. One type had two disk platters: one was embedded
and could not be removed except by a technician, and the
other was in a large plastic shell and was easily removable.
Each platter held five megabytes. Yes, that's right:
five whole megabytes, an insignificant amount of space now but
humongous then.
   </p>
   <p>
    Many used this dual platter drive to keep their operating system
and database on the embedded one, and at the end of the day they'd
copy it to the removable one.  Then they would open the disk drive,
take out the removable disk, store it in a safe, insert a
new removable disk, and close the drive.  Then they'd be ready for
business the next day.
   </p>
   <p>
    We got a call one morning from a customer.  He couldn't boot.
One of the techs went over to have a look and found that the
embedded disk had a bad sector. It would need to be replaced.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">
      Technician:
     </span>
     "The embedded disk is bad. Are you backed up?"
    </li>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">
      Customer:
     </span>
     "Yes!"
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    So the technician replaced the disk, snapped the old one in half so it would
fit in the garbage can, and threw it away.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">
      Technician:
     </span>
     "I'm done -- she's all yours."

    I used to work in tech support for a company in Sweden.  Once a guy called
and started talking in English.  Well, I speak fairly fluent English, so this
wasn't a problem.  So I spoke English back, and we started troubleshooting
his problem.  After a little while I started to suspect something was up
with this guy, because he didn't always seem to understand what I was saying,
and he often fumbled for words.
   </p>
   <p>
    Right then, I heard a door open in the background, and a voice said, in
Swedish, "Ready to go to lunch, Sten?"  He answered in perfect Swedish.
   </p>
   <p>
    I put the customer on hold and tried not to spit my coffee out from
laughing so hard. When he came back on the phone, he spoke in English, and
I spoke in Swedish. After about five more minutes of him following my
instructions, he said to me in English, "Hang on. I can't understand
Swedish. Please speak English."  The rest of the conversation was in english.

    I work for an ISP. After two calls totaling 45 minutes with
one customer, I asked him to bring his computer, in and I would
configure it myself. He was a bit skeptical, so I assured him that he did
not have to bring in the whole computer, just the CPU -- no monitor, cables,
mouse or keyboard, just the CPU. He was not sure which part was the CPU, so
I told him, "Just bring in the box -- the part with the CD-ROM drive and
floppy drive."  I explained this twice.  Later he arrived with the
cardboard box that his computer came in. I asked him where
the computer was, he replied, "I thought you just needed to look at the box
to see what model it was."

     </span>
     "I have a problem. OR, I have a question."

   <p>
    I took a call from a customer who sounded like quite a nice old lady.
Querying the customer database through the serial number, I found the
customer's name to be "Carol" and her surname to be impossibly long and
presumably Eastern European.  Fortunately -- or so I thought at first --
she didn't want tech support and was only calling to claim a free software
offer that was a part of the packaged bundle.  I checked on the issue and
the offer had expired a good three months before.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">
      Me:
     </span>
     "I'm sorry, ma'am, but the offer has expired."

     <em>

   <p>
    Sure, escalate the call, but she wasn't going to get it.  I told her so
in the nicest and sweetest of the tones I'm capable of.

   <ul>
    <li>
     <span class="speaker">

     </span>

   </ul>
   <p>
    Wow, talk about getting emotional.  I called my supervisor who would
take the escalated call and try to talk some sense into her, but he
failed.  The call escalated a second time as the area supervisor took
the call and once more as the shift supervisor took over.
   </p>
   <p>
    I couldn't believe it.  There we were, all four of us sitting in a row,
listening to the call that -- for an encore -- got escalated once more.  A
customer satisfaction specialist took the call and didn't do any better.
   </p>
   <p>
    We decided to roll it around once more and patched her through another
tech, who finally placed and solved the ACTUAL problem.

   <ul>

   <p>
    Or hanging jaws nearly hit the floor.  "Carol" was A GUY -- even though he
sounded like a Powerpuff girl -- and we had all been calling him "Ma'am" all
along.  The whole company laughed at this for almost a week.

written.

    I had a hard time reading that letter. I went to my boss and asked him if he
read it, and he said he only read part of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    I decided to call, against my better judgment, to see what was going on.
I was on the phone with him for 30 minutes trying to figure out how to get
him to get Internet Explorer up on the screen.  I asked my boss if I
could have him bring in the machine.
   </p>
   <p>
    The machine came in, and I took a look at it and found out exactly what the
problem was.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every time we did a maintenance on our network, he changed his Windows 98
desktop theme. All his icons changed in size and shape. He wanted to have
all his icons "locked in place," because apparently they kept moving on
him. He kept moving his start bar around the sides of the screen, shifting
the window and the icons around.
   </p>
   <p>
    The "verse" he makes reference to was the KAK viruses I had called him about
earlier in the week.  I also found out that his references to "micro" were
either about Microsoft Internet Explorer or Outlook Express.
   </p>
   <p>
    The main problem was that Outlook Express wouldn't open. It just needed a
re-install, and he would have been fine.
