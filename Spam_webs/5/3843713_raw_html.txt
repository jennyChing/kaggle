      You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out, and in which an alarm is going off by going on. English was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all.

       A young man came to Socrates one time and said, "Mr. Socrates, I have come 1,600 miles to talk to you about wisdom and learning."
       <br/>
       He said, "You are a man of wisdom and learning, and I would like to be a man of wisdom and learning."

      Socrates said, "Come follow me," and he led the way down to the seashore. They waded out into the water up to their waists, and then Socrates turned on his friend and held his head under the water.
      <br/>
      His friend struggled and kicked and bucked and tried to get away, but Socrates held him down. Now if you hold someone's head under the water long enough, he will eventually become fairly peaceable. And after this man had stopped struggling, Socrates laid him out on the bank to dry, and he went back to the market place.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the young man had dried out a little bit, he came back to Socrates to find the reason for this rather unusual behavior.
      <br/>
      Socrates said to him, "When your head was under the water, what was the one thing you wanted more than anything else?" And the man said, "More than anything else, I wanted air."
      <br/>
      Socrates said, "All right, when you want wisdom and learning like you wanted air, you won't have to ask anybody to give it to you."

       Study English pronunciation.
       <br/>
       I will teach you in my verse
       <br/>
       Sounds like corpse, corps, horse, and worse.
       <br/>
       I will keep you, Suzy, busy,

       Make your head with heat grow dizzy.

      Sword and sward, retain and Britain.
      <br/>
      (Mind the latter, how it's written.)
      <br/>
      Now I surely will not plague you
      <br/>
      With such words as plaque and argue.
      <br/>
      But be careful how you speak:
      <br/>
      Say break and steak, but bleak and streak;
     </p>
     <p>
      Cloven, oven, how and low,
      <br/>
      Script, receipt, show, poem, and toe.
      <br/>
      Hear me say, devoid of trickery,
      <br/>
      Daughter, laughter, and Terpsichore,
      <br/>
      Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles,

      Exiles, similes, and reviles;

      Gertrude, German, wind and mind,

      Scene, Melpomene, mankind.

     <p>
      Billet does not rhyme with ballet,
      <br/>
      Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
      <br/>
      Blood and flood are not like food,
      <br/>
      Nor is mould like should and would.
      <br/>
      Viscous, viscount, load and broad,
      <br/>
      Toward, to forward, to reward.

      When you correctly say croquet,

      Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,

      Marriage, foliage, mirage, and age.

      Job, knob, bosom, transom, oath.

      Though the differences seem little,

      We say actual but victual.
      <br/>
      Refer does not rhyme with deafer.
      <br/>
      Foeffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
      <br/>
      Mint, pint, senate and sedate;
      <br/>
      Dull, bull, and George ate late.

      Scenic, Arabic, Pacific,

      Liberty, library, heave and heaven,

      Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,

      Petal, panel, and canal,

      Wait, surprise, plait, promise, pal.

      Senator, spectator, mayor.

      Heron, granary, canary.
      <br/>
      Crevice and device and aerie.
      <br/>
      Face, but preface, not efface.
      <br/>
      Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
      <br/>
      Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
      <br/>
      Ear, but earn and wear and tear
      <br/>
      Do not rhyme with here but ere.
      <br/>
      Seven is right, but so is even,
      <br/>
      Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
      <br/>
      Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,

      Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.

      Pronunciation -- think of Psyche!
      <br/>
      Is a paling stout and spikey?
      <br/>
      Won't it make you lose your wits,
      <br/>
      Writing groats and saying grits?
      <br/>
      It's a dark abyss or tunnel:
      <br/>
      Strewn with stones, stowed, solace, gunwale,
      <br/>
      Islington and Isle of Wight,
      <br/>
      Housewife, verdict and indict.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, which rhymes with enough --
      <br/>
      Though, through, plough, or dough, or cough?
      <br/>
      Hiccough has the sound of cup.
      <br/>
      My advice is to give up!

       Abraham Lincoln tells somewhere that as a boy when he met an obscure or ambiguous sentence in his reading it threw him into a sort of rage.
       <br/>
       The fact is that this was simply a form of instinct for clear thinking which is found in every child and manifests itself abundantly to the perception of the good teacher.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Far more important than any particular piece of knowledge, than geography or arithmetic or spelling, is this love of clearness in our mental life and instinctive hatred of confusion and obscurity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Let us learn to know what we know clearly and definitely, and also how we know it.
      <br/>
      The great intellectual need of men and women in the outer world is not so much more knowledge as it is better knowledge and better thinking.
      <br/>
      There is much philosophy in the humorist's remark, "It was never my ignorance that done me up, but the things I know'd that wasn't so."
     </p>
     <p>
      The great enemies of intellectual life are superstition, gullibility, and fallacious reasoning. A mere knowledge of facts, important as that is, is no safeguard against these.
     </p>
     <p>
      A conscious desire and resolve to think clearly is the true remedy. Our national success will depend largely upon the development of a generation of men and women who have formed a love and habit of clear thinking and who can do their part in solving the problems that confront civilized man today.

       How to tell a Canadian from an American

       It used to be enough to ask him to say the alphabet.
       <br/>
       When the Canadian got to the end, he'd say "zed" instead of "zee".
       <br/>
       But 18 years of Sesame Street have taught a lot of Canadian kids to say "zee," and it's starting to sound as natural as it does south of the 49th parallel.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      Another test used to be the word "lieutenant".
      <br/>
      Canadians pronounced it in the British was, "leftenant", while Americans say "lootenant".
      <br/>
      But American cop shows and army shows and movies have eroded that difference, too.
     </p>
     <p>
      Canadians have been adopting American spelling as well.
      <br/>
      They used to put a "u" in words like labour. The main organizationin the country, the equivalent of the AFL-CIO, is still officially called the Canadian Labour Congress.
      <br/>
      But news organizations have been wiping out that distinction by adopting American spelling, mostly to make it easier to use news copy from such agencies as Associated Press without a lot of changes.
      <br/>
      So it's "Canadian Labor Congress" when the Canadian Press, the national news agency, writes about it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some pronunciations, considered true tests of Canadians, are not as reliableas they're thought. Take the word "house" for example. When some Canadians say it, it sounds very Scottish in American ears. Visiting Americans trying to reproduce what they hear usually give the Canadian pronunciation as "hoose".
      <br/>
      The same for "out" and "about". The way some Canadians say them sounds like "oot" and "aboot" to many Americans. And when an American says "house" to a Canadian, the Canadian often hears a bit of an "ay" in it, something like "hayouse".
     </p>
     <p>
      But pronunciation isn't a good test because people from different parts of Canada speak differently. A resident of the Western province of Alberta, where there has been a considerable inflow of settlers from the United States, may sound like a Montanan or a Dakotan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then there's the ubiquitous Canadian expression "eh?" - pronounced "ay?"
      <br/>
      This is a better test because many Canadians tack it on to the end of every assertion to turn it into a question.

      A linguistics professor was lecturing to his English class one day.
      <br/>
      "In English," he said, "a double negative forms a positive.
      <br/>
      In some languages, though, such as Russian, a double negative is still a negative.
      <br/>
      However, there is no language wherein a double positive can form a negative."

       I was having lunch at the faculty club with a recent acquaintance when a young man approached my table, handed me a slip of paper, said "Two more" and walked away. My companion and I were just beginning to discuss the project that we had agreed to lunch about when another man came up, gave me another slip of paper, said "Three, maybe four" with an air of quiet triumph and left. A woman dropped off the next slip. "Only one this time," she said, "not a large number, but after awhile the mind tends to grow number."
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Would it be presumptuous to ask what this is all about?" my vis--vis said.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Not at all," I said. "It's a kind of game--trying to find a word that has two separate pronunciations, two distinct meanings, but only one spelling. Word games used to be used more often, but it's a subject I didn't intend to subject you to since you're an economist." He looked slightly annoyed. "The last economist I tried it on got his wind up before I'd even had a chance to wind up," I explained. "This is more likely to appeal to literary people."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Economists are not necessarily illiterate," he said. "Can you give me an example or two?"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      I handed him the slip the first man had given me. He unfolded it and read aloud:
      <em>
       "The bass swam around the bass drum on the ocean floor."
      </em>
      He paused to blink, then continued:
      <em>
       "The buck does odd things when the does are in heat
      </em>
      ... You sure this isn't some sort of a private code?"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Something I'd only intimate to my most intimate friends?" I said. "By no means." I handed him the slip the woman had given me, sure that it would be a good one; her mind moves so supply that she had already added a dozen to the total supply.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      <em>
       "A crow can scatter wheat seeds, but can a sow sow corn?"
      </em>
      he read, and laughed, but I sighed because the example duplicated one that had already been given me by a physicist obsessed with the game. "Oh!" my lunch companion said. "I get it. But what's the problem? There must be dozens of words that meet your three conditions."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "They're rather hard to find. Name one if you can."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      His silence lasted quite awhile but his lips kept moving.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Are you having dessert?" the waitress asked.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "After dessert she deserted..." he started off happily, but I interrupted with: "No good; the spelling must be the same."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Oh." Then after a pause, "But suppose I said: 'She wished she could desert him in the desert'?"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "On the nose--same spelling, two meanings, two pronunciations."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Give me a few more from your approved list," he said.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "A couple should be enough to present you with at present. First, a rather sweet one: 'After watching the seagull dive for a fish, the dove dove.'"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Lovely," he said. "Go on."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "OK, a final example," I said. "'The town dump is so full that it may have to start to refuse refuse. And if that makes the mayor blow his fuse, who will refuse him?'"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "That's a double," he said accusingly, and then added on with sudden inspiration: "When my mother-in-law accompanied us on our honeymoon trip to Niagara, I nearly threw the old dam over the dam."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Two-thirds OK, but the pronunciation is the same in both."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "D---," he said. Then, after a pause: "How about: 'In trigonometry, the sine is a
      <em>
       sine que non
      </em>
      '?"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Sorry," I said gently, "foreign languages don't count. Although one contribution, 'It's unwise to rub pt into one's pate,' struck me as so charming that I was tempted to give it a visa."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Why not?" he said. "Must you be so intransigent?"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      I sighed. "You make me feel that my sole object is to object. But I allow one great exception: 'Man's laughter can be crueler than manslaughter.'"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "That's really awe-inspiring. Do these things have a name?"
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      "Of course: heteronyms, logical relatives of synonyms, homonyms and antonyms."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      The next morning's mail brought seven sound ones from my lunch companion--not a bit to my surprise. Heteronyms spread like happy rumors, perhaps because they're so useful in warding off insomnia, migraines or irritation with airplane delays. A two-page list came from a paleoanthropologist on the same day that a novelist swam up to me on Martha's Vineyard and said, "I saw the weirdest thing in town: a hand reaching up from a manhole wielding a threaded needle. It's the first time I ever came upon a sewer in a sewer."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      We are, I think, coming close to a close with the contents of the master list, combining the inspirations of several score heteronymophiles for a 49-word total, including 16 you may or may not have spotted on this page.

       Spelling skills are declining in the United States, according to the latest "Futurist" magazine. Well, da. I mean, duh.
      </span>
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      I've always considered spelling a weird hangup propagated by that anal-retentive guy Webster just to sell a few books.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Dictionaries have become one of the most culturally divisive aspects of modern society. Just because stodgy old dudes like Daniel Webster believed there was only one way to spell a word doesn't mean our sovereign spelling rights should be violated.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Let me ax you a question. Shouldn't spelling keep up with the current pronunciation of words?
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      You can't watch a television talk show these days without people "axing" each other to death with questions. If kids spend their early years in schools where questions are "axed", not "asked," how can you expect them to know that the letters "s" and "k" are somehow associated with the word?
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      And that's an easy one. How about all the words out there that mean exactly the same thing but are spelled differently? How do you explain to a youngster that the wild beasts called "wildebeests" in Africa and "antelopes" in America are old "gnus" to everyone else?
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Gnu, by the way, is one of those gnarly words that gnaw and gnash like a gnostic gnat on the common-sense lobe of our brains.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Why does the letter G command such a prominent position in these words and yet pull so little actual duty?
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Who was the G whiz who invented the Verbal Stealth Technology that renders such Gs phonetically invisible? Or are these words alien vessels, equipped with Klingon Cloaking Devices that selectively shield certain letters from audio detection?
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      I challenge you to bravely go where no reader has gone before and explore the following sentence:
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      The new gnu knew which witch a night knight might now know, but not which waves waifs waive when surfing serfs, where we were, wear wire ware at noon and from one to two, too.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      YOU can imagine how frightening a flight through such a sentence would be for, say, a 7-year-old child attempting to learn our language. It's the type of sentence that might make the child flee to another country where language adheres to certain natural laws, such as gravity.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      But when it comes to the English language, there is no gravity. What marginal laws of spelling there are - such as "I before E except after C" - are cavalierly suspended at will by the language gods. For proof, we merely have to turn to "science."
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Kids learn certain things early in life. And one of them is, when you gotta "P," you gotta "P," period. That is, unless "P" starts hanging out with incorrigible letters such as "H." Then the "P" forsakes its P-ness, dons the phonetic trappings of a completely different letter and sashays around town pretending to be an "F." It's pointless and sad. Especially when a child discovers her dream of a "pony" has become a "phony" simply because our language forefathers (and foremothers) could not control their alphabet.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      Is it so surprising, then, that kids 2day find language 2 hard 2 handle and look 4 ways 2 take spelling shortcuts?
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      And technology has been no help. Computer spell-checkers are sullen and moody and steadfastly refuse to do their job.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      The cheapest computer on the market can slice pi to the three-millionth digit but pretends like it doesn't know the difference between "cent" and "sent." If you want my two scents worth, that stinks. And stinks.
     </p>
     <p class="body02">
      So maybe spelling skills are declining. But just remember, while seasonings change, thyme marches on and the brave gnu, whirled, keeps turning.

       Since the dealer doesn't understand he asks him to spell the word, and here's what the gangster said... " 'G' for Jeans 'U' for Onions 'N' for Knickers 'S' for Cement."

      We'll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,
      <br/>
      but the plural of ox became oxen not oxes.
      <br/>
      One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,
      <br/>
      yet the plural of moose should never be meese.
      <br/>
      You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,
      <br/>
      yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the plural of man is always called men,
      <br/>
      why shouldn't the plural of pan be called pen?
      <br/>
      If I spoke of my foot and show you my feet,
      <br/>
      and I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?
      <br/>
      If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,
      <br/>
      why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?
     </p>
     <p>
      Then one may be that, and three would be those,
      <br/>
      yet hat in the plural would never be hose,
      <br/>
      and the plural of cat is cats, not cose.
      <br/>
      We speak of a brother and also of brethren,
      <br/>
      but though we say mother, we never say methren.
      <br/>
      Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,
      <br/>
      but imagine the feminine, she, shis and shim.
     </p>
     <p>
      Let's face it - English is a crazy language.
      <br/>
      There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger;
      <br/>
      neither apple nor pine in pineapple.
      <br/>
      English muffins weren't invented in England.
      <br/>
      We take English for granted.
      <br/>
      But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that
      <br/>
      quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square,
      <br/>
      and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.
     </p>
     <p>
      And why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers
      <br/>
      don't groce and hammers don't ham?
      <br/>
      Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not
      <br/>
      one amend? If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get
      <br/>
      rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?
     </p>
     <p>
      If teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught?
      <br/>
      If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?
      <br/>
      Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speaking English
      <br/>
      should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane.
     </p>
     <p>
      In what other language do people recite at a play and
      <br/>
      play at a recital? We ship by truck but send cargo by ship.
      <br/>
      We have noses that run and feet that smell.
      <br/>
      And how can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same,
      <br/>
      while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?
      <br/>
      <br/>
      You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language
      <br/>
      in which your house can burn up as it burns down,
      <br/>
      in which you fill in a form by filling it out,
      <br/>
      and in which an alarm goes off by going on.
     </p>
     <p>
      So if Dad is Pop, how come Mom isn't Mop?
     </p>
     <p>
      And I've often wondered: How come we park in a driveway and drive on
      <br/>
      a parkway? Makes no sense!
