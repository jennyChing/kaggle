             With only four letters and three numbers, Ford created a legend. Even if you dont know the details, as a Mustang enthusiast, you certainly know the name Boss 302. You have to go back a few decades to discover the first edition, which came out in 1969. Despite only lasting two model years, the original Mustang Boss 302 blasted into the automotive history books leaving two smoking tire marks that are still there today.
            </p>
            <h2>
             The Early Days
            </h2>
            <p>
             In 1969, the Ford Mustang was still a baby. Having arrived in early 1964, the first pony car had created a whole new class of sports car, and met immediate success. The formula was simple: Ford took an existing rear-wheel drive chassis (the same one that underpinned the Falcon), introduced a sporty 2+2 coupe body, and stuck inline-6 and V8 engines under the hood.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pricing made the Mustang affordable to many people who previously couldnt afford to own a performance car, and the rest is history. While other manufacturers copied the Stang over the years, none can claim the throne as the most loved and best-selling pony car of all time. That distinction belongs to the Mustang.
            </p>
            <p>
             Part of the mystique is due to the many special performance models Ford released over the years. One of the most legendary is the Boss 302 Mustang. As the name suggests, the heart of the car was a 302 cubic inch V8. Though to be fair, the 302 wasnt designed to fit in the updated 1969 Mustang. The 69 was designed to fit around the 302. The Boss 302 story is an exciting one, and any enthusiast can appreciate the dedication and vision that went into creating this beloved sports car legend.
            </p>
            <h2>
             When the Boss Tells You to Do It, You Do It
            </h2>
            <p>
             So how did the Boss 302 get its name? While the Boss label makes perfect sense for a car that dominated the competition, the name actually came from a more literal meaning. Larry Shinoda, the man credited as the designer of the Boss 302, was once asked about what project he was working on. To keep the project a secret, he simply responded the bosss car. This clearly struck a chord, as the car was baptized Mustang Boss 302 when it hit the market in 1969. It was based on the newly redesigned Mustang, but was created with a very specific mission.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its mission involved the phrase race on Sunday, sell on Monday, and its the reason the 302 came to be. Rules in the SCCA (Sports Car Club of America) racing league stated that a manufacturer had to sell a production version of any car entered to race in the Trans-Am series. Ford had no choice but to come up with a production version if they wanted to race a high performance Stang.
            </p>
            <p>
             This was important to Ford, especially since the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro was available with more powerful V8 engines than the Mustang  it had also won the 1968 Trans-Am racing series. There was no way they were going to be outdone by the newcomer, so Ford devised a plan to create an all-out performance Mustang. But it was going to take some creativity.
            </p>
            <h2>
             A Tale of Two Cities
            </h2>
            <p>
             A Ford racecar for the Trans-Am series was going to need an engine. However, Fords most recent attempt at a high-performance engine, the tunnel port Windsor V8, had resulted in a disappointing racing year for Ford. At the same time, work had started on a new 351 cubic inch engine that would be built in Cleveland and bear that name.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a true case of the sum of the parts being greater than the whole, Ford engineers combined the Windsor block with the Cleveland heads, and ended up with the
             <a href="http://www.cjponyparts.com/mustang-crate-engines-cylinder-blocks/c/60060250/">
              Boss 302 engine
             </a>
             for the Mustang. The strengths of these two components created a stout, powerful racing engine that would be responsible for turning the Mustang into a winning racecar that would take the Trans-Am series title in 1970.
            </p>
            <p>
             The process involved much more than a case of simply throwing together a pair of heads and a block and calling it a day. The 302 engine was actually the first use of the Cleveland head design, which wouldnt see regular production for a few years. However, Fords forward-thinking engineers were convinced that the larger heads could be mated to the small-block Windsor so they found a way to make them work together.
            </p>
            <p>
             One significant feature of the 302 was that the heads were oversized relative to the block, and much larger than the competitions heads. The result was a heavy, over 500-pound engine that compensated with impressive power. The stats were impressive for the era:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              302 cubic inch Windsor small-block V8, with 4-inch bore and 3-inch stroke
             </li>
             <li>
              Modified Cleveland cylinder heads, with 2.23 inch intake valves and 1.71 inch exhaust valves
             </li>
             <li>
              Unique mechanical cam with high-lift design

             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The official stats for the production 302 were 290 bhp at 5,800 rpm and 290 lb-ft at 4,300 rpm. Insurance companies were quick to target high-power engines, so it wasnt uncommon for manufacturers to underrate the engines in their sports cars. The Boss 302 engines installed in the track versions of the Mustang were accurately listed at 470 horsepower.

             and the other necessary upgrades, the Mustang brand was finally ready to compete. The 1968 Trans-Am series was taken by the Chevrolet Camaro, and that didnt sit well with Ford, who had created the whole pony car class several years prior. There was no doubt that the 302 was meant for the track. The Boss 302 engine provided some impressive performance stats:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Acceleration of 0-60 mph in 6.9 seconds

            </ul>
            <p>
             The Ford team was led by Bud Moore, and while they failed to win in 1969, two Boss 302 Mustangs were entered in the 1970 season. One of them, driven by Parnelli Jones, pulled off a win and took the SCCA Trans-Am Championship. Having made its mark, the Boss 302 Mustang disappeared after a short two-year production run, leaving place in the lineup for the 429 to be the torch-bearer for Ford racing.

             The 302 engine had several additional performance features that made it perfect for a race engine:

              The big Cleveland heads used 8 valve cover bolts instead of six, and featured a wide intake manifold.

              Connecting rods were forged from high-strength steel to support the high RPMs of the Boss.

              Small Autolite sparkplugs were used due to the large valves taking up space.

            <p>
             These design features combined to create what has become one of the true American performance legends. More than 40 years later, collectors and enthusiasts still hold up the Boss 302 as a perfect example of a street-legal racecar  and the price of these rare cars on the used-car market prove it. It was the solid lifter design that produced that distinctive chatter that still gets fans heartbeats racing fast today.

             More Developments
            </h2>
            <p>
             The Boss 302 Mustang may only have lasted two years, but there were a few differences between the 1969 and the 1970 models.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 1969 Boss Mustang featured several exterior upgrades relative to the standard Mustang, including front and rear spoilers. A C-shaped stripe on the sides made the car easily identifiable, along with the deletion of the fake rear fender scoops that were present on other 1969 Stangs. Only a few options were available, including a blacked-out hood and a rear window shade that added to the racy look. Just under 2,000 examples of the Boss 302 would be sold in 1969.
            </p>
            <p>

              <img alt="boss 302 grille" src="/sites/default/files/u8/04_boss302_grille-new.jpg"/>
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             For the following year, the Mustang front end was modified, going to single headlights on each side within the grille while adding vents in the previous outboard light positions. Two L-shaped stripes were also added to the hood. Beyond these cosmetic changes, a standard Hurst shifter appeared, as did a modified competition suspension and the dual exhaust system. Under the hood, the original chrome valve covers were swapped out for aluminum versions, while the intake valves were reduced in size. Over 7,000 units of the second year Boss sold.
            </p>
            <p>
             SCAA rules stated that at least 1,000 copies of each car be sold per year, and the Boss 302 Mustang easily met that goal. The traffic the Boss drove into Ford showrooms was even more important. Already an unquestionable success, the new race-bred Mustang helped ignite the new breed of Mustang fans that exists to this day. Subsequent generations of Mustangs became legends in their own right, and developed huge followings. This created a need for aftermarket support, which is where CJ Pony Parts comes in.

             Having been produced over 40 years ago, and only ever in low numbers, finding a Boss today isnt easy. Thankfully, enthusiasts have kept the remaining examples in beautiful shape, and there is a lot of respect for an original Boss 302 Mustang. If you happen to own one of these rare beauties, you know how hard it can be to find parts to keep it in original, showroom condition.
            </p>
            <p>
             A car like the Boss begs to be driven, and parts eventually wear out and need to be replaced. CJ Pony Parts carries a full lineup of parts for all of the popular Mustang models, including the Boss 302.

            <p>
             Finding an original 302 V8 replacement engine is also nearly impossible today, and even if you could, it would likely require significant repairs and upgrades to get it back into race-quality condition. Your best option is a crate motor, and CJ Pony Parts has a

            <p>
             What if youre not blessed with an original Boss Mustang? Nothing is stopping you from building your own! A crate engine is a great choice when youre upgrading or modifying a Mustang, and the Boss 302 from Ford Racing is a popular choice for an ultimate performance Stang. The specifications of the Z363 crate engine are impressive:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Based on the 302 small-block Ford block (8.2 deck), with a displacement of 363 cubic inches
             </li>
             <li>
              Develops 500 horsepower at 6500 rpm and 450 pound-feet of torque at 5300 rpm
             </li>
             <li>
              Piston dimensions of 4.125 inches bore by 3.400 inches stroke
             </li>
             <li>
              Forged internal components (including the pistons, connecting rods, and crankshaft)
             </li>
             <li>
              Unique Ford Racing Z aluminum cylinder heads
             </li>
             <li>
              Black wrinkle finish cast aluminum heads with Boss script
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             The engine is internally balanced, and it makes more than 50 hp and 50 lb-ft of torque than the Z347 it replaced in Ford Racings lineup. A high-performance oiling system keeps the engine lubricated as it revs up to 6500 rpm.

             Building a Custom Boss
            </h2>
            <p>
             While the crate engine is a popular and easy drop-in solution, some enthusiasts are looking for something a little more customizable. If youre rebuilding your Mustang but want more flexibility, a new block might be the best starting point. Any original block, even on a well-cared-for Mustang, is going to be showing signs of wear. The Mustang was a pony car that was designed to be driven, and most examples of the 1960s and 1970s Mustangs are showing their age after decades of burnouts and drag races.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even a solid traditional steel block like the reliable Mustang small-block will eventually need to be replaced, especially if youre upgrading the performance. CJ Pony Parts offers over a dozen different blocks for all generations of Mustangs. One of the most exciting is obviously the

             </li>
             <li>
              Maximum stroke up to 3.400 inches
             </li>
             <li>
              Machined tolerances to allow factory lifter guides and retainers

             Ford realized that the appeal of the Boss name was as strong as ever, which is why they reintroduced it as a model of the fifth generation Mustang. Available as a special edition model in 2012 and 2013, the Boss 302 once again carried a V8  this modern version developing 444 horsepower and 380 lb-ft of torque.
            </p>
            <p>
             Taking things one step further, there was also a Laguna Seca version of this new Boss, which added suspension and interior enhancements on top of the already capable Boss modifications. The all-new, sixth generation Mustang recently stormed onto the sports car scene. It has not only been an instant success in the U.S. and Canada, but its on its way to international markets all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the first time ever, it will even be available in right-hand drive right from the factory for markets like Australia and the United Kingdom. No Boss 302 has been mentioned yet, but fans can only hope that Ford will once again dust off the Boss name with a Mustang that can dust the competition!
