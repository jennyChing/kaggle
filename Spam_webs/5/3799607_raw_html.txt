        . I know; I used to.
       </p>
       <p>
        My first dance with depression happened fifteen years ago. I was in my early twenties and it totally freaked me out.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         When youre depressed, your perception of pretty much everything changes.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Except you dont realize that its your perception thats changed, and instead it feels like the world has turned bad. If youve been depressed youll know what Im talking about.
       </p>
       <p>
        It goes something like this 
       </p>
       <p>
        One day you feel confident and happy, and then the next day, ugh!
       </p>
       <p>
        All the ideas and plans you have now seem ridiculous, your thoughts become morbid, and boy do you feel sluggish and sleepy, and why (yawn) is your boyfriend/friend/parent/spouse being so critical and mean all of a sudden?
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         And if thats not enough, the world seems more abrasiveas if someones turned up the volume and taken off your sunglasses.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what happened to me. I cried. I felt sorry for myself. And I couldnt for the life of me understand why I felt so bad: I had loads of friends and an awesome boyfriend; Id recently been accepted into the Post Graduate Masters Degree program for Human Nutrition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Life was good. Or it would be if I only could stop crying!
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I went to the doctor, which made me feel better because the doctor told me I had a chemical imbalance in my brain; but then she told me I was depressed, which made me cry again since I thought depression was for

        with no plans for their life.
        <strong>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        So that was that. I was depressed. I had an illness. I took the medication and kind of, sort of started to feel better.
       </p>
       <p>
        But after a year things started to change. I dont remember why I started doing thismaybe I read it somewherebut I stopped taking antidepressants, and whenever a flat period would come Id watch it with as much distance as I could summon.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         I started to notice that if I just let the flatness
         <em>
          be
         </em>
         and stopped worrying about it, my perception about something would shift, and as it did, the depression would lift.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        The more times this happened, the more I began to trust that it was going to happen. And always, there standing on the other side of the
        <em>
         flatness
        </em>
        , was an understanding that made my life richer,

         Looking back, its not surprising I was depressed, or that it would lift once I started taking better care of myself.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Other shifts included the realizations that I was creative (back then I thought creativity was for other people) and that I was spiritual being, connected to all things.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stopped seeing depression as a disease and started to see it as a

        I like how Kahlil Gibran explains it too:
       </p>
       <p>
        Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. ~Kahlil Gibran,

        For a number of years that was how I understood depression, but it wasnt until more recently when I spent the best part of a year being silent that I understood more fully what was going on.
       </p>
       <p>
        My year of silence is another story, but in short, it involved me metaphorically throwing my hands in the air saying, I am so over repeating these old habits. How do I make this stop?!
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that emerged from my year of silence was an appreciation of the scale of madness of the mind and how to differentiate myself
        <em>
         from
        </em>
        my mind.
        <strong>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         We live in a world focused on strengthening the mind and listening to it above all else. But when we do this, we get out of balance. The truth is, our mind is only a small part of usand its not the wise part. It can be the worrying, negative, computer like part.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        A friend of mine explains depression as what happens when you listen to your mind at the expense of your heart for too long, ignoring the natural flow of your life and your inner wisdom.
       </p>
       <p>
        He says, Depression is your heart stepping aside temporarily.
       </p>
       <p>
        This explains why you feel so down on yourself. The unpleasantness of depression is what it feels like to use your mind without full use of your heart, since your heart is the bit that loves and feels connected and joyful.
       </p>
       <p>
        So often you hear people say how they beat depression by taking up skydiving or some other new behavior, but probably its the other way around. The depression lifted because the message to take up skydiving was received. The depressions job was done.
        <strong>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        If youre going through a depressed period, it may help to adopt these attitudes:
       </p>
       <h4>
        <strong>
         Non-Judging.
        </strong>
       </h4>
       <p>
        It is what it is, and it will pass, so theres no point in judging it.
       </p>
       <h4>
        <strong>
         Live Kindly
        </strong>
        .
       </h4>
       <p>
        Eat well, exercise where you can, and continue to live. Be gentle with yourself. It can sometimes be helpful to talk to someone.
       </p>
       <h4>
        <strong>
         Mind your Mind
        </strong>
        .
       </h4>
       <p>
        Try and stand back from your mind and know that much of what your mind is telling you is incorrect. Know that your mind is operating alone while you heart takes a little rest, which is why you feel so bad and why you cant
        <em>
         feel
        </em>
        as much love for yourself or others.
       </p>
       <h4>
        <strong>
         Silence.
        </strong>
       </h4>
       <p>
        Add a little downtime to your life. Instead of watching TV or trawling Facebook, take some time out and try just sitting. The thing youre looking for is not outside of you, but within you. Meditation can be helpful too.
       </p>
       <h4>
        <strong>
         Be Safe
        </strong>
        .
       </h4>
       <p>
        Often depression comes with morbid thoughts. Monitor these. Theyre just thoughts, and they will pass as
        <em>
         the
        </em>
        <em>
         flatness
        </em>
        lifts, but at any stage if you feel unsafe, ask someone for help.
       </p>
       <p>
        I write about a lot of things, but this is the first time Ive written my thoughts on depression because its so often judged.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is that most people experience some degree of depression, or as I like to call it
        <em>
         flatness,
        </em>
        at some time in their lives. It is a normal reaction felt by just about everyoneand we can all get past it.

           I very much resonate with this story. Having experienced several bouts of depression throughout my life, these events proved to be the beginning of a new phase. One being publishing a memoir where I shared this part of myself with the world.  Im actually now in a silence period.  Thanks so much!  Cards welcome!

           Thank you so very much for this post! Ive spent most of the last 4 months feeling guilty for even feeling depressed.  Being much like you (great family, friends, boyfriend, job but also a huge people pleaser/perfectionist) it didnt make sense to me for a very long time.  This post has put what Ive been thinking into words and I cant thank you enough!! Youve reinforced my  positive view on depression!  This website is amazing and Ill forever be grateful!

           Thank you for bravely sharing your experiences with depression.  I think this has the potential to help a lot of people.  I already shared your article with a dear friend who is struggling with depression, it will help her to see that she is not alone and to have new options to consider in terms of how to re frame her experience.

           Thank you for taking the time and energy to write.  As you said, everyone goes thru periods of depression.  By writing you have affirmed that we are not alone and given us a new perspective.  Flatness is a very good description.  We can learn from everything in our life  depression included.  Enjoy your journey and keep us up.

           Thank you for this post. This spoke to me more than you know as I have been feeling pitiful as of late. Last night was particularly flat, so I was happy to see this in my Inbox today  it was very fitting and helpful. Im a firm believer in therapy/talking to someone and have recently started meditating. I definitely think I need to add more meditation since it has helped, but the tips in this post really will help get me through the next few days or until the flatness subsides. Right now Im just numb and uncaring. I know its just temporary and I will keep this article to reread whenever i doubt that.

           Thank you for this post.  This has hit home for me and I have seen so many suffer from this in their lives, and I have even had a bout of it in the past.  It is so real and personal, your words are so kind and clear and really hitting the nail on the head.  I would love to share this message with anyone I know who has had a remote touch of depression (which could be just about anyone!). Your an excellent writer and of course I would love to see your cards as a gift to me, as I am sure they are just as wonderful.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am glad you shared your thoughts on depressionit is a gift to many others that your courage allowed you to share.

           This is the best description I have seen of what it is like to go through a depression, or a flatness as you call it. A good description, because that is how it feels! I love your suggestions, very helpful.

           Wow, that was helpful. Your friends advice is really meaningful to me: Depression is your heart stepping aside temporarily. I just realized that every time I was depressed was after having been in my head for too long. Thank you.

           Thank you so much for sharing this. I have dealt with depression for years and the past 19 months have been the hardest in my life. I am currently taking antidepressant to get through the flatness. I have found that they tame my mind with those wicked thoughts of self doubt and cruelness it can project. It is important to remember that you arent the only one and the world isnt against you. Everything has a reason and we dont always know the whys until we have weathered the storm. The storm may actually not really have anything to do with us directly. We must proceed through each day and know that this too shall pass.

           Lisa, I truly appreciate your post!  I appreciate your strength and willingness to open up, as it reminds me that Im not the only one.  Ive battled depression for the past 10 years or so.  I find that I have to work the hardest at battling it between late fall and early spring.  As I gear up for the season to change, I will add your 5 helpful attitudes to adopt to my toolkit.  These are great recommendations that I will turn to in times of flatness.  Thank you!

           I really enjoyed this post, however, I think that sometimes medication can be a helpful and healthy option. I spent several years trying to get my anxiety under control. I started working out more, having more me time, eating better, studying teachings by the Dalai Lama, but I finally had to recognize I needed a little help to take the edge off my feelings so I could manage them. I think many people feel that choosing to try medication for something like anxiety or depression is like declaring defeat. That is dangerous. No one should feel shamed out of trying medication if they truly need that assistance.

           Thats good advice for many people, but please be aware that some really do have legitimate, biological mental illness, and they really do require psychiatric help.  I have a severe mood disorder, and while I do much of what you prescribe, I still need medication to stay sane and out of the hospital.  If your flatness is particularly bleak, or if youre thinking of suicide, PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR.

           Thank you for sharing your experience with depression.  There is a lot of stigma out there about it, despite its prevalence.
           <br/>
           Just the word depression stirs up so many fears in people.   My own brother told me I wasnt welcome to come around his kids when I erred in telling him I was experiencing hormonally charged depression related to perimenopause and assumed I was suicidal.  If I had just said I was more hormonal, I wouldnt have gotten that reaction out of him.  It is what it is  a damn shame.

           Thank you very much for sharing your insights on depression.  Your description of the whole process is elegant and simple, and it resonates with me.  It resonates with me (i.e. it feels right), and I look forward to keeping this gem of wisdom &amp; perspective close, and sharing it with others.

           Something in this post grabbed my attention in a way little else has in a long while.  Something about depression is an imbalance, and something about the flatness.  That is my experience of depression  flatness.  I can recognize joy in my life  joy in being with my grand daughters and family and partner, in moments of creativity.  But the flatness returns without warning or reason.  I have no illusions that these healing cards are THE answer, but I do see how helpful they might be, as reminders to let go, let it be what it is, shift a bit, be mindful, learn from others, listen, shift a bit more.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am 56 years old.  Sometimes I think I should have a handle on my depression by now.  Instead, what Ive learned is that every time the flatness comes, I have to reach for new handles.  Perhaps these cards can be a new handle.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you for this!

           I really like your take on depression, we do all indeed struggle with it in some form or fashion throughout the trials of life.  BUT I do believe that what you are saying is truth, if we listen, slow down, and pay attention to what our heart is telling usthis too shall pass!  Bravo!  I enjoy getting your email everyday, would love to win the life cards!  Good luck to everyone.xo

           Thank you, I could likely read this everyday.  Going through multi-layered griefwhich then asks, is this grief or depression? Does it matter? Do we treat it?
           <br/>
           I do believe there is learning to be had, as Parker Palmer speaks about the descent and that it is our teacher.  I love the quote about the pain is breaking open to the understandingto just trust THAT pattern!

           Thanks so much for your comments and advice. And I agree.  I also truly believe there is no right or wrong way to deal with depression  or anything for that matter! Whatever we feel is right for us is absolutely completely perfect. L:)

           Thank you Lisa for the post.   I especially like your advice that it will pass and wish someone had told me that years ago when I first began to experience bouts of prolonged sadness. After seeking some professional help and becoming more aware that every episode did indeed end, I began to feel less sad just by knowing I will not be feeling that bad forever.  That feeling was so frightening! Be well, Deborah

           Thanks for such a great article! I have suffered with depression on and off for years. I have always thought it was caused by lifes eventsI have been through some terrible ordeals in my life and have believed these to be the sole cause but your post has made me think that possibly it could an imbalance in my brain. I have been perscibed medication in my life but the last time I was (which was a couple of years ago) I just stopped taking itI thought enough was enough! I also had an excellent councellor last year who made me look at things in a completely different way and that has helped a lot! I do still have bad daysIm struggling through a bitter divorce and am a single mum to 3 kids the youngest being 4 years old.but as you suggested I just sit with itI turn off the TV and computer and have some quiet time and watch and feel the emotions as they pass and also try to meditate too. I also feel that you need good and understanding friends/family around youI dont think I could have got through the dark times without them! :O)

           Thank you so much for this post, Ive been suffering from depression for a number of years, without realising how badly it was affecting both my intimate and personal relationships. That was until I learnt to communicate with friends and family without feeling or perceived as weak.  Your post and most of the comments have helped me to realise that this isnt just a problem that affects only me. Im now arranging to see a pyschologist, so your post will help me in my efforts to help myself.  Keep up the good work, as I really look forward to reading your daily posts.

           I never thought Id say this about a post on depression, but I thought this post was lovely.  It really brings to the forefront the ideas that this is not a permanent state, that it can get better, that you are not to blame, and that you can have control over the way you feel.  Thank you for your insiteful, find and lovely words.

           Youre very welcome, Deborah! Thanks for sharing your experience  I remember  experiencing the same sense of relief when I stopped judging and analyzing what I was feeling. It seemed to take a lot of the sting out of it, and as you put it so well, made it less frightening!

           You know, there is a thought that springs up in my mind when reading all this, one that I initially read about on another Buddhist website. Its all about me, me, me. I think depression is largely an illness strengthened by out egocentrism. This may sound harsh to someone suffering, but if you think about it when in a peace of mind, I think its quite close to the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Oh, I am SO miserable. Oh, I have no goals. Oh, why do I deserve this! Well, not only is this an escape from reality, in a sense, since you are just ruminating rather than facing reality, it is also a preoccupatuon with the I, the me and mine behind our suffering. Its dellusional, inefficient. If you can, force yourself and go help other people selflessly; perhaps you will notice the egos dissolution happen at the same time as the mood slightly lifts, even as the mind tries to manipulate with it again.

           I really enjoyed this article.  Ive certainly been depressed at times and just recently found myself again becoming depressed and frustrated as to why.  Ive been on such a great self awareness journey lately.  Your article is timely.  I absolutely love the quote you added from Kahlil Gibran,
           <br/>
           Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
           <br/>

           Its brave to share your experience with depression.  I have had a hard time putting my own into words; to attempt to explain it to anyone else is difficult as I cant always identify a word for the emotion Im feeling or the lack thereof.  Flatness is a pretty good description though.  I would like to get off my meds just because of side effects but I am also fearful of how I would be without them.  For me, I think flatness beats
           <br/>
           the peaks and valleys and definitely the deep dark valleys of despair.  Thank you for your advice though. Knowing other ways of dealing with depression is helpful.

           Thanks so much for you comment   Im pleased you enjoyed the post. And I agree with your comment, that theres nothing defeatist about taking medication. Which ever way we choose to deal with depression (or anything for that matter) is perfect, I reckon.

           Thank you so much for this post! Its so true!! My husband and I have been wanting to split up for a few years now but have been encouraged against our better judgement by my parents who are very strong Christians. Theyve been saying awfully negative things about divorce that has made me believe God would hate me and I started ignoring my heart and as a result I have fallen into a deep depression. Its only since distancing myself from what they believe and listening to my heart that my depression has eased

           Excellent post, thank you! I think for many of us who dont suffer from serious depression, its still difficult to see our way beyond occasional bouts.  Still learning and growing in this regard, and grateful for every opportunity and challenge to do so!

           Ive struggled with depression for years and have never heard it explained quite this way. It is very helpful to me. Thank you for posting. Changing thinking, talk therapy and medication are all helpful in dealing with this debilatating disease.

           I realized on my way into work this morning that all my negativity yesterday was due to yet another round of depression. I dont see it right away when it comes, I just leave everyone around me wondering what they did to stress me out.  I am going to take this post, print it, and read it every day for a week.  The quote by Kalil Gibran especially resonated with me.  I need to move into and through the pain in order to grown into a new creation.
           <br/>
           It is also perfect with the post it was paired with in the e-mail.  Finding the courage to live out loud is what is scaring me right now.  Consequently, I find excuses and reasons to be miserable.  Thank you for challenging me to see that this is a process.  Perhaps an evaluation would be helpful but for the most part, I think I need to acknowledge, experience, and move through the depression.

           Lovely, thoughtful post.  I, too, spent a year of silence and didnt realize it until starting to come back to activity, as a different person.  I meditated, prayed, and continually asked for the openness to change my perspective to  more positive outlook.  I feel like Ive only just begun and it feels wonderful.  Id dearly love to receive your cards and would treasure them.

           As someone who has struggled with depression on and off for the last ten years, I want to thank you for providing me with new ways to view those times in my life. My mom sometimes refers to depression as growing pains  the pain and discomfort that sometimes happens when youre on the verge of a big personal change. I think anxiety, something I also struggle with, could be looked at in the same ways, so I plan to print your post out and read it the next time Im feeling anxious or flat! Thank you for sharing your perspective.

           i have been depressed for 4 years. i can suggest that self-compassion is very helpful. it breaks a blind circle of blaming and self-criticizing. another things i use are meditation. it slows and calms all down that we can see them more clearer. also positive people around help me to get better. and all the things wrote above as well.

           I appreciate your objectivity on this subjectI have dealt with this depression most of my life, took medication at one point which was helpful and now through my spiritual practice I recognize depression to be a way that I am disconnected from my true naturethere is nothing more painful to me and I know that through all the things you mentioned in particular meditation and inquiry that I do come back to a more complete sense of self and I am in touch againthank you

           Thank you for such a great reframe on depression. Your tips can help alleviate pressure and stress that often accompany depression. And often help you gain some distance between your emotions, feelings &amp; your thoughts so you can gain insight.

           lovely post I have had people around me with depression, sometimes its not understandable to me but I do believe in finding the silence and spending a little time finding and understanding ourselves, surely this is better than a quick pill from a doctor nothing in this existence is an accident and we should listen to our heart do we need to have everything in our life labelled with a diagnosis. have a wonderful day, may it be filled with just a little of your own silence xx

           I appreciated this post, and was also disturbed by it. Sadness is extremely natural and normal.  And there is depressionand then major depression.
           <br/>
           I am extremely biased. I had a dear friend with major depression decide to go off antidepressants. And a week later he killed himself. That was a good 15 years ago, and yet my sorrow remains. What an unnecessary loss.
           <br/>
           Depression is a serious condition. Although meditation, silence and insight are useful tools, it is dangerous to suggest they are cure for all or even almost all depression.
           <br/>
           Its hardbecause its knowing where to draw a line, between the normal ups and downs that we so easily (and unnecessarily) medicate for, and depression and mental illness that requires a range of more intensive attention.

           Thanks, Lisa. Really useful advice and something I need to re-read if ever I enter another flat period. I had awful post natal depression. It felt like all the colour had been drained out of my world, despite having a supportive husband and beautiful, happy baby. Every time I felt sad, it felt like I was betraying them. It is so hard to take that step back to see whats really going on, as the hormones cloud your judgment, but it can be done and life does get better again!

           This is a really calming post for me. Ive been experiencing depression lately because of my relationship/career/health situations, but reading this makes me wonder if Im experiencing these situations because I havent been following my heart. Itll be interesting to see how things change once I start listening to it more.

           I like this and can relate to it so much.  Depression is not always the enemy we make it out to be; we must listen to what it is trying to teach us.  Thank you for such an insightful, meaningful piece!  I shared it on my FB, too.

           Mind is not the wise part. Happy for you that what you told yourself lifted your depression. I disagree that our minds are not wise. Everyones depression is different. I think it is important to note this is 1 opinion.

           Thanks so much for sharing  that sounds really challenging. Those hormones can be a cow sometimes cant they  not that Ive experience post-natal ones. However, on one occasion a little hormonal re-balancing by a friendly naturopath was a HUGE help! (Which is a whole other topic of course!)

           Aaaah! Amazing post. Truly. Ive nearly been flattened by the flatness for, God, at least a decade (and Im only in my late 20s). I take an antidepressant. I know that it works for me. Chemically. But, thoughts and emotions and attitude are SO important to be aware of. Crucial. Especially when the flatness wrinkles up and one is able to feel alive again Thank you so so much for sharing this!! Your voice is gentle but direct. You shared your journey succinctly, but with enough color and detail to explain openly what its like to face depression. It sucks. )c: but it IS doable. (c:

           Identifying a need to get professional help is one thing.finding the right professional is a whole other ball game. Thats where things really get tricky and it can start to seem like OTC substances or even black market substances are not only cheaper but also much easier to access than doctors or counselors in the medical field. That is the unfortunately reality for some people who dont see a way out of their flatness.

           Well put, but I do know that there are times where it takes more than just a positive attitude to pull yourself out when youre in pretty deep. Depression has so many triggers and many are, indeed, chemical. Many times the anti-depressant is what it takes to help you stay above water long enough to make other changes that may or may not be able to help with the chemical imbalance.

           Thank you for this beautifully written description.  While its true that we are all individuals and experience things differently, I have been looking for a gentle way to describe to my boyfriend what it can feel like to be depressed.  Its sometimes hard for me  to explain without sounding over the top melodramatic.  I have struggled with depression to varying degree for most of my life and have learned that self awareness is key in integrating with the rest of the world, whether that means medication or meditation,  Thank you again for your insight.

           i took effexor as prescribed my doctor and it just made it worse now my lows are extremely deep valleys. i would just implore people to know every risk factor before taking anything.. and not just the ones in the sheet search the net and read what others have experienced just to prepare. i wish i had done that at least i wouldnt have believed the doc when he said its all in your head.

           Wow. Such a magnificent post and so well written. The last time I overcame my depression I was positive it wouldnt happen again. I recently faced a career disappointment and am feeling blue but not as darkly as I have in past situations.  Its so good to read everyones thoughts and see that depression is a normal human condition, and that we are not bad or the only one going through it. I definitely recommend Cheri Hubers The Depression Book for saving me a few years ago. She mentions that when you dont live your life to its fullest and BE who you are, you are causing depression in yourself. Its an actual compression of you who are, until you are that little person balled up on the couch in your PJs. I started living out loud and was happier almost instantly. I had to let go of a LOT of anger towards the people who I felt were depressing me, when I realized I was the one actually doing it! Lisa, thanks so much for sharing your post and your 7 secrets book. Im also going to print out this post and save it!

           You describe depression so eloquently, and the solutions to cope are legitimate. Ive been struggling with depression for a few years and, unknowingly, have been employing your techniques to deal with it. I can attest that what you wrote in this article are true. Thank you; Im definitely going to re-read this article when Im feeling down.

           I have been battling depression full time for over a decade. I have tried seemingly every med available. I am in the throes of severe flatness now. Im new to twitter and find myself searching depression and suicide about this time every night. Its a desperate attempt to feel less lonely. Sometimes posts like this one help.

           Lisa, thank you for your perspective on depression ~ its an honest and quite accurate way to look at it I believe. Its amazing the power it takes to monitor ones own mind and keeping from buying into ones own downward spiral. I often look at the onset of depression as a warning sign that something in my life needs to be adjusted and then I search for the source and try to correct the course of thinking and action. As the years have gone by Ive become less dependent on medication and more reliant on building coping mechanisms similar to ones that you mention here. Thanks for sharing with us!!

           This was a wonderful piece for me to read.  I have struggled with depression for years and this piece of writing is the first I have read that truly makes me feel that I have some power over controlling it. (I might also add that I am new to the teachings of Buddha as well, which might explain why I have never realized the right strategies of coping).

           Thanks Lisa, this post really spoke to me, having lived with periods of depression ( and prescribed antidepressants ) for almost 10 years now. I found physical exercise really helped, even though it was difficult to motivate myself. Ive had a couple of sessions of hypnotherapy over the last month, which seem to have had a hugely positive impact, in combination with talking to a counsellor.

           Just wanted to say that your advice is good because, even if one is dealing with a chemical imbalance, fixing the chemical imbalance wont necessarily fix your life. To quote Melissa Etheridge just breathe.

           Thank you for sharing your story! We need to continue to work to educate people about mental illness, so that we can reduce the stigma associated with it. Your work on tiny buddha is helpful to many!! Your cards seem very grounded and helpful as well. Good luck to everyone who is hoping to win a set. Peace.

           Thank you for sharing your post! Ive bookmarked it so I can reflect back on your advice next time I feel flatness coming on. Meditation is a wonderful way to help, but I also find setting a daily intention keeps my mind focused on positive thinking.

           I know the feeings that you describe well because I ride the rollercoaster of depression thanks to PMS for a little more than a quarter of almost every month. I KNOW that it is mainly due to out-of-control hormones,but Ive never wanted to take medication for it.  Its just crazy how my perceptions of life (in my own head) can turn so harrowingly negative during these time periods and thus create such sadness (in my heart) all atonce. Strongly reminding myself that I am being way overly-sensitive and unneccessarily analytical has helped over the years.  As Ive grown older Ive also realized that calm, alone-time is necessary to regain a sense of balance, along with the knowledge that this too shall pass. I enjoyed your thoughts.and advice. Thank you.

           The last year or so has been a journey of awakening, which has been a slow but rewarding process.  I believe in embracing mystery and seeing myself as one with ALL, but also separate at the same time.  It is quite a mysterious paradox.  One thing I feel is important for me is how getting help (i.e. counseling) can be part of the process of waking up.  I feel like a lot of enlightenment teaching tends to take an either/or approach as opposed to embracing both.  Counseling and medication has helped this body feel better as I also embrace the reality of my oneness with everything and everyone.

           Just an FYI, if one stops medications it is best to do so gradually and with your doctors knowledge.  Some meds have withdrawal symptoms that are pretty tough and that can be mistaken for other illnesses, both physical and emotional.  Stopping depression meds cold turkey is usually not a great idea.

           I have come to the understanding that my depression is a part of me, a facet of me, something that will always be there, yet not the real me, as my ego would have me believe, and so I ACCEPT it.  When I feel it, the best thing I can do for myself is to recognize and acknowledge it in the moment, accept it by remembering the big picture of my past experiences with and without the symptoms, and proceed to practice what I have learned to get through it again until it recedes.  My practices come under the heading Self-compassion and Self-care.  I have come to embrace those 12-Step slogans I used to resist: One Day at a Time, Easy Does It, How Important Is It?, and This, Too, Shall Pass.  Thank you for your contribution, and for reminding me to keep things in perspective and be gentle with myself.

           i saw one of my friends go under depression after her sons death,taking lots of medicine and bearing pangs of after effects.Then I also had those blues of depression.Seeing my friends plight I did not want to go into medicine.Talking to others helped but not that much.Finally what helped me was following Nichiren Diashonins phylosophy.

           I have gone through several periods of depression and taken meds for it.  But I have finally found a holistic, natural formula that works for me.  This includes regular exercise, a combination of vitamins and supplements for mood support that helps my body produce seratonin and meditation.  Sometimes its a matter of figuring out what doesnt work to discover what does.

           Thank you for this, Lisa. Ive struggled with depression off and on for years, and your description of it really spoke to me. I realize that I use some of the same ways of dealing with that you recommend, but Id never explicitly laid them out in this way. Its helpful to have this list to come back to remind myself of what works when I need it. Thank you!

           Interesting perspective.  Although medicine can play an important part, I think sometimes we think it is a silver bullet to cure all. I dont believe it is. I like your wholistic approach (medicine + therapy + positive thought = whole, healthy well-being. Thanks!

           I  agree!  And maybe this is a good opportunity to be clear that the med side of things is NOT my area of expertise.  I mentioned my experience because it was part of my story  but I in no way meant to suggest people stop medication. The 5 attitudes I believe are as relevant whether people chose to go the medication way or not!  Thanks so much for your message!

           Thanks so much, and yes  there really is no silver bullet, or one answer for all of us! If someone read my article and said, you know what, I disagreed with everything you said, but you spurred me on to come up with something that works for me  I would be delighted!  One of my Life Cards talks about this: CREATIVITY: Your healing is a work of art, an original lifestyle sculpture. Heres to us all finding our own perfect way!

           Yes  was a strange time  Just started out doing it for one day  and then a couple more. And then a few more. It had nothing to do with depression  except that I became pretty flat in the first few months of doing it. I had the support of a friend who knows a lot about this kind of thing. Not sure I would have tried without. Ill be talking about silence and, as I call it doing nothing over the next few weeks on my website and in my newsletter, in case youre interested. Thanks again!

           Hi Cindy, thanks so much for contributing to the discussion. I really appreciate your comments and would like to take this opportunity to be very clear that the topic of whether to medicate for depression is not an area I am an expert on, and as such would never advise anyone either way. Like all things  I believe there is no one right or wrong approach  and that whichever option we choose for our self, in this and in other matters, is perfect.

           Having recently slipped into depression myself after a terrible couple of years in which I tried to deal with things with a supressed heart this article has really helped me to change my view on where i am now. Flatness, I like that

           This is a cool article about feeling depressed, I have been there and I wish I had had this advice back when things were pretty bad for me a few years ago.  The year of silence sounds like a cool story. Thanks for the post!

           I love these five simple tips. Ive found that when I was going through depression, it was so difficult to begin to take better care of myself and get out of my mind. Ultimately, the only thing that worked was to take up yoga  because for an hour I was in my body and out of my depression. In other words: I started to realize that my depression wasnt me!

           depressionwhat happens when you listen to your mind at the expense of your heart for too long I find this to be a very valid and meaningful perspective. I have had bouts myself, as early as late teenage years and into college and again as an adult. I, too, was put on a medicated path and interestinglymy heart vehemently cried out NO, yet being in my head, I rationalized this was how it was going to be/help. It took years-many, many years- to listen to my heart. I educated myself on alternatives and found what works best for myself, my chemistry imbalance. Diet and exercise became primary components and have worked. {The Chemistry of Joy, by Henry Emmons was a helpful resource, merging Western science with Eastern Wisdom}
           <br/>
           Its always refreshing to hear someone else speak candidly about their experience with depression. Ive also heard the perspective that depression is a gateway to your soul/creativity/greater purpose. Its another view that says, its not forever. And I found great peace with that.
           <br/>
           Thank you for sharing your experience and bits of wisdom that emerged from it.

           Thank you for sharing this article and I too become clear about depression.   It is nothing just when we ignore our needs and desires.  I went through this depression many years but after that I learned that it was all mind made network of thoughts.   I started caring me more. but sometimes when these thoughts come again and again we all forget what is true. So we need everyday quite time to listen us .

           The best solution which worked for me is to live in Now as it is and just seeing it completely and living in it.    If we are not enjoying now means we are under some worry and soon it will become depression.   May we have dreams or plains but i tried hard to reach my dreams and do not reach anywhere by being more hard on me.  But when i learned to live as its is spending now . Then Universe start helping me.  Stop managing all by yourself and live in complete harmony of Universe is best solution for depressionaccording to me.

           I really enjoyed this article. Looking at moments of overload (which seem more common in our modern world full of distractions) by creating a sense of space and objectivity is a beautiful thought. That is something I really want to work on. It happens when I run or work out, but I definitely get into busy mind mode when Im working on creative projects.

           Hi Kasey, thanks for your note. You know, people say that to me often, that Im brave to talk about the things I do  but really were all the same  perfectly imperfect creatures making our way through life. Having this understanding makes me less fearful. Best wishes on your journey. PS: I just watched a wonderful talk that Lori gave  have you seen it? About Authentic Connections in a Networked World. I thought it was fantastic   its at the bottom of this page

           Hi Lisa  thanks so much for your note. And I think you might be right  what does it matter what you call it, it is what it is:) This sounds like a time to really be kind to yourself  although when is it not a time to be kind to ourselves, but you know what i mean! Best wishes, L.

           Wow thats exactly how I feel when my depression kicks in . . Like life has shifted and will never be fun anymore. Its hard to lift your head up and see that things will go back to normal.. . that your depressed state is not your new reality.Thank you for sharing your story.

           I come from a family with a history of clinical depression.  Mine began during adolescence and I was on Elavil when I attempted suicide at seventeen.  Since then I have been in and out of therapy, working hard on myself and have also been on and off of antidepressant medication.  I have come to the conclusion, now in my early 50s, that in my case, much of my problem is due to negative thinking patterns that are learned and passed down through generations of my parents families (in addition to physical and emotional abuse).  I would say that I agree, therefore with a great deal of what you are saying in your post, except that for me, the negative thinking led to great depressions in my life which altered my brain chemistry over time, which in turn required medication to restore my brains equilibrium.  Once that was accomplished, cognitive therapy could address the thought disorder.

           I loved this post and I couldnt have read it at a better time! I always thought you were either depressed or not depressed and that depression required drugs for a positive recovery!  I am currently studying mental health and am aware that there is clinical depression but that is by far different to flatness.  It is hard when you have those days of I hate the world or nothing ever goes right for me and at the time you really believe them and believe things wont change!  This post made me realise that I need to step back a bit when I am struck with these feelings and remember,
           <br/>
           Know that your mind is operating alone while you heart takes a little rest!

           This is the second time Ive read this article because Im currently going through depression. I love the part where you said that the heart stops and the brain takes over and to essentially not pay attention to what it has to say. Ive had a huge issue with listening to all the negative thoughts about every situation. I rip the most positive thing apart and turn it into a negative. And when I think something is positive, I will actualy tell myself that I am being delusionalyet another negative thought! Its really hard to shake these thoughts and have a realistic point of view.

           I read your post just while going through some uncharted level of post-quitting-of-medication-for-depression-using-ssri-like-lexapro-and-jovia. I ate 6 krispy kreme donuts and ate 2 pc KFC chicken and got a massage and spent out of the budget for the taxi to get home   all this in the coping grounds of feeling spiralling down because of mean things that people who are not me did. The dough kneading in my chest- have all of you been through that? There was a panic I am afraid to entertain. I like the see the pain from as much distance as possible. Hopefully, by doing this, I could still retain control of my body and not go berserk and kill or worse, hurt.

           I found this post truly inspirational. I am currently battling depression and have been for some time. Lately things have taken a turn for the worse and, in my opinion, there is only so much medication that one can take; only so much that medication can do. Thank you for sharing these feelings and emotions with us. It helped me to understand that there is hope and that I wont be this way for the rest of my life. It feels great to know that there are others out there who understand and who can offer support. Thank you!

           This has some really nice parts in it, I especially like: your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding and know that your mind is operating alone while your heart takes a rest.
           <br/>
           It has been a year since my marriage break up and I have felt depression, anxiety and anger more then I ever would want to, I fear I will not feel good again,
           <br/>
           I do yearn for the day I can breathe fully again with love flowing through me.
           <br/>
           Deep down I have the faith but the fear still rises.

           If you think depression is the same as flatness, Im not sure youve actually really had depression. There is nothing flat about it, nor is it about feeling sorry for yourself. Depression is complete and utter despair, and a sense of self-hatred that cannot be described with words. Its being in physical pain without actually knowing why. Its constant tiredness and an endless stream of guilt and shame. Its spending every waking moment wishing you could cease to exist.
          </p>
          <p>
           It sounds to me as if what you experienced was somewhere between mild and moderate depression, which, fair enough, is pretty common (not EVERYONE gets it, but about 1 in 4 will at some point in their lives). However, the flatness you experienced is what happens when you take antidepressants. A lot of people seem to think that they are these amazing pills that will make them feel happy again, but the only thing they do is stabilise you, and because you dont have any happy thoughts in you at this point, what you are left with when the depression lifts is, indeed, flatness. This makes most people complain, which I have never understood, because my goodness was it great to feel flat instead of suicidal! If the flatness doesnt come as a relief to you, then you probably didnt need the antidepressants to begin with.
          </p>
          <p>
           Once you feel flat, that means you have been stabilised by the meds. The next step is therapy, which is where you start rebuilding yourself as a person. Combine this with doing things you used to enjoy before you got sick, and spend time with the people you love, and you will start to feel better. And to me it sounds like thats what you did, from the description of those five attitudes, and that is good.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, for me there is no recovery. There is no happy ending. I am not 1 in 4. I have bipolar disorder, which is a permanent illness. Im on two different types of medication, and I see a therapist once a week, and all of this helps, but there is no miracle cure and I will always suffer these ups and downs (in my case, mostly downs). For me it is about finding a way to live with it, and to manage it to the best of my ability. There is a chemical imbalance that I have absolutely no control over. So while I am glad you found something that works for you, its not actually true that we can all get past it. Some of us cant. I hope that puts things in perspective for you.

           Lisa,  this is a GREAT article and I will print this off and read it when I am Flat which is more often than I like at this time.  But the more I get out of my head and into my Heart, the better I feel.  Thank you for writing about it, it not only helps me in my situation but helps me relate to my family better as well!  Love your stuff!!!

           This is great if it works for you, however, there are a lot of people who can try this all they want and wont get better. Reading this makes them feel the more guilty and being losers as they did something wrong and are now punished with depression. Depression is NOT your friend. It is a terrible experience and it kills people. If you overcome it, deem yourself lucky!
           <br/>
           I have tried mindfulness, meditation, yoga, nutrition, and so on. I have suffered from various grades of depression for all my life, it never went away until recently  when I started taking hormones that my body seems to lack somehow. Had I not find that out, I would be sitting here, reading this, and feel horrible about myself because I cant get it right. If you talk about compassion, please consider my story, which is the story of many others, too. Some will never find a way out of depression and the reasons for that are not always clear. Sometimes it is just bad luck to be born with a brain chemistry that is prone for depression. In such a case, you just have to try and live with it.

           One of the best articles I have read in a long time. I have been through an incredible past year full of challenges. I have experienced these solemn quiet tender moments and is spite of everyone telling me I should fix  the problem I have had an underlying sense that I should just embrace it. Taking that approach has actually scared the crap out if me since it raises the question have I seriously just slipped off the edge?  This article has restored faith in myself and I feel like I trust my instincts more. Thank you so much for writing such insightful thoughts and sharing them.

           I have never taken medications for depression. I try to defeat it on my own and with a little substance abuse. But every-time I try to fight it, my mind convinces myself that this is a part of me and that I will never truly eradicate it. I know the reason for my depression. I lack a creative mind, I feel like I cant enrich peoples lives with my company, just a quiet boring guy who hasnt got a thought to say, as a result anxiety explodes on me when I start thinking in this state of mind.
          </p>
          <p>
           But sometimes miracles happen, when I show I can be spontaneous, confident and relaxed i am happy. But these feelings are never truly real because the next day I am back in the sinking hole when I am reminded yet again that I am not spontaneous, confident and relaxed. I wish you could feel on top of the world and stay there with tools that help you feel that way. Most people have these tools, whether its your job/ career, appearance/fashion, gym/body, mind/personality. For me I am depressed because of I dont know how to be a social person and fit in, awkward is all I know.

           This is so inspiring! Thank you! This is truly a gift to read during a tough depression spot. I learned to belive that struggles and hardships have the great potential to be tremendous gifts should they be allowed in the psyche to be such. Anything stating otherwise is a depressed thought that has turned into an accepted belief! I say this as someone who has come to extreme lows where I literally at times could not see the point of living. Our brains have such immense power to believe and create such vastly opposing realities. I hope everyone who suffers through depression and or anxiety gets to see the incredible other side of it and the power of deep understanding that it brings.

           This is a really soothing and beautiful look at depression. Depression is something I have had many many times over my life and it comes and goes. Mindfulness has helped me a lot, but sometimes words like yours can lift my spirit into a more creative place and make some changes. Thank you.

           Flat would be a relief.  I have been on many meds for over thirty years and they mostly havent helped.  I am trying amino acids under a drs care but dont know yet if that will work.  Therapy and friends are a big help.  I feel terrible.  Cant work ,  over time more fatigue and less ability to function.  Cant stand noise or light.  Sometimes terrified, angry at the loss of time to accomplish things.  Have to be positive when I can.  The horrible parts are like a seizure which wont let go until it finally lets go.  No control over thoughts for days and days.  This is a devastating illness for many.  My family is full of it.  Cant have a real relationship with the sickest people.  The buck stops here.  I did not have children.  No one deserves this hell.  Positive thoughts help when the mood is not too deep.  Cats, nature, Earth are so much comfort.

           This speaks alot to me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am 23, and up till now I have lived life with an all or nothing policy and up till now have always got what I wanted. There was always a goal to strive for and I invariably got there. But now I have graduated and started a full time job, and life had become fairly bland. I lost motivation and lost any real goals to strive for. I became very negative and my girlfriend of 7 years was having a hard time being around me. After 6 months of this she left me and never looked back.
          </p>
          <p>
           So for a week I was in a state of shock and confusion. It felt like I had lost everything and had nothing. I had never really thought what life would be like without this person. I was close to rock bottom. But in this state, I was forced to change things. So I have started looking at the world differently, focusing on my own inner peace and trying to love life. I realised that I had so far spent my life focusing on my mind and my thoughts, but not on my inner peace and my heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           Depression is a catalyst to change, not necessarily a bad thing. I truly hate the attitude that many people have towards depression. I myself was guilty of this attitude towards my brother who has been suffering from it his entire life. Many people see it as a weakness, a negative, and they see the solution is just to man up and move forwards. But it is much deeper than that, it is a tough thing to go through but if the right steps are taken one can come out stronger and grow in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am mostly just rambling now  but for me, as painful as this place I am in right now is, it is forcing me to re-evaluate, discover spirituality and inner peace, and grow as a person. That is an opportunity I am grateful for, and I have to keep strong and thinl positively.
