As we learn more about ourselves, our new beliefs change how we behave. Research on economics students showed this in action: textbooks describing facts and theories about human behaviour can affect the people studying them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic models are often based on an imaginary character called the rational actor, who, with no messy and complex inner world, relentlessly pursues a set of desires ranked according to the costs and benefits. Rational actors help create simple models of economies and societies. According to &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory\"&gt;rational choice theory&lt;/a&gt;, some of the predictions governing these hypothetical worlds are common sense: people should prefer more to less, firms should only do things that make a profit and, if the price is right, you should be prepared to give up anything you own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tool used to help us understand our motivations and actions is &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\"&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt;, which examines how you make choices when their outcomes are affected by the choices of others. To determine which of a number of options to go for, you need a theory about what the other person will do (and your theory needs to encompass the other person's theory about what you will do, and so on). Rational actor theory says other players in the game all want the best outcome for themselves, and that they will assume the same about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most famous game in game theory is the &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma\"&gt;prisoner's dilemma&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;, in which you are one of a pair of criminals arrested and held in separate cells. The police make you this offer: you can inform on your partner, in which case you either get off scot free (if your partner keeps quiet), or you both get a few years in prison (if he informs on you too). Alternatively you can keep quiet, in which case you either get a few years (if your partner also keeps quiet), or you get a long sentence (if he informs on you, leading to him getting off scot free). Your partner, of course, faces exactly the same choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a rational actor, it's an easy decision. You should inform on your partner in crime because if he keeps quiet, you go free, and if he informs on you, both of you go to prison, but the sentence will be either the same length or shorter than if you keep quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, and thankfully, this isn't what happens if you ask real people to play the prisoner's dilemma. Around the world, in most societies, &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/327/5972/1480\"&gt;most people&lt;/a&gt; maintain the criminals' pact of silence. The exceptions who opt to act solely in their own interests are known in economics as \"&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem\"&gt;free riders&lt;/a&gt;\" &ndash; individuals who take benefits without paying costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self(ish)-selecting group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prisoner's dilemma is a theoretical tool, but there are plenty of parallel choices &ndash; and free riders &ndash; in the real world. People who are always late for appointments with others don't have to hurry or wait for others. Some use roads and hospitals without paying their taxes. There are lots of interesting reasons why most of us turn up on time and don't avoid paying taxes, even though these might be the selfish \"rational\" choices according to most economic models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, rational actor theory appears more useful for predicting the actions of certain groups of people. One group who have been found to free ride more than others in repeated studies is people who have studied economics. In a study &lt;a href=\"http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.7.2.159\"&gt;published in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, Robert Frank and colleagues from Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York State, tested this idea with a version of the prisoner's dilemma game. Economics students \"informed on\" other players 60% of the time, while those studying other subjects did so 39% of the time. Men have previously been found to be more self-interested in such tests, and more men study economics than women. However even after controlling for this sex difference, Frank found economics students were 17% more likely to take the selfish route when playing the prisoner's dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In good news for educators everywhere, the team found that the longer students had been at university, the higher their rates of cooperation. In other words, higher education (or simple growing up), seemed to make people more likely to put their faith in human co-operation. The economists again proved to be the exception. For them extra years of study did nothing to undermine their selfish rationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank's group then went on to carry out surveys on whether students would return money they had found or report being undercharged, both at the start and end of their courses. Economics students were more likely to see themselves and others as more self-interested following their studies than a control group studying astronomy. This was especially true among those studying under a tutor who taught game theory and focused on notions of survival imperatives militating against co-operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent work has questioned these findings, suggesting that selfish people are just &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/ei/cbg020/abstract\"&gt;more likely to study economics&lt;/a&gt;, and that Frank's surveys and games tell us &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2138290\"&gt;little about real-world moral behaviour&lt;/a&gt;. It is true that what individuals do in the highly artificial situation of being presented with the prisoner's dilemma doesn't necessarily tell us how they will behave in more complex real-world situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related work, &lt;a href=\"http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/\"&gt;Eric Schwitzgebel has shown&lt;/a&gt; that students and teachers of ethical philosophy don't seem to behave more ethically when their behaviour is assessed using a range of real-world variables. Perhaps, says Schwitzgebel, we shouldn't be surprised that economics students who have been taught about the prisoner's dilemma, act in line with what they've been taught when tested in a classroom. Again, this is a long way from showing any influence on real world behaviour, some argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons of what people do in tests and games are limited because of the additional complexities involved in real-world moral choices with real and important consequences. Yet I hesitate to dismiss the results of these experiments. We shouldn&rsquo;t leap to conclusions based on the few simple experiments that have been done, but if we tell students that it makes sense to see the world through the eyes of the selfish rational actor, my suspicion is that they are more likely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors influence our behaviour, of which formal education is just one. Economics and economic opinions are also prominent throughout the news media, for instance. But what the experiments above demonstrate, in one small way at least, is that what we are taught about human behaviour can alter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree?

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasas cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

Many of us do, including a US shopkeeper who just &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21949983\"&gt;scooped $338 million&lt;/a&gt; in the Powerball lottery &ndash; the fourth largest prize in the game's history. Before the last Powerball jackpot in the United States, tickets were being snapped up at a rate of around 130,000 a minute. But before you place all your hopes and dreams on another ticket, here&rsquo;s something you should know. All the evidence suggests a big payout won&rsquo;t make that much of a difference in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning the lottery isn't a ticket to true happiness, however enticing it might be to imagine never working again and being able to afford anything you want. One study &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/690806\"&gt;famously found&lt;/a&gt; that people who had big wins on the lottery ended up no happier than those who had bought tickets but didn't win. It seems that as long as you can afford to avoid the basic miseries of life, having loads of spare cash doesn't make you very much happier than having very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way of accounting for this is to assume that lottery winners get used to their new level of wealth, and simply adjust back to a baseline level of happiness &ndash; something called the &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill\"&gt;hedonic treadmill&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;. Another explanation is that our happiness depends on how we feel relative to our peers. If you win the lottery you may feel richer than your neighbours, and think that moving to a mansion in a new neighbourhood would make you happy, but then you look out of the window and realise that all your new friends live in &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; mansions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these phenomena undoubtedly play a role, but the deeper mystery is why we're so bad at knowing what will give us true satisfaction in the first place. You might think we should be able to predict this, even if it isn't straightforward. Lottery winners could take account of hedonic treadmill and social comparison effects when they spend their money. So, why don't they, in short, spend their winnings in ways that buy happiness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picking up points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that happiness isn't a quality like height, weight or income that can be easily measured and given a number (whatever psychologists try and pretend). Happiness is a complex, nebulous state that is fed by transient simple pleasures, as well as the more sustained rewards of activities that only make sense from a perspective of years or decades. So, perhaps it isn't surprising that we sometimes have trouble acting in a way that will bring us the most happiness. Imperfect memories and imaginations mean that our moment-to-moment choices don't always reflect our long-term interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It even seems like the very act of trying to measuring it can distract us from what might make us most happy. An &lt;a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/374702\"&gt;important study&lt;/a&gt; by Christopher Hsee of the Chicago School of Business and colleagues showed how this could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hsee&rsquo;s study was based around a simple choice: participants were offered the option of working at a 6-minute task for a gallon of vanilla ice cream reward, or a 7-minute task for a gallon of pistachio ice cream. Under normal conditions, less than 30% of people chose the 7-minute task, mainly because they liked pistachio ice cream more than vanilla. For happiness scholars, this isn't hard to interpret &ndash;those who preferred pistachio ice cream had enough motivation to choose the longer task. But the experiment had a vital extra comparison. Another group of participants were offered the same choice, but with an intervening points system: the choice was between working for 6 minutes to earn 60 points, or 7 minutes to earn 100 points. With 50-99 points, participants were told they could receive a gallon of vanilla ice cream. For 100 points they could receive a gallon of pistachio ice cream. Although the actions and the effects are the same, introducing the points system dramatically affected the choices people made. Now, the majority chose the longer task and earn the 100 points, which they could spend on the pistachio reward &ndash; even though the same proportion (about 70%) still said they preferred vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this, and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661305003244\"&gt;other experiments&lt;/a&gt; [5], Hsee concluded that participants are maximising their points at the expense of maximising their happiness. The points are just a medium &ndash; something that allows us to get the thing that will create enjoyment. But because the points are so easy to measure and compare &ndash; 100 is obviously much more than 60 &ndash; this overshadows our knowledge of what kind of ice cream we enjoy most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time you are buying a lottery ticket because of the amount it is paying out, or choosing wine by looking at the price, or comparing jobs by looking at the salaries, you might do well to remember to think hard about how much the bet, wine, or job will really promote your happiness, rather than simply relying on the numbers to do the comparison. Money doesn't buy you happiness, and part of the reason for that might be that money itself distracts us from what we really enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

Over the course of his playing career he&rsquo;s thought to have won and lost $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamblers and statisticians share a love of odds, though the stakes on the table couldn&rsquo;t be more different between the two. But us statisticians are allowed to fantasise a little, so here&rsquo;s a hypothetical challenge. Let&rsquo;s say you fancied a Maserati costing $100,000, but sadly you only had a dollar, what form of gambling will give you the best chance of getting the sports car? I&rsquo;ll even make it a little easier for you by giving you three choices &ndash; a punt on the lottery, a flutter on the horses or a spin on the roulette wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you think about this, you might be surprised to discover how far back our urge for gambling stretches. Devices that embody randomness have been used in leisure for at least 5,000 years. The ancient Egyptians, presumably when nothing good was on television, sat around and played board games in which moves were decided by throwing an astragalus, which is a bone in the heel that can land on one of four sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gambling became so popular that the Romans tried to restrict it to Saturdays. Even the Emperor Claudius played obsessively and wrote a book called &lt;em&gt;How to win at dice&lt;/em&gt;. People continued for centuries to make bets and quote odds: in Paris in 1588 you could get &lt;a href=\"http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=74849\"&gt;5 to 1 against the Spanish Armada sailing to invade England&lt;/a&gt;, although this was probably a ruse by the Spanish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculated risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is remarkable is that in all this time, right up until the Renaissance, &lt;a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Emergence_of_Probability.html?id=Z2g0F1V5DywC&amp;redir_esc=y\"&gt;nobody analysed gambles mathematically&lt;/a&gt;. This could be partly because people thought the outcomes were decided by some external force of fate, but it is now thought that the gap between theory and practice was too great, and therefore no-one had the idea of putting a number on chance - in other words calculate probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not until the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ualberta.ca/MATH/gauss/fcm/BscIdeas/probability/DeMere.htm\"&gt;Chevalier de Mere&lt;/a&gt;, it seems. The Chevalier was a very perceptive gambler in Paris in the 1650s, and he reckoned that odds were slightly in his favour of getting a six in four throws of a single dice, but that the odds were slightly against him of throwing two dice and getting a double 6 in 24 throws. By chance (or fate) he brought the problem to two of the smartest mathematicians at that or any other time, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal\"&gt;Blaise Pascal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat\"&gt;Pierre de Fermat&lt;/a&gt;. They confirmed that he had a 52% chance of &lt;a href=\"http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/abstracts/david_games.htm\"&gt;winning the first bet&lt;/a&gt;, and a 49% chance of winning the second, so the Chevalier had got it right from what must have been very extensive and expensive experience.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chevalier also presented the mathematicians with the &lsquo;problem of points&rsquo; &ndash; if a game has to stop before the end, in what proportions should the stake be divided up? A modern counterpart is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.duckworth-lewis.com/\"&gt;Duckworth-Lewis method&lt;/a&gt; in cricket, used for allocating runs scored by a team when a match is stopped by the weather &ndash; which in England is pretty much all the time. If you thought the game of cricket is difficult to understand, the Duckworth-Lewis method is almost totally incomprehensible to even the most ardent fan. No surprise, then, to hear that statisticians designed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Chevalier&rsquo;s time the scientific assessment of odds disappeared for a few centuries, as the 1700s became a golden age of betting on the basis of gut-feelings rather than calculations. It was the time of &lsquo;&lt;a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Age_of_Chance.html?id=SjTpHMTCXtQC&amp;redir_esc=y\"&gt;eccentric wagers&lt;/a&gt;&rsquo;, such as a large sum won by the Count de Buckeburg in 1735 for riding from London to York seated backwards on a horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also huge bets on cricket matches, and a predictable consequence was the match-fixing scandals that erupted in the early 1800s, with spectators at Lord&rsquo;s Cricket Ground (the so-called home of the game) bewildered at the sight of &lt;a href=\"http://www.hodder.co.uk/books/work.aspx?WorkID=43261\"&gt;two nobbled teams both desperately trying to lose&lt;/a&gt;. A reaction followed, with bookmakers being banned from Lord&rsquo;s in 1817, lotteries banned in 1826, and the Gaming Act of 1845 making gambling debts unenforceable by law. Cricket was turned into the archetypal gentlemen&rsquo;s game. Until recently, that is. Heavy gambling has again brought match-fixing to the fore; and more worrying is the ability to bet on every minor detail of the match, &lt;a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/aug/29/pakistan-cricket-betting-allegations\"&gt;known as spot-fixing&lt;/a&gt;, which has led to high-profile cases of players being bribed to mess up specific bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing the odds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So back to the Maserati, and which of the three gambling options would give you the best odds. If you were to buy a single lottery ticket, and if your choice of six numbers matches the five winning balls plus the bonus number (a seventh ball drawn), then &lt;a href=\"http://playlotto.org.uk/lottery/uklottery_odds.html\"&gt;this generally wins around &pound;100,000&lt;/a&gt; in the UK (which for arguments sake let&rsquo;s say is close enough to our dollar target &ndash; it will certainly cover the cost of the sports car). The probability of this happening is 1 in 2,330,636, which is about my chance of having a heart attack or stroke in the half-hour it takes for me to go to the shop for the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you were to go for an accumulator on the horses, that is, pick a race meeting with six races, and in each race choose a horse at medium odds of around 6 to 1 against? Then the accumulator, in which the winnings of each race are passed to the next horse, will give you 7&times;7&times;7&times;7&times;7&times;7 = $117,000 if they all win. Given a bookmakers margin of, say, 12% for each bet, the true odds may be around 1 in 230,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which leaves the roulette wheel. If you can find a casino to let you bet $1, place it on your lucky number between 1 and 36. When it wins, either leave the $36 there or move it to another number. When that comes up too, move the $1,296 you now have to another number, or leave it where it is &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to the odds, but somehow it seems that the chance increases when the money is moved.&nbsp; When that comes up you will have $46.656, so move it all to Red, and when that comes up you will have $93,312, almost enough for your Maserati. The chances of this happening, on a roulette wheel with a single zero, are 1/37&times;1/37&times;1/37&times;18/37 = 1 in 104,120.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So roulette easily gives the best chance of getting that shiny Maserati for a dollar.&nbsp; But given the odds involved, perhaps it&rsquo;s best to stick there and start saving instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-06-06T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Gambling: Understanding the odds in numbers","HeadlineShort":"Getting the odds on gambling","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Our resident statistician looks through the numbers to discover which form of betting gives you the best chance of winning a six-figure sum.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Our resident statistician looks through the numbers to discover which form of betting gives you the best chance of winning a six-figure sum.","SummaryShort":"What form of betting gives you the best chance of winning a six-figure sum?","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:45Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"426cff6e-7c10-4b5b-8390-6bac77cd3aff","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120606-getting-the-odds-on-gambling","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:45Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120606-getting-the-odds-on-gambling"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120606-getting-the-odds-on-gambling","_id":"559a55f10b808738c4e2ef4f"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;When Shing Tat Chung was a baby, his parents changed his name on the advice of a fortune teller. The soothsayer warned that the name they had given him at birth had &ldquo;too much fire&rdquo;, whatever that means. The new one, which also happens to be his current one, &ldquo;is supposed to be more balanced and carry a good fortune,&rdquo; Chung told me. &ldquo;I will also apparently make lots of money with this name,&rdquo; he says, laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s a relief because I recently gave him some of &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;money. More specifically, I put $200 into an experimental investment fund Chung launched in June. Mind you, this guy is not some stock-picking savant who finished Stanford Business School at the age of 15. Chung is a 25-year-old newly minted graduate in design from the Royal College of Art in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascinated by superstitions and their wider, yet often overlooked, ramifications for society, Chung decided to start &lt;a href=\"http://asuperstitiousfund.com/\"&gt;The Superstitious Fund Project&lt;/a&gt;. Some people trust Windsor-knotted stock traders and mutual fund managers to grow their money. Others use algorithms designed to respond to various market conditions so that &ndash; one hopes &ndash; they deliver earnings. Still others buy gold, plunk it in a vault, and pray that it will be worth more on some future date than it is today. How odd is it then, really, to calculate trade decisions by way of astrology and numerology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund works like this: stock trades are carried out by an Automated Trading System (colloquially, a &ldquo;robot&rdquo;), which is a computer program that buys, sells or holds stocks based on a set of specifications encoded into the program&rsquo;s governing algorithm. The code for Chung&rsquo;s experiment was written by Jim Hunt, who runs a firm called &lt;a href=\"http://www.trading-gurus.com/\"&gt;Trading Gurus&lt;/a&gt;, and together with Chung they named it &ldquo;Sid the Superstitious Robot&rdquo;. (They also decided to make the source code completely transparent and &lt;a href=\"http://community.trading-gurus.com/threads/204-Sid-the-Superstitious-Robot\"&gt;free to download&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many investment models, Sid is an automated speculator. But whereas other algorithms might take action based, for instance, on a stock&rsquo;s recent performance or the price of oil, the criterion for this program are lunar phases and the affection and disaffection people have for certain numbers. &ldquo;I wanted it to operate based on human characteristics,&rdquo; Chung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sid won&rsquo;t buy anything on the 13th of the month, and steers clear of buying or selling any stock if its value happens to have a 13 in it. As for lunar phases, Chung explains with a hint of pride that the algorithm finds a new moon to be &ldquo;good&rdquo;, whereas a full moon is very, very bad. &ldquo;The closer the moon is to being full, the more it effects us,&rdquo; Chung says. So as the full moon approaches, the robot &ndash; instead of starting to grow claws and thick brown hair &ndash; sells more, as if it is nervous about the moon&rsquo;s impact on multinational corporations and the decision-making capabilities of senior management. If you&rsquo;re wondering how this automated yet temperamental trader handles an eclipse, one word: sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And get this: the robot&rsquo;s beliefs evolve. People are constantly seeing correlations in the world and interpreting them as patterns that they can or should act upon. Sid also generates new, albeit irrational, beliefs and acts on them. Cautious not to leave any spiritual stone unturned, Chung went as far as seeking the advice of a fortune teller to help him determine the most prudent launch date. When her first suggestion conflicted with a prior engagement already on Chung&rsquo;s calendar, she used her powers and a sacred pendant to &ldquo;visualise&rdquo; another option: 1 June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all sounds rather ridiculous, until you discover that Sid and the Superstitious Fund illuminate some disquieting truths. On the one hand, magical thinking is, of course, everywhere: unlucky numbers; the dangers of Friday the 13th; boosted birth rates in the year of the dragon; holding one&rsquo;s breath when driving past a cemetery; black cats, rabbit&rsquo;s feet, horoscopes, crossed fingers, lucky underwear, and every palm reader, healer, mystic, shaman, soothsayer and woo-woo yoga instructor from New York to New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the last thing you want is the steward of your money making decisions based on slight vibrations in the cosmos. When it comes to matters financial, we&rsquo;re all business, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardly. A generation of behavioural economics research has demonstrated that standard predictions of how we treat and handle money have woefully misread &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. Rational we are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a tax incorporated into a price tag on supermarket shelves makes us more frugal, whereas an equivalent tax added at checkout is virtually ignored. We also spend the same money differently depending on whether it&rsquo;s labelled credit, rebate, or bonus, and our willingness to pay for stuff is heavily influenced by the payment method. One recent article listed &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/07/the-11-ways-that-consumers-are-hopeless-at-math/259479/\"&gt;eleven ways in which consumers behave irrationally&lt;/a&gt; when confronted with maths. There are probably more. When it comes to moo-la, the technical term for us is &ldquo;cuckoo&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic impact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inconsistencies born from biases and tricks of the mind are one thing; superstition is another. The idea of a &ldquo;Friday 13th effect&rdquo; came to prominence thanks to a &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1987.tb04373.x/abstract\"&gt;1987 study by Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;, two finance professors at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/tags/topic/University+of+Miami\"&gt;University of Miami&lt;/a&gt;, who found that you are more likely to lose in the stock market on that day, as opposed to a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Friday. Their findings have since been disputed by &lt;a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=234828&amp;http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=friday%2013th%20effect%201987%20%20robert%20kolb%20and%20ricardo%20rodriguez%2C&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CG0QFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpapers.ssrn.com%2Fsol3%25\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=recent%20evidence%20on%20friday%20the%20thirteenth%20effect%20in%20u.s.%20stock%20returns&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fjournals.cluteonline.com%2Findex.php%2FJBER%2Farticle%2Fview%2F2271&amp;ei=_jEWUN\"&gt;stock market&lt;/a&gt; studies, but Kolb and Rodriguez say the paper was published tongue-in-cheek. Their point was not that the day itself had an effect, it was to illustrate how superstition has an effect on our behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These beliefs have a massive, and largely negative, impact on the economy &ndash;boom times for fortune tellers notwithstanding. Chung has estimated that Friday the 13th costs the US alone hundreds of millions of dollars, due not only to all those elevators and buildings indicating the absence of a 13th floor, but also lost revenue due to shortened vacations and purchases bypassed because of that unlucky date. Realtors in Hong Kong have reported that apartments deemed haunted might sell for as little as 40% of what a comparable un-haunted apartment might bring in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the majority of stock traders in Shanghai are not bankers pursuing value based on market analysis, but everyday individuals who &ldquo;gamble on numerical superstitions, with little understanding of concepts from the financial arena.&rdquo; Not that those who have mastered said &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; have necessarily done great things for anyone of late. &ldquo;Given the failure of all these sophisticated mathematical models that have turned geniuses into morons over the years,&rdquo; says Marc Hochstein, executive editor of the financial services daily American Banker, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how a model [like Sid] that intentionally has no rhyme or reason performs.&rdquo;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, a finance professor in Copenhagen looked at 80 years worth of data from the New York Stock Exchange, S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones Composite Average, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and tried to determine whether the 362 solar and lunar eclipses that took place over that time period affected investment decisions and the economy. &ldquo;[T]he stock market is an ideal breeding ground for superstition,&rdquo; &lt;a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1428792\"&gt;wrote Gabriele Lepori&lt;/a&gt;, who found below-average returns during times of &ldquo;negative superstitious events&rdquo;, like eclipses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His and other researchers&rsquo; findings suggest that we resort more heavily to superstition when there is high uncertainty, the stakes are high, and when we perceive outcomes to be essentially beyond our control. The great irony, of course, is that superstitions are supposed to protect us from misfortune. Yet they do the opposite. They are expensive, and their cost is borne by believers and eye-rollers alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unproven experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chung, the whole thing was personal at first but it quickly snowballed. He comes from a family that subscribes to many superstitions. His mother never orders seven dishes at a restaurant (unlucky number) and has filled the house with lucky bamboo and statues of the Buddha holding gold (lucky vegetation, deity, and metal respectively). More recently, she decided at the last minute not to buy a house because the feng shui of the place was off; a decision made because of the direction the toilet faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After maintaining a blog about superstition for a while, Chung decided that a fund that actually trades on the FTSE100 would be an interesting way to explore the murky intersection of value, faith and the economy. &ldquo;Where money and risk are involved,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;superstition is there lurking in the background&rdquo; &ndash; at casinos, of course, but also on Wall Street. &ldquo;I wanted to poke fun at our superstitions,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but I also wanted to highlight our irrational nature in a way that is less critical and more about encouraging dialogue.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present he plans to let the fund run for a year, tracking its performance against various indices and other funds, both managed and automated. Should there be gains, he will send dividends to people like me who threw down for a stake in this otherworldly approach to playing the markets. (Yes, his mother is an investor, to the tune of &pound;100/$157) If the whole thing tanks, the money is gone. &lt;em&gt;Poof&lt;/em&gt;. But at least investors are aware of that risk ahead of time, not to mention reminded of it in every correspondence from Chung, which now includes the cautionary e-mail tag: &lt;em&gt;Please be aware, that this is an unproven, highly speculative, experiment and a project with the risk of total loss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, everyone and their cousin is reaching out to him to share titbits about their personal superstitions, and he is currently making the rounds to talk with future-of-money thinkers in London, audiences at Microsoft, CNBC, CNET, The Wall Street Journal, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has the whole experience made him want a career in finance? &ldquo;Definitely not,&rdquo; says Chung; he finds the prospect of losing other peoples&rsquo; money quite worrisome. After three weeks of trading the fund had dropped 12% from its starting value of &pound;5,000, while the NASDAQ100 and Hang Seng Index rose around 4% during this period. It has since rebounded a little; at the time of writing the fund is around -5% of its starting amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is losing 5% of value horrible? Depends whom you ask and what you compare it to. In the age of Libor, Lehman, Madoff, and sovereign debt write-offs, maybe it&rsquo;s not so bad. I guess I&rsquo;ll find out next spring, and BBC Future will follow up with Chung to find out how both he and the fund have fared over the course of this experiment. Besides, speculation is just that: not a sure bet. &ldquo;When you gamble,&rdquo; says Chung, &ldquo;you either win or lose.&rdquo; When you put it that way, maybe the more rewarding way to lose $200 would have been an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. Then again, I&rsquo;m a Cancer, and Cancers aren&rsquo;t prone to such rash behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Superstitious Fund: Too mystic to fail","HeadlineShort":"Trading on superstition","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Would you invest in a fund that trades on superstition?

And on-line auction sites like eBay cater for this, allowing us to share in the over-excitement of auction bidding in the privacy of our homes. Yet somehow, despite our better judgement, we end up paying more than we know we should have done on that piece of furniture, equipment or clothing. What's going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One estimate states that about half of eBay auctions &lt;a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13699\"&gt;result in higher sale prices&lt;/a&gt; than the \"buy it now\" price. This is a paradox. If the people going into the auction really wanted the item so badly, why didn't they get it for less by paying the \"buy it now\" price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has nothing to do with the way the eBay bidding system works. In fact, unlike most auctions, the eBay auction process is actually &lt;a href=\"http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/%7Emathijs/publications/machazine07.pdf\"&gt;perfectly designed to allow rational outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. By allowing you to set a private &ldquo;maximum bid&rdquo; in advance, eBay auctions are better for individual buyers than public auctions where everyone has to shout out their bid in public. No, the reason auctions &ndash; both on and offline &ndash; produce higher sale prices than any bidder originally imagined they would pay is because of one irreducibly irrational part of the bidding process: the bidders themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auctions push a number of our psychological buttons, and in fact the phenomenon of &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597804000925\"&gt;auction fever&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; is well documented. They are social occasions, with lots of other people around, and this tends to increase your physiological arousal, an effect called &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_facilitation\"&gt;social facilitation&lt;/a&gt;. As your adrenaline pumps, your heart beats faster, and your reactions quicken. This is ideal for something like sports, but makes cool rational decision making harder. The very rich often send delegates to auctions, and as well as avoiding the paparazzi I suspect this is also a strategy to combat the over-excitement induced by being physically present in the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, auctions are time pressured, and &ndash; by definition &ndash; you're bidding on something you value highly. These factors create excitement whether you are in the room or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persuasive powers&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another psychological bias that operates in auctions is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120717-why-we-love-to-hoard\"&gt;endowment effect&lt;/a&gt;, where we tend to over-value things we already possess. By encouraging us to connect the bid (our money) with the sale item, bidding on items lets us fantasise about owning them &ndash; stimulating a kind of endowment effect. This is why the auction catalogue (or the item picture and description on a website) is so important. This forms part of the psychological journey the seller wants you to go on to imagine owning this item in advance, so you'll place a higher value on it, and so pay more to make imagination reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persuasion plays a huge part here, and the best book you can read on the psychology of the subject is &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini\"&gt;Robert Cialdini's&lt;/a&gt; Influence. Cialdini is a Professor of Social Psychology at Arizona State University, and he lists six major ways you can make yourself persuasive. Auctions hit at least two of these six principles square on the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, auctions use the principle of scarcity, whereby we overvalue things that we think might run out. Auction items are scarce in that they are unique (only one person can have it), and scarce in time (after the bids are finished, you've lost your chance). Think how many shop sales successfully rely on scarcity heuristics such as \"Last day of sale!\", or \"Only 2 left in stock!\", and you'll get a feel for how powerful this persuasion principle can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other principle used by auctions is that of &ldquo;social proof&rdquo;. We all tend to take the lead from other people; if everybody does something, or says something, most of us join in before we think about what we really should do. Auctions put you in intimate contact with other people who are all providing social proof that the sale item is important and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final ingredient in the magic-spell cast by auctions was uncovered &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20305741\"&gt;by researchers from Princeton&lt;/a&gt;. Their experiments asked volunteers to play on-line auctions with different rules. Some of these auctions had rules that encouraged over-bidding (like typical open auctions, which most of us are familiar with from movies), and some had rules that encouraged rational behaviour (like the eBay structure). With enough guidance from the auction rules, the bidders didn't end up paying much more than they originally thought was reasonable - but only if they thought they were bidding against a computer programme. As soon as the volunteers thought they were bidding against other live humans they found it impossible to bid rationally, whatever the auction rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies that the competitive element of auctions is crucial to provoking our irrational buying behaviour. Once we're involved in an auction we're not just paying to own the sale item, we're paying to beat other people who are bidding and prevent them from having it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it seems Gore Vidal had human nature, and the psychology of auctions, about right when he said: \"It is not enough to succeed.

That&rsquo;s great PR for a continent used to bad press, but there is a problem. Mobile money has only really taken off in one country out of 55 on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\"&gt;M-Pesa in Kenya&lt;/a&gt;, the poster child of mobile money in Africa, there is a mistaken belief among some that it is the norm across Africa. The service allows people to use their phones like a bank account &ndash; depositing, withdrawing and transferring money with their handset. People can also pay utility bills and &ndash; less commonly &ndash; pay for goods in a limited number of shops.&nbsp; It currently has around 20 million subscribers &ndash; around half the population of the East African nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various reasons for this&ndash; a receptive regulatory environment, the dominant position of Safaricom, Kenya&rsquo;s biggest mobile operator and the owner of M-Pesa, as well as a clear demand for its &ldquo;send money&rdquo; function, due to high numbers of domestic migrants transferring funds back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in other countries, the quest to replicate Kenya&rsquo;s success remains a difficult and uphill struggle. Attempts to roll out M-Pesa in countries like Tanzania and South Africa have faced a range of obstacles and have failed to emulate Kenya&rsquo;s success. While in countries like Nigeria, Uganda and Ghana, other mobile money projects are beginning to pay off, but there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems mobile money&nbsp;as a stand-alone offering does not excite most consumers who operate in economies where cash is still king. In fact research suggests that even if consumers know their network&nbsp;has a mobile money proposition, very few find any use for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I believe that could change. In particular, I believe mobile-commerce (m-commerce) offers an opportunity to boost mobile money use and give economies across Africa a shot in the arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take an incident that happened to me in Ghana a few weeks ago. After dinner, I pulled out my debit card to pay only to be told by the waitress that it was a cash-only service. Yet, this was at one of the best restaurants in the country. For a continent supposed to be at the forefront of mobile money it was beyond belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, imagine if I were able to make that payment with my phone. With a simple tap I could have paid for the meal and been on my way. It is this kind of service &ndash; already offered in a limited way by M-Pesa - that I believe will allow mobile money to really take off. By allowing small and medium businesses to easily accept payments, it will create an environment where goods and services can be offered and bought via mobiles as easily as someone buying a book on Amazon or paying for a coffee in Starbucks with their debit card. In short, we need mobile payment systems that allow easy payments between companies and customers online and in the real world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M-commerce, powered by smart mobile payment systems, would radically change the way business is done.&nbsp; Most of sub-Saharan Africa remains a rurally driven agri-economy, with farmers and businessmen having to rely on their local market days to do business. Successful m-commerce would allow the farmers, businessmen and entrepreneurs of Africa to reach a wider range of possible buyers at a relatively low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would open the door for many online businesses to emerge, and the ease of purchase that will follow will spur consumption, create new jobs and help African companies to develop markets beyond their existing borders and the borders of the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would not only benefit rural dwellers but also their fellow countrymen who live in urban areas. From micro transactions such as purchasing a cinema ticket to those on a larger scale such as paying for white goods, m-commerce will enable people living in African cities to make the transactions and payments necessary for everyday living at the push of a button, without the need for cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent months a couple of forward thinking African start-ups have launched services looking to disrupt the way people currently pay for products. With banks and mobile networks spending huge sums to secure a piece of the mobile money action, these technology companies are already thinking of the future, building online shopping cart plug-ins that are accessible via mobiles and have the capability to process mobile payments. The key factor driving this innovation is payment -&nbsp; how to make it easier for people to pay for goods and services in markets, restaurants and cinemas as well as online without the need to resort to cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with mobile banking, Kenya is leading the way. For example, &lt;a href=\"http://www.kopokopo.com/\"&gt;KopoKopo&lt;/a&gt; operates a platform that builds on top of M-Pesa to allow small and medium businesses move to accept mobile money payments at the shop till. Others like Kenya&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://zegetech.com/home/mpayer/\"&gt;Mpayer&lt;/a&gt;, take the process one step further, allowing real world transactions as well as payments on the web and via web-enabled phones. It is not difficult to imagine the impact of such technology on small businesses, farmers, craftsmen, and food or beverage retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kenya isn&rsquo;t the only place where mobile money is trying to hit critical mass. In Nigeria, established firms likes the UK&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.monitise.com/\"&gt;Monitise&lt;/a&gt; are beginning to make inroads, while one of the recent success stories is a relatively new upstart, &lt;a href=\"https://www.mypaga.com/paga-web/start.paga\"&gt;Paga&lt;/a&gt;, backed by Silicon Valley money and well known investment funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core business for Paga is its mobile money transfer service; however those behind it realise the importance of using their platform to facilitate payment for goods and services, and are signing up merchants across Nigeria to use the platform to receive payments. As with the Kenyan start-ups, the suspicion is that the company will pivot to focus more on consumer-to- merchant payments as opposed to peer-to-peer transfers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel-backed Ghanaian technology firm Rancard Solutions and mobile operator Bharti Airtel also recently launched a mobile platform that allows their customers to buy and sell products via their phones. Furthermore, Airtel customers can also pay for purchases using their mobile wallet. Whether this will take off or not remains to be seen, but it is a welcome step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe these kinds of innovations are just the beginning. In the coming years, we will see all kinds of new services being built and even more piggy-backing on them to create new businesses and value in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Africa will truly deserve the title of the home of mobile money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"Making mobile money pay in Africa","HeadlineShort":"Making mobile money pay ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A Matter of Life and Tech features a range of voices from people involved in Africas tech future.

Is your ideal holiday adventure sports with a large group of mates and, or anywhere more sedate destination with a few good friends? Maybe your answers to these questions are clear &ndash; you'd love one option and hate another &ndash; or maybe you find yourself somewhere between the two extremes. Whatever your answers, the origin of your feelings may lie in how your brain responds to rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all exist somewhere on the spectrum between extroverts and introverts, and different circumstances can make us feel more one way or the other. Extraverts, a term popularised by psychologist Carl Jung at the beginning of the 20th Century, seem to dominate our world, either because they really are more common, or because they just make most of the noise. (The original spelling of &ldquo;extravert&rdquo; is now rarely used generally, but is still used in psychology.) This is so much the case that some have even written guides on &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/302696/\"&gt;how to care for introverts&lt;/a&gt;, and nurture their special talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fundamental question remains &ndash; what makes an extrovert? Why are we all different in this respect, and what do extraverts have in common that makes them like they are? Now, with brain scans that can record activity from deep within the brain, and with genetic profiling that reveals the code behind the constructions of the chemical signalling system used by the brain, we can put some answers to these decades-old questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, psychologist Hans Eysenck made the &lt;a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Biological_Basis_of_Personality.html?id=unee8oL0OgwC&amp;redir_esc=y\"&gt;influential proposal&lt;/a&gt; that extroverts were defined by having a chronically lower level of arousal. Arousal, in the physiological sense, is the extent to which our bodies and minds are alert and ready to respond to stimulation. This varies for us all throughout the day (for example, as I move from asleep to awake, usually via few cups of coffee) and in different circumstances (for example, cycling through the rush-hour keeps you on your toes, heightening arousal, whereas a particularly warm lecture theatre tends to lower your arousal). Eysenck's theory was that extroverts have just a slightly lower basic rate of arousal. The effect is that they need to work a little harder to get themselves up to the level others find normal and pleasant without doing anything. Hence the need for company, seeking out novel experiences and risks. Conversely, highly introverted individuals find themselves overstimulated by things others might find merely pleasantly exciting or engaging. Hence they seek out quiet conversations about important topics, solitary pursuits and predictable environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betting brains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, this theory has been refined, linking extroversion to the function of &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11301519\"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that plays an intimate role in the brain circuits which control reward, learning and responses to novelty. Could extroverts differ in how active their dopamine systems are? This would provide a neat explanation for the kinds of behaviours extroverts display, while connecting it to an aspect of brain function that we know quite a lot about for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers lead by Michael Cohen, now of the University of Amsterdam, were able to test these ideas in &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926641005002880\"&gt;a paper published in 2005&lt;/a&gt;. They asked participants to perform a gambling task while in the brain scanner. Before they went in the scanner each participant filled out a personality profile and contributed a mouth swab for genetic analysis. Analysis of the imaging data showed how the brain activity differed between extroverted volunteers and introverted ones. When the gambles they took paid off, the more extroverted group showed a stronger response in two crucial brain regions: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens. The amygdala is known for processing emotional stimuli, and the nucleus accumbens is a key part of the brain's reward circuitry and part of the dopamine system. The results confirm the theory &ndash; extroverts process surprising rewards differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cohen's group looked at the genetic profiles of the participants, they found another difference in reward-related brain activity. Those volunteers who had a gene known to increase the responsiveness of the dopamine system also showed increased activity when they won a gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here we see part of the puzzle of why we're all different in this way. Extrovert's brains respond more strongly when gambles pay off. Obviously they are going to enjoy adventure sports more, or social adventures like meeting new people more. Part of this difference is genetic, resulting from the way our genes shape and develop our brains. Other results confirm that dopamine function is key to this &ndash; so, for example, genes that control dopamine function &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11055-007-0058-8#page-1\"&gt;predict personality differences&lt;/a&gt; in how much people enjoy the unfamiliar and actively seek out novelty. Other results show how &lt;a href=\"http://www.frontiersin.org/Human_Neuroscience/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00288/abstract\"&gt;extroverts learn differently&lt;/a&gt;, in keeping with a heighted sensitivity to rewards due to their reactive dopamine systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our preferences are shaped by the way our brains respond to the world. Maybe this little bit of biological psychology can help us all, whether introverts or extroverts, by allowing us to appreciate how and why others might like different things from us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Neuroscience and the psychology of the everyday.

Nor is it a plane. The garish orange piece of plastic, small enough to hold in the palm of a hand, could pass for a missing limb of a toy tyrannosaurus. It may not look all that impressive, but it&rsquo;s notable for two reasons. One is that the monster arm has emerged from a 3D printer. The other is that it is, in fact, the first ever object made from thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This milestone was reached with little fanfare last month at the &lt;a href=\"http://stgomakerspace.com\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Santiago MakerSpace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a technology and design studio in the Chilean capital. The toy limb&rsquo;s shape was determined according to the wishes of its designer, as gleaned from a headset picking up his brainwaves. The man in question was George Laskowsky, Chief Technical Officer of &lt;a href=\"http://www.thinkerthing.com/\"&gt;Thinker Thing&lt;/a&gt;, the Chilean start-up developing the mind-controlled 3D printing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers and designers have been using 3D printers for more than two decades. More recently, prices have tumbled and desk-top devices are increasingly being pitched at consumers. The touted possibilities appear to be endless &ndash; from bones to buildings to burritos &ndash; making some observers predict revolutionary consequences like the eventual demise of the factory. Because 3D printers build objects layer by layer from materials such as plastic or metal dust, a key advantage is the comparative freedom they give designers. Yet the design software is not easy to master, especially if you are four-years-old and haven&rsquo;t yet learnt to hold a pencil properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;What is the point of these printers if my son cannot design his own toy?&rdquo; says Bryan Salt, CEO of Thinker Thing. &ldquo;I realised that while there were a lot of people talking about the hardware of the printer no-one really seemed to be talking about how to actually use it.&rdquo; In theory 3D printers could help unleash our inner creativity, freeing us from the constraints of traditional production methods. However, in practice those unwilling or unable to plough through the software instruction manual could be left downloading ready- made models designed by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s where Emotional Evolutionary Design (EED), the software that allows Thinker Thing to interpret its users&rsquo; thoughts, comes in. Its current role is to power the Monster Dreamer Project, which will allow users to design their own fantastical creatures using the power of thought. Chilean children will get the first opportunity to try it out during tour of schools in the country at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When those children sit in front of a computer running Monster Dreamer, they will be presented with a series of different body shapes in bubbles. These will mutate randomly, with built-in rules preventing them becoming too abstract. The children&rsquo;s reactions to the changes will be picked up by an &lt;a href=\"http://www.emotiv.com/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Emotiv EPOC headset&lt;/a&gt;, a $300 electroencephalography (EEG) device designed to pick up the electrical signals from brain cell interactions using fourteen sensors on the scalp. As different brain states such as excitement or boredom generate specific patterns of brain activity, the computer can identify the shapes associated with positive emotional responses. The favoured shapes will grow bigger on the screen, while the others shrink. The biggest shapes are combined to generate a body part, and the process is repeated for different body parts until the monster is complete. The final result should be a unique 3D model that is ready for printing as a solid object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second nature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design steered by emotional responses is based on the notion that most people are better at critiquing a design than they are at thinking of new ideas from scratch, especially if they have no training. &ldquo;One of the biggest bottlenecks right now with 3D printing is content,&rdquo; says Professor Hod Lipson, director of the &lt;a href=\"http://creativemachines.cornell.edu/\"&gt;Creative Machines Lab&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York State. &ldquo;We have iPods with no music. We have machines that can make almost anything but we do not have a lot of things to make with them.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipson&rsquo;s lab is also working on evolving 3D models with the mind. &lt;a href=\"http://endlessforms.com/\"&gt;EndlessForms&lt;/a&gt;, created by two of Lipson&rsquo;s students, is a website that mimics nature&rsquo;s way of creating new designs in small steps. At the start of the process users are presented with 15 three-dimensional shapes. Clicking on any two will combine them and produce fifteen new shapes based on those choices. If you wanted to make a cat, you might click on one shape with the semblance of a muzzle and another with two pointed, ear-like triangles on top. The computer would then offer up a series of new shapes that more closely resemble the cat you have in mind, and so on until the model reaches the desired shape.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the time spent clicking, the researchers came to the same conclusion as the Thinker Thing team &ndash; feeding users&rsquo; thoughts back into the computer directly could make the process quicker. So, last year, the team used Emotiv EPOC headsets to read users&rsquo; brain signals and therefore determine their reactions. But then they ran into a problem. &ldquo;At some point we were thinking it was only measuring the level of sweat because we were actually trying so hard to feel happy or sad about something,&rdquo; says Lipson. No matter how many times they tried, the scientists could not find a reliable signal to use from the headset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with cheap consumer headsets is that the signals they pick up are already weak. The skull dampens the small electrical impulses from the brain&rsquo;s neurons and electrical signals from nearby facial muscles can overpower them. Some sceptics argue that consumer EEG devices are not really measuring thoughts at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others argue that for applications that only require basic feedback such as yes or no, the readings they generate can be accurate enough. &ldquo;If they are simple positive or negative emotions, it can be 100%,&rdquo; says Dr Olga Sourina, head of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eosourina/CHCILab/index.html\"&gt;Cognitive Human Computer Interaction Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. &ldquo;When you need to differ between more emotions like anger or fear, they can be less accurate.&rdquo; Sourina has spent nine years working on improving the ability of computers to recognise emotions from EEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some of the limitations of consumer EEG technology in mind, Lipson and colleagues decided to monitor thoughts via the eyeballs. Eye tracking can identify the shapes that get the most attention, and this could be used to shape design processes. The snag is that without an EEG headset it is not possible to tell whether someone is looking at a shape because they find it strange or beautiful. Even so, the team&rsquo;s research so far suggests that at the end of the process participants still feel they have managed to reach the desired design. There&rsquo;s some way to go, but in the future a combination of brain scanning and eye tracking may be preferred to the trusty old mouse when it comes to 3D object design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dream maker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If and when that day comes, it still won&rsquo;t be a case of closing your eyes, imagining a unicorn and hearing the printer take off. But recent work by two teams of neuroscientists suggests the idea of translating whole images from the mind to the design screen may not be as improbable as it sounds. &ldquo;In principle, it is not farfetched at all,&rdquo; says Professor Jack Gallant, from the University of California, Berkeley. &ldquo;We have already published many papers where we reconstruct photographs or movies from what people have seen.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Gallant&rsquo;s team used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to show how computers &lt;a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0960982211009377/1-s2.0-S0960982211009377-main.pdf?_tid=31af21f8-d357-11e2-b72e-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1371038402_ec24ef5f425036a951f7730e0190d837\"&gt;can be trained to read the minds&lt;/a&gt; of those watching moving images. They built up a database of the activity in a key visual centre of the brain as three fellow researchers watched a compilation of Hollywood film trailer clips. Next the subjects watched a new set of clips. Based on the brain activity this generated, and the database created from the first phase of the experiment, the computer was asked to select segments of 5,000 hours of randomly selected YouTube clips that best matched the second sequence of clips. &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR0qJ17Rsvc\"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt;, although blurry, were recognisable as copies of the originals, and demonstrated for the first time the ability to decode moving images from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related advance came in April this year when Japanese scientists led by Yukiyasu Kamitani, of the ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, revealed they had made significant steps towards &lt;a href=\"http://neurosurgery.washington.edu/Lectures/science.1234330.full.pdf\"&gt;automated dream decoding&lt;/a&gt;. Three people had their brains scanned in a MRI machine while they slept. They were awoken when EEG signals indicated they had reached an early phase of sleep associated with dreaming. The researchers then asked them to describe their dreams, with the process being repeated until more than 200 reports had been collected for each person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamitani&rsquo;s group then chose 20 categories of objects and scenes based on the words that occurred most frequently in the descriptions. They selected photos representing each category, and scanned their volunteers&rsquo; brains while they looked at them. Comparing the scans taken while participants were awake with those while they were dreaming allowed the accurate prediction of dream content 60-70% of the time, depending on the individuals, the brain areas involved and different objects and scenes involved. It may not yet be a fully formed &ldquo;dream decoder&rdquo;, but it does show that direct decoding mental images is a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scanners may be better at reading the brain than cheap EEG headsets, but that does not make them a practical or affordable solution for 3D printing. &ldquo;As a giant three million dollar magnet, it is not something you would just wear around,&rdquo; says Gallant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if these issues can be overcome, there are other obstacles. Seeing an object and imagining one may not produce the same brain signals. On top of this individuals vary widely in their abilities to dream up designs from scratch, and in the level of detail they can imagine. &ldquo;I have been doing 3D modelling since it began back in the 80s,&rdquo; said Salt. &ldquo;And the process is that you build something and then you move it about. You do not sit down and think, I have something absolutely finite in my head and that is what I am going to build.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenges suggest the idea of 3D printing guided by fully formed mental images of users is, if not entirely farfetched, a long way from becoming reality. Combining sensors that can pick up human emotions with design software that can interpret and respond to them looks like the nearest we&rsquo;re going to get to creating 3D objects from thought in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Thinker Thing&rsquo;s twig-like orange monster arm, as unsophisticated as it may appear at first glance, may one day be celebrated as marking the start of a new and exciting way of moulding the things around us. &ldquo;It is really something magical to be there, sat without moving a limb, and watching the designs evolve into something that you were thinking about,&rdquo; says Laskowsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-06-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"3D printing powered by thought","HeadlineShort":"3D printing your thoughts","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Imagine if you could print objects just by thinking about them.

In 2005 Jennifer Pluznick hypothesised that a gene known to play a role in a common form of kidney disease did so by acting as a master switch for other genes. Lab tests supported her theory; however, when she looked at which genes it acted on, she did a double take. Among them were several that encode scent receptors, the chemical sensors that allow us to identify smells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first Pluznick didn't believe her eyes. As far as we know, kidneys filter waste from our blood and get rid of it in urine. They are not sensory organs. \"I wasn't sure if we could believe the data,\" she says. \"It seemed really spurious.\" Thinking there had to be a mistake, Pluznick, then a researcher at Yale School of Medicine, in New Haven, Connecticut, carried out another experiment. She soaked a slice of kidney in a fluid that would make scent-system proteins glow fluorescently under a microscope. When she peered down the eyepiece, it was lit up like a Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluznick has spent the last eight years trying to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sense of smell is one of our most powerful connections to the physical world. Our noses contain hundreds of different scent receptors that allow us to distinguish between odours. When you smell a rose or a pot of beef stew, the brain is responding to scent molecules that have wafted into your nose and locked on to these receptors. Only certain molecules fit specific receptors, and when they slot together, like a key in a lock, this triggers changes in cells. In the case of scent receptors, specialised neurons send messages to the brain so we know what we have sniffed. The discovery, in 1991, of around 1,000 genes involved in generating scent receptors was rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2004/\"&gt;Nobel prize in Medicine&lt;/a&gt; over a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last ten years, however, reports have trickled in from bemused biologists that these receptors, as well as similar ones usually found on taste buds, crop up all over our bodies. In 2003, bitter taste receptors were found in sperm. The same year Pluznick came across scent receptors in the kidney, biologists at the University of California, San Diego identified sour receptors in the spine. A smattering of papers over the following few years reported sweet taste receptors in the bladder and the gut, bitter taste receptors in the sinuses, airways, pancreas and brain, and scent receptors in muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are they doing there? As these findings became public, researchers poured over genomic data and reported that low levels of these receptors occurred in almost every tissue in the body. One possible explanation was that they are evolutionary leftovers whose previous functions were lost in time. However, Pluznick and others have unearthed evidence that, in some tissues at least, they are anything but passive. Their findings suggest that our bodies are &ldquo;smelling&rdquo; and &ldquo;tasting&rdquo; things deep inside of us, and that these abilities are crucial to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System sensor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kidney is made up of miles of minuscule tubes, twisted into an exquisite lacework. Threaded through these is a system of blood vessels, and in places where these and the kidney's tubes are especially intertwined, water, nutrients and other molecules seep through the walls and pass between the two. What the blood doesn't need is passed off to the urine forming in the tubes, and what it does have a use for &ndash; keeping blood pressure stable, for instance &ndash; goes back. If this process stops working the body will soon shut down, poisoned by its own exhaust fumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peering more closely down the microscope at that slice of kidney, Pluznick saw the fluorescent glow was emanating from the macula densa, a group of cells that play a central role in this chemical back-and-forth, sampling the forming urine as it goes by and sending out alerts to adjust the blood filtration rate. &ldquo;The macula densa is the only cell type in the kidney that you would think of as being a chemical sensor,&rdquo; says Pluznick. &ldquo;It made a hell of a lot of sense, and it made me think it was real.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to figure out what would happen if these receptors were absent in this region of the kidney, using engineered mice that lacked one of scent receptors Pluznick identified in the kidney, called Olfr78. Tests revealed these mice had kidney problems involving their blood filtration rate and the production of renin, a hormone which stimulates the constriction of blood vessels to increase blood pressure. Both of these are controlled by the macula densa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluznick now began to devote herself full-time to the puzzle. Identifying which chemical \"keys\" &ndash; known as ligands &ndash; were binding to the Olfr78 receptor \"locks\" would help her understand the bigger picture of what the receptor was responding to. In doing so, her work took her from one weird and wonderful discovery in biology to another: &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120412-the-beasts-inside-you\"&gt;the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies contain trillions of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. Those in the human gut fulfil various important functions, such as breaking down certain foods into energy and useful nutrients, suppressing harmful microbes, preventing allergies and assisting the immune system in a number of other ways. The evidence that the balance of different microbes we have inside us is important to our health has been growing rapidly in recent years. People with irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and depression have been shown to have differences in gut bacteria when compared to healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/02/05/1215927110\"&gt;study published by Pluznick last March&lt;/a&gt; showed, Olfr78's ligands are short-chain fatty acids, molecules produced when gut bacteria digest components of plant-based foods. Other scientists have documented their roles in human health, such as stimulating immune-cell production, reducing heart-disease risk, stabilising blood glucose levels and protecting the colon lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluznick acknowledges the picture is a complex and incomplete one, further work indicates another receptor that also binds to short-chain fatty acids has a greater and opposite effect. However, she believes the work shows the scent receptors she accidentally discovered are a previously unknown means for bacteria to tell the kidney to make blood pressure changes that allow them to best carry out their health-related functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitter truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Pluznick was unravelling this mystery, other researchers were investigating taste and scent receptors elsewhere in the body. Yehuda Ben-Shahar, now a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, found cells in the human airway equipped with bitter receptors. These cells are covered in microscopic hair-like protrusions called cilia which flap when dangerous chemicals are breathed in, helping to flush them out of the body. Bitter receptors in the tongue are thought to have evolved to help us identify poisons, and Ben-Shahar wondered whether those in the airway might be protecting us in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his collaborators found that when receptors in these cells were exposed to certain noxious molecules, it triggered a cascade of events that culminated in the flapping of the cilia. This made Ben-Shahar think that what we know as bitter receptors might better be called danger receptors. &ldquo;We call them bitter but that's only because when we taste with them that's what we get,\" he says. \"Probably what's uniting them is things that we try not to take in.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, work by Noam Cohen, an ear, nose and throat doctor at University of Pennsylvania Medical School, suggests an intriguing role for bitter receptors recently discovered in the sinuses. He found one particular type can intercept the chemical signals that bacteria send to each other when they are coming together to form biofilms, a manoeuvre that greatly strengthens their defences against immune-system attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bitter receptors in the sinuses pick up these signals, they set in motion an attack against the bacteria, causing cells to release toxic gas and cilia to flap. If people have a genetic variant that produces a different form of this bitter receptor, however, they are deaf to this back-channel bacterial chatter, and are more prone to severe sinus infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who regularly get serious sinus infections often opt for surgery. However Cohen, who, along with Ben-Shahar, presented some of his findings at April's Association for Chemoreception Sciences meeting in Huntington Beach, California, speculates this may not help those with bitter receptors that can't pick up these signals. Since the bitter receptors in an individual's sinuses are the same as those on their tongue, Cohen suggests a test that tells clinicians which version of the receptor patients have on their tongues could help guide treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different tastes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluznick's research has revealed the existence of Olfr 78 receptors beyond the kidney, in blood vessels in the skin, heart and muscle. Scent receptors may be even more widely distributed, Firestein thinks, in blood vessels right across in the body. There's no better place for a chemical sensor, he points out, as the blood is the highway by which substances move around the body. This could explain why the receptors show up in so many places, since tissues are shot through with blood vessels bringing in nutrients and ferrying away waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's emerging is a picture of these receptors as a kind of general-purpose chemical sensor. Consider a doorbell: the button next to your front door is hooked up to a little machine that can be programmed to play almost any kind of tune, a clock chime, a fire alarm, or \"Wild Thing\" if so desired. The button doesn't care what is being played &ndash; it just relays to the machine the message that a finger is pushing on it. These receptors are like that button, and the finger is anything with the right chemical structure to bind to it. The output might be the perception of a scent, the alerting of the immune system or the beating of cilia. &ldquo;If you say olfactory receptors in the kidney, it sounds kind of nuts,\" says Pluznick. \"But if you say that chemical sensors are in the kidney, I think it makes a heck of a lot of sense.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just happened to come across the receptors in the nose and the mouth first. It's intriguing to think this role may be pre-dated by their chemical-sensing capacities in other organs. Some see it as unlikely given that they are present in much higher numbers in the nose and mouth, but others disagree. &ldquo;We call these taste receptors, but maybe they aren't taste receptors,\" says Ben-Shahar. \"Maybe they were doing a lot of things before. Recycling is a very strong theme in evolution.&rdquo; Cohen puts it more strongly. \"I'm willing to bet that these bitter receptors were on the airway before they migrated to the tongue, that this is where they really belong.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluznick is now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in Baltimore, Maryland. It has been a long time since she studied kidney disease. Her lab is focused on understanding how these receptors work, and how they contribute to kidney function. Pluznick acknowledges there is still a lot to discover about the broader functions of what we still currently call scent and taste receptors, but she and others have made a start. She chuckles as she remembers how she complained to her academic supervisor about the \"bad\" data from her kidney gene experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He kind of looked at me for a second, and he was like 'Scent receptors in the kidney. That would be cool though, right?' At that point we both still thought it was one of those crazy, stupid ideas you laugh about later.\" Crazy perhaps, but very far from stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORRRECTION (12/07)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; We stated that the engineered mice used in experiements had come from Stuart Firestein's lab, but this was not the case.

But it&rsquo;s also important to go back to basics, says &lt;a href=\"http://wi.mit.edu/people/faculty/lindquist\"&gt;Susan Lindquist&lt;/a&gt;, molecular biologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her idea is to use the power of evolution to unlock secrets that could keep our minds healthy as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we reduce the rate of people dying from heart disease and cancer, we face another threat, and that&rsquo;s neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer&rsquo;s and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, that are caused by fundamental defects in protein folding. Studies have been dominated by the need to unlock the complexity of the brain, but you can flip this around and look at what are the fundamental basics of biology that might also feature in much simpler organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evolved from simpler individual cells that still inhabit the Earth, and they still face the same complex problem &ndash; how do they take their DNA code and create and fold it up into a complete, working protein. So we could test the simpler things first using these simple cells, and fuel our knowledge not just for possible drugs but also understand the biology in such a way as to help improve our lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is how to go from these simple cells to making it work in a human being. That&rsquo;s going to take a lot of interaction between many different groups &ndash; like biologists, chemists, geneticists &ndash; not to mention new imaging methods for viewing the brain. But the way technologies are converging makes Lindquist excited and optimistic; she says we might now be in a position to begin to find answers that will help tackle these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Simpler solutions for unlocking secrets of ageing minds","HeadlineShort":"Unlocking secrets of ageing minds","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Could tiny organisms help us understand the extraordinary complexity of the human brain, and how to keep our brains healthy as we get older?

It's called the autonomous sensory meridian response, and until 2010 it didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) from British journalist &lt;a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/maria-spends-20-minutes-folding-towels-why-millions-are-mesmerised-by-asmr-videos-7956866.html\"&gt;Rhodri Marsden&lt;/a&gt;. He had become mesmerised by intentionally boring videos he found on YouTube, things like people explaining how to &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHiKxytbCWk\"&gt;fold towels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AK-eOx4RWc\"&gt;running hair dryers&lt;/a&gt; or role-playing &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xxh3tzbhwZE\"&gt;interactions with dentists&lt;/a&gt;. Millions of people were watching the videos, reportedly for the pleasurable sensations they generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodri asked my opinion as a psychologist. Could this be a real thing? \"Sure,\" I said. If people say they feel it, it has to be real &ndash; in some form or another. The question is what kind of real is it? Are all these people experiencing the same thing? Is it learnt, or something we are born with? How common is it? Those are the kind of questions we'd ask as psychologists. But perhaps the most interesting thing about the ASMR is what happened to it before psychologists put their minds to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presumably the feeling has existed for all of human history. Each person discovered the experience, treasured it or ignored it, and kept the feeling to themselves. That there wasn't a name for it until 2010 suggests that most people who had this feeling hadn't talked about it. It's amazing that it got this far without getting a name. In scientific terms, it didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, of course, along came the 21st Century and, like they say, even if you're one in a million there's thousands of you on the internet. Now there's websites, &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/\"&gt;discussion forums&lt;/a&gt;, even a &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response\"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. And a name. In fact, many names &ndash; &ldquo;Attention Induced Euphoria&rdquo;, &ldquo;braingasm&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the unnamed feeling&rdquo; are all competing labels that haven't caught on in the same way as ASMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth becomes fact &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to something curious about the way we create knowledge, illustrated by a wonderful story about the &lt;a href=\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Metic..30R.540M\"&gt;scientific history of meteorites&lt;/a&gt;. Rocks falling from the sky were considered myths in Europe for centuries, even though stories of their fiery trails across the sky, and actual rocks, were widely, if irregularly reported. The problem was that the kind of people who saw meteorites and subsequently collected them tended to be the kind of people who worked outdoors &ndash; that is, farmers and other country folk. You can imagine the scholarly minds of the Renaissance didn't weigh too heavily on their testimonies. Then in 1794 a meteorite shower fell on the town of Siena in Italy. Not only was Siena a town, it was a town with a university. The testimony of the townsfolk, including well-to-do church ministers and tourists, was impossible to deny and the reports written up in scholarly publications. Siena played a crucial part in the process of myth becoming fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where early science required authorities and written evidence to turn myth into fact, ASRM shows that something more democratic can achieve the same result. Discussion among ordinary people on the internet provided validation that the unnamed feeling was a shared one. Suddenly many individuals who might have thought of themselves as unusual were able to recognise that they were a single group, with a common experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a blind spot in psychology for individual differences. ASMR has some similarities with synaesthesia (the merging of the senses where colours can have tastes, for example, or sounds produce visual effects). Both are extremes of normal sensation, which exist for some individuals but not others. For many years synaesthesia was a scientific backwater, a condition viewed as unproductive to research, perhaps just the product of people's imagination rather than a real sensory phenomenon. This changed when techniques were developed that precisely measured the effects of synaesthesia, demonstrating that it was far more than people&rsquo;s imagination. Now it has its own research community, with &lt;a href=\"http://www.synesthesia.info/\"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt; and papers in &lt;a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2001/00000008/00000012/1244\"&gt;scientific journals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps ASMR will go the same way. Some people are certainly pushing for &lt;a href=\"http://www.asmr-research.org/\"&gt;research into it&lt;/a&gt;. As far as I know there are no systematic scientific studies on ASMR. Since I was quoted in that &lt;a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/maria-spends-20-minutes-folding-towels-why-millions-are-mesmerised-by-asmr-videos-7956866.html\"&gt;newspaper article&lt;/a&gt;, I've been contacted regularly by people interested in the condition and wanting to know about research into it. When people hear that their unnamed feeling has a name they are drawn to find out more, they want to know the reality of the feeling, and to connect with others who have it. Something common to all of us wants to validate our inner experience by having it recognised by other people, and in particular by the authority of science. I can't help &ndash; almost all I know about ASMR is in this column you are reading now. For now all we have is a name, but that's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more discussion about ASMR, visit the &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/\"&gt;Reddit discussion page&lt;/a&gt;.

Like most good questions, this one works on many levels. We have answers on some levels, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We like music because it makes us feel good. Why does it make us feel good? In 2001, neuroscientists Anne Blood and Robert Zatorre at McGill University in Montreal &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/20/11818.long\"&gt;provided an answer&lt;/a&gt;. Using magnetic resonance imaging they showed that people listening to pleasurable music had activated brain regions called the limbic and paralimbic areas, which are connected to euphoric reward responses, like those we experience from sex, good food and addictive drugs. Those rewards come from a gush of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. As DJ Lee Haslam told us, music is the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why? It&rsquo;s easy enough to understand why sex and food are rewarded with a dopamine rush: this makes us want more, and so contributes to our survival and propagation. (Some drugs subvert that survival instinct by stimulating dopamine release on false pretences.) But why would a sequence of sounds with no obvious survival value do the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is no one knows. However, we now have many clues to why music provokes intense emotions. The current favourite theory among scientists who study the cognition of music &ndash; how we process it mentally &ndash; dates back to 1956, when the philosopher and composer &lt;a href=\"http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3643659.html\"&gt;Leonard Meyer suggested&lt;/a&gt; that emotion in music is all about what we expect, and whether or not we get it. Meyer drew on earlier psychological theories of emotion, which proposed that it arises when we&rsquo;re unable to satisfy some desire. That, as you might imagine, creates frustration or anger &ndash; but if we then find what we&rsquo;re looking for, be it love or a cigarette, the payoff is all the sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, Meyer argued, is what music does too. It sets up sonic patterns and regularities that tempt us to make unconscious predictions about what&rsquo;s coming next. If we&rsquo;re right, the brain gives itself a little reward &ndash; as we&rsquo;d now see it, a surge of dopamine. The constant dance between expectation and outcome thus enlivens the brain with a pleasurable play of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should we care, though, whether our musical expectations are right or not? It&rsquo;s not as if our life depended on them. Ah, says musicologist &lt;a href=\"http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/%7Emas03dm/papers/huron06-review.pdf\"&gt;David Huron&lt;/a&gt; of Ohio State University, but perhaps once it did. Making predictions about our environment &ndash; interpreting what we see and hear, say, on the basis of only partial information &ndash; could once have been essential to our survival, and indeed still often is, for example when crossing the road. And involving the emotions in these anticipations could have been a smart idea. On the African savannah, our ancestors did not have the luxury of mulling over whether that screech was made by a harmless monkey or a predatory lion. By bypassing the &ldquo;logical brain&rdquo; and taking a shortcut to the primitive limbic circuits that control our emotions, the mental processing of sound could prompt a rush of adrenalin &ndash; a gut reaction &ndash; that prepares us to get out of there anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that music has this direct line to the emotions: who hasn&rsquo;t been embarrassed by the tears that well up as the strings swell in a sentimental film, even while the logical brain protests that this is just cynical manipulation? We can&rsquo;t turn off this anticipatory instinct, nor its link to the emotions &ndash; even when we know that there&rsquo;s nothing life-threatening in a Mozart sonata. &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s tendency to overreact provides a golden opportunity for musicians&rdquo;, says Huron. &ldquo;Composers can fashion passages that manage to provoke remarkably strong emotions using the most innocuous stimuli imaginable.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound check&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that musical emotion arises from little violations and manipulations of our expectations seems the most promising candidate theory, but it is very hard to test. One reason for this is that music simply offers so much opportunity for creating and violating expectations that it&rsquo;s not clear what we should measure and compare. We expect rising melodies to continue to rise &ndash; but perhaps not indefinitely, as they never do. We expect pleasing harmonies rather than &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130129-how-are-we-wired-for-sound\"&gt;jarring dissonance&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; but what sounds pleasing today may have seemed dissonant two hundred years ago. We expect rhythms to be regular, but are surprised if the jumpy syncopation of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll suddenly switches to four-square oompah time. Expectation is a complicated, ever-changing interplay of how the piece we&rsquo;re hearing has gone so far, how it compares with similar pieces and styles, and how it compares with all we&rsquo;ve ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, one corollary of Meyer&rsquo;s theory is that emotion in music will be primarily culturally specific. In order to have any expectations about where the music will go in the first place, you need to know the rules &ndash; to appreciate what is normal. This varies from one culture to another. Western Europeans think simple rhythms like waltz time are &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, but Eastern Europeans dance happily to metres that sound extraordinarily complicated to others. All of us develop a strong, subconscious sense of which notes sound &ldquo;right&rdquo;, whether in sequence in a melody, or sounding together in harmonies. But because different cultures use different scales and tunings &ndash; the scales of India and Indonesia, for example, don&rsquo;t respect the tunings of a piano &ndash; there is nothing universal about these expectations. A jolly piece of Indonesian music may be interpreted as &ldquo;sad&rdquo; by Westerners simply because it sounds close to being in the traditionally &ldquo;sad&rdquo; minor scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This picture also implies that music isn&rsquo;t just about good vibrations &ndash; it can provoke other feelings too, such as anxiety, boredom and even anger. Composers and performers walk a delicate tightrope, needing to tweak expectations to just the right degree. Not enough, and the music is dully predictable, as nursery tunes seem to adults. Too much, and we can&rsquo;t develop any expectations at all &ndash; which is why many people struggle with modernist atonal music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this can rationalise a great deal about why we feel emotions from particular musical phrases and performances. Meyer&rsquo;s ideas have received further support very recently from a &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6129/216.abstract\"&gt;brain-scanning study&lt;/a&gt; by Zatorre and colleagues, which showed that the rewards stimulated by music heard for the first time are particularly dependent on communication between &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; and &ldquo;logic&rdquo; circuits in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&rsquo;s not the whole story. Our emotional response to music may be conditioned by so many other factors too &ndash; if we are hearing it alone or in a crowd, for example, or if we associate a particular piece with a past experience, good or bad (dubbed the &ldquo;Darling they&rsquo;re playing our tune&rdquo; theory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underneath all these ideas is the fact that we&rsquo;re not even sure what kind of emotion we&rsquo;re talking about. We can recognise sad music without feeling sad. And even if we do feel sad, it&rsquo;s not like the sadness of bereavement &ndash; it can be enjoyable even if it provokes tears. Some music, like some of Bach&rsquo;s, can create intense emotion even though we can&rsquo;t quite put into words what the emotion is. So we&rsquo;ll surely never understand why music stimulates emotions at least until we have a better picture of what our emotional world is really like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-04-19T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Will we ever understand why music makes us feel good?","HeadlineShort":"Why does music make us feel good?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"No one knows why music has such a potent effect on our emotions.

Or are you doing so as a result of forces beyond your control?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thousands of years of philosophy, theology, argument and meditation on the riddle of free will, I'm not about to solve it for you in this column (sorry). But what I can do is tell you about some thought-provoking experiments by psychologists, which suggest that, regardless of whether we have free will or not, whether we believe we do can have a profound impact on how we behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is simple: we all make choices, but could those choices be made otherwise? From a religious perspective it might seem as if a divine being knows all, including knowing in advance what you will choose (so your choices could not be otherwise). Or we can take a physics-based perspective. Everything in the universe has physical causes, and as you are part of the universe, your choices must be caused (so your choices could not be otherwise). In either case, our experience of choosing collides with our faith in a world which makes sense because things have causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment how you would research whether a belief in free will affects our behaviour. There's no point comparing the behaviour of people with different fixed philosophical perspectives. You might find that determinists, who believe free will is an illusion and that we are all cogs in a godless universe, behave worse than those who believe we are free to make choices. But you wouldn't know whether this was simply because people who like to cheat and lie become determinists (the \"Yes, I lied, but I couldn't help it\" excuse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we really need is a way of changing people&rsquo;s beliefs about free will, so that we can track the effects of doing so on their behaviour. Fortunately, in recent years researchers have developed a standard method of doing this. It involves asking subjects to read sections from Francis Crick's book The Astonishing Hypothesis. Crick was one of the co-discoverers of DNA&rsquo;s double-helix structure, for which he was awarded the Nobel prize. Later in his career he left molecular biology and devoted himself to neuroscience. The hypothesis in question is his belief that our mental life is entirely generated by the physical stuff of the brain. One passage states that neuroscience has killed the idea of free will, an idea that most rational people, including most scientists, now believe is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have used this section of the book, or sentences taken from it or inspired by it, to induce feelings of determinism in experimental subjects. A typical study asks people to read and think about a series of sentences such as \"Science has demonstrated that free will is an illusion&rdquo;, or \"Like everything else in the universe, all human actions follow from prior events and ultimately can be understood in terms of the movement of molecules&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects on study participants are generally compared with those of other people asked to read sentences that assert the existence of free will, such as \"I have feelings of regret when I make bad decisions because I know that ultimately I am responsible for my actions\", or texts on topics unrelated to free will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the results are striking. One study reported that participants who had their belief in free will diminished were more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.csom.umn.edu/assets/91974.pdf\"&gt;to cheat in a maths test&lt;/a&gt;. In another, US psychologists reported that people who read Crick&rsquo;s thoughts on free will said they were &lt;a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/35/2/260.short\"&gt;less likely to help others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad taste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up to this study used an ingenious method to test this via aggression to strangers. Participants were told a cover story about helping the experimenter prepare food for a taste test to be taken by a stranger. They were given the results of a supposed food preference questionnaire which indicated that the stranger liked most foods but hated hot food. Participants were also given a jar of hot sauce. The critical measure was how much of the sauce they put into the taste-test food. Putting in less sauce, when they knew that the taster didn't like hot food, meant they scored more highly for what psychologists call \"prosociality\", or what everyone else calls being nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've guessed it: Participants who had been reading about how they didn't have any free will chose to give more hot sauce to the poor fictional taster &ndash; twice as much, in fact, as those who read sentences supporting the idea of freedom of choice and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/5/613.short\"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; carried out at the University of Padova, Italy, researchers recorded the brain activity of participants who had been told to press a button whenever they wanted. This showed that people whose belief in free will had taken a battering thanks to reading Crick's views showed a weaker signal in areas of the brain involved in preparing to move. In another study by the same team, volunteers carried out a series of on-screen tasks designed to test their reaction times, self control and judgement. Those told free will didn't exist were slower, and more likely to go for &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001171\"&gt;easier and more automatic courses of action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a young research area. We still need to check that &lt;a href=\"http://rolfzwaan.blogspot.nl/2013/03/the-value-of-believing-in-free-will.html\"&gt;individual results hold up&lt;/a&gt;, but taken all together these studies show that our belief in free will isn't just a philosophical abstraction. We are less likely to behave ethically and kindly if our belief in free will is diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puts an extra burden of responsibility on philosophers, scientists, pundits and journalists who use evidence from psychology or neuroscience experiments to argue that free will is an illusion. We need to be careful about what stories we tell, given what we know about the likely consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the evidence shows that most people have a sense of their individual freedom and responsibility that is &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23833053?dopt=Abstract\"&gt;resistant to being overturned by neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. Those sentences from Crick's book claim that most scientists believe free will to be an illusion. My guess is that most scientists would want to define what exactly is meant by free will, and to examine the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_Room_%28book%29\"&gt;various versions of free will on offer&lt;/a&gt;, before they agree whether it is an illusion or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the last few thousands of years have taught us anything, the debate about free will may rumble on and on. But whether the outcome is inevitable or not, these results show that how we think about the way we think could have a profound effect on us, and on others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Neuroscience and the psychology of the everyday.

But does giving reasons always make things clearer, or could it sometimes distract us from our true feelings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One answer came from a study led by &lt;a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/19/3/331.abstract\"&gt;psychology professor Timothy Wilson&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Virginia, which asked university students to report their feelings, either with or without being asked to provide reasons. What they found revealed just how difficult it can be to reliably discern our feelings when justifying our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to evaluate five posters of the kind that students might put up in their bedrooms. Two of the posters were of art &ndash; one was Monet's water lilies, the other Van Gogh's irises. The other three posters were a cartoon of animals in a balloon and two posters of photographs of cats with funny captions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the students had to evaluate the posters, but half the participants were asked to provide reasons for liking or disliking them. (The other half were asked why they chose their degree subject as a control condition.) After they had provided their evaluations the participants were allowed to choose a poster to take home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happened? The control group rated the art posters positively (an average score of around 7 out of 9) and they felt pretty neutral about the humorous posters (an average score of around 4 out of 9). When given a choice of one poster to take home, 95% of them chose one of the art posters. No surprises there, the experimenters had already established that in general most students preferred the art posters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the group of students who had to give reasons for their feelings acted differently. This &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; group liked the art posters less (averaging about 6 out of 9) and the humorous posters more (about 5 to 6 out of 9). Most of them still chose an art poster to take home, but it was a far lower proportion &ndash; 64% &ndash; than the control group. That means people in this group were about seven times more likely to take a humorous poster home compared with the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&rsquo;s the twist. Some time after the tests, at the end of the semester, the researchers rang each of the participants and asked them questions about the poster they'd chosen: Had they put it up in their room? Did they still have it? How did they feel about it? How much would they be willing to sell it for? The &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; group were less likely to have put their poster up, less likely to have kept it up, less satisfied with it on average and were willing to part with it for a smaller average amount than the control group. Over time their reasons and feelings had shifted back in line with those of the control group &ndash; they didn't like the humorous posters they had taken home, and so were less happy about their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivial pursuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of this effect, according to the researchers, is that when prompted to give reasons the participants focused on things that were easy to verbalise; they focused on the bright colours, or funny content of the humorous posters. It's less easy to say exactly what's pleasing about the more complex art classics. This was out of step with their feelings, so in the heat of the moment participants adjusted their feelings (a process I've written about before, called &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130312-why-we-act-against-our-beliefs\"&gt;cognitive dissonance&lt;/a&gt;). After having the posters on their wall, the participants realised that they really did prefer the art posters all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story isn&rsquo;t that intuition is better than reason. We all know that in some situations our feelings are misleading and it is better to think about what we're doing. But this study shows the reverse &ndash; in some situations introspection can interfere with using our feelings as a reliable guide to what we should do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this has consequences in adulthood, where the notion of expertise can mean struggling to discern when introspection is the best strategy. The researchers who carried out this study suggest that the distorting effect of reason-giving is most likely to occur in situations where people aren't experts &ndash; most of the students who took part in the study didn't have a lot of experience of thinking or talking about art. When experts are asked to give reasons for their feelings, research has found that their feelings aren&rsquo;t &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103189900292\"&gt;distorted in the same way&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; their intuitions and explicit reasoning are in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also see the consequences of this regularly in your line of work. Everybody knows that the average business meeting will spend the most time discussing &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality\"&gt;trivial things&lt;/a&gt;, an effect driven by the ease with which each member of the meeting can chip in about something as inconsequential as what colour to paint the bike sheds. When we're discussing complex issues, it isn't so easy to make a contribution. The danger, of course, is that in a world which relies on justification and measurement of everything, those things that are most easily justified and measured will get priority over those things which are, in fact, most justified and important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-06-05T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why we dont always know the true causes of our actions","HeadlineShort":"Why your gut feeling may be wrong","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We can justify our decisions by how we feel, or so we believe.

And if you find yourself acting out of line with your beliefs, change them. This sounds like motivational advice from one of the more cynical self-help books, or perhaps a Groucho Marx line (&ldquo;Those are my principles, and if you don't like them... well, I have others&hellip;&rdquo;), but in fact it is a caricature of one of the most famous theories in social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Festinger's Dissonance Theory is an account of how our beliefs rub up against each other, an attempt at a sort of ecology of mind. Dissonance Theory offers an explanation of topics as diverse as why oil company executives might not believe in climate change, why army units have brutal initiation ceremonies, and why famous books might actually be boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic study on dissonance theory was published by Festinger and James Carlsmith in 1959. You can find a copy thanks to the &lt;a href=\"http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm\"&gt;Classics in the History of Psychology archive&lt;/a&gt;. I really recommend reading the full thing. Not only is it short, but it is full of enjoyable asides. Back in the day psychology research was a lot more fun to write up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festinger and Carlsmith were interested in testing what happened when people acted out of line with their beliefs. To do this, they made their participants spend an hour doing two excruciatingly boring tasks. The first task was filling a tray with spools, emptying it, then filling it again (and so on). The second was turning 48 small pegs a quarter-turn clockwise; and then once that was finished, going back to the beginning and doing another quarter-turn for each peg (and so on). Only after this tedium, and at the point which the participants believed the experiment was over, did the real study get going. The experimenter said that they needed someone to fill in at the last minute and explain the tasks to the next subject. Would they mind? And also, could they make the points that \"It was very enjoyable&rdquo;, &ldquo;I had a lot of fun&rdquo;, &ldquo;I enjoyed myself&rdquo;, &ldquo;It was very interesting&rdquo;, &ldquo;It was intriguing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;It was exciting\"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; was none of these things. But, being good people, with some pleading if necessary, they all agreed to explain the experiment to the next participant and make these points. The next participant was, of course, a confederate of the experimenter. We're not told much about her, except that she was an undergraduate specifically hired for the role. The fact that all 71 participants in the experiment were male, and, that one of the 71 had to be excluded from the final analysis because he demanded her phone number so he could explain things further, suggests that Festinger and Carlsmith weren't above ensuring that there were some extra motivational factors in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their trouble, the participants were paid $1, $20, or nothing. After explaining the task the original participants answered some questions about how they really felt about the experiment. At the time, many psychologists would have predicted that the group paid the most would be affected the most &ndash; if our feelings are shaped by rewards, the people paid $20 should be the ones who said they enjoyed it the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, people paid $20 tended to feel the same about the experiment as the people paid nothing. But something strange happened with the people paid $1. These participants were more likely to say they really did find the experiment enjoyable. They judged the experiment as more important scientifically, and had the highest desire to participate in future similar experiments. Which is weird, since nobody should really want to spend another hour doing mundane, repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festinger's Dissonance theory explains the result. The &ldquo;Dissonance&rdquo; is between the actions of the participants and their beliefs about themselves. Here they are, nice guys, lying to an innocent woman. Admittedly there are lots of other social forces at work &ndash; obligation, authority, even attraction. Festinger's interpretation is that these things may play a role in how the participants act, but they can't be explicitly relied upon as reasons for acting. So there is a tension between their belief that they are a nice person and the knowledge of how they acted. This is where the cash payment comes in. People paid $20 have an easy rationalisation to hand. \"Sure, I lied\", they can say to themselves, \"but I did it for $20\". The men who got paid the smaller amount, $1, can't do this. Giving the money as a reason would make them look cheap, as well as mean. Instead, the story goes, they adjust their beliefs to be in line with how they acted. \"Sure, the experiment was kind of interesting, just like I told that girl\", \"It was fun, I wouldn't mind being in her position\" and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is cognitive dissonance at work. Normally it should be a totally healthy process &ndash; after all, who could object to people being motivated to reduce contradictions in their beliefs (philosophers even make a profession of out this), but in circumstances where some of our actions or our beliefs exist for reasons which are too complex, too shameful, or too nebulous to articulate, it can lead to us changing perfectly valid beliefs, such as how boring and pointless a task was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of cognitive dissonance will tell you that this is why people forced to defend a particular position &ndash; say because it is their job &ndash; are likely to end up believing it. It can also suggest a reason for why military services, high school sports teams and college societies have bizarre and punishing initiation rituals. If you've been through the ritual, dissonance theory predicts, you're much more likely to believe the group is a valuable one to be a part of (the initiation hurt, and you're not a fool, so it must have been worth it right?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I think dissonance theory explains why some really long books have such good reputations, despite the fact that they may be as repetitive and pointless as Festinger's peg task. Get to the end of a three-volume, several thousand page, conceptual novel and you're faced with a choice: either you wasted your time and money, and you feel a bit of a fool; or the novel is brilliant and you are an insightful consumer of literature. Dissonance theory pushes you towards the latter interpretation, and so swells the crowd of people praising a novel that would be panned if it was 150 pages long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing your beliefs to be in line with how you acted may not be the most principled approach. But it is certainly easier than changing how you acted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-03-12T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why people act out of line with their beliefs","HeadlineShort":"Why we act against our beliefs","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Ever been forced to defend a particular position and ended up believing it?

The only mystery is not one of a connection to the spirit world, but of why we can make movements and yet not realise that we're making them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon is called the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_effect\"&gt;ideomotor effect&lt;/a&gt; and you can witness it yourself if you hang a small weight like a button or a ring from a string (ideally more than a foot long). Hold the end of the string with your arm out in front of you, so the weight hangs down freely. Try to hold your arm completely still. The weight will start to swing clockwise or anticlockwise in small circles. Do not start this motion yourself. Instead, just ask yourself a question &ndash; any question &ndash; and say that the weight will swing clockwise to answer \"Yes\" and anticlockwise for \"No\". Hold this thought in mind, and soon, even though you are trying not to make any motion, the weight will start to swing in answer to your question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic? Only the ordinary everyday magic of consciousness. There's no supernatural force at work, just tiny movements you are making without realising. The string allows these movements to be exaggerated, the inertia of the weight allows them to be conserved and built on until they form a regular swinging motion. The effect is known as Chevreul's Pendulum, after the 19th Century French scientist who investigated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is happening with Chevreul's Pendulum is that you are witnessing a movement (of the weight) without \"owning\" that movement as being caused by you. The same basic phenomenon underlies dowsing &ndash; where small movements of the hands cause the dowsing wand to swing wildly &ndash; or the Ouija board, where multiple people hold a cup and it seems to move of its own accord to answer questions by spelling out letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect also underlies the sad case of \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.skepdic.com/facilcom.html\"&gt;facilitated communication&lt;/a&gt;\", a fad whereby carers believed they could help severely disabled children communicate by guiding their fingers around a keyboard. Research showed that the carers &ndash; completely innocently &ndash; were typing the messages themselves, rather than interpreting movements from their charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about the phenomenon is what it says about the mind. That we can make movements that we don't realise we're making suggests that we shouldn't be so confident in our other judgements about what movements we think are ours. Sure enough, in the right circumstances, you can get people to believe they have caused things that actually come from a completely independent source (something which shouldn't surprise anyone who has reflected on the madness of people who claim that it only started raining because they forget an umbrella).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read what this means for the nature of our minds in &lt;a href=\"http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/conscwil.htm\"&gt;The Illusion of Conscious Will&lt;/a&gt; by psychologist Daniel Wegner, who sadly &lt;a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/07/11/daniel-wegner-harvard-social-psychologist-unraveled-mysteries-thought-and-memory/g1So09GTjK40ikR0Tyyi4H/singlepage.html\"&gt;died last month&lt;/a&gt;. Wegner argued that our normal sense of owning an action is an illusion, or &ndash; if you will &ndash; a construction. The mental processes which directly control our movements are not connected to the same processes which figure out what caused what, he claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is not that of a mental command-and-control structure like a disciplined army; whereby a general issues orders to the troops, they carry out the order and the general gets back a report saying \"Sir! We did it. The right hand is moving into action!\". The situation is more akin to an organised collective, claims Wegner: the general can issue orders, and watch what happens, but he's never sure exactly what caused what. Instead, just like with other people, our consciousness (the general in this metaphor) has to apply some principles to figure out when a movement is one we've made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these principles is that cause has to be consistent with effect. If you think \"I'll move my hand\" and your hand moves, you're likely to automatically get the feeling that the movement was one you made. The principle is broken when the thought is different from the effect, such as with Chevreul's Pendulum. If you think \"I'm not moving my hand\", you are less inclined to connect any small movements you make with such large visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This maybe explains why kids can shout \"It wasn't me!\" after breaking something in plain sight. They thought to themselves \"I'll just give this a little push\", and when it falls off the table and breaks it doesn't feel like something they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-07-30T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How the ouija board really moves","HeadlineShort":"How the ouija board really moves","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"The mystery isnt a connection to the spirit world, but why we can make movements and yet not realise that we're making them.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"The mystery isnt a connection to the spirit world, but why we can make movements and yet not realise that we're making them.","SummaryShort":"Clue: its you... but how does it happen?","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:15Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"5addc37b-85f4-4f0e-8fd5-18209123aa0d","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130729-what-makes-the-ouija-board-move","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:15:15Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130729-what-makes-the-ouija-board-move"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130729-what-makes-the-ouija-board-move","_id":"559a56180b808738c4e2f431"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;One of the least charming but most persistent aspects of human nature is our capacity to hate people who are different. Racism, sexism, ageism, it seems like all the major social categories come with their own &ldquo;-ism&rdquo;, each fuelled by regrettable prejudice and bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tendency for groupness appears to be so strong there seems little more for psychology to teach us. It's not as if we need it proven that favouring our group over others is a common part of how people think &ndash; history provides all the examples we need. But one psychologist, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_tajfel\"&gt;Henri Tajfel&lt;/a&gt;, taught us something important. He showed exactly how little encouragement we need to treat people in a biased way because of the group they are in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any phenomenon like this in the real world comes entangled with a bunch of other, complicating phenomenon. When we see prejudice in the everyday world it is hard to separate out psychological biases from the effects of history, culture and even pragmatism (sometimes people from other groups really are out to get you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a social psychologist, Tajfel was interested in the essential conditions of group prejudice. He wanted to know what it took to turn the average fair-minded human into their prejudiced cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wanted to create a microscope for looking at how we think when we&rsquo;re part of a group, even when that group has none of the history, culture or practical importance that groups normally do. To look at this, he devised what has become known as the &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_group_paradigm\"&gt;minimal group paradigm&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimal group paradigm works like this: participants in the experiment are divided into groups on some arbitrary basis. Maybe eye-colour, maybe what kind of paintings they like, or even by tossing a coin. It doesn't matter what the basis for group membership is, as long as everyone gets a group and knows what it is. After being told they are in a group, participants are divided up so that they are alone when they make a series of choices about how rewards will be shared among other people in the groups. From this point on, group membership is entirely abstract. Nobody else can be seen, and other group members are referred to by an anonymous number. Participants make choices such as \"Member Number 74 (group A) to get 10 points and Member 44 (group B) to get 8 points\", versus \"Member Number 74 (group A) to get 2 points and Member 44 (group B) to get 6 points\", where the numbers are points which translate into real money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won't be surprised to learn that &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420010202/full\"&gt;participants show favouritism&lt;/a&gt; towards their own group when dividing the money. People in group A were more likely to choose the first option I gave above, rather than the second. What is more surprising is that people show some of this group favouritism even when it ends up costing them points &ndash; so people in group B sometimes choose the second option, or options like it, even though it provides fewer points than the first option. People tend to opt for the maximum total reward (as you'd expect from the fair-minded citizen), but they also show a tendency to maximise the difference between the groups (what you'd expect from the prejudiced cousin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect may be small, but this is a situation where the groups have been plucked out of the air by the experimenters. Every participant knows which group he or she is in, but they also know that they weren't in this group before they started the experiment, that their assignment was arbitrary or completely random, and that the groups aren't going to exist in any meaningful way after the experiment. They also know that their choices won't directly affect them (they are explicitly told that they won't be given any choices to make about themselves). Even so, this situation is enough to evoke favouritism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it seems we'll take the most minimal of signs as a cue to treat people differently according to which group they are in. Tajfel's work suggests that in-group bias is as fundamental to thinking as the act of categorisations itself. If we want to contribute to a fairer world we need to be perpetually on guard to avoid letting this instinct run away with itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

The British artist creates mechanical animals and animal machines - like &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0sbXNdNEfQ\"&gt;Pony&lt;/a&gt;, a robotic ostrich with an arm for a neck and a poised hand for a head &ndash; that creak into life in a way that can seem unsettling, as if they have a strange, if awkward, life of their own. His latest creations are able to respond to the environment, and it makes me ponder the essence of intelligence &ndash; in some ways revealing what makes us, us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met Tim on a cold Friday afternoon to talk about his work, and while talking about the cogs and gears he uses to make his artwork move, he made a remark that made me stop in my tracks. The funny thing is, he said, all of the technology existed to make machines like this in the sixteenth century - the thing that stopped them wasn't the technical know-how, it was because they lacked the right model of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What model of the mind do you need to create a device like Tim's &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0sbXNdNEfQ\"&gt;Jetsam&lt;/a&gt;, a large wire mesh Kiwi-like creature that forages around its cage for pieces of a nest to build. The intelligence in this creation isn't in the precision of the craftwork (although it is precise), or in the faithfulness to the kind of movements seen in nature (although it is faithful). The intelligence is in how it responds to the placing of the sticks. It isn't programmed in advance, it identifies where each piece is and where it needs to go&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives Jetsam the hallmark of intelligence &ndash; flexibility. If the environment changes, say when the sticks are re-scattered at random, it can still adapt and find the materials to build its nest. Rather than a brain giving instructions such as \"Do this\", feedback allows instructions such as \"If this, do that; if that, do the other\". Crucially, feedback allows a machine to follow a purpose &ndash; if the goal changes, the machine can adapt. &lt;br /&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; It&rsquo;s this quality that the sixteenth century clockwork models lacked, and one that we as humans almost take for granted. We grasp and process information about the world in many forms, including sights, smells or sounds. We may give these information sources different names, but in some sense, these are essentially the same stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics\"&gt;Cybernetics&lt;/a&gt; is the name given to the study of feedback, and systems that use feedback, in all their forms. The term comes from the Greek word for \"to steer\", and inspiration for some of the early work on cybernetics sprang from automatic guiding systems developed during World War II for guns or radar antennae. Around the middle of the twentieth century cybernetics became an intellectual movement across many different disciplines. It created a common language that allowed engineers to talk with psychologists, or ecologists to talk to mathematicians, about living organisms from the viewpoint of information control systems. &lt;br /&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; A key message of cybernetics is that you can't control something unless you have feedback &ndash; and that means measurement of the outcomes. You can&rsquo;t hit a moving target unless you get feedback on changes to its movement, just as you can&rsquo;t tell if a drug is a cure unless you get feedback on how many more people recover when they are given it. The flip side of this dictum is the promise that with feedback, you can control anything. The human brain seems to be the arch embodiment of this cybernetic principle. With the right feedback, individuals have been known to control things as unlikely as their own &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22744827?dopt=Abstract\"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, or learn to &lt;a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Dilate-or-Shrink-Your-Pupils-on-Command\"&gt;shrink and expand their pupils at will&lt;/a&gt;. It even seems possible to control the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7222/full/nature07418.html\"&gt;firing of individual brain cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But enhanced feedback methods can accelerate learning about more mundane behaviours. For example, if you are learning to take basketball shots, augmented feedback in the form of \"You were 3 inches off to the left\" can help you &lt;a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00336297.1994.10484129\"&gt;learn faster&lt;/a&gt; and reach a higher skill level quicker. Perhaps the most powerful example of an augmented feedback loop is the development of writing, which allowed us to take language and experiences, and make them permanent, solidifying it against the ravages of time, space and memory.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to feedback we can become more than simple programs with simple reflexes, and develop more complex responses to the environment. Feedback allows animals like us to follow a purpose. Tim Lewis's mechanical bird might seem simple, but in terms of intelligence it has more in common with us than with nearly all other machines that humans have built. Engines or clocks might be incredibly sophisticated, but until they are able to gather their own data about the environment they remain trapped in fixed patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feedback loops, on the other hand, beginning with the senses but extending out across time and many individuals, allow us to self-construct, letting us travel to places we don't have the instructions for beforehand, and letting us build on the history of our actions. In this way humanity pulls itself up by its own bootstraps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-02-26T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why your brain loves to get feedback","HeadlineShort":"Why your brain loves feedback","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A meeting with an artist gets Tom Stafford thinking about the essence of intelligence.

Racism, sexism, ageism, it seems like all the major social categories come with their own &ldquo;-ism&rdquo;, each fuelled by regrettable prejudice and bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tendency for groupness appears to be so strong there seems little more for psychology to teach us. It's not as if we need it proven that favouring our group over others is a common part of how people think &ndash; history provides all the examples we need. But one psychologist, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_tajfel\"&gt;Henri Tajfel&lt;/a&gt;, taught us something important. He showed exactly how little encouragement we need to treat people in a biased way because of the group they are in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any phenomenon like this in the real world comes entangled with a bunch of other, complicating phenomenon. When we see prejudice in the everyday world it is hard to separate out psychological biases from the effects of history, culture and even pragmatism (sometimes people from other groups really are out to get you).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a social psychologist, Tajfel was interested in the essential conditions of group prejudice. He wanted to know what it took to turn the average fair-minded human into their prejudiced cousin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wanted to create a microscope for looking at how we think when we&rsquo;re part of a group, even when that group has none of the history, culture or practical importance that groups normally do. To look at this, he devised what has become known as the &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_group_paradigm\"&gt;minimal group paradigm&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minimal group paradigm works like this: participants in the experiment are divided into groups on some arbitrary basis. Maybe eye-colour, maybe what kind of paintings they like, or even by tossing a coin. It doesn't matter what the basis for group membership is, as long as everyone gets a group and knows what it is. After being told they are in a group, participants are divided up so that they are alone when they make a series of choices about how rewards will be shared among other people in the groups. From this point on, group membership is entirely abstract. Nobody else can be seen, and other group members are referred to by an anonymous number. Participants make choices such as \"Member Number 74 (group A) to get 10 points and Member 44 (group B) to get 8 points\", versus \"Member Number 74 (group A) to get 2 points and Member 44 (group B) to get 6 points\", where the numbers are points which translate into real money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won't be surprised to learn that &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420010202/full\"&gt;participants show favouritism&lt;/a&gt; towards their own group when dividing the money. People in group A were more likely to choose the first option I gave above, rather than the second. What is more surprising is that people show some of this group favouritism even when it ends up costing them points &ndash; so people in group B sometimes choose the second option, or options like it, even though it provides fewer points than the first option. People tend to opt for the maximum total reward (as you'd expect from the fair-minded citizen), but they also show a tendency to maximise the difference between the groups (what you'd expect from the prejudiced cousin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect may be small, but this is a situation where the groups have been plucked out of the air by the experimenters. Every participant knows which group he or she is in, but they also know that they weren't in this group before they started the experiment, that their assignment was arbitrary or completely random, and that the groups aren't going to exist in any meaningful way after the experiment. They also know that their choices won't directly affect them (they are explicitly told that they won't be given any choices to make about themselves). Even so, this situation is enough to evoke favouritism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it seems we'll take the most minimal of signs as a cue to treat people differently according to which group they are in. Tajfel's work suggests that in-group bias is as fundamental to thinking as the act of categorisations itself. If we want to contribute to a fairer world we need to be perpetually on guard to avoid letting this instinct run away with itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with Tom?

And if you find yourself acting out of line with your beliefs, change them. This sounds like motivational advice from one of the more cynical self-help books, or perhaps a Groucho Marx line (&ldquo;Those are my principles, and if you don't like them... well, I have others&hellip;&rdquo;), but in fact it is a caricature of one of the most famous theories in social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Festinger's Dissonance Theory is an account of how our beliefs rub up against each other, an attempt at a sort of ecology of mind. Dissonance Theory offers an explanation of topics as diverse as why oil company executives might not believe in climate change, why army units have brutal initiation ceremonies, and why famous books might actually be boring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classic study on dissonance theory was published by Festinger and James Carlsmith in 1959. You can find a copy thanks to the &lt;a href=\"http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Festinger/index.htm\"&gt;Classics in the History of Psychology archive&lt;/a&gt;. I really recommend reading the full thing. Not only is it short, but it is full of enjoyable asides. Back in the day psychology research was a lot more fun to write up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festinger and Carlsmith were interested in testing what happened when people acted out of line with their beliefs. To do this, they made their participants spend an hour doing two excruciatingly boring tasks. The first task was filling a tray with spools, emptying it, then filling it again (and so on). The second was turning 48 small pegs a quarter-turn clockwise; and then once that was finished, going back to the beginning and doing another quarter-turn for each peg (and so on). Only after this tedium, and at the point which the participants believed the experiment was over, did the real study get going. The experimenter said that they needed someone to fill in at the last minute and explain the tasks to the next subject. Would they mind? And also, could they make the points that \"It was very enjoyable&rdquo;, &ldquo;I had a lot of fun&rdquo;, &ldquo;I enjoyed myself&rdquo;, &ldquo;It was very interesting&rdquo;, &ldquo;It was intriguing&rdquo;, and &ldquo;It was exciting\"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; was none of these things. But, being good people, with some pleading if necessary, they all agreed to explain the experiment to the next participant and make these points. The next participant was, of course, a confederate of the experimenter. We're not told much about her, except that she was an undergraduate specifically hired for the role. The fact that all 71 participants in the experiment were male, and, that one of the 71 had to be excluded from the final analysis because he demanded her phone number so he could explain things further, suggests that Festinger and Carlsmith weren't above ensuring that there were some extra motivational factors in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money trap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their trouble, the participants were paid $1, $20, or nothing. After explaining the task the original participants answered some questions about how they really felt about the experiment. At the time, many psychologists would have predicted that the group paid the most would be affected the most &ndash; if our feelings are shaped by rewards, the people paid $20 should be the ones who said they enjoyed it the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, people paid $20 tended to feel the same about the experiment as the people paid nothing. But something strange happened with the people paid $1. These participants were more likely to say they really did find the experiment enjoyable. They judged the experiment as more important scientifically, and had the highest desire to participate in future similar experiments. Which is weird, since nobody should really want to spend another hour doing mundane, repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Festinger's Dissonance theory explains the result. The &ldquo;Dissonance&rdquo; is between the actions of the participants and their beliefs about themselves. Here they are, nice guys, lying to an innocent woman. Admittedly there are lots of other social forces at work &ndash; obligation, authority, even attraction. Festinger's interpretation is that these things may play a role in how the participants act, but they can't be explicitly relied upon as reasons for acting. So there is a tension between their belief that they are a nice person and the knowledge of how they acted. This is where the cash payment comes in. People paid $20 have an easy rationalisation to hand. \"Sure, I lied\", they can say to themselves, \"but I did it for $20\". The men who got paid the smaller amount, $1, can't do this. Giving the money as a reason would make them look cheap, as well as mean. Instead, the story goes, they adjust their beliefs to be in line with how they acted. \"Sure, the experiment was kind of interesting, just like I told that girl\", \"It was fun, I wouldn't mind being in her position\" and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is cognitive dissonance at work. Normally it should be a totally healthy process &ndash; after all, who could object to people being motivated to reduce contradictions in their beliefs (philosophers even make a profession of out this), but in circumstances where some of our actions or our beliefs exist for reasons which are too complex, too shameful, or too nebulous to articulate, it can lead to us changing perfectly valid beliefs, such as how boring and pointless a task was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of cognitive dissonance will tell you that this is why people forced to defend a particular position &ndash; say because it is their job &ndash; are likely to end up believing it. It can also suggest a reason for why military services, high school sports teams and college societies have bizarre and punishing initiation rituals. If you've been through the ritual, dissonance theory predicts, you're much more likely to believe the group is a valuable one to be a part of (the initiation hurt, and you're not a fool, so it must have been worth it right?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I think dissonance theory explains why some really long books have such good reputations, despite the fact that they may be as repetitive and pointless as Festinger's peg task. Get to the end of a three-volume, several thousand page, conceptual novel and you're faced with a choice: either you wasted your time and money, and you feel a bit of a fool; or the novel is brilliant and you are an insightful consumer of literature. Dissonance theory pushes you towards the latter interpretation, and so swells the crowd of people praising a novel that would be panned if it was 150 pages long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing your beliefs to be in line with how you acted may not be the most principled approach. But it is certainly easier than changing how you acted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-03-12T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why people act out of line with their beliefs","HeadlineShort":"Why we act against our beliefs","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Ever been forced to defend a particular position and ended up believing it?

It's a question that has repeatedly been asked throughout humanity. For thousands of years, philosophers have debated whether we have a basically good nature that is corrupted by society, or a basically bad nature that is kept in check by society. Psychology has uncovered some evidence which might give the old debate a twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way of asking about our most fundamental characteristics is to look at babies. Babies' minds are a wonderful showcase for human nature. Babies are humans with the absolute minimum of cultural influence &ndash; they don't have many friends, have never been to school and haven't read any books. They can't even control their own bowels, let alone speak the language, so their minds are as close to innocent as a human mind can get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that the lack of language makes it tricky to gauge their opinions. Normally we ask people to take part in experiments, giving them instructions or asking them to answer questions, both of which require language. Babies may be cuter to work with, but they are not known for their obedience. What's a curious psychologist to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, you don't necessarily have to speak to reveal your opinions. Babies will reach for things they want or like, and they will tend to look longer at things that surprise them. Ingenious experiments &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7169/full/nature06288.html\"&gt;carried out at Yale University&lt;/a&gt; in the US used these measures to look at babies' minds. Their results suggest that even the youngest humans have a sense of right and wrong, and, furthermore, an instinct to prefer good over evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could the experiments tell this? Imagine you are a baby. Since you have a short attention span, the experiment will be shorter and loads more fun than most psychology experiments. It was basically a kind of puppet show; the stage a scene featuring a bright green hill, and the puppets were cut-out shapes with stick on wobbly eyes; a triangle, a square and a circle, each in their own bright colours. What happened next was a short play, as one of the shapes tried to climb the hill, struggling up and falling back down again. Next, the other two shapes got involved, with either one helping the climber up the hill, by pushing up from behind, or the other hindering the climber, by pushing back from above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already something amazing, psychologically, is going on here. All humans are able to interpret the events in the play in terms of the story I&rsquo;ve described. The puppets are just shapes. They don't make human sounds or display human emotions. They just move about, and yet everyone reads these movements as purposeful, and revealing of their characters. You can argue that this &ldquo;mind reading&rdquo;, even in infants, shows that it is part of our human nature to believe in other minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened next tells us even more about human nature. After the show, infants were given the choice of reaching for either the helping or the hindering shape, and it turned out they were much more likely to reach for the helper. This can be explained if they are reading the events of the show in terms of motivations &ndash; the shapes aren't just moving at random, but they showed to the infant that the shape pushing uphill \"wants\" to help out (and so is nice) and the shape pushing downhill \"wants\" to cause problems (and so is nasty).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an encore to confirm these results. Infants saw a second scene in which the climber shape made a choice to move towards either the helper shape or the hinderer shape. The time infants spent looking in each of the two cases revealed what they thought of the outcome. If the climber moved towards the hinderer the infants looked significantly longer than if the climber moved towards the helper. This makes sense if the infants were surprised when the climber approached the hinderer. Moving towards the helper shape would be the happy ending, and obviously it was what the infant expected. If the climber moved towards the hinderer it was a surprise, as much as you or I would be surprised if we saw someone give a hug to a man who had just knocked him over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way to make sense of this result is if infants, with their pre-cultural brains had expectations about how people should act. Not only do they interpret the movement of the shapes as resulting from motivations, but they prefer helping motivations over hindering ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't settle the debate over human nature. A cynic would say that it just shows that infants are self-interested and expect others to be the same way. At a minimum though, it shows that tightly bound into the nature of our developing minds is the ability to make sense of the world in terms of motivations, and a basic instinct to prefer friendly intentions over malicious ones. It is on this foundation that adult morality is built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https:/www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https:/twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-01-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Are we naturally good or bad?","HeadlineShort":"Are we naturally good or bad?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"It's a question humanity has repeatedly asked itself, and one way to find out is to take a closer look at the behaviour of babies. and use puppets.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"It's a question humanity has repeatedly asked itself, and one way to find out is to take a closer look at the behaviour of babies. and use puppets.","SummaryShort":"How babies can reveal the answer","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"ae0de38e-7ab7-4682-a4f6-ceb720e7a2a1","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130114-are-we-naturally-good-or-bad","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130114-are-we-naturally-good-or-bad"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130114-are-we-naturally-good-or-bad","_id":"559a56050b808738c4e2f1d1"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;When my wife can't find her keys, I assume it is because she is careless. When I can't find my keys I naturally put it down to bad luck. The curious thing is that she always assumes the opposite &ndash; that she's the one with the bad luck,&nbsp;and I'm the careless one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we observe other people we attribute their behaviour to their character rather than to their situation &ndash; my wife's carelessness means she loses her keys, your clumsiness means you trip over, his political opinions mean that he got into an argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we think about things that happen to us the opposite holds. We downplay our own dispositions and emphasise the role of the situation. Bad luck leads to lost keys, a hidden bump causes trips, or a late train results in an unsuccessful job interview &ndash; it&rsquo;s never anything to do with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern is so common that psychologists have called it the &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error\"&gt;fundamental attribution error&lt;/a&gt;. And there's a whole branch of psychology that investigates how we reason about causes for things called attribution theory. The fundamental attribution error is a good example of a quirk in the way we reason about causes, but it isn't the only one. Despite the name, it may not even be the most fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking causes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists are interested in attribution of causation because it tells us important things about how the mind works. To illustrate this, imagine you see a man asleep under a tree, and a leaf fluttering down to land on his head. As the leaf touches his head he wakes up and shouts \"Yikes\". Anyone watching this scene would assume the man woke up because of the falling leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this simple statement is remarkably &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume#Induction\"&gt;difficult to prove&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; you have no direct access to the cause, just the before (a leaf) and after (\"Yikes\"). We automatically assume the cause. We talk about it like it is a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; &ndash; somehow in the middle between the leaf and the man, but really it is just an assumption, not a thing. And indeed, some new information could come along and force us to reconsider our assumptions. We might find out later that a philosophically-minded ant had come along and, just at that minute, decided to bite the sleeping man's hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So our causes are assumptions, based on what we perceive but with an extra bit of imagination. They are necessary assumptions. Without looking for causes we would be stuck with a confusing picture of the world. Rather than say \"the falling leaf caused the man to wake up\", we have to take everything into account and say the following. \"The leaf fell. The grass did the same as before. A bird flew between two trees one hundred and thirty yards away. I lost my keys. My Romanian aunt's clock in my Romanian aunt's house continued ticking (on and on and on). The man woke up.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming causes in this way lets us make sense of the world. Not only is it easier to describe, the descriptions tell you how to make things happen (or avoid them &ndash; for instance, if you want the man to stay asleep next time, catch the leaf). In this way, attributions are psychological magic that help us control the future. No wonder psychologists find them interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built on sand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fundamental attribution error is just a continuation of a wider pattern: we blame individuals for what happens to them because of the general psychological drive to find causes for things. We have an inherent tendency to &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v2/n8/abs/nrn0801_561a.html\"&gt;pick out each other as causes&lt;/a&gt;; even from infancy, we pay more attention to things that move under their own steam, that act as if they have a purpose. The mystery is not that people become the focus of our reasoning about causes, but how we manage to identify any single cause in a world of infinite possible causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the way I described cause-seeking as an \"inherent tendency\" is part of this pattern. I have no direct access to what causes the results of experiments that have made me think this, just as I would have no direct access to what caused the man to wake as the leaf fell. I assume a thing, hidden, somehow, underneath the experiments &ndash; an inherent tendency for humans to identify each other as causes &ndash; which I then rely on to tell you what I'm thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That thing might not exist, or might have a reality very different from how I describe it, but we are forced to rely on assumptions to make sense of the world, and these assumptions create a reality of causes and essences that seems solid, despite its uncertain foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all might sound overly philosophical, but once you are switched on to this tendency to invent essences you'll hear them everywhere. Generalisations or stereotypes such as \"women can't do maths\" or \"Americans don't have a sense of humour\" also rely on an invented essence of a sex, or of a nationality, a term that some psychologists have called &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_attribution_error\"&gt;ultimate attribution error&lt;/a&gt;. These views don't have a concrete existence. They are based in imagination, and are subject to all the psychological forces that are at play there.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more prosaic domestic moments, when it feels like such bad luck that I can't find my keys, yet my wife seems so careless when she can't find hers, I know I&rsquo;m performing psychological magic. I&rsquo;m observing the myriad events in the world and imagining things &ndash; my bad luck, her carelessness &ndash; which I use to explain the world with. &nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the knowledge that these explanations can only ever be built on sand, I know to be a bit more careful about how I use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-07-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why I am always unlucky but you are always careless","HeadlineShort":"Playing the brain's blame game","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"From lost keys to failed interviews, we blame other people for their mishaps but never ourselves when we do the same.

You were dreaming, but in the haze of morning, you cannot quite remember what ran through your head. Childhood acquaintances were there. You were in Australia. One guy was a pirate. There was something about a cow. Perhaps. We have all had similarly murky memories of an earlier night&rsquo;s dream. But what if you could actually record your dreaming brain? Could you reconstruct the stories that play out in your head?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to be plausible. Science fiction is full of machines that can peer inside our heads and decipher our thoughts, and science, it seems, is catching up. The news abounds with tales of scientists who have created &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16267-mindreading-software-could-record-your-dreams.html\"&gt;mind-reading&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; &lt;a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/mar/06/medicalresearch\"&gt;machines&lt;/a&gt; that can convert our thoughts into images, most of these stories including a throwaway line about one day recording our dreams. But visualising our everyday thoughts is no easy matter, and dream-reading is more difficult still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task of decoding dreams comes down to interpreting the activity of the brain&rsquo;s 100 billion or so neurons, or nerve cells. And to interpret, you first have to measure. Contrary to the hype, our tools for measuring human brain activity leave a lot to be desired. &ldquo;Our methods are really lousy,&rdquo; says Professor Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some techniques, like &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\"&gt;electroencephalography&lt;/a&gt; (EEG) and &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography\"&gt;magnetoencephalography&lt;/a&gt; (MEG), measure the electric and magnetic fields that we produce when our neurons fire. Their resolution is terrible. They can only home in on 5-10 millimetres of brain tissue at a time at best &ndash; a space that contains only a few hundred million neurons. And because of the folded nature of the brain, those neurons can be located in nearby areas that have radically different functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, some scientists have used small grids of electrodes to isolate the activity of a handful of neurons. You get much better spatial resolution, but with two disadvantages: you can only look at a tiny portion of the brain, and you need to open up a hole in the volunteer&rsquo;s skull first. It is not exactly a technique that is ready for the mass market.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other methods are indirect. The most common one, &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI), is the darling of modern neuroscience. Neurons need sugar and oxygen to fuel their activity, and local blood vessels must increase their supply to meet the demand. It&rsquo;s this blood flow that fMRI measures, and the information is used to create an activation map of the brain. However, this provides only an indirect echo of neural activity, according to Gallant. &ldquo;Imagine you tried to work out what was going on in an office, but rather than asking people what they did, you went into the kitchen to see how much water they used,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking Yoda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these weaknesses, Gallant has repeatedly used fMRI to decipher the images encoded in our brain activity. &lt;a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2811%2900937-7\"&gt;For his latest trick&lt;/a&gt;, three of his team watched hours of YouTube clips while Gallant scanned the visual centres of their brains. He plugged the data into a mathematical model that acted as a brain-movie &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo;, capable of translating neural activity into moving images. The dictionary could later &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo&amp;feature=player_embedded\"&gt;reconstruct what the volunteers saw&lt;/a&gt;, by scanning hours of random clips and finding those that matched any particular burst of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reconstructed images were blurry and grainy, but Gallant thinks that this will improve with time, as we develop better ways of measuring brain activity, better models for analysing it and faster computers to handle the intense processing. &ldquo;Science marches on,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You know that in the future, it will be possible to measure brain activity better than you can today.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Gallant decodes what we see, Moran Cerf from the California Institute of Technology is decoding what we think about. He uses tiny electrodes to measure the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in creating memories. In this way, he can identify &lt;a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/10/27/harnessing-your-marilyn-monroe-neurons/\"&gt;neurons that fire in response to specific concepts&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; say, Marilyn Monroe or Yoda. Cerf&rsquo;s work is a lot like Gallant&rsquo;s &ndash; he effectively creates a dictionary that links concepts to patterns of neural activity. &ldquo;You think about something and because we learned what your brain looks like when you think about that thing, we can make inferences,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both techniques share similar limitations. To compile the dictionaries, people need to look at a huge number of videos or concepts. To truly visualise a person&rsquo;s thoughts, Cerf says, &ldquo;That person would need to look at all the concepts in the world, one by one. People don&rsquo;t want to sit there for hours or days so that I can learn about their brain.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dream album&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, visualising what someone is thinking is hard enough. When that person is dreaming, things get even tougher. Dreams have convoluted stories that are hard to break down into sequences of images or concepts. &ldquo;When you dream, it&rsquo;s not just image by image,&rdquo; says Cerf. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say I scanned your brain while you were dreaming, and I see you thinking of Marilyn Monroe, or love, or Barack Obama. I see pictures. You see you and Marilyn Monroe, whom you&rsquo;re in love with, going to see Barack Obama giving a speech. The narrative is the key thing we&rsquo;re going to miss.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You would also have to repeat this for each new person. The brain is not a set of specified drawers where information is filed in a fixed way. No two brains are organised in quite the same fashion. &ldquo;Even if I know everything about your brain and where things are, it doesn&rsquo;t tell me anything about my brain,&rdquo; says Cerf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions. A small number of people have regular &lsquo;lucid dreams&rsquo;, where they are aware that they are dreaming and can partially communicate with the outside world. Martin Dresler and Michael Czisch from the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry exploited this rare trait. &lt;a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2811%2901031-1\"&gt;They told two lucid dreamers&lt;/a&gt; to dream about clenching and unclenching their hands, while flicking their eyes from side to side. These dream movements translated into real flickers, which told Dresler and Czisch when the dreams had begun. They found that the dream movements activated the volunteers&rsquo; motor cortex &ndash; the area that controls our movements &ndash; in the same way that real-world movements do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was an interesting proof-of-principle, but it is a long way from reading normal dreams. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if this would work on non-lucid dreams. I&rsquo;m sceptical that even in the medium-term future that you&rsquo;d ever have devices for reading dreams,&rdquo; says Dresler. &ldquo;The devices you have in wakefulness are very far from reading your mind or thoughts, even in the next couple of decades.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if those devices improve by leaps and bounds, reading a sleeping mind poses great, perhaps insurmountable challenges. The greatest of them is that you cannot really compare the images and stories you reconstruct with what a person actually dreamt. After all, our memories of our dreams are hazy at the best of times. &ldquo;You have no ground-truthing,&rdquo; says Gallant. It is like compiling a dictionary between one language and another that you cannot actually read. One day, we might be able to convert the activity of dreaming neurons into sounds and sights.

But the rise of Google, Wikipedia and other online tools has made many people question the impact of &lt;a href=\"http://www.edge.org/discourse/carr_google.html\"&gt;these technologies on our brains&lt;/a&gt;. Is typing in the search term, &ldquo;Who has played James Bond in the movies?&rdquo; the same as knowing that the answer is Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig (&hellip; plus David Niven in Casino Royale)? Can we say we know the answer to this question when what we actually know is how to rapidly access the information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ve written before about whether or not the internet is &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120424-does-the-internet-rewire-brains\"&gt;rewiring our brains&lt;/a&gt;, but here the question is about how we seek to define intelligence itself. And the answer appears to be an intriguing one. Because when you look at the evidence from psychological studies, it suggests that much of our intelligence comes from how we coordinate ourselves with other people and our environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An influential theory among psychologists is that we're &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_miser\"&gt;cognitive misers&lt;/a&gt;. This is the idea that we are reluctant to do mental work unless we have to, we try to avoid thinking things though fully when a short cut is available. If you've ever voted for the political candidate with the most honest smile, or chosen a restaurant based on how many people are already sitting in there, then you've been a cognitive miser. The theory explains why we'd much rather type a zipcode into a sat-nav device or Google Maps than memorise and recall the location of a venue &ndash; it's so much easier to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that people don't tend to rely on their memories for things they can easily access. Things like the world in front of our eyes, for example, can be changed quite radically without people noticing. Experiments have shown that buildings can somehow disappear from pictures we're looking at, or the people we're talking to can be switched with someone else, and often we won't notice &ndash; a phenomenon called &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness\"&gt;change blindness&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo;. This isn't as an example of human stupidity &ndash; far from it, in fact &ndash; this is an example of mental efficiency. The mind relies on the world as a better record than memory, and usually that's a good assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, philosophers have suggested that the mind is designed to spread itself out over the environment. So much so that, they suggest, the thinking is really happening in the environment as much as it is happening in our brains. The philosopher Andy Clark called humans \"&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Clark\"&gt;natural born cyborgs&lt;/a&gt;\", beings with minds that naturally incorporate new tools, ideas and abilities. From Clark's perspective, the route to a solution is not the issue &ndash; having the right tools really does mean you know the answers, just as much as already knowing the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Society wins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A memory study by Daniel Wegner of Harvard University provides &lt;a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/61/6/923/\"&gt;a neat example of this effect&lt;/a&gt;. Couples were asked to come into the lab to take a memorisation test. Half the couples were kept together, and half were reassigned to pair up with someone they didn't know. Both groups then studied a list of words in silence, and were then tested individually. The pairs that were made up of a couple in a relationship could remember more items, both overall and as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened, according to Wegner, was that the couples in a relationship had a good understanding of their partners. Because of this they would tacitly divide up the work between them, so that, say, one partner would remember words to do with technology, assuming the other would remember the words to do with sports. In this way, each partner could concentrate on their strengths, and so individually they outperformed people in couples where no mental division of labour was possible. Just as you rely on a search engine for answers, so you can rely on people you deal with regularly to think about certain things, developing a shared system for committing items to memory and bringing them out again, what Wegner called &ldquo;transactive memory&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having minds that work this way is one of the great strengths of the human species. Rather than being forced to rely on our own resources for everything, we can share our knowledge and so pool our understanding. Technology keeps track of things for individuals so we don't have to, while large systems of knowledge serve the needs of society as a whole. I don't know how a computer works, or how to grow broccoli, but that knowledge is out there and I get to benefit. And the internet provides even more potential to share this knowledge. Wikipedia is one of the best examples &ndash; an evolving store of the world's knowledge for which everyone can benefit from. I use Wikipedia every day, aware of all the caveats of doing so, because it supports me in all the thinking I do for things like this column.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as well as having a physical environment &ndash; like the rooms or buildings we live or work in &ndash; we also have a mental environment. Which means that when I ask you where your mind is, you shouldn&rsquo;t point toward the centre of your forehead. As research on areas like transactive memory shows, our minds are made up just as much by the people and tools around us as they are by the brain cells inside our skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-11-20T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"What makes us intelligent?","HeadlineShort":"What makes us intelligent?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":" and does Google and Wikipedia make it better or worse?

                Studying human behaviour can be like a dog trying to catch its own tail. As we learn more about ourselves, our new beliefs change how we behave. Research on economics students showed this in action: textbooks describing facts and theories about human behaviour can affect the people studying them.
               </p>

                Economic models are often based on an imaginary character called the rational actor, who, with no messy and complex inner world, relentlessly pursues a set of desires ranked according to the costs and benefits. Rational actors help create simple models of economies and societies. According to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory">
                 rational choice theory
                </a>
                , some of the predictions governing these hypothetical worlds are common sense: people should prefer more to less, firms should only do things that make a profit and, if the price is right, you should be prepared to give up anything you own.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another tool used to help us understand our motivations and actions is
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">
                 game theory
                </a>
                , which examines how you make choices when their outcomes are affected by the choices of others. To determine which of a number of options to go for, you need a theory about what the other person will do (and your theory needs to encompass the other person's theory about what you will do, and so on). Rational actor theory says other players in the game all want the best outcome for themselves, and that they will assume the same about you.
               </p>
               <p>
                The most famous game in game theory is the 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">
                 prisoner's dilemma
                </a>
                , in which you are one of a pair of criminals arrested and held in separate cells. The police make you this offer: you can inform on your partner, in which case you either get off scot free (if your partner keeps quiet), or you both get a few years in prison (if he informs on you too). Alternatively you can keep quiet, in which case you either get a few years (if your partner also keeps quiet), or you get a long sentence (if he informs on you, leading to him getting off scot free). Your partner, of course, faces exactly the same choice.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you're a rational actor, it's an easy decision. You should inform on your partner in crime because if he keeps quiet, you go free, and if he informs on you, both of you go to prison, but the sentence will be either the same length or shorter than if you keep quiet.
               </p>
               <p>
                Weirdly, and thankfully, this isn't what happens if you ask real people to play the prisoner's dilemma. Around the world, in most societies,
                <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/327/5972/1480">
                 most people
                </a>
                maintain the criminals' pact of silence. The exceptions who opt to act solely in their own interests are known in economics as "
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem">
                 free riders
                </a>
                "  individuals who take benefits without paying costs.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Self(ish)-selecting group
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                The prisoner's dilemma is a theoretical tool, but there are plenty of parallel choices  and free riders  in the real world. People who are always late for appointments with others don't have to hurry or wait for others. Some use roads and hospitals without paying their taxes. There are lots of interesting reasons why most of us turn up on time and don't avoid paying taxes, even though these might be the selfish "rational" choices according to most economic models.
               </p>
               <p>
                Crucially, rational actor theory appears more useful for predicting the actions of certain groups of people. One group who have been found to free ride more than others in repeated studies is people who have studied economics. In a study
                <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.7.2.159">
                 published in 1993
                </a>
                , Robert Frank and colleagues from Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York State, tested this idea with a version of the prisoner's dilemma game. Economics students "informed on" other players 60% of the time, while those studying other subjects did so 39% of the time. Men have previously been found to be more self-interested in such tests, and more men study economics than women. However even after controlling for this sex difference, Frank found economics students were 17% more likely to take the selfish route when playing the prisoner's dilemma.
               </p>
               <p>
                In good news for educators everywhere, the team found that the longer students had been at university, the higher their rates of cooperation. In other words, higher education (or simple growing up), seemed to make people more likely to put their faith in human co-operation. The economists again proved to be the exception. For them extra years of study did nothing to undermine their selfish rationality.
               </p>
               <p>
                Frank's group then went on to carry out surveys on whether students would return money they had found or report being undercharged, both at the start and end of their courses. Economics students were more likely to see themselves and others as more self-interested following their studies than a control group studying astronomy. This was especially true among those studying under a tutor who taught game theory and focused on notions of survival imperatives militating against co-operation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Subsequent work has questioned these findings, suggesting that selfish people are just
                <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/ei/cbg020/abstract">
                 more likely to study economics
                </a>
                , and that Frank's surveys and games tell us
                <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2138290">
                 little about real-world moral behaviour
                </a>
                . It is true that what individuals do in the highly artificial situation of being presented with the prisoner's dilemma doesn't necessarily tell us how they will behave in more complex real-world situations.
               </p>
               <p>
                In related work,
                <a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/">
                 Eric Schwitzgebel has shown
                </a>
                that students and teachers of ethical philosophy don't seem to behave more ethically when their behaviour is assessed using a range of real-world variables. Perhaps, says Schwitzgebel, we shouldn't be surprised that economics students who have been taught about the prisoner's dilemma, act in line with what they've been taught when tested in a classroom. Again, this is a long way from showing any influence on real world behaviour, some argue.
               </p>
               <p>
                The lessons of what people do in tests and games are limited because of the additional complexities involved in real-world moral choices with real and important consequences. Yet I hesitate to dismiss the results of these experiments. We shouldnt leap to conclusions based on the few simple experiments that have been done, but if we tell students that it makes sense to see the world through the eyes of the selfish rational actor, my suspicion is that they are more likely to do so.
               </p>
               <p>
                Multiple factors influence our behaviour, of which formal education is just one. Economics and economic opinions are also prominent throughout the news media, for instance. But what the experiments above demonstrate, in one small way at least, is that what we are taught about human behaviour can alter it.
