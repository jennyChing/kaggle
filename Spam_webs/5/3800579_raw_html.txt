       Now that we've reached over two million completions of our
  vocabulary survey, we thought
  it would be a good time to consolidate our biggest findings in a single
  post. All numbers here are rounded to make for nice "factoids", but
  link to the original blog entries with the raw data.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Note that "native" here is short for "native speakers of English", or
  people who speak English as a first language, and 
  "foreign"
  is short for "non-native learners of English."
  And remember that these statistics are based on self-selected survey
  participants who are the kind of people who take vocabulary tests on the
  Internet, and not necessarily representative of the population 
  as a whole.)

      <p>
       This is an extremely fascinating chart, because it reveals what we've
  thought all along  reading builds your vocabulary. 
  However, we never dreamed that the final chart would look quite
  so "clean"! (At least, ignoring the bottom-most line for now.)
  Of course, when you have more than a quarter million respondents,
  that lets you produce pretty accurate results.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have three main findings from this chart. The first
  is that while increasing your reading matters, increasing your
  reading of fiction, specifically, matters
       <i>
        equally as much
       </i>
       .
  That fiction reading would increase vocabulary size more than
  just non-fiction was one of our hypotheses  it makes sense,  
  after all,
  considering that fiction tends to use a greater variety of words 
  than non-fiction does. However, we hadn't expected its effect
  to be this prominent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second finding is that, 
  for people who already read "somewhat", 
  then for each level of "bumping up" their
  reading in general, or of fiction specifically, 
  their vocabulary will
  be roughly 2,000 words larger. Indeed, the difference between someone
  who reads "somewhat" and fiction "not much", and someone who reads
  "lots" and fiction "lots", is approximately 8,000 words, 
  regardless of age level. That's a huge difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       [The numbers for people who read "not much" are
       <i>
        far
       </i>
       lower, and seem to follow a different curve entirely. 
  Indeed, the lowest
  percentiles of vocabulary size in our survey overall show drastically
  different results. We believe this is due to a combination of
  1) insufficient data (we need more participants),
  2) greater variation within the group (the single category
     "not much" is too broad), and
  3) participant selection (what kinds of people have taken the
     test, vs. what kinds haven't).
  In other words, more study
  is needed.]
      </p>
      <p>
       And the third finding, completely unexpected,
  is that the difference between those who
  read "somewhat" and those who read "lots" doesn't appear to change
  with age  the difference at 15 years old is essentially
  the same
  difference at 60, which means that this life-long difference
  is
       <i>
        already
       </i>
       present by age 15.
  The previous chart doesn't show data before age 15,
  because with far less participation, it's much noisier. 
  However, if we ignore the fictional literature question, 
  and focus entirely
  on overall reading ability, we can get a rough idea of what's 
  going on:

      );
    });
      </script>
      <p>
       The data is still pretty noisy because of fairly low 
  participation levels (between 
  the ages of 4 and 8, there are still only between 140 and 260
  responses per age, while by age 12, there are already more than 1,500).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the overall picture is still pretty clear: at around age 4, when
  children are only first starting to read (at best), 
  average vocabulary levels are
  roughly equivalent in relation to reading habits (as one would
  expect)
   at around 6,000 words. 
  Then, it's between the crucial
  ages of 415 where reading makes all the difference in the
       <i>
        rate
       </i>
       at which children increase their vocabulary.
  We can calculate the differences, although these should be taken
  as "ballpark approximations" at most, given the noisiness of the data:
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <table style="font-size: 16px;">
       <thead>
        <td>
         Reading habits
        </td>
        <td>
         Vocabulary growth per day, ages 415
        </td>
       </thead>
       <tr>
        <td>
         Reads "lots"
        </td>
        <td>
         +4.1 words/day
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>
         Reads "somewhat"
        </td>
        <td>
         +2.6 words/day
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td>
         Reads "not much"
        </td>
        <td>
         +1.4 words/day
        </td>
       </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
       This is a fascinating finding, as
  it tells us that vocabulary growth is drastically affected by the
  amount children read. 
  By age 15, this has resulted in
  a difference of 5,0006,000 words between
  each level, and children who read "lots" have almost
       <i>
        double
       </i>
       the
  vocabulary of children who read "not much". Obviously, this will
  affect school performance, SAT scores, and so on  and it's a
  difference accumulated throughout all of childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       (However, keep in mind that these learning "rates" are based only on
  averages across all our survey respondents  they are not representative 
  of the population as a whole. Also, the rates are "average" only  
  we also don't have enough
  data to separate them out into percentiles yet. 4-year olds
  who start out with larger vocabularies of 7,000 words, or smaller vocabularies
  of only 3,500 words, could likely show different growth rates, and 
  other factors besides reading habits surely affect vocabulary growth
  as well.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what's the biggest takeaway from this? If you're a parent, make sure
  your kids
       <i>
        read
       </i>
       , and read all they can  it will 
  last them the rest of their lives.

  But now that it's almost two years later, and we've collected more than
  five times as much data, it's time 
  to revisit the graph.
  The overall shape hasn't changed, of course (it's just smoother),
  but with so much more participation,
  we can now calculate not just median vocabulary levels per age, but also
  various percentiles as well. This gives a better idea of the
       <i>
        distribution
       </i>
       of vocabulary sizes among survey participants. So here
  is the crown jewel of our results:

       To give you an idea of just how much data is compressed into this
  single graphic, there are over 20,000 respondents which alone make up
       <i>
        just
       </i>
       the single age of 21, with over 2,000 for
       <i>
        each
       </i>
       point in the percentile lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, remember that these percentiles are
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       for the population
  as a whole, but rather just those who have taken the test online. 
  Comparing with self-reported SAT scores from previous analysis,
  overall participation is in roughly the 98th percentile of the American
  population as a whole  it is apparently a very "elite" group of
  people who spend their time taking vocabulary tests on the Internet!
      </p>
      <p>
       But regardless, it's fascinating to see how test-takers age 50, for example,
  range from slightly over 20,000 words (10th percentile), to slightly
  over 30,000 words (median), to nearly 40,000 words (90th percentile).
      </p>
      <p>
       (You'll also notice how we've cut off some of the percentile lines, restricting
  them to only a subset of ages. This is because data was too noisy in these
  areas.)

       IELTS is used particularly

  TOEFL is used more for
  American purposes. Both tests are geared towards advanced learners of
  English, since they're designed especially to gauge ability to perform
  at university level. And here is how their scores correlate
  with vocabulary sizes:

      <p>
       Note that TOEFL scores are rounded to the nearest 10, so 
  a score of 570 on the paper exam
  actually includes scores in the range 565574
  (and the "impossible" score of 680 is actually 675677). 
  In all three tests,
  we've cut off lower levels of scores where we had less data (they also
  tended to be relatively flat).
  Finally, note that the very highest score of each test "jumps" quite far up
  relative to the rest  this is to be expected, since the highest
  score includes people who would score
       <i>
        even higher
       </i>
       if the test
  examined even more difficult English.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there's nothing particularly unexpected from this data,
  it is interesting to see that the three exams basically cover vocabulary
  ranges from lower-advanced (around 6,000) to lower-native (around 20,000)
   which makes sense, since the tests are geared towards university
  admissions. 
  Of course, the tests evaluate far more than just vocabulary, and include
  things like grammar, listening, and writing  which are
  not reflected in the TestYourVocab quiz.

       As previously promised... we are releasing the average English
  vocabulary levels per-country, for non-native speakers. Please
  keep in mind, this is
       <i>
        not

       scientific in the slightest, but 
  rather just for fun.

      <p>
       It is clear that the real "winner" here is Northern Europe: the
  first four places are Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. After that,
  Europe as a whole has a relatively strong showing, along with Mexico,
  Argentina, Israel, Chile, and Indonesia.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what does this chart really mean? Besides being based normally
  on the vocabulary test results, there are three limits
  placed on the data:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Non-native.
       </b>
       It is based on speakers self-identified as non-native
  speakers
       <i>
        only
       </i>
       , so an American living in China should not affect 
  the data for China.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No English as an official language.
       </b>
       We have
       <i>
        not
       </i>
       included results for countries where English is one of the
  official languages. This means no US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
  India, Pakistan, Philippines, or Singapore. While many of these countries
  had high numbers of respondents who self-identified as non-native 
  English speakers, comparison with other countries would not be very
  meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        At least 300 respondents.
       </b>
       Less than this, and the data for the
  country is really not very meaningful at all. (Interestingly, China,
  Iran and Russia are by far our largest participants, with over 60,000
  test-takers each. Next comes Ukraine at 23,000, and then Germany at 12,000.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, there are two big caveats to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Internet participation.
       </b>
       It is based only on people who took the
  survey, without any kind of scientific control, or guarantee that
  the participants are representative of the overall population as a whole. 
  In fact, they almost surely aren't, since Internet users tend to be
  better educated and fall into particular age groups.
  Strictly speaking, this
  means the comparative data is totally useless, because it is 
  theoretically 
  possible that, for example, the test was popular among top students in
  Denmark, and among low-performing students in Iran.
  Such an extreme example is probably
  not the case, but whether participation in a particular country
  came via an article on a high-brow news site, or was spread by a
  particular group of people on a certain social network, could certainly
  have an influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        IP addresses.
       </b>
       Countries were calculated automatically from the IP
  addresses of test-takers. These are mostly accurate, but not perfect.
  Some respondents also provided their nationality in the survey.  
  Many countries show self-reported nationalities and IP addresses matching
  up over 95% of the time, while other countries have a somewhat lower rate. So
  country identification, while good, is not absolutely perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       So have fun with the rankings, but don't take them too seriously.
  And if you have further interest, check out the
       <a href="http://www.ef.com/epi/ef-epi-ranking/">
        EF English Proficiency
  Index

  different survey, and also has a PDF report with interesting profiles of
  English usage in a number of countries.

      <h3>
       28 July 2011
      </h3>
      <p>
       Participation has continued to build far beyond our expectations, with
  over a third of a million unique visitors to the site (and,
  interestingly, almost
  everybody who visits takes the test). We realize the potential
  for collecting more detailed data, and have received lots of suggestions
  from participants as well. So today we've added several additional
  survey questions which will hopefully allow us to produce more interesting
  results:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <b>
         Reading.
        </b>
        For native speakers, how much do you read? And how
    much do you read fiction? It's commonly believed that reading 
    is the principal mechanism for adult vocabulary growth. Is this true?
    And how much does it depend on fictional literature?
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Nationality.
        </b>
        We've been tracking English-speaking
    nationality explicitly, and non-native nationality by IP address, 
    but now we're including a full list of countries for
    non-native speakers, so that we can be sure any country comparisons
    we perform are accurate.
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         Reading, writing, listening, speaking.
        </b>
        For non-native learners, we've had an overall question about 
    English usage English outside class. We're keeping that question, but
    now including additional breakdown questions by skill. How are they
    ranked in terms of effect on vocabulary?
       </li>
       <li>
        <b>
         TOEFL and IELTS.
        </b>
        We've already been recording SAT scores for US participants.
    Now we're recording TOEFL (both paper-based and Internet-based)
    and IELTS scores for non-native learners, along with when the
    exams were taken.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We're looking forward to being able to publish new findings here.
  So thanks to everyone who's participated so far, and please keep spreading 
  the word!

      <p>
       Over the past week, we've had a flood of participation, with over
  200,000 visitors. (If you haven't taken the quiz, you can
       <a href="/">
        do it here
       </a>
       .)
  So now it's about time we gave something back!
  Previously, we'd only been able to calculate a very narrow range
  of statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, we've been able to produce two great new charts which give
  a much fuller picture of the vocabulary sizes of native English speakers.
  First, since we've had much more participation from both younger and
  older speakers, we can calculate meaningful average vocabulary sizes from
  native English speakers who took the test, for ages 371:

      <p>
       This is a fantastic chart, because it shows the speed at
  which our vocabulary really grows. Between the ages of 3 and roughly 16,
  our vocabulary explodes at an average rate of almost 4 new words
  a day (3.8, to be more exact). Then, between the ages of 16 and 50,
  our vocabulary growth is slower, but still fairly consistent:
  around 1 new word a day (0.85, to be precise). Finally, beyond 50, vocabulary
  size appears to remain fairly constant. (Note that the
  data is still a bit jagged both for younger and older participants 
  we still need more data at both ends to smooth things out.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        However,
       </b>
       note that these average vocabulary sizes of our
  respondents are
       <i>
        significantly higher
       </i>
       than those of the overall
  population at large. How do we know this? Because our American
  participants' self-reported verbal SAT scores hover at around a
  constant 700 (out of 800 maximum) at all applicable age levels,
  while the median score of SAT test-takers is only
       <a href="http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat-percentile-ranks-2010.pdf" target="blank">
        500
       </a>
       . And these test-takers themselves are a more educated subset
  of the American population as a whole. To put things in perspective,
  it has been estimated that if the whole US population took the verbal SAT,
  it would have a median verbal score of around
       <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~miyaguch/sat.html" target="_blank">
        350
       </a>
       .
  Our average respondent's verbal SAT score of 700 places him or her
  in the 95th percentile among SAT takers,
  and above the 99th percentile in the American population as a whole.
  This means that the average American's vocabulary size would be
  significantly lower than the chart above shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with the
  new data we've acquired, we've been able to produce
  a second chart, more limited in age range, but which shows
  the levels of vocabulary growth among respondents of different
  verbal SAT scores:

       Note: V-SAT scores are as reported, and
  have

       been adjusted to account for the

       First, this appears to tell us that the verbal SAT really is
  measuring something real, which is always good to know!
  But more interestingly, the data so far suggests that
  vocabulary growth over the
  years is independent of SAT scoreall the slopes are
  essentially the same, with everyone learning
  the same "one new word a day"
  of vocabulary growth.
  It also shows that, at least in this SAT range of 500800, each
  50-point increase in score is equivalent to knowing roughly
  1,500 more words, regardless of your age.
  The difference between a 500-scoring adult and an 800-scoring
  adult is roughly an extra 10,000 words in their vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may notice that, while the top-scoring lines are smooth
  and don't touch (because we've got lots of data), the lower-scoring
  lines become increasingly jumpy. This is because we still need more
  participation at these SAT levels  in fact, we don't have enough
  data to draw
       <i>
        any
       </i>
       reliable lines for SAT scores under 500.
  So, we're still waiting for more participation in order to calculate
  the lifetime vocabulary curve of an "average" American, with a
  verbal SAT score of 350.

       <a href="/blog/2011-07-25-New-results-for-foreign-learners">
        New results for foreign learners
       </a>
      </h2>
      <h3>
       25 July 2011
      </h3>
      <p>
       We knew that our new exposure would give us lots of data in the U.S.
  and other English-speaking countries. What we didn't expect was
  that the quiz would have so much international popularity!
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Russia has generated almost half as much participation as the
  U.S., Germany has produced nearly 6,000 visits, China over 5,000,
  and Iran exactly 4,000 as we write this. We've even had solitary visits
  from Namibia and Zambia.
      </p>
      <p>
       And probably half the e-mails we've received have been from non-native
  speakers asking for numbers to compare their personal results with.
  This presented us with a problem: how to produce numbers that are
  meaningful enough to compare one's results with?
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious answer would be vocabulary correlated to the number of
  years people have studied English. We tried that, but these numbers
  have turned
  out to be all over the place. There are so many different types of courses,
  and so many ways of informally learning English, that the data has been
  fairly meaningless so far. Plus, most people taking the test and filling
  out the
  survey already have a decent level of English, since the survey itself
  is in English  so lower levels are probably severly underrepresented.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll be surmounting many of these problems with our future launch of
  this test in Brazil, where styles of English learning are much
  more uniform, and easier to compare and correlate. (Plus, the
  interface will be available in Portuguese, so we can include more
  introductory students.) But we don't want to keep
  everyone waiting until then.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've decided to make available a chart simply showing the
  overall distribution of vocabulary scores, with the percentage of
  respondents which fall into the range centered on each score:

       The largest proportion of respondents (4.7%) know 4,500 words
  (or are in the range from 4,2504,749, technically).
  Looking at it another way (not displayed on the chart),
  the
       <i>
        median
       </i>
       vocabulary size for all respondents is 7,826 
  half know more, half know less.
  But remember that these statistics, while they might be fun to
  compare yourself against, merely reflect the people who have taken
  this online quiz from all over the world, and is in no way
  representative of the world population as a whole. Percentages
  for people who know less than 1,000 words are not even shown on the chart
  (the data is too spotty/erratic so far).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this doesn't mean we haven't found anything else interesting.
  To the contrary! Because while our data isn't fine enough to
  find much correlation between vocabulary size and the number of years of
  English classes taken, we
       <i>
        did
       </i>
       find great differences in average
  vocabulary results for the following questions:

       So, summing it up for non-native learners of English, what does this
  mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       While the charts above should not be interpreted as a scientifically
  controlled survey, and represent
  only the voluntary responses of a self-selected Internet survey group,
  they do suggest a few things:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Academic performance helps
       </b>
       , up to doubling your vocabulary size.
  But that doesn't tell us what helps academic performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Classroom participation matters too, but it's not the top factor.
       </b>
       It appears to give you up to a 50% boost in vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Outside of class is the biggest difference.
       </b>
       Students who do "lots" of things in English outside of class have
  more than twice the vocabulary of those who "don't do much."
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Living abroad gets you to and beyond 10,000.
       </b>
       Up to one year abroad brings the average student from around 7,000
  to around 10,000 words. After that, every year abroad gives you
  around 850 more words, or around 2.35 per day. (Compare that to the
  average American adult who learns 0.85 per day.)
      </p>
      <p>
       But be aware that the results above are suggestive onlywe have
  not separated out the different factors from each other
  statistically. So, for example, higher vocabulary sizes among people
  with lots of English activity outside of class might not actually
  be due to their learning at the time, but the fact that it made them
  more likely to live abroad afterwards. Or higher vocabulary sizes
  for top academic performers might simply be due to the fact that they
  took more years of classes, while others dropped out sooner.
  Or indeed, causation might run in the opposite direction 
  students whose English is already better might be more inclined
  to participate in class, and engage in extracurricular English
  activities. More research will tell.

       Out of nowhere, we woke up Sunday morning to discover that, instead
  of the slow trickle of participants we'd become accustomed to... the
  site was booming!
      </p>
      <p>
       All thanks to "mike_esspe" who

        posted

       the
  survey to Hacker News. This small action has generated over 50,000 new
  completed surveys so far  over 3,000 an hour yesterday, 
  which is almost one new visitor per second. And it's still going strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a big thank you to everyone who participated, and a big welcome to
  everyone arriving. As soon as this new wave of participation slows down,
  we'll take another look at the data and see what new trends we can
  tease out of it, so bookmark this page!

       02 December 2010
      </h3>
      <p>
       Over the past three days we've gotten a fantastic response from people
  sharing this site on
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/edlnv/reddit_i_created_this_site_to_measure_the_size_of/">
        reddit
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://facebook.com">
        Facebook
       </a>
       , with over 8,000
  participations so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've made two discoveries so far. The first is that, for native speakers
  age 18+, most people (74%) have a vocabulary size between 20,000 and 35,000
  (13% below, and 13% above).
  Of course, this is for the specific subset of people who are Internet
  users and have taken our test so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our second discovery is much more interesting, a statistic we haven't
  come across anywhere before. We calculated average vocabulary sizes
  for native English speakers for ages 1532, which is the range
  of ages for which we have at least 100 respondents per year of birth, and
  discovered there is a remarkably linear progression from
  23,303 words (age 15) to 29,330 words (age 32), which works out to
  an average increase of 355 words per year, or almost
       <b>
        exactly one new word a day
       </b>
       (0.97 words to be precise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this increase could be due to some kind of age-education bias
  among the test-takers, but we ran an analysis of average self-reported
  verbal SAT score per age as well in the same range, and it hovers
  around a constant 700 15 points, so the increase in vocabulary
  with age appears to be quite realat least for people who
  originally scored quite well on their high school verbal SAT, who appear
  to be our main respondents so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is actually quite fascinatingthe fact that people don't
  simply stop learning once they're out of school, but that their
  vocabulary appears to be growing just as much at age 30 as it was at
  age 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it leads to further questions: how much faster is vocabulary growth
  below age 15 (as it necessarily must be)? And to what extent, and when,
  does vocabulary growth start tapering off? More participation in the
  survey should tell us.
      </p>

       With just a day before Thanksgiving, we're about collect our
  first data. The final vocabulary list has been selected, the website
  code has been written, and a nice, bright yellow graphical theme was put together
  last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       By asking a few friends to spread the link around to friends and family,
  we plan to build up enough preliminary statistics on how vocabulary
  levels relate to education and age so that, when we finally go public
  with the site, we'll already have some meaningful data for users to
  compare their own vocabulary level with. So, here we go!
