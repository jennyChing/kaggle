          Eva Clarke lives in a neat detached house on the outskirts of Cambridge. The city is not where she grew up, but she came here almost 50 years ago as the bride of a young academic. Today Malcolm Clarke is emeritus professor of law and an award-winning author, so I am here by proxy  all the real credit is with my husband, she says.

          Such understatement, you quickly learn, is typical of Eva, a softly spoken woman with luminous green eyes and a magnetic smile. In fact, she often addresses students herself, not just here but around the UK. But unlike her husband, Eva does not discuss complex legal arguments. In the simplest, most direct way possible, she tells the harrowing story of her birth.

          Eva came into this world at Mauthausen, a notorious Nazi death camp, on 29 April 1945. Her mother was forced to deliver her as she lay gaunt and wild-eyed upon a mass heap of dying, typhoid-ridden prisoners slung on to a wooden cart by ruthless SS officers. Had Anka Bergman gone into labour just 24 hours earlier, her daughter would almost certainly not be here  both of them would have been killed moments after Eva took her first breath. But Evas arrival coincided with the wholesale collapse of the Third Reich. Hitlers henchmen had just dismantled Mauthausens gas chambers and were about to flee the approaching US army. By sheer fluke of timing, Eva became one of the youngest known survivors of the Holocaust.

I tell my story because it is important to make history come alive while I still can, she says. For 15 years, in schools, colleges and also prisons, Evas talks have held audiences mesmerised and appalled in equal measure.

          Born Survivors, by bestselling author and journalist Wendy Holden, gives an unsparingly vivid account of Ankas four years in Nazi captivity and reveals how she concealed her pregnancy to bring new hope into the world in defiance of unthinkable cruelty.

          Strikingly beautiful and conversant in six languages as well as her native Czech, Anka was a 21-year-old law student when German tanks rolled into Prague in March 1939. Although nominally Jewish, her parents Stanislav and Ida, who ran a successful leather factory, were non-observant and had raised their family to be freethinkers. Back then, Anka, the youngest of their five children (one of whom had died, age three, of meningitis), barely imagined that Hitlers growing antisemitism would have any effect on her own life.

          Once the Nazis had occupied Czechoslovakia, however, all Jewish citizens found their freedoms being gradually eroded. Ankas familys factory  in a small 14th-century town two hours from the capital  was taken over by the Reich and their assets were frozen. In Prague, Jews were banned from popular cafs, cinemas and universities. As a film buff, Anka was devastated about not being able to go to the movies. But she wasnt bothered about her studies, says Eva. She was a party girl and said it was a blessing in disguise because she had been too busy enjoying herself to do much work.

          Some of Ankas friends fled as the restrictions tightened, but she stayed, partly because she lived by the mantra of her favourite screen heroine, Gone with the Winds Scarlett OHara  Ill think about it tomorrow  and partly because she had fallen in love. She and Bernd Nathan, a head-turningly handsome German-born architect ten years her senior, met in a nightclub in November 1939 and married in May 1940 after a whirlwind romance. Like her, he was a non-practising Jew and they had 18 brief but blissful months together before, in November 1941, Bernd became one of the first among 140,000 internees to be shipped to a newly established ghetto 30 miles outside Prague.

          Terezin was, in reality, a transit camp for Auschwitz and, weeks later, Anka received notification that she was to be sent there, too.

          The old, sick and vulnerable who were crammed into vermin-infested buildings quickly succumbed to the appalling sanitary conditions and starvation rations and either died in Terezin or were moved on to the death camps. But as a young, healthy and strong couple, Anka and Bernd were able to work  he as a carpenter and she in the department responsible for handing out meagre food portions  and so they remained there for three years.

          Men and women were segregated in Terezin but Anka and Bernd found ways to steal intimate moments together, particularly after he was able to build a secret compartment in one of the buildings. In the summer of 1943, Anka discovered she was pregnant. Under the rules of the Third Reich, no Jewish babies were allowed to survive and she was told she would have to give up her child to be killed. In the event, no one came to take her son Dan away after he was born weak and premature in February 1944, but he died two months later of pneumonia.

          In September 1944, as the Allies drew closer, Bernd was placed on a train to Auschwitz before Anka could tell him she was expecting another baby. Three days later, she volunteered to follow him, thinking they would be reunited once more  a decision she later described as the biggest foolishness of my life. She never saw Bernd again.

          At Auschwitz, like so many newly arriving prisoners, she was forced to strip naked, have her head shaved and parade before the notorious Angel of Death Dr Josef Mengele, who asked her if she was with child. She told him Nein  a lie that saved her from being sent to the gas chamber. Ten days later, she was sent to work in a munitions factory in Freiberg, Germany, and for the rest of her pregnancy, as her stomach swelled, her body shrivelled.

          Anka weighed barely five stone when she went into labour moments after arriving at Mauthausen in Austria  her third concentration camp in her four years of captivity. With the Nazis in a race against time to annihilate all Jews before they lost the military campaign, she and hundreds of others had just spent 16 days on a freight train being transported  with barely any food or drink  to what was intended to be their certain death. But as Ankas legs buckled beneath her, the last gassings had already taken place  as the Germans were preparing to flee the advancing Allies. Guards picked her up from the ground and flung her with the sick and dying on to a cart that was directed towards the camp infirmary. Moments later, her waters broke and as Anka screamed, her baby pushed her way out. Eva did not cry for almost ten minutes. Then a Jewish prisoner-doctor appeared, cut the umbilical cord and smacked her bottom to make her breathe. My mother always said nobody has any conception of what they can withstand, says Eva now. But Ive always known that I could never have endured what she did.

          Many of those who suffered the most barbarous atrocities of war emerged too traumatised to talk about their experiences. Remarkably, Anka was not one of them. Students often ask me whether what she went through caused her long-term psychological damage, says Eva. And the truth is no. She had seen death all around her, but she was an eternal optimist and

          On her return to Prague in the summer of 1945, Anka learned that her entire immediate family  whom she had last seen when they were interned with her at Terezin  had perished. Her father died of pneumonia at Auschwitz and her mother, her two sisters, brother and other relatives were gassed. For a while she held out hope that Bernd had survived, until a witness who had seen him being shot by an SS guard a week before the liberation was able to confirm his fate. That news almost broke her, says Eva. But she had me  and I was enough to give her purpose.

          Within three years, Anka had married Karel Bergman, a solid, virtuous, reliable man who she knew would be a good father. Karel, who was 15 years older than his new wife, was Czech but had spent much of the war in Britain working as an interpreter. He adopted Eva and the three of them came to Cardiff as refugees. He took a temporary job in a glove factory and ended up buying and running the business, but he and Anka never had children of their own. My mother offered, but he wanted to live within their means and they had very little money in those early days, Eva explains.

         <font style="font-size:1.2em">
          As a child, Eva knew instinctively never to discuss the war with her adoptive father, who had lost his mother and his twin sister along with the rest of his family to the Nazis and could not bear to talk of his heartache. With her mother, however, the subject was an open book.

          I remember coming home from school one day when I was learning the alphabet  I must have been four or five years old, Eva recalls. And on the back of the kitchen door, my mother had a brown suede shopping bag that someone had made for her in Prague. On it were the initials AN for Anka Nathanova  her name from her first marriage. And I said, Shouldnt it be AB?  and that was when she took a deep breath and first told me about my other daddy. And from then on, she would tell me everything  or as much as she felt I could cope with  throughout my childhood. She talked about my grandparents and aunts, uncles and cousins, and she would describe them so vividly, she made them come alive for me. She often said that telling me early on was a way of allowing her to hold her family close but also to move on and that was the very best thing.

         <font style="font-size:1.2em">
          Occasionally when she reminisced, Anka would become tearful, but more often she retained a remarkable ability to look on the upside. The one word she used time and again was luck. At any moment, she could have died from sickness or been killed, particularly while pregnant with me, but she was blessed with robust health and that, combined with luck, kept her alive. Occasionally, if she read a book or saw a documentary that contained inaccuracies about the Holocaust, Anka would also get angry. Daddy used to say the fact that she was so angry stopped her getting upset, Eva says. And she had little sympathy for those with survivors guilt. That made her very cross. Her attitude was that people should just be grateful that they were alive.

          The circumstances of Evas birth had meant her early development was slow; she didnt walk until she was 22 months old. But she, too, was lucky. By the time she started school, she had caught up and suffered from no more than the usual childhood ailments. Ive only ever had three illnesses in my life, she says. Measles, tonsillitis and chicken pox.

          As a precious only child, Eva had an exceptional bond with her mother, but as a teenager, she put both her parents to the test when she had several dalliances with German boyfriends. Two were holiday romances and a third was with a local boy in the German army who was stationed at Barry Island near where we lived, she recalls. My father made it clear that he would not allow the boy to cross his threshold. And my mother, who all her life would have nothing German in our house, found it hard. But she also said that, in a way, she understood why I would be attracted to German boys, because of course my real father was German. I was the image of him, and she used to say how glad she was that I had his looks but not his character because, although they had been madly in love, the honest truth was that he was a philanderer and she never believed their marriage would have stayed the course had he survived, which shows you just what a realist she was.

          In the end, Eva settled with Malcolm, a Welsh boy whom she had known since she was 14. Both my parents approved of him  my dad emphasised that of all my boyfriends, he was the one that he liked the most. They married in 1968 when Eva was 23, and soon afterwards provided Anka and Karel (who died in 1983) with two grandsons, Tim, now 43, and Nick, 40. During her pregnancies, Anka would ask Eva if she was taking vitamins and eating the right foods, And then she would joke, Pah! You dont need any of those. Just look at you and me. Tim and Nick in turn gave Anka three great-grandchildren  Tims son Theo, five, and Nicks daughters Matilda, seven, and Imogen, also five. If ever you asked my mother to describe herself, she would say, I am an ordinary wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, says Eva. She could have added Holocaust survivor, but she never wanted to be wholly defined in that way.

          Eva worked for many years as an administrator at a local further-education college, before becoming a volunteer speaker for several charities including the Holocaust Educational Trust. Her aim is always to encourage diversity and stamp out prejudice and extremism. I have a unique opening line when I address convicts, she says.

          of the Nazis. Like Anka, they, too, gave birth in captivity  Priska at the Freiberg munitions factory and Rachel on the train that transported them to Mauthausen. The three women never knew each other, but today Eva knows their offspring  Priskas daughter Hana, who lives in Austria, and Rachels son Mark, who lives in Wisconsin. They met first at the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Mauthausen five years ago, and now consider themselves siblings of the heart. Anka met them, too, when they came to the UK in 2011 for a Holocaust commemoration service, and told them they were her surrogate children.

          All three have just celebrated their 70th birthdays. For hers, Eva organised a family outing to London. Ostensibly for the benefit of her three grandchildren, they went to see Matilda The Musical and then ate at the Rainforest Caf  a kids party favourite. When I called to make the booking, I had to explain that the birthday girl was seven-zero, not seven, she says playfully.

          Her one tinge of regret, of course, was that her mother, who for so long appeared to be invincible, was not there to celebrate with her. Her eyes fill with tears as she adds, When we had family gatherings, she would look across the four generations and say, We won. It was a miracle to her that her family had flourished, and it is a miracle to me.

            <img alt="14 July 2015 - Los Angeles - USA  **** STRICTLY NOT AVAILABLE FOR USA ***  Kate Hudson goes Running Wild with Bear Grylls. The actress, 36, kicked off the second season of the show as she joined the British the adventurer, 41, to spend two days hiking in the Italian Dolomites, a rocky mountain range close to the country's border with Austria. Wearing climbing equipment and a backpack, the blonde star first had to rapel out of a tramway car half way up the mountain before trekking through tunnels to get through the mountain. She had to camp outside with Grylls, who first made her try eating ants before cooking a pigeon he had caught in the tunnels - even though Hudson told him after he killed the bird: &quot;Urgh that's disgusting.&quot; Hudson also opened up to Grylls, talking about her career and family and revealing she is open to getting married again as well as saying how she sees Kurt Russell as her dad and has no contact with real dad Bill Hudson. She also made Grylls try some meditation" height="115" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/14/11/2A841EC400000578-0-image-m-34_1436868499462.jpg" width="154"/>
