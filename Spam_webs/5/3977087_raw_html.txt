           It helps them make sense out of life

           Its their best chance to accept Christ

          <strong>
           It helps avoid some negative outcomes of sin
          </strong>
          . Only Gods grace can change our hearts, but knowing the consequences of disobeying God is often a wake up call. When children understand the great price that Jesus paid for their salvation, they are more likely to stay on the way of the righteous.

          <strong>
           It accommodates the unique educational needs of children
          </strong>
          . We all know that children learn differently than adults. Targeted teaching for kids helps accommodate these differences.

          </strong>
          . New research in education points to various types of intellect. Typical childrens ministry curriculum already addresses these different learning needs.

          <strong>
           It allows for age-graded instruction
          </strong>
          . A tried and true way to promote learning is to teach on different maturity levels. Childrens ministry programs (like VBS and Sunday school) have been doing this for years.
          <br/>

         <li>
          <strong>
           It allows children to memorize large portions of scripture
          </strong>
          . A major focus for most childrens ministry programs is Bible memorization. Concentrated efforts in this area while kids are young can yield lifelong benefits.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Challenge kids to learn and retain three verse each month. Review these every week all year long. Use games and drills to make it fun, but dont skip the Bible memorization.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It provides systematic Bible instruction
          </strong>
          . Sunday school publishers charge their lessons according to a defined scope and sequence. This assures that kids get a broad introduction to the Bible and its major teachings.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip

          <strong>
           It allows learning to worship in a group through singing
          </strong>
          . Kids who learn to worship in groups of other children, using simple worship songs, are better prepared to participate in congregational singing.

          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>

         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It allows children to learn how to read scripture in public
          </strong>
          . Having kids read scripture in Sunday school and childrens church, helps them learn to read the Bible aloud.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Make this a regular component of your ministry time.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It helps kids learn to pray aloud in public
          </strong>
          . The same is true for praying in public. This is a much less intimidating process in a small group, such as Sunday school.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>

         <li>
          <strong>
           It provides a context for children to learn how to respect their elders
          </strong>
          . This habit is also best learnt-by-doing. Childrens ministry is an excellent format to teach kids how to interact with and to respect older people.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Invite an older church member to share a testimony about their many years of serving God. Hold up long-term faithfulness as something that should be greatly respected.

           It increases the total amount of instruction time children will get in the Bible
          </strong>
          . Promote biblical literacy by teaching the Bible. Even children who read their Bibles at home will benefit from this extra learning time.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Add a regular Bible reading portion to your ministry time. Even 2 minutes at a time will add up over the years.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It promotes the use of music as a learning tool
          </strong>
          . One of the easiest ways to learn is through music. Most childrens ministry curriculum provide music designed for worship as well as teaching.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Find the best mix of musically quality and content. Dont just settle for contemporary music. When possible, teach the children songs based closely on scripture passages. Give away CDs with these high quality learning songs.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It provides a context for children learn to do peer-to-peer evangelism
          </strong>
          . When kids invite other kids to church, they take the first steps to witnessing to their friends. Childrens ministry helps make that happen by encouraging kids to share Jesus.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Encourage kids to invite friends to church and talk about Jesus in their regular life. Younger kids dont have the same shyness about witnessing as adults. So, help them spread the message.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It provides opportunities to re-teach the Gospel in every developmental stage
          </strong>
          . Often a childs response (or lack of response) to the Gospel is hidden by their immaturity. The best way to overcome this concern is to continue to reinforce the plan of salvation as they mature.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Have a plan to re-teach the Gospel in detail (at least four weeks worth of lessons) at least once each year while a child is in your ministry programs. If they dont understand the way of salvation, then we have failed them.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           It helps maximize spiritual development at every developmental stage
          </strong>
          . The principle is true for their spiritual development after they are converted.
          <br/>
          <em>
            Childrens Ministry Tip
          </em>
          : Watch out for 9-11 year olds. This is a prime time when kids learn to pray long and deep. Celebrate their maturing spiritual capacities and help them become consistent in daily private worship times.
