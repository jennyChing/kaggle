  <h1>
   Inventing a New Kind of Pencil
  </h1>
  <p>
   So you want to do some inventing? Well then, ask a student
in your class to volunteer showing a pencil to the class that
needs improving? For example, a pencil like this:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img align="MIDDLE" alt="image of an ugly pencil" height="15" ismap="" naturalsizeflag="3" src="ugly.JPG" width="186"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Then ask the following question:
  </p>
  <h2>
   What's wrong with this pencil?
  </h2>
  <p>
   Here are some typical replies:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    small
   </li>
   <li>
    ugly
   </li>
   <li>
    no eraser
   </li>
   <li>
    needs sharpening
   </li>
   <li>
    made out of wood
   </li>
   <li>
    can't see inside and how it works
   </li>
   <li>
    can't write on chalkboard
   </li>
   <li>
    not made of steel
   </li>
   <li>
    goes down too fast
   </li>
   <li>
    lead always breaks
   </li>
   <li>
    can't eat it
   </li>
   <li>
    easy to lose
   </li>
   <li>
    not interesting
   </li>
   <li>
    not decorated
   </li>
   <li>
    too skinny
   </li>
   <li>
    too fat
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Don't forget to say some of those
   <a href="http://www.noogenesis.com/malama/encouraging_words.html">
    encouraging
words
   </a>
   . And remember, be non-judgmental, do not allow any criticism,
and quickly jot the ideas on the board. Then ask "How can
we improve this pencil?" What new features can we add to
make it more useful. Here are some more ideas.
  </p>
  <h2>
   Kids Inventions!
  </h2>
  <ul>
   <li>
    put an eraser on
   </li>
   <li>
    make the eraser bigger
   </li>
   <li>
    change the color
   </li>
   <li>
    make it longer
   </li>
   <li>
    get a new one
   </li>
   <li>
    make it fatter
   </li>
   <li>
    make it skinnier
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   After getting half a dozen or so more idea, I dig into my box
of pencils and pull out one to fix one of the above mentioned
problems. Usually someone notices the lack of an eraser, so I
like to show a pencil that has two erasers on the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img align="MIDDLE" alt="image of a pencil with two erasers" height="66" ismap="" naturalsizeflag="3" src="hammer.JPG" width="300"/>
   <br/>
   Invariably someone blurts out that it looks like a hammer. Yes,
perhaps you might find one like this in your doctor's office!
Then I go around the room testing some student's knee reflex,
and imitate writing down on a clipboard. "Yup, your reflexes
are fine!"
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    hammer
   </li>
   <li>
    doctor's hammer
   </li>
   <li>
    screw driver
   </li>
   <li>
    cork screw
   </li>
   <li>
    can opener
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Again, I look into my box of pencils, and find another one
to fix to either the same problem, or a different one. For example,
I show how to add an eraser, using those arrowhead shaped erasers.
I also have a pencil I made with a sharpenable eraser on the end
that I like to show. I pass these various examples around.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At this point, I may point out the pencil/pen attached to my shirt.
It has a small string attached to it, and a small clip on the
end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img align="MIDDLE" alt="image of a pencil with a leash: image not available" height="58" ismap="" naturalsizeflag="3" src="leash.JPG" width="136"/>
   <br/>
   I show this to the class, and describe how it was made. I drilled
a hole on one end into which I screwed a small eyescrew, used
for example to hang a picture up. A string is threaded through
and on the other end is attached a clip retrieved from an old
handbag. In my pen example, I even drilled a hole in the cap,
so I don't lose the cap. I demonstrate its utility by doing some
imaginary signing of a room pass, and forgetting to put my pen
away, and when I walk away, the pen follows me. My students and
most adults seem to be fascinated by this invention.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Maybe even this pen can be marketed today! The only pen I found
with similar capabilities, purchased at my local drugstore, has
the string attached only to the cap. You can still lose the pen,
so my invention is an improvement.
   <br/>
   Usually, the students are clamoring to see more of what is in
my box of pencils, and so show them some of these:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Shell pencil
   </li>
   <li>
    magnifier pencil
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   <img align="MIDDLE" alt="image of a pencil with a built in magnifying glass" height="32" ismap="" naturalsizeflag="3" src="magnifier.JPG" width="360"/>
   <br/>
   Invariably, they ask me how these are made. For example, the lens
for this pencil was retrieved from a broken camera that someone
gave me. He dropped it into the ocean, and it could not be fixed.
So I've made use of the various parts. One lens is in this pencil,
another lens in front of the photocell is in front on another
invention of mine, a light sensor for the blind. Etc.
  </p>
  <h3>
   One of my first inventions!
  </h3>
  <p>
   I invented this in 7th grade. It is not a pencil, but a "minimalist"
pen. It consists simply of a pen refill with a paper clip stuck
in one end, which serves as the pen clip. Unfortunately my English
teacher saw me fooling around with it too much, laughed at it
and then took it away. I tell my students this discouraging story,
how I felt, and that I would never laugh at their inventions like
this teacher did.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img align="MIDDLE" alt="image of a pen refill with paperclip stuck in one end" height="33" ismap="" naturalsizeflag="3" src="pen.JPG" width="204"/>
   <br/>
   I then ask "Could you have invented these? What ideas do
you have for a new pencil. Often, the younger the student, the
more creative they are, because the lack of the ability to judge,
is the basis of creativity! Here are some more ideas I've gotten
from my students:

   <br/>
   <br/>
   Enough ideas for you?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Well, now is the time for getting the class to do improve their
critical thinking skills. For example, ask the class:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Which pencils could be invented with simple tools and easily
  obtained items.
   </li>
   <li>
    Which items could be manufactured most easily?
   </li>
   <li>
    How much can such a pencil be sold?
   </li>
   <li>
    Does the class want to form a small business manufacturing
  and selling pencils, or any other items?
   </li>
   <li>
    What kinds of activities are involved?
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   The process of inventing is going back and forth between the
two thinking states: creative/non-judgmental versus critical/judgmental.
