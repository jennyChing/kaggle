            <em>
             Whiplash

            Tootie Heath says that in the
            <em>
             really
            </em>
            old tradition, when a musician sits down to play a concert, it is very important for the musician not to have worked on music yet that day. The player's mind should be fresh, and they should ask the ancestors for permission to create. Everyone in the circle should be on the same fresh page, ready to respond not just to all the other musicians in the circle but also the primordial reason to play music.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a devotional attitude, an African attitude.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Most of the rhythms that power American music come from Africa. They were brought here on the slave ships. In shorthand form, all this music loved by so many created in the New Land is a mix of European harmony and African rhythm. (There are melodic contours that are African and rhythm technology that is European but that's the basic mix. Also, Cuba, the rest of Latin America, and everything else that Jelly Roll Morton called "the Spanish tinge" is crucial, although there are also arguments that Africa was still the source of all those different rhythms.)
           </p>
           <p>
            ---
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the reasons that African rhythm is so compelling is its devotional attitude. It seeks ecstasy through communion, not just with God but with every one in the immediate vicinity. You don't practice it. You plug into the ancestors and your reason for living and it's there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Intimacy and devotion exists in European music as well - J.S. Bach inscribed even small exercises "to the glory of God" - but what society usually views as the highest aspiration of that form is the symphonic concert or grand opera. Many of my own favorite pieces are piano concertos, which celebrate a virtuoso soloist on a high platform almost equal to the composer.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no high platform like that in classical African music. Not that there aren't drum or vocal virtuosos, of course, but devotion and interconnectedness comes first.
           </p>
           <p>
            ---
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't need to be in Africa to get that interconnected feeling. Any time everybody in the room is on the same page you can get it. Surely that feeling mush exist in all cultures in different ways at different times. However, the African version was especially crucial for American music.
           </p>

           <p>
            Early jazz had the impact it had because of the feeling. Duke Ellington explained it best in his autobiography, talking about a club in 1920's Harlem:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Sonny Greer and I were real tight buddies and, naturally, night creatures. Our first night out in New York we got all dressed up and went down to the Capitol Palace...
            </p>
            <p>
             My first impression of The Lion - even before I saw him - was the thing I felt as I walked down those steps. A strange thing. A square-type fellow might say, This joint is jumping, but to those who become acclimatized - the tempo was the lope - actually everything and everybody seemed to be doing whatever they were doing in the tempo The Lions group was laying down. The walls and furniture seemed to lean understandingly - one of the strangest and greatest sensations I ever had. The waiters served in that tempo; everybody who had to walk in, out, or around the place walked with a beat.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Sonny Greer in this excerpt is Duke's drummer. He played the drum set on all of Duke's most famous early records.

            A drum set. What is a drum set?
           </p>
           <p>
            A drum set is a version of an African drum choir reduced and streamlined so that a single musician can provide that devotional feel for a larger ensemble.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the greatest American drummers specialize in "feel." I am not an expert in this topic, but as a big jazz fan, I know that "feel" is what makes the music go.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most great jazz needs a great drummer.
           </p>
           <p>
            ---
           </p>
           <p>
            Not all grooving music needs a drummer for "feel." The classic instrumental quintets of American Bluegrass and Argentinian Tango seem to do better if a drummer stays well away.
           </p>
           <p>
            But for most jazz, there's a drummer present.

            A lot rides on the drummer because they are often the only one connecting all the rhythmic dots. That can be a lonely position. While fiction, a bit from a disgruntled teenager in
            <em>
             Up for It: A Tale of the Underground
            </em>
            by L. F. Haines (collected in
            <em>
             Best African American Fiction 2010
            </em>
            ) will certainly get a nod of rueful recognition from any professional drummer:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             It was something to drive a band, more than a notion, let me tell you. And understand this, pilgrims: Drummers are damn important to a band. I dont care what youve heard otherwise. If they dont get the rhythm right, they throw the whole band off and nobody can play right. Being a little bit slow on the beat or rushing the tempo can mess up things real bad because a band is a delicate thing, like a clock or a race car or something, and youve got to have good coordination. We drummers do more than keep time but keeping time well is very important. And we get tired of hearing people say we play too loud. If the other retards in any given band would learn something about harmony and dynamics, then we wouldnt need to play so damn loud. Were not trying to overshadow the band; were trying to make sure the damn band can hear us and know where the damn beat is. But dont get me started. Drummers get no respect!
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Of course, Haines is not talking about immortal jazz groups led by, say, Miles Davis or John Coltrane: In those bands,
            <em>
             everyone
            </em>
            is connecting the rhythmic dots, that's part of what makes that music so great.

            At the top of the page there are pictures of Tony Williams and Elvin Jones. They are two of the drummers associated with Miles Davis and John Coltrane. They are total devotional players. With Tony and Elvin, feel is the most important thing. It is impossible for me to imagine them picking up a stick without swinging.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony and Elvin are famous for playing a lot of virtuosic and innovative drums as well. Part of this was their natural inclination, but part of it was coming to prominence with Miles or Trane in groups of overall rhythmic excellence. Their aggressive and unusual permutations were part of a bigger circle of devotional music, where all members in the circle were innovative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony and Elvin were great drum soloists, but I don't think any of their fans would play a drum solo of either to prove they were great. A fan would play Tony or Elvin while the band was all improvising together.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drum solos are like a piano concerto: a platform for the celebration of one. With all their chops and innovative ideas, Tony and Elvin seldom stopped and got on that platform for too long. They take unaccompanied star turns, sure, but soon enough the band will come back in and the devotional circle will recommence.

            The other drummer in the photos above is Buddy Rich.
           </p>
           <p>
            Buddy Rich is the biggest inspiration for the young drummer portrayed in
            <em>
             Whiplash
            </em>
            , and score composer Justin Hurwitz explicitly cites Rich in an interview in
            <a href="http://www.thecredits.org/2014/09/whiplash-composer-justin-hurwitz-settles-the-score/" target="_self">
             The Credits
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hurwitz said one of the things hes most proud of is an overture which plays twice in the film, tentatively at first, much like Andrew is at the time, then boisterously and bombastically at the end. Andrew is walking through New York in the second scene, and theres an abridged movement that plays. Then at the end credits, the full four minute version of that song plays. I modeled it after the Buddy Rich big band style, its very, very fast, complicated and dense big band music, the band is just flying around playing, interweaving lines."

            Buddy Rich had a long career. A total natural, Rich was a monstrously talented drummer from extremely young.
           </p>
           <p>
            His speciality was chops. His hands. Rudiments, rolls, cadences: the stock-in-trade of military snare drums, going back hundreds of years to Europe and other places.
           </p>
           <p>
            How fast and flashy were Buddy Rich's hands? For many, they were the fastest and flashiest ever.

            Why are fast and flashy hands important in a jazz drummer? The short answer: they aren't.

           <p>
            has very little to do with the drummer'sfast and flashy hands. It has much more to do with the drummer's devotion and feel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the most-loved jazz drummers by the cognoscentihad hands only fast enough to go to church every time they sat behind the kit.
           </p>

            Some of those giants would barely eventake a solo.

            A story about Mel Lewis: Mel hated giving lessons, but finally a kid talked him into letting him come by a record session and watch Mel at work. During a break Mel gestured for the kid to sit behind the kit, and said, "Play me a snare roll."
           </p>
           <p>
            The kid played a good, professional roll. Maybe not as good as the one that starts the movie
            <em>
             Whiplash
            </em>
            , but still, a good roll. Not easy to do.
           </p>

            Mel took his sticks back and said, "See, right there is your problem. You shouldn't be able to do that.
            <em>

            That's a fun story, but truthfully drummers do need to learn how to roll. Mel himself surely learned to roll at some early point.
           </p>

            However the point is clear. At least for Mel Lewis, devotion has precedence over chops.

            Mel Lewis was a white big band drummer. He made a point to play in a style that de-emphasized chops. This is not the way most historically important white big band drummers play.

            Gene Krupa was the first star big-band drummer. He stopped Benny Goodman's band and took fancy solos. It really became like a European piano concerto at this point, where a full assortment of back-up band waited around while the featured soloist worked up to a frenzy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Krupa's most famous performance is "Sing, Sing, Sing" with Goodman at Carnegie Hall. It's great, and I particularly admire Jess Stacy's surreal and romantic piano solo. Talk about Europe meets drums!

            Buddy Rich was Krupa's disciple, and soon surpassed Krupa in drum antics and theatrics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later in life, Rich would cram everything he could into every corner while his big band was roaring along. The classic Rich "concerto" was a medley of
            <em>
             West Side Story
            </em>
            themes where Rich would play almost as much during the band parts as during the solos.
           </p>
           <p>
            This hyperactivity is why some consider him the
            <em>
             greatest
            </em>
            drummer. In countless polls for decades, Rich places at the top. At this point, not in the jazz polls. But in the rock or general interest polls, Buddy is still top dog.

            of (supposedly) "thousands of thousands" weighing in on "The Greatest Drummer in History" has Buddy Rich in the final tabulation alongside various rock greats. Rich is the only jazz drummer these people know, apparently.
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost certainly, all those people who would claim that Rich is the greatest ever would offer up one of his solos, not his devotional position within a group.

            is rather retrograde in suggesting that the fancy drum solo is a centerpiece of American entertainment connected to jazz. That era was the 40's and 50's.

            I like the term "stage band drumming." Not sure if that's totally accurate, but I'm going to use it here anyway. "Stage band" suggests a big band in a floor show Las Vegas, playing for burlesque, crooners, dinner, dancing, and the occasional hot instrumental capped by drum fireworks and a final blaring "Ta-dah!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Johnny Carson had a stage band, the Doc Severinsen organization with Ed Shaughnessyon drums. Carson loved drums andShaughnessy had quite a few solo features over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, Dave Letterman also loves drums and fairly recently had "drum solo week" on his show. Neil Peart took a solo that included pre-programmed "swing" big-band hits from his massive rig of pads, computers, and a few hundred drums. Clearly Peart knows his stage band history.

            Right, rock drums. Rock drum solos! Everyone leaves the stage while the drummer goes animal for 15 minutes!
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep, straight out of stage band. And straight out of Buddy Rich, whose solos are usually namechecked by all the rock drummers when discussing their own epic solo moments.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems to help to have a lot of drums, cymbals, and other ways to make cascades of sound for this style. Many drummers more interested in interconnectedness use a minimal amount of gear.

            Generally, the great black jazz drummers are not in the stage band tradition. Not to say there weren't any good ones!But great black jazz has always been more about getting the feel right then fast and fancy hands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, respect must be given: Chick Webb was an important innovator of flashy big band drumming and apparently an influence on Krupa, but he also died very young. Sid Catlett also died too young, but not before taking one of the firstrecorded long drum solos on "Mop Mop" with Louis Armstrong at Symphony Hall in 1947. (I have heard that Jack DeJohnette can play this iconic solo complete.)

            Max Roach is usually considered the premier modern jazz drum soloist. On "Ko-Ko" with Charlie Parker, Roach's solo statement answers Bird in a way essential for the projection of bebop's uptempo emotional message.
           </p>
           <p>
            Roach would also record what were among the very first drum solo compositions on
            <em>
             Drums Unlimited.
            </em>
            However, the title track, "The Drum Also Waltzes" and "Big Sid" are more showcases for feel, composition, and bebop language than fancy theatrics (not that Roach doesn't have amazing chops).

            , the track "Figure Eights" offers uptempo trades. Buddy certainly seems louder and more precise, although the drum tuning and recording levels may have something to do with it as well. No one's snare drum sounds more like a machine gun than Buddy Rich's snare drum.

            The most popular black bandleaders Duke Ellington and Count Basie had some of the great black big band drummers. Basie's first, Jo Jones, helped define what swing was for all jazz for all time.

             Tootie has an amusing story
            </a>
            about Jones's relationship to Rich (who adored Jones):"I saw Jo Jones sub for Buddy Rich once in Buddys big band. When Jo came in, the first thing he did was ask the whole trumpet section to put mutes in. Then he played the whole gig on brushes!"
           </p>
           <p>
            That's one way to get the band to listen up to the drummer's beat: have the band play softer.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've written about Sonny Greer extensively already in my post on Ellington,

            He was great but not well-loved by those whose ideal was Buddy Rich.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, while Basie's postwar band book became more flashy, with the drummer required to set up hits all the time, Ellington almost always had someone like Sam Woodyard, someone who functioned more independently of the orchestra.

            When the crowd-pleasing drum solo became popular, both Ellington and Basie offered interesting solutions.Ellington got a white cat, Louis Bellson, and in 1952 tracked a piece of immortal fancy drums in one of the best acoustics ever gotten for drums on tape. Duke gave Bellson full compositional credit but I wonder who came up with the name: "Skin Deep."
           </p>
           <p>
            In the later 50s's Basie gave his black drummer Sonny Payne a solo feature. Panye's choice of repertoire also has an interesting title: "Ol' Man River." Payne would actually play the Kern tune (a protest against slavery written for Paul Robeson) on his toms.

            Krupa, Rich, Bellson,Shaughnessy: those are probably the most famous stage band drummers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bellson fared best with thecognoscenti, partly because he always said publicly that Duke Ellington was his career highlight and married a black woman, the major talent Pearl Bailey. The first time I saw Bellson play he was late in life yet onstage at Newport with Dizzy Gillespie, Ron Carter, and other major black figures.
           </p>
           <p>
            Krupa, Rich, andShaughnessy, all great drummers, all followed similar career tracks. In the beginning they were in with thecognoscenti and made records with significant black jazz musicians. Devotion was unquestionably present. But, as they become general-interest stars, they seemed to be mostly connected to the white world of money and power.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure they could all still swing, but it was really the flashy hands, not the devotion, that got them that career track.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bellson has more credibility. Mel Lewis has much credibility. And going further back, the white cat who was the delightful alternative to Krupa was Dave Tough, the quiet and devotional drummer for Woody Herman, the 40's white band that proudly proclaimed they could play the blues.

            Playing the blues began as a black thing, but soon enough it pervaded all of American music.
           </p>
           <p>
            The great musical big band love of WW II white America was Glenn Miller, whose group played the most sanitized swing and blues imaginable. I nominate Moe Purtill's fills in "Tuxedo Junction" (1940) as the least swinging drum fills ever heard on a popular jazz record.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miller's performance style wasnt that hip, but its still good enough to dance to. Im sure plenty of black couples have cut a rug to Glenn Miller over the years.

            In the next decade, some white big band music took a sharp turn into the undanceable with Stan Kenton, whose noisy music of the future repertoire gets a fairly bad rap among the cognoscenti today. Truthfully there are Kenton performances that are important works of jazz.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kentons band was also deeply connected to the birth of jazz education. North Texas State University was key, where there was some kind of military attention to ranking and lock-step detail that is the true father of the school system depicted in

            For years, at least since Kenton and Leon Breeden got repute for Lab music from Denton, Texas, there has been a symbiosis between bands, schools, gear, and jazz magazines.

            Kentons best music leads straight into futuristic late 60s and 70's white big band leader Don Ellis, famous for odd-meters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ellis was hipper than Kenton, probably, and I dont ever mind hearing some of his music, especially that early small group stuff with Jaki Byard or Paul Bley. The odd-meter big band material certainly has its place as well.

            The Black alternative to modernist jazz big band Kenton, North Texas State "Lab," and Ellis was the Sun Ra Arkestra, who combined the old-time swing religion of Fletcher Henderson with the weirdest shit imaginable in a group that was so devotional that they essentially lived their whole lives together.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Kenton, "Lab," and Ellis recede from historical view, Sun Ra just keeps seeming more important. This is only correct.

            The 1973 chart Whiplash in 7/4 meter was written for Ellis by Hank Levy. It's a flowing and cinematic piece, and while no modern jazz professional would think it is a particularly advanced treatment of odd-meter in 2015, back then it was still innovative to sound this relaxed in seven. Kudos to the drummer on "Whiplash," Ralph Humphrey, who also played with the other leader of that era's odd meters, Frank Zappa.
           </p>
           <p>
            In general Ellis's version is better than the movie cover, although, to be fair, the uptight soundtrack version then does sounds like student band. (So, better for the movie, maybe?)

            When I was a (terrible) drummer in my own high school jazz band, the ultimate challenge was Elliss The Last Tangle of Lord Boogie. I cant remember the meter: 13/8? Anyway, nobody could play it. Horace Silvers Filthy McNasty was much easier.
           </p>
           <p>
            Except, of course, now I know the devotional shuffle of Filthy McNasty is much harder than farting around in 13/8 for The Last Tangle of Lord Boogie. Too bad I didn't have a mentor to explain that to me.

            Odd-meters are easy to teach and a good way to improve reading and rhythmic awareness. That's one reason odd-meters are favorites of school bands.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, there's also plenty of wonderful and essential music that requires odd-meter.
           </p>
           <p>
            The relationship of devotional groove and odd-meter is hard to parse. Most jazz drummers appropriate some Afro-Cuban, and the music of virtuosos like Los Muequitos de Matanzashas some of the oddest phrases ever I've heard. However, those odd groupings are within an even folkloric framework. In jazz, a hint of those kinds of odd groupings is part of how swing is generated. See especially Elvin Jones and Art Blakey.

            Stravinsky's
            <em>
             The Rite of Spring
            </em>
            is sometimes cited as the first work proposing odd-meter vamps. This is exciting rhythm, but it's not folkloric. It's a composer seeking something new.
           </p>
           <p>
            Devotional odd-meter certainly exists, though, especially when you add in the classical drum music of other cultures, perhaps especially the rich traditions of India. In Africa, certain Pygmy music is in odd-meter.

            Max Roach was reputedly furious that Joe Morello got the first 5/4 drum solo on record with the Paul Desmond/Dave Brubeck "Take Five" (1959), as he claimed to have done it first but that the studio wouldn't put it out. (In 1956, Max did record a wild arrangement of "Love is a Many-Splendored Thing" with a few bars of five, before Morello.)

            (1966), "Nommo" was in 7/4. Unlike the cheerful "Take Five" and "Unsquare Dance" titles of the Brubeck/Morello crew, Jymie Merritt'stitle refers the mythological ancestral spirits of Mali. They wanted the cognoscenti to know right away that this band was still devotional while taking it odd!

            At first glance it was hard to for me to see how to apply the reparations concept to jazz. History is the ultimate judge of artistic merit, and history has generally taken care of imbalances in the long view of jazz reception.

           <p>
            Usually, from where I sit at this moment, among the people I know and trust, things are in their proper place. Benny Goodman isnt considered greater than Duke Ellington; Dave Brubeck isnt considered greater than Thelonious Monk. Not that Goodman or Brubeck werent valuable musicians, but, cmon.

            scandal offers a plausible starting point for jazz reparations. From the same interview with film's composer Justin Hurwitz:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hurwitz plays the piano, yet his education was mostly classical without much of a jazz background. Its a huge regret looking back because its just such a different language, and its a little like spoken languages where the younger you are the easier and better you soak up the rules and syntax of all of it. Yet Hurwitz has gotten an intensive jazz program working on Chazelles last two films. Damien put me on a steady diet of jazz, both American and French music scores, he says. Basically I had an independent study with Damien the last couple of years of college. Now I use more jazz idioms today than I learned in musical theory class.

            Miles Teller may play a bit of drums, and just maybe Teller makes some of the sounds heard in the movie, but in general Teller is not the drummer on the soundtrack. I've listened to the soundtrack carefully and have concluded that the unknown drummer or drummers are actually the most experienced musicians in the band.
           </p>
           <p>
            Presumably the soundtrack drummer was placed under a gag order in order to help give the impression that Teller is actually drumming. It's too bad, because this is a real opportunity to get some gigs!

            If there is one thing certain in this world, it is that criticizing hip-hop brings intense criticism right back.

They are different things, with a different relationship to the culture.

            A familiar jazz story about Elvin Jones is how Elvin came to New York to audition for Benny Goodman: At the audition he had to play "Sing, Sing, Sing," a song Elvin didn't like, and Elvin didn't get the gig.
           </p>
           <p>
            Elvin told that story himself. As with many anecdotes related by the black jazz masters, there are subtleties encoded for thecognoscenti.
           </p>
           <p>
            While working on this post I discovered a
            <a href="http://www.smithsonianjazz.org/documents/oral_histories/Elvin_Jones_Interview_Transcription.pdf" target="_self">
             long interview with Elvin from 2003
            </a>
            . It's exceptionally valuable. While in the military, he wrote the snare cadences, but when they marched, he played a different instrument.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I played the bass drum because nobody had the will to do it. I was the one that said, I dont mind playing the bass drum, because I like to listen to the cadence and the bass drum is essential to the cadence. If you dont hear that the cadence isnt being played right and you loose the time, and everyone gets frustrated. So its important.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Being able to write the cadence yet prefer to play the bass drum seems like an ideal perspective for a devotional drummer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Elvin also mentions Buddy Rich (in a positive light) a few times in this interview.

            . That's a worthy topic. But those homophobic rants clearly belong to the genre of locker room talk.

           <blockquote>
            <p>

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Huh? It seems like Lowder googled, "jazz homophobia" and came up with two recent articles by Francis Davis and James Gavin. These pieces (by critics I have questioned on DTM before:

           <p>
            I directly challenge

           </p>
           <p>
            My own impression is that classic mid-century black jazz musicians were more forgiving of homosexuality than society overall. This only makes sense, as that community was comprised of outcasts already. I'll supply a list of great gay black jazz musicians if Lowder needs one, as well as plenty of spicy hearsay.

            When I see those impeccably turned out devotional black masters posing with the sweating white athlete, my hackles begin to rise. It's not just the drumming, it's the whole relationship they were afforded to their work in the 20th century.

             Hi Ethan,
            </p>
            <p>
             This whole
             <em>
              Whiplash
             </em>
             thing has brought back a lot of memories!
            </p>
            <p>
             Hank Levy was a very inspiring, gentle guy, so very much different than the guy in the movie. He was very well known in jazz ed circles in the 70's &amp; 80's through his association with Stan Kenton &amp; Don Ellis, but not much of a self-promoter, so a lot of the things he was into just sort of disappeared.
            </p>
            <p>
             I studied composition with Hank at Towson State from '90-'94, and played in the band there the whole time. We played only his charts (which we all loved). Many were the odd-meter charts he wrote for Ellis and Kenton - which is what he's known for almost exclusively - but he also had tons of quite innovative arrangements of standards which are practically unknown.
            </p>
            <p>
             Quite a bit of the rock-oriented stuff those bands were doing (including Buddy, Kenton, Ellis, as well as Woody Herman, et al) were at the very strong suggestion of their management and record labels. Don Ellis's
             <em>
              Connection
             </em>
             album, for instance, was really a scandal among the arrangers who all felt strong-armed into doing assigned pop charts. For a time, they also thought odd meters were the way everything was going to go, so Buddy's management thought he should get some of that. So some calls were made, and Hank was asked to write something for Buddy's band.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hank came up with a chart in 7/4 called "Ven-Zu-Wailin", an Afro-Cuban kind of tune, and sent it out to LA. The story goes that Buddy didn't really read charts. When a new arrangement came along, Buddy hired a session drummer to read down the chart in rehearsal with the band while he listened, then he would take over and he'd have it memorized (so the story goes).
            </p>
            <p>
             Apparently this time (late 60's), the session drummer couldn't really get the feel, and the figures and set-ups were all over the place, and it just wasn't working. The record company guys were there (guess they wanted to record soon), and Buddy tries to play it anyway, and he doesn't get the feel either. So in a rage, he grabs the chart off the stand and flings it across the room and lets it be known what he thinks about odd meters (your imagination can fill in the blanks there).
            </p>
            <p>
             So whenever I showed up for lessons with Hank, I would see the framed letter up on the wall of his office on Pacific Jazz letterhead, saying we're so sorry, but "Ven-Zu-Wailin" was "a little too different" for Buddy and the band, and they were returning the chart, we hope you find a good home for it, sincerest apologies, etc. And this crumpled-up chart came in the package with it. Hank LOVED that story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Too bad, cause that probably would have sounded great. Hank later re-wrote in 4/4 and we recorded it - it was a burning chart.
            </p>
            <p>
             We did play "Whiplash" all the time with Hank. It was one of the best-recorded charts of his, and Ralph Humphrey had a lot to do with that, but Ellis's band in general was much better on Hank's tunes than the Kenton band, which was frankly terrible (except when Peter Erskine was in the band). I haven't seen the movie to know if they played it, but the back half of that chart is written in 14/8, because the subdivision is 223322 - a really nice-feeling pattern that Hank said explicitly came from Bulgarian music, and which he used fairly often. Those different subdivisions of the asymmetrical meters are what has been lost lately outside of world music stuff, but Hank and Ellis were very interested in that. A lot of their most interesting experiments in that were never recorded, but we did some of those things - big band charts with 2 drum sets playing in different subdivisions at the same time, for instance.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also played a lot of straight-ahead swinging in 5, 7, and other asymmetrical meters. Not 5/4 as in the "waltz+2" feel of "Take Five," but just 5-on-the-floor swinging. Hank's "Chain Reaction" for Ellis has a blistering straight-ahead 13 section for pianist Milcho Leviev to blow over (not long enough, but enough to prove that it can be done, and done well). He also had a few things that were overt homages to the Basie style, but in 5/4. I don't hear much of that kind of thing lately, though in some quarters odd meters are otherwise ubiquitous.
            </p>
            <p>
             In regards to the substance of your post, it would be an interesting comparison to look at the elaborate "drum routines" of the Don Ellis band, which were virtuosic for sure, vs the vaudeville-like solos of Rich. Personally I find Rich's solos repetitive and hackneyed at best, and a true annoyance at worst. On the
             <em>
              Roar of '74
             </em>
             album, which is a fantastic band playing really great arrangements, he basically plays a drum solo throughout every every tune, even where the charts have space to breathe built in - he just bashes right through. And then plays another solo at the end. If you ever want to see Bill Holman roll his eyes and shake his head ruefully, ask him about the charts he sent Buddy, and how they turned out on the record.
            </p>
            <p>
             The genius of Mel Lewis is the perfect antidote to Rich-ophilia.

             Just wanted to address the part about "black intelligentsia not being interested"
            </p>
            <p>
             For one, I think we have to remember there was a time when blacks couldn't use the same entrance to clubs as whites
            </p>
            <p>
             If a club told me I had to use a separate entrance, I still wouldn't want to go to that club once things changed.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also have to remember that there used to be clubs in black communities (like Harlem) that blacks went to &amp; even owned
            </p>
            <p>
             Of many things that have changed, It's very clear that there aren't many "jazz" clubs in black communities any more.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also have to consider education. I never learned about "jazz" or anything that had to do with my culture in grade school.
            </p>
            <p>
             Luckily I had a mother that was into this music &amp; exposed me to it &amp; other styles of music at a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
             In school, the learned about Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart.
            </p>
            <p>
             I love Bach, but looking back, I wonder why I wasn't taught about Bird, Ellington, &amp; other American musicians in school.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was a music ed. major at Berklee. When I went to do my student teaching I noticed the urban schools had no music classes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, the suburban schools were learning all about Ellington, Monk, Armstrong and other American musicians/composers
            </p>
            <p>
             Almost of of the suburban schools I visited didn't have many if any black students. The urban schools were all black.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can't say this is exactly why "many in the black intelligentsia aren't interested" in jazz, but I think it's beyond a start.
