           The Fiction Faction
          </h2>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Have you ever noticed that when youre reading, the power of your imagination is so intense that it has the ability to recall and replicate certain sensations as theyre described in the book?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           For example, read about the taste of an apple and your body begins to trick itself into tasting an apple. But what happens when books describe something that the body has never experienced before? Something like a brand new colour?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Chances are youve never heard of the fourth primary colour Squant, the dark saturated red Sangoire or even the shade of blue called Hooloovoo. But youd be forgiven for such ignorance as these colours only exist in fictional film or literature and the imaginations of its audience. A more infamous example is probably Terry Pratchetts Octarine from his
           <em>
            Discworld
           </em>
           series. In the books, Octarine is the eighth colour of the spectrum, is the colour of magic, and is described as being a greenish yellow-purple colour in other words, impossible to replicate in the real world. Or is it?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Making up names and describing colours that dont exist isnt such a wild idea. Colour is, after all, a spectrum of perception and there is an enormous variety of shades and hues that the naked human eye cannot perceive. Humans, along with some other primates, are normally trichromatic meaning they have three cone cells in their eyes that are used to pick up colour (red, blue, green). These three cone cells allow us to detect roughly one million hues although on average woman can see up to 50 shades more than the average male. It also doesnt help that more men than women suffer from some form of colour blindness which probably explains why a lot of men need help choosing the right tie each morning.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Recently, however, colour vision researcher Dr Gabriel Jordan in the UK discovered the existence of what she called a tetrachromat  someone who has four cone cells in their eyes. This one additional cone cell means that the owner, a woman, can see 99 million additional colours not visible to the average person. Some of which could potentially be considered a shade of Octarine or Squant?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Discoveries in colour perception such as this, and similarly other cognitive and visual peculiarities such as Colour Blindness, Synesthesia or Tetrachromacy teach us that colour is never black and white, and cannot be viewed with standardised measures. Unlike humans many animals including some species of spiders, most marsupials, birds, reptiles, and many species of fish, enviably perceive a much wider range of colours.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           When Douglas Adams, author of the
           <em>
            The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
           </em>
           series speaks of a super intelligent shade of blue he names Hooloovoo, or Reese from
           <em>
            Malcolm in the Middle
           </em>
           mixes blue and yellow to create Blellow, naturally we laugh. But as the world is rich in biodiversity with species yet to be discovered, is it not too much to ask that the colour spectrum is only limited by ourselves and our understanding?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Next time you are flicking through a science fiction novel, scanning the net or watching some fantastic film that makes reference to an absurd colour, that sight has not seen nor ear heard, pause for a moment and wonder if this colour is science fact, waiting to be proven.

          </h2>
          <p>
           Thomas Edison, the man who had his very own light bulb moment in 1880, wrote down a string of valuable words many refer to today when in need of motivation  genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.
          </p>
          <p>
           But its that elusive one percent we are concerned with today. Where do people, and in particular creatives, find that fresh idea, the famed moment when all the pieces seem to fall into place? The inspiration that pushes your project out of your head and into the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
           What we have discovered, through practice and discussions with creative peers, is that there are many ways to become inspired. These are a few tried and trusted ways we continually use to enrich our creative dry spells.
          </p>
          <h2>
           1. The Kids are All Right
          </h2>
          <p>
           When we are young our formative years are an endless stream of wonder and curiosity as we explore and experience things for the first time. We know nothing of the big, wide world out there but with dogged determination we discover the who, what, when, where and why.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then we grow up. And sometimes we forget how to be courageous, dream big and continue the learning process. Our boundlessness now has boundaries, sometimes they are imposed on us by society, or we set personal ones as we fall toward adulthood. Not all boundaries are bad of course, some are healthy such as a refusal to break the law.
          </p>
          <p>
           We cannot change, Benjamin Button style, reversing the ageing process. But we can adopt simple tricks of the childhood trade. Survival skills youve learned  to use your imagination  but perhaps set aside. Albert Einstein once said Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world
          </p>
          <h2>
           2. Better Living Through Chemistry
          </h2>
          <p>
           No, were not advocating a drug dependant lifestyle here. Instead we see the value in the natural highs and (s)lows that organic compounds can provide  such as a morning coffee to stimulate not just the body but also the mind, or a glass of wine at night to free yourself from the tension of the day and allow the ideas to flow.
          </p>
          <p>
           Coffee  that dark, rich elixir that even has its own culture  not content simply to be the first thing on our minds when we awake, comes equipped with proven health benefits. We all know it can improve our mental acuity, in addition this super drink can assist you to be socially adroit, enhance your mood and give you the ability to brainstorm your way through the most tiresome of projects.
          </p>
          <p>
           Wine on the other hand is best consumed under the cloak of darkness. Not to infer that it is a drink to be sipped guiltily in the shadows, rather one can reward themselves with red, white or rose to calm an unsteady nerve. Give yourself over to the clarity of thought that comes with a relaxed state of mind and rescue those ideas once drowned in a flood of information.
          </p>
          <h2>
           3. Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out
          </h2>
          <p>
           The last thing anyone needs is to see another
           <em>
            Keep Calm and Carry On
           </em>
           iteration materialising before their eyes. Its modern resurgence is serving only as a source of humour or mild annoyance. Thankfully there are many wonderful ways to keep calm that dont involve age old government messages rooted in pre-World-War anxiety. Never fear, similarly we wont foist any faux motivational messages, you know the ones, replete with bad typography and artificial sunsets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Instead we believe the path towards carrying on a successful and inspired life lies in the subconscious pursuit of Meditation. There are a number of iPhone apps a few clicks away that can bring you closer to this state of being. Giving yourself a time out from all forms of mental stimulation to unlock those competing thoughts and visualising them float away. (And yes, we see the irony that plugging in to technology in order disconnect brings.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Meditations most famous champions include David Lynch who claim it can tap into unlimited reserves of energy, creativity and happiness deep within. Or The Beatles who pursued spiritual guidance in India in the late 60s and earlier gave us the song
           <em>
            Tomorrow Never Knows
           </em>
           in which we are instructed to Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream. Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void. Yet you may see the meaning of within.
          </p>
          <h2>
           4. Slave to the Rhythm
          </h2>
          <p>
           When people study music they start out learning how to read each note using the acronym Every Good Boy Deserves Fruit. They also get lost in back catalogues of their favourite musicians, which can be an even more enriching endeavour than a simple read and play method. Because observation and experience, rather than formal education can be the best teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Avalanches (first and only) full length album
           <em>
            Since I Left You
           </em>
           was a sonic medley featuring some 3,500 samples, including a sound bite from Madonnas song
           <em>
            Holiday
           </em>
           no less, deftly interwoven with vintage music from across the globe to create one seamless celebration. It was a critical and commercial success. But what we really embrace here is there eclectic choice in styles.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the studio we see the importance of surrounding ourselves with vast arrays of music from Electronic, Hip Hop, Rock or Ambient and even Classical. Our playlist defies lazy pigeonholing, although we do like to prescribe to a loose format of calm music in the morning, graduating mid to late afternoon to something a little more adventurous. Then on Fridays, its a shout out loud, fun, frivolous race to the finish line with tracks to prepare us for a weekend mindset.
          </p>
          <h2>
           5. Delve into the Celluloid Closet
          </h2>
          <p>
           Normally we would recommend you reach for the laserdisc but weve titled this as such because we want you to go way back. As graphic designers we reference the past masters of our profession in order to shape our design sensibilities with a foundation in the classics.
          </p>
          <p>
           We digress. So, it can be difficult to encourage new generations to embrace the pre fast editing, foul mouthed, special effects, genre blending era of film. But with the rise of television shows such as
           <em>
            Mad Men
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            Boardwalk Empire
           </em>
           it has encouraged younger audiences to allow this old world under their skin. Then further exploring the medium of film.
          </p>
          <p>
           Becoming enamoured by the set design, fashion, sparkling jewellery, big hair and language of the script. There is a purity in these works that can teach us to not simply recognise and remember these styles but understand and have them influence our ideas creatively. Then, instilled with the design knowledge of old, we have the wisdom to execute great things.

           6. Digital Detox
          </h2>
          <p>
           The
           <em>
            New York Times
           </em>
           recently reviewed the film
           <em>
            Web Junkie,
           </em>
           which examines internet addiction in China, the first country to classify it as a clinical disorder. Its subjects, mostly teenage boys, are sent to a Beijing boot camp to kick their habits. Such habits are not unique to the east and many of us, those fixed to computers for their 9 to 5 but perhaps not ready to be diagnosed with this addiction, are in dire need of digital detox.
          </p>
          <p>
           Returning to the natural world  be it taking a walk in the park sans phone, breathing in a lungful of salty sea air down at the ocean or simply having a wrestle with your dog. The colours, the textures, the shapes, and smells, amplified (operative word use here) with a distinct lack of noise pollution.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is a complete sensory immersion and one that has evolved (or been created  dependent on which belief system you fall within) without the hand or mind of man. When confined to the great indoors though, always keep a David Attenborough documentary close at hand. You probably dont realise how vital and inexpensive this therapy can be.
          </p>
          <h2>
           7. Daydream Nation
          </h2>
          <p>
           The value of sleep is vastly underrated. Sleep deprivation can cause imbalance in your waking life, effecting learning, memory, health and even contribute to depression. To restore the natural order to your whole self, you must pay back your sleep debt, to ensure you are performing at peak levels. Its not simply a question of how much sleep one must get in order to be productive and happy, because quality also plays a major role and this is never an either or situation, rather an and. Balance, always.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now that your eyes are closed, the visuals begin. Often dreams are a way of dealing with events we feel somewhat powerless to control during daylight hours. We process these, albeit in quick vignettes, many scenes both wonderful and sometimes frightening. Searching the subconscious for a resolution. Not only are they remedial but dreams can also be a rich source of imaginative ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Generating them though can be somewhat unpredictable, but this rarity lends currency. For director James Cameron, the idea for
           <em>
            Terminator
           </em>
           came to him in a feverish dream, in the form of a robot, red eyes ablaze, crawling menacingly toward him. And a better example cannot be found of the way dreams affect real life than in Christopher Nolans
           <em>
            Inception
           </em>
           where people are able to share the same dream space of others and cause events to take place in the physical world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Henry David Thoreau wrote Our truest life is when we are in dreams awake. Yes, when we do chance upon a crossover from dream to reality, it can be a wonderful thing indeed.
          </p>
          <h2>
           8. Lets get Physical
          </h2>
          <p>
           Put down the mouse, step away from the computer and free yourself from the shackles of technology. Its time you went for a walk. Sometimes being in the same place for too long can render us dull and lifeless, dazed or even confused.
          </p>
          <p>
           To prevent mental RSI we find the best solution can be found in a new challenge. It doesnt have to be a permanent change and certainly cannot be concluded as giving up. Instead these temporary shifts in behaviours can easily be achieved by a walk around the block (obvious), how about a session at the gym or even a shower? Last (and least)  perhaps youll find simple solace in cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>
           So to relieve temporary insanity, give yourself space to breath, time to process through all the gymnastic workouts your brain has endured. This is a body over mind experience with known benefits. Youll come back fitter, happier, more productive, thanks Radiohead.
          </p>
          <h2>
           9. The Eye has to Travel
          </h2>
          <p>
           There is so much to learn as we connect with other cultures. Mark Twain wrote: Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all ones lifetime. These lessons happen naturally.
          </p>
          <p>
           For example, did you know Bhutan uses an index of Gross National Happiness rather than GDP as a measure of success? Or that there are Amazonian tribes who are completely isolated by jungle, having never made contact with modern society? In Tibet a traditional form of greeting is to poke out ones tongue. Then the fun fact we should all know: otters sleep holding hands. How human of them!
          </p>
          <p>
           You can also travel without moving. By reading explorers memoirs like
           <em>
            Conde Nast Traveller Book of Unforgettable Journeys
           </em>
           or flip through a weathered edition of
           <em>
            National Geographic
           </em>
           . Online we can find beautifully curated photography of the Earth. These accounts now proliferate on Instagram. They inspire awe through beauty, diversity and unfamiliarity.
          </p>
          <h2>
           10. Old World Wisdom
          </h2>
          <p>
           Aside from regaling us with stories of the way things were, people older than ourselves have an uncanny knack of imparting wisdom learned through a lifetime of experience. Its not important that their experiences match ours absolutely, however it is of value that we share a commonality in our approach when searching for a way forward. Attitude is key.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you dont have access to a real life, age appropriate person you can read biographies or watch documentaries and discover what coping mechanisms they employed when adversity struck. For those of you who are time poor, pull up a new window in your web browser, type in
           <a href="http://www.ted.com" target="_blank">
            ted.com
           </a>
           and treat yourself to a wealth of nourishing talks. Their mission statement is Ideas Worth Spreading.
          </p>
          <p>
           These conversions are essential. In the end, we should hold dear that contented feeling we get from realising what really matters in life. Knowing how long to hold on and when to break free and run.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Odd Couple
          </h2>
          <p>
           In the studio at Another Colour we are in continual pursuit of the next big idea to build anything from a new branding project to an invitation for a special event or even how to satisfy our hunger during the lunch break! Yes, even our base instincts require invested thought.
          </p>
          <p>
           Above all what we have learned is that inspiration for these ideas can spring from the most unexpected places. Buddhism holds the lotus flower to be sacred, a symbol of fortune, purification and rebirth. As the flower rises through the mud and murk of water to the surface where it blooms, beautifully.
          </p>
          <p>
           A creative person and their ideas have a relationship like this flower and its environment, an unusual alliance, that is a wellspring of persistent tension and potential. When the two are united it can be life changing.

           The lungs of the earth will breath new life into your workspace
          </h2>
          <p>
           This modern life with all its technological trappings has us spending many of our working hours indoors, screen facing and surrounded by a man-made environment.
          </p>
          <p>
           But through the introduction of some green leaved members of the plant kingdom you can easily offset (sometimes) toxic emissions, softening and beautifying all those hard surfaces in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
           We guide you through this often tangled subject, discussing those that are best suited to the office, so that your weekdays can be as fresh and clean as your weekends spent outdoors.
          </p>
          <h2>
           1 Peace Lily
           <em>
            Spathiphyllum
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           A resident of our studio, this slender shade lover bursts forth each spring with white crescent shaped flowers but doesnt disappoint with a year round display of dense deep green foliage. It prefers well watered soils and humid conditions.
          </p>
          <h2>
           2 Parlour Palm
           <em>
            Chamaedorea Elegans
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           As stately in appearance as its name suggests, it was bestowed with an Award of Garden Merit by the British Royal Horticultural Society  a recognition of excellence. In Victorian times it became a staple of living rooms and has continued its reign throughout the 20th century, earning a place in

           known to improve air quality.

           3 Fiddle-leaf Fig
           <em>
            Ficus lyrata
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           Native to the tropical West African rainforests, this hardy specimen has been adopted by
           <a href="http://www.houzz.com/au/fiddle-leaf-fig" target="_blank">
            interior designers
           </a>
           the world over, as much for the way it complements a room as it is for its survival skills. It prefers well drained soil, to be watered once a fortnight and a sunny position.
          </p>
          <h2>
           4 Janet Craig
           <em>
            Dracaena deremensis
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           Janet was born in East Africa but has since migrated to indoor spaces across the globe. Janet does not like direct sunlight, however she enjoys its warmth. Give her a drink once a week and feed with liquid fertilizer at least twice a year to maintain her statuesque form.
          </p>
          <h2>
           5 Jade Plant
           <em>
            Crassula ovata
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           Our Jade plant, nested within a white ceramic container, with fleshy green leaves and a woody stem, is almost tree like in appearance. This succulent enjoys drier Winters, with moderate watering in Summer and a sunlit position all year round. Also known as the Money Tree, it will deliver a dividend of small white star like flowers.
          </p>
          <h2>
           6 Yucca
           <em>
            Yucca elephantipes
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           This hardy
           <a href="http://www.burkesbackyard.com.au/fact-sheets/in-the-garden/gardening-tips-books-techniques-and-tools/yucca-cuttings" target="_blank">
            specimen
           </a>
           has found a home in our studio. Although the naturally occurring plants from Mexico, Central and South America can grow up to 9 metres tall, its development will be arrested when confined to a pot. It is drought resistant and under the right conditions will produce a spike of pale yellow flowers.
          </p>
          <h2>
           7 Walking Iris
           <em>
            Neomarica bicolour gracilis
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           An ethereal plant with long reed like leaves and (most commonly) white and blue flowers. It grows well in hanging pots, where the leaves can cascade easily over the edge and the flowers can be raised up for all to see. Best of all, these flowers produce a lovely fragrance.
          </p>
          <h2>
           8 Pothos
           <em>
            Epipremnum aureum
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           Born of French Polynesia with heart shaped leaves, marbled yellow and green, it is a vine that will creep or climb when given support. However, its lush exotic beauty is deceptive and it should never be allowed to roam beyond the house or garden as it can become a
           <a href=" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipremnum_aureum" target="_blank">
            noxious weed
           </a>
           . Studies have proven this plant to be an affective sponge for pollution when in an indoor setting.
          </p>
          <h2>
           9 Croton
           <em>
            Codiaeum variegatum
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           A name like Croton conjures images of an alien life form from the set of
           <a href="http://www.startrek.com/database_article_navigator#Alien" target="_blank">
            Star Trek
           </a>
           . Although unusual in appearance, this earth bound plant is firmly rooted in reality. Its thick leathery two toned leaves are offset by delicate sprays of white flowers in Spring. This forest dweller from regions as far flung as Sri Lanka, Indonesia and beyond love a warm, moist position in their adopted homes.
          </p>
          <h2>
           10 Lucky Bamboo
           <em>
            Dracaena braunii
           </em>
          </h2>
          <p>
           Revered in Asian cultures as a source of prosperity and happiness, it has become a popular addition to any home or office in need of the harmonising qualities of
           <a href="http://fengshui.about.com/od/fengshuicures/p/fengshuibamboo.htm" target="_blank">
            Feng Shui
           </a>
           . But dont be fooled by its associations, appearance or name, because it is endemic to West Africa and is not a member of the bamboo family. You will commonly find it growing directly in water, sans soil, which must be changed fortnightly.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Great Indoors
          </h2>
          <p>
           The physical and psychological health benefits of the natural environment are well documented. And as urban development encroaches on these habitats, it becomes increasingly important to foster small pockets of life within our newfound world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, they relieve stress and reduce noise levels and have even been linked to more esoteric outcomes such as boosting creativity and aiding concentration.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, it is a logical progression to want to integrate the organic with the artificial, turning our concrete jungle into a living, breathing, leafy green beauty. Youre investing in your future and in addition the wellbeing of the people with whom you inhabit your space.

           You had us at you are here. Everyone needs to know their location, physically yes, and also their place in life. The books title speaks of the maps we view when in need of direction but this volume produced by Viction:ary gives us so much more that the security of knowing our place. It also surveys the work of wayfinding systems that assist us on the journey once we leave the map. Its practicality is matched by the ingenuity of its designs.

           As a follow up to Information is Beautiful, Knowledge is Beautiful takes us further into the field of data collection and transposition into highly engaging graphs, charts and diagrams. This time it focusses on the dissemination of information in an easy to see format, inviting viewers to learn something new that might otherwise be overlooked when in written form. At first glance we see only attractive colours and shapes but its the layers of learning that engage our minds. You can see how this book influenced our own work here

          <p>
           This weighty tome strips bare extraneous distractions such as colour and context and shows us the structure of a logo in stark simplicity. Every designer knows that a companies mark needs to work in black and white before it can be embellished and brought to the client and public in a more palatable format. We are better able to asses its composition and how effective it will be for the brand. The configuration of each symbol throughout is arranged by form, sector, designer and client. It is extremely thorough, with omissions due only to those who were unable to grant permission to publish.

           Contrary to popular belief pastels did not die with the 80s. True, they fell from favour for a time but what trend does not when oversaturation takes hold. It lives on through this wonderful book, wrapped in a somewhat austere cover of raw card, where a single circular die cut reveals a small piece of peach colouring beneath. What we love most about this one  besides the endless summer feeling one gets from these palettes  is the double page spread featuring the QT Port Douglas branding. One of our favourite clients.

           7 Dynamic Identities  How to Create a Living Brand
          </h2>
          <p>
           It is the mark of a good designer that he or she can create a suite of materials for a singular brand. It is the mark of a great designer when they can turn the brand into one that is characterized by constant change. Which, in our modern era makes sense like never before, where we live with few constants. And to be frank  attention deficit disorders are becoming the rule, not the exception. But lets not look upon dynamic identities as a necessary evil, far from it, this book teaches us the creative scope of a project can be boundless, cater to diverse groups of people and above all be fun.

           The ideas contained within this hardcover have the power to ignite the imagination. Every page challenges the norm. We see a shirt stitched together from different patterned fabrics that functions as a graph, 3D renders that bring understanding to complex issues, or recipe ingredients flat laid on vivid colour and styled to showcase their texture and colour. All of which makes us realise that there are many solutions to design problems.

           Last but nowhere near least comes a book that cuts and pastes together an array of modern collage. Design and art need not be mutually exclusive and thankfully the two often intersect in the industry at large and here

           That is why our shelves are filled with a vast selection that covers anything from illustration to web design. Interestingly these contemporary works often merge vintage images, but always in new ways. It can be a refreshing escape, a welcome rest for the eyes on our days filled with standard graphic design.

           Its great to have the Internet as a quick reference tool, especially in our profession where visual stimulation rules. But the value of books cannot be understated when we are in need of a more complete overview of any particular subject.
          </p>
          <p>
           The beauty of books is immediate. We scour the shelves of our studio and enjoy each of the images ad free. No flickering, epilepsy inducing banners, just crisp white pages and designs to inspire that seemingly go on forever. Weve learnt that reading offline has proven to be far more engaging.
          </p>
          <p>
           As our attention spans lengthen, we grasp for something more substantial that doesnt prescribe to the Internets bits and pieces collected from here and there ethos. So, the next time you encounter a person of rare talent, you should ask them what design books theyve been reading.

           The message
          </h2>
          <p>
           When fitness guru Mark Moon approached us to re-work his companys brand, the first step was to determine what sets his approach apart from every other personal trainer out there promising the perfect bod.
          </p>
          <p>
           Marks unique philosophy on nutrition and exercise is built around blood types. Have you got type O blood? Your genetics most closely resemble cavemen and Mark will create a customised plan for you, likely containing high intensity exercise and a diet heavy on protein and light on grains. And if youre a type A? Turns out calming exercises such as yoga or pilates are your best bet, along with a meal plan full of fresh fruit and whole grains.
          </p>
          <p>
           We worked with Mark to streamline his websites many offerings and messages into a step-by-step and holistic approach to health.
          </p>

           is for everybody. We wanted to make the brand more approachable and appealing to both men and women from a broad age rage. We shied away from using the tough-faced, shirtless photos and an open, lowercase typeface was used for headings to continue the friendly tone. We warmed up the colour palette with an injection of fresh yellow and replaced sombre greys and blacks with clean white space.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The results
          </h2>
          <p>
           Mark explains: after trying a few agencies in Sydney and not really getting what I was looking for, I changed agencies to Another Colour to get my business where I wanted it to be. By spending time to understand Marks business and helping him define his brands values, we were able to overhaul his marketing materials to be more in tune with his audience which has resulted in a steady increase in his sales.

            Brock Davis
           </a>
           is a man of many talents  artist, art director, illustrator, graphic designer and photographer. When he isnt out winning awards for his work with high profile clients, hes busy creating little scenes for Instagram. And much like his project Make Something Cool Every Day where he made one piece of creative work, consecutively for 365 days within a single year, he applies the same dedication to each fine thought.

           This intriguing series, stars our protagonist posing in
           <a href="http://instagram.com/kapstand" target="_blank">
            a single-armed handstand
           </a>
           throughout the world in front of iconic landmarks and landscapes. Originating from Paris, this breakdancer uses his camera, an eye for symmetry and frames himself balanced within expansive wide shots. We never see his face, lending each photograph an air of mystery and a stillness to counter the frenetic look at me crowds of Instagram.

            his images
           </a>
           we are taken by their simplicity. There is an overarching focus on the big idea and these images are all free from anything that may distract the viewer from the immediacy of this idea. With no extraneous textures, patterns or objects. Often he will pair only two items to create a single frame narrative. In each composition though, a beautiful execution is not forgone for the sake of the story.

           is a fellow Australian. Like Smart, George is concerned with the simplicity of an urban landscape, often populated with a solitary figure. Although he is not a native to Los Angeles his work can be characterised as distinctly American, as he captures the everyday spaces in between the cliched icons such as the Hollywood sign.

           is one of those unique individuals who turns his everyday life into a vibrant melange of art and design, accompanied by the written word. He pens (or shall we say types) a small essay for each bright square portrait, sharing intimate details of his loves, his fears and his future hopes. His story often touches on the life and times of a creative and the frustration we all face, seeking value in our work and feeling a constant need to usher it out into the world.

           uses the built environment as his canvas much like fellow European artist Christo, which he wraps, not in fabric but large scale photographic portraits of everyday people. He plasters them with glue and rollers, assisted by a legion of helpers. The process is not dissimilar to flyposted street advertisements but at a much larger scale and with the cooperation of the owners whose surfaces they cover. These temporary site-specific pieces transform a familiar landscape with an unfamiliar face or group of faces to create discussions on anything from identity, class, or culture to gender, race or religion. Engaging the community to influence the way they see the world and the way the world sees them. JRs body of work tells us that art can instigate change.

           describes himself (aptly) as an undesigner. And we couldnt agree more, for he takes minimalism, and then strips it back. Often giving his work a dreamlike quality and inviting the viewer to interpret for themselves what his photographs are trying to say, because rarely are the textures, patterns or poses so deliberate that they can be judged purely on aesthetics alone. Ohad hails from the studio Mishmaacool who specialize in product and space design. But for us as Graphic Designers, the underlying message, as it relates to our work is  what can we take away from the compositions we create in order to add to their impact. So yes, more or less, less is more, no?

Interspersed with these Escher-esque images are regular photos, equal in beauty and rich in detail from the Portuguese capital. Resonating each image with the same signature simplicity. Its little wonder tourism agencies the world over employ everyday photographers to go forth and spread the word with pictures worth a thousand.

We believe the magic in the work is due to the fresh eyes that he sees things with, not being a native resident of a strange far off land.

           taps into our childlike loves of illustration and collage  she cuts, she pastes, she scribbles  with fervour and haste for an adoring adult audience. Juxtaposition is where she excels, sometimes grafting real life on the streets with a torn page from a magazine, to humour or challenge us with her broken stereotypes. Turning the world into a stage for each new piece. I am always concerned with what lies beneath the surface, says Hollomon. I hope to create conversation that is rooted in questions related to learned social rules, identity, the subtext of everyday situations and perception. Above all, I try to capture a sense of romance in images that are spontaneous and slightly unnerving.

           populates our feeds with these subjects and more. There is a clever artifice to each of his photos as he shows us his life in blacks and bright banana pops of yellow. His sense of play is something that we, as designers, try to embrace daily. He allows us to peer inside his innovative mind when he dons a patterned singlet and shorts and continues its triangulation across his skin with texter. To end at the beginning, the opening words for his account tre et paratre translate as appearance and reality, which we feel can be a comment on Instagram as a whole, as people present to us their lives as they want us to see them and perhaps not as they really are.

Across 50 states he has posed his best friend, artfully within the scene, her sweet expression beaming, almost as if she is a knowing accomplice to the beauty and/or humour that surrounds her. Although, we suspect she is simply enjoying all the love and attention she receives throughout the whole process.

           Storytelling, first. We are told in the opening line of his succinct bio. But no, not the once upon a time suspended reality type fantasies, instead we are treated to a very real photograph of people and their environments that just might make you exclaim unreal! Spanning six continents, this commercial photographer brings his unique style to each of his single frame stories. Balloons lift its subject gently skyward, a solitary figure stands fixed within a strange new landscape, or a man, having ascended a mountain waves a pirate flag. Unfettered by the usual corporate gloss that accompanies paid work,

For the record, we are not averse to the odd culinary delight or self portrait, as long as its done sparingly and with panache.

           Behind the finished product are other valid ideas, that for one reason or another, didn't make it through to completion. For our initial round of concepts, we always present our clients with options  and the final result is an iteration of one of these, or an amalgamation of several of them. Here we unveil some of those unused (yet still loved) concepts.

          <h2>
           From The Vault
          </h2>
          <p>
           Behind the finished product are other valid ideas that, for one reason or another, didnt make it through to completion. For our initial round of concepts, we always present our clients with options  and the final result is an iteration of one of these, or an amalgamation of several of them. Here we unveil some of those unused (yet still loved) concepts.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Zoofari 2011 Black &amp; White Lemur Ball  Event Branding
          </h2>
          <p>
           For Tarongas Annual fundraiser, we were inspired by the playfulness of the Lemurs. As children we loved playing with tangrams, so we came up with a series of geometric arrangements to make fun portrayals of the distinctly black and white animal.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Lunetta Baking Company  Packaging
          </h2>
          <p>
           The packaging concept for these artisan cookies featured a mix of traditional elements with a sweet twist: functional brown paper is brought to life with a cursive, salmon-coloured font and cute moustache motif.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Thompson Health Care  Company Rebrand
          </h2>
          <p>
           For this family company we were assigned to do a full rebrand of their aged care facilities established in 1965. Organic watercolour compositions of the homes showed a gentle, nurturing side, while touches of gold foil depicted integrity and authority.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Mot Hennessy Collection  Packaging
          </h2>
          <p>
           A literal, yet artistic approach was used for this concept for Mot Hennessys online store. Rich, golden liquids swirl across the boxes of the opulent alcohol collection.
          </p>
          <h2>
           The Adventure Specialists  Company Rebrand
          </h2>
          <p>
           Using dream-like double-exposures, we combined lifestyle, travel and adventure photography to capture the emotions that are sparked when travelling and exploring the world.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Australian Lighting and Building Automation  Branding
          </h2>
          <p>
           This dynamic brand concept featured a futuristic home, shown in a range of seasons and times of day. As the weather changes around the home, block colours and icons reflect the different tiers of the Exhibition.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Tiger Zoofari 2014  Event Branding
          </h2>
          <p>
           In this concept we captured the tiger in all its glory along with elements of its natural habitat. Flourishes of gold tones, sundrenched trees and warm hues payed homage to this formidable yet endangered animal.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Masq Ball  Event Branding
          </h2>
          <p>
           We thought there would be no better way to capture the new take on a classic theme: MFAAs Masquerade Ball. Classical paintings were splashed with a bold, neon, grungy font.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Creative Process Prowess
          </h2>
          <p>
           Concept generation is the most critical stage for each branding and major creative project we work on. In the concept process we collaborate as a team and with the client, considering many approaches, each with a design philosophy that speaks to the audience.

Spectacular scenery, fashion to die for, champagne in crystal glassware  set against the unmistakable architecture of the modernist era. This truly was the definition of cool. The modernist period was so ahead of its time thanks to the forward thinking and innovation of its designers. Excuse us while we drool over the wire sun-loungers, flat roof houses and clean lines.

           After viewing just a snapshot of Aarons work in some of the most glamorous destinations, we found ourselves looking off into the distance and daydreaming of how we would spend our time in a place wed rather be.

           <em>

          <p>
           We all know QT Gold Coast as being the venue for Queenslands it crowd. So for their New Years Eve campaign this year we drew inspiration from the TV series
           <em>
            Magic City
           </em>
           , known for its highly styled costumes and locations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Set in 1959 Miami, Florida shortly after the Cuban Revolution,
           <em>
            Magic City
           </em>
           tells the story of Ike Evans, the owner of Miamis most glamorous hotel, the Miramar Playa. It mixes both superficial luxury and a seedy underbelly with equal aplomb.
          </p>
          <p>
           The creative evoked the nostalgic Miami scene with its cool pastel colour scheme and iconic art deco type style. All in all, an exotic, electric and sexy campaign for the biggest night on the QT calendar.
          </p>

           Our journey of creative partnership with Taronga Zoo
          </h2>
          <p>
           Another Colour have supported fundraising events by Taronga Zoo, delivering imaginative new design solutions for many events over the last five years.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have grown close to each cause and feel rewarded as funds are raised, aiding in the conservation of a wide range of animals, both local and abroad.
          </p>
          <p>
           The design features that made the event branding for each occasion memorable, motivating and moving have been mapped out below on a timeline.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Zoofari 2010  Year of the Tiger
          </h2>
          <p>
           Upon removing a golden belly band, the reader came face-to-face with a Tiger. Once unfurled, the invitee held in their hands the last 400 Sumatran Tigers left in the wild, each tigers silhouette hand-drawn and gold foiled.
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/projects/year-of-the-tiger/">
            See more images of this project here.
           </a>
          </p>
          <h2>
           Taronga Dinner 2011  Wild Frontiers
          </h2>
          <p>
           A series of exotic landscapes appeared throughout the invitation, with a stark, white silhouette reversed from the photographs representing a missing animal. It invited the audience to imagine a world in which animals did not exist.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Zoofari 2011  Black and White Lemur Ball
          </h2>
          <p>
           The playful nature of these animals was captured as the invitation was unrolled to reveal the Lemurs story on one side and a full-scale replica of the distinctive Lemur tail on the other.
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/projects/lemur-black-white-ball/">

          </p>
          <h2>
           Taronga Dinner 2012  Leap for Survival
          </h2>
          <p>
           With fewer than 120 Corroboree Frogs left in the wild, a strong message was required with this event invitation. A carefully die cut pocket referencing frog eggs is removed to reveal a small number of baby frogs within.
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/projects/leap-for-survival/">

          <h2>
           Zoofari 2012  Five for the Wild
          </h2>
          <p>
           A cascade of flowing watercolour and pen illustration graced this invitation to create a visual feast, celebrating the Asian Elephant, Cassowary, African Wild Dog, Sumatran Tiger and the Platypus. The result was a set of colourful pieces with differing textural elements, set to bold and classic typefaces.

          </p>
          <h2>
           Zoofari 2013  Cherishing Chimps
          </h2>
          <p>
           This invitation used the nostalgia of collage, incorporating Tarongas Chimps and vintage drawings of exotic flora to raise awareness for the destruction of habitat facing the Chimpanzee in equatorial Africa.
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/projects/cherish-our-chimps/">

          <h2>
           Taronga Dinner 2014  Elephant Journey
          </h2>
          <p>
           We used a unique gate fold and ornate asian imagery for Elephant Journey to suggest a new door opening for young-adult Elephants as they make a new home at Western Plains Zoo. As you opened the cover, it revealed two elephants embracing on the inside spread. Regal golds and cool aqua colours featured heavily, paired with a classic typeface.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Zoofari 2014  Tiger Zoofari
          </h2>
          <p>
           This year saw us come full circle with tigers. The concept drew upon art history from cultures all over the globe and captured tigers in diverse artworks, from varying periods to celebrate their diversity and history.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Our creative legacy. Their charitable successes.
          </h2>
          <p>
           This inspired partnership would not have been possible without the assistance of Jess and her predecessor Rebecca, Burwood Press and all the Taronga team for allowing us to create, develop and be such a big part of bringing these important events to life. Thanks to their efforts and our design solutions future generations will live to see these animals continue to exist.

          <h2>
           We stand on the shoulders of giants
          </h2>
          <p>
           Within graphic design, our kind are not as widely celebrated as high achieving individuals from other creative industries, despite our contribution to the visual environment. There are no widely publicised awards shows with red carpets and little statues, or major articles devoted to the work we do, with our names and faces splashed across the pages.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, most of you will be familiar with the creative output of some of those with a higher profile  the pioneers in our field. And today we want to focus on the stars that shone bright, often far from the spotlight, the ones whose work needs to be discussed, pawed-over and mined for inspiration.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although our industry is relatively young, there is a rich pool of talented lumineers from recent history that we can all draw upon for daily creative cues. Let us introduce you to twelve designers who have a far greater influence over current graphic styles than many people realise.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Paul Rand (1914  1996)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Even after his passing, Paul Rand endures as one of the most influential graphic designers in the world. To a certain degree, his renowned corporate identity designs for companies like IBM, ABC, UPS and Westinghouse are the reason for such status within the design community.
          </p>
          <p>
           Rand began his career designing covers for
           <em>
            Direction
           </em>
           magazine, where he embraced and honed the Swiss Style of graphic design, a practice developed in 1950s Switzerland and known for its emphases on clean lines, readability and objectivity. He was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1972.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Saul Bass (Born 1920  1996)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Mr Bass was primarily a graphic designer but is best known for his work on animated motion picture title sequences, for
           <em>
            Psycho, Anatomy of a Murder, Spartacus
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            The Man with the Golden Arm
           </em>
           . These are the best examples of his film work and of the style at large.
          </p>
          <p>
           He was responsible for memorable logos like the AT&amp;T globe, Minolta, United Airlines, The Girl Scouts and later he would also produce logos for numerous Japanese companies. In addition to this enviable portfolio, Bass designed the pared back poster for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and several Academy Awards shows.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Milton Glaser (Born 1929)
          </h2>
          <p>
           The name may not be familiar to most but the many iconic works he created are still being worn to this day  his ubiquitous I Heart NY shirt), or well-thumbed through (New York Magazine). Then there is the psychedelic Bob Dylan poster and the DC comics logo. Mr Glasers work is consistently characterised by simplicity and originality.
          </p>
          <p>
           Not only did Milton Glaser create a visual feast for successive generations of designers, he also spoke succinct, wise words that all creatives can use as a modern day mantra  The real issue is not talent as an independent element, but talent in relationship to will, desire, and persistence. Talent without these things vanishes and even modest talent with those characteristics grows.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Massimo Vignelli (1931  2014)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Massimo Vignelli tells us that if you can design one thing, you can design everything. And his lifes work is a testament to these inspiring words. His portfolio includes packaging design, furniture design, interior design, architectural and exhibition graphics, product design and last but not least, graphic design.
          </p>
          <p>
           Vignellis most familiar work however was his design for the NYC Subway system and the DC Metro system signage. He also imparts his wisdom teaching and lecturing on design in the major cities and universities in the United States and abroad.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Deborah Sussman (1931  2014)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Deborah Sussman was best known for leading the team that created the environmental graphics of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The team created bold, brightly colored supergraphics  large scale designs that were shaped around the built environment and gave the urban landscape a vibrancy and the architecture a much needed makeover. This characteristic technique that she pioneered and more is more mantra has since gone mainstream, allowing other designers to realise information signage in non-traditional ways.
          </p>
          <p>
           Her bold graphics reflected her unspoken dialogue with clients, best articulated here: Several people have told me over the years just give them what they want with regards to clients, and I cant bring myself to do it, I have to inspire them, and that can sometimes be a very dangerous attitude to have because you can lose yourself a lot of money.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Ruth Ansel (Born 1938)
          </h2>
          <p>
           As the visionary art director of prestigious titles such as
           <em>
            Harpers Bazaar
           </em>
           in the 1960s,
           <em>
            The New York Times Magazine
           </em>
           in the 1970s,
           <em>
            Vanity Fair
           </em>
           and
           <em>
            Vogue
           </em>
           in the 1980s; she has collaborated with nearly every icon of magazine publishing including Diana Vreeland, Annie Leibowitz, Bruce Weber and a whole lot more. But all of this was only part of her creative output during an illustrious career. She also directed fashion ad campaigns for Versace, Club Monaco and Karl Lagerfield.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Paula Scher (Born 1948)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Femme fatale Scher began her graphic design career as an art director for record covers at both Atlantic and CBS Records and became known as an innovative typographer, shunning the ever present Helvetica.
          </p>
          <p>
           This wild side is balanced with her corporate identity work for iconic brands like Tiffany &amp; Co., Citibank, New York City Ballet; Bloomberg, Coca-Cola, the Metropolitan Opera, and MoMA. She is now continuing her legacy, shaping young minds as an educator at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in New York.
          </p>
          <h2>
           David Carson (Born 1954)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Rough, rugged and raw, Carson, once considered an upstart in the design world, rose to prominence in the grunge era. Known for his anti-swiss style, through an abstract cut and paste aesthetic that could even be described as noisey. A style he started in Transworld Skateboarding and perfected with Ray Gun magazine.
          </p>
          <p>
           His experiments with design have led him to break widely observed graphic design rules in regards to grids, typography and its interplay with imagery. This playful technique of freeform creation in various mediums has ensured a vitality and a longevity for his career.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Neville Brody (Born 1957)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Neville Brodys meteoric rise began with his incredible art direction of cult UK magazine
           <em>
            The Face
           </em>
           between 1981 and 1986, establishing it as a doyen of culture and style. And as the creative force behind
           <em>
            Arena
           </em>
           magazine his stature within the publishing world was cemented.
          </p>
          <p>
           This master typographer used type as a primary element of the hero image, even creating the image itself entirely from letterforms. Although the magazine was his bread and butter work he often stepped away from the printed page to design record covers for artists such as Cabaret Voltaire and Depeche Mode to name but a few.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Stefan Sagmeister (Born 1962)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Enfant terrible, only in the best kind of way, Stefan Sagmeister pushes the boundaries like no other designer. Most notably is the 1999 poster for AIGA where he had his assistant carve the letters into his torso with a knife, photographing the bloody mess for all to see.
          </p>
          <p>
           Born in Austria, he now lives in New York City where he dabbles in the music scene, designing album covers for Lou Reed, OK Go, The Rolling Stones, David Byrne and Aerosmith.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Chip Kidd ( Born 1964)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Primarily a book jacket designer Chip Kidd has freelanced for many of the major publishing houses such as Penguin, Amazon and Random House; working with noted authors like Bret Easton Ellis, Haruki Murakami, Cormac McCarthy, Frank Miller and David Sedaris. He has often devalued the importance of his designs, expressing of his role, Im very much against the idea that the cover will sell the book. We disagree, and feel it is the perfect introduction to an undiscovered author.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because, you can tell a book by its cover, at least when Kidd is at the helm. He has a way of arresting the readers gaze, with art that speaks volumes for the printed word inside with one single image. His striking style has sometimes transcended the literary world, to be featured on marketing material for the film adaptation of Michael Crichtons
           <em>
            Jurassic Park
           </em>
           novel.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Deanne Cheuk (Born 1975)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Although our very own Deanne Cheuk now resides in New York she is native to Perth, Western Australia. She has many design arrows in her quiver  illustrator, designer, art director and artist. But the world of publishing is where she is most at home as contributor to Nippon Vogue, Dazed &amp; Confused, Nylon, Black Book, The Fader, Flaunt, Tokion and The New York Times Magazine.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cheuk pioneered the use of illustrative typography with her oft-copied/rarely-bettered style of watercolour titles and hand drawn letterforms on the printed page. This has led to commissioned work for revered companies like Nike, Converse, Swatch, The Gap, MTV, Levis, Nickelodeon, Nokia, and Converse.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Their Visual Legacy
          </h2>
          <p>
           As pillars of the design community, the impact is still apparent to this day. Their classic creations can help you navigate your train journey, be worn on an iconic tourist t-shirt, they package up your products and make your Sunday reading more pleasing to the eye.
          </p>
          <p>
           Moreover it is a testament to their skills that many current-day creatives still look to these masters for inspiration. Serving as models for modern-day designs, evolving from templates set out decades earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
           Often unchanged since genesis, the works of these designers are immune to the shifting tide of trends. Each name a permanent synonym for style.

Another Colour took a peek back in time at the British Vogue Archive to reveal how the cover of one of the most revered magazines in the world has evolved over time.

          <h2>
           Vogue BC (Before Celebrity)
          </h2>
          <p>
           Earlier this year, Anna Wintour placed a reality television star and her husband on the cover of American Vogue. The use of celebrities on Vogue (and magazine covers in general) has become a powerful selling tool; familiar faces and oversized taglines scream at readers to buy me.
          </p>
          <p>
           But before the power of celebrity endorsement and the importance of brand recognition, what did the cover of Vogue once look like? Another Colour took a peek back in time at the
           <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/magazine/archive" target="_blank">
            British Vogue Archive
           </a>
           to reveal how the cover of one of the most revered magazines in the world has evolved over time.
          </p>
          <h2>
           June 1917
          </h2>
          <p>
           She may have been very curvy or she may have been drowning in trim, but undoubtedly the June 1917 cover by George Wolfe Plank offered readers unabashed escapism from World War 1. Almost in spite of the war and a possible testament to the need for people to find some form of solace or distraction from general social bleakness, sales of the magazine were up during this period.
          </p>
          <h2>
           January 1923
          </h2>
          <p>
           This really was the dawn of the golden age of fashion illustration: each cover was a work of art that explored colour, shape and drew the eye in with rich details. Here a model appears to be feeding a dragon marshmallows.
          </p>

           Only the masthead has any resemblance to the current version of Vogue, in a similar font (Baskerville Old Face) that currently sits purposefully at the top of each issue. But that hasnt always been a fixed feature
          </p>
          <h2>
           September 1926
          </h2>
          <p>
           The Roaring 20s brought with it a whole new variety of cover art  literally, art, including this lavish September 1926 cover by Art Deco artist, Benito. Covers started to explore more detailed forms of expression, including the use of intricate backgrounds, landscapes and even architecture.
          </p>
          <h2>
           July 1928
          </h2>
          <p>
           By the late 20s, every issue featured the masthead reborn in an entirely new form, using many different fonts. And some without an actual font at all, instead incorporating features of the cover art such as extra long scarf knots in the wind or parting clouds clouds that would reveal the word, Vogue.
          </p>
          <h2>
           October 1930
          </h2>
          <p>
           Following the exuberance of the 20s, the 30s brought with it The Great Depression. This, however, didnt prevent Vogue from maintaining their sense of celebration and art during these tough times. Here, the cover of October 1930 sits somewhere between Art Deco and Surrealism in simple and pared back hues of austere beige.
          </p>
          <h2>
           July 1932
          </h2>
          <p>
           It was their 1932 July issue that featured their first ever photographic cover. It was shot by Edward Steichen, although he was not credited for his work at the time, and it featured a woman in a bright red swimsuit sitting against a background of cobalt blue. What is most remarkable, we feel, about this image is that the photographic medium was still used to portray artistic movements that were happening at the time: the ongoing influence of cubism is apparent in the harsh shadows that appear on the swimsuit model and her face, which emphasises the length and positioning of the body that resembles geometric shapes. It would still be some years yet before the photograph became the accepted norm for Vogues covers.
          </p>
          <h2>
           February 1935
          </h2>
          <p>
           For the February edition, 1935, Carl Erickson  a fashion illustrator for over 35 years  offered a stark watercolour cover that looks little more than a doodle, with the masthead scribbled across the top. We cant really see Anna Wintour approving something like this.
          </p>
          <h2>
           September 1937
          </h2>
          <p>
           For the UK editions 21st anniversary issue a birthday cake and unicorn were designed. They appear to be floating romantically in the sky, painted in purple and powder blue  a cover as far removed from fashion ever seen on Vogue. Although it does have a rather Vivienne Westwood feel to it.
          </p>
          <h2>
           August 1940
          </h2>
          <p>
           On the August 1940 cover, model  Lisa Fonssagrives was photographed wearing a boy-cut swimsuit and used her own body to pose as letters, spelling out the Vogue magazine title. The cover was recreated in 1992 for British Vogues 75th Anniversary issue.
          </p>
          <h2>
           June 1944
          </h2>
          <p>
           Dals surrealist cover of April 1944 arrives during the throes of World War 2. It is one of the final few covers to escape the soon to be standardised format: fixed serif masthead; photograph of a female model, usually maintaining eye contact with her audience; and some catchy captions intended to attract a greater readership. By the 1950s, the cover achieved the formulaic template we are now so familiar with.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Vogue Today
          </h2>
          <p>
           We understand that Vogue is a business, and each editor has redirected the magazine to ensure its longevity and a highly successful brand but, looking back, we cant help but feel that a particular magic and appeal was lost along with the more creative artwork that once graced Vogues cover. Its sad that each issues cover is no longer a true blank canvas; a place where an illustrator or artist could take the reader far, far away from the burdens of a world driven by making a buck.

           Reflections from the past can inform the present
          </h2>
          <p>
           Powerful design is a balance of arresting imagery and succinct messaging. And no one understands this better than Fukuda. Behind his bold, bright colouring is a distillation of complex ideas, often achieved through juxtaposition. Mens legs intertwine with womens, a new branch springs forth from an axe handle or corporate attire walks alongside psychedelic styling.
          </p>
          <p>
           With this in mind we proposed to create our own set of modest graphics, which are almost logo-like in their simplicity. Hopefully capturing some of that Fukuda genius in the process. We extended a cheeky middle finger on one, reflected with the two fingered peace sign. Scotch bottles sit alongside soda topped with straws. All with a distinctly 21st century colour palette.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fukuda also taught us other valuable lessons in design practice. His love of minimalism, asymmetry and sans serif typefaces served him well and, although he forged a signature style, he ensured that his unique aesthetic retained a classic timelessness decades later.
          </p>
          <p>
           As good designers we must remain vigilant, educating ourselves in the styles and substance of intelligent work that has come before, seeking out famed creatives who can inform us and our work in the modern age. Beautiful graphics are always more compelling with meaning.

           Here at Another Colour we are often presented with a project to challenge the standard ways in which we are accustomed to designing. The work we completed for Event Emporium was no exception and rather than working with a single dimension such as graphics for print or screen we were required to think and design in three dimensions.

          <h2>
           A room with a view  designing a liveable space
          </h2>
          <p>
           Here at Another Colour we are often presented with a project to challenge the standard ways in which we are accustomed to designing. The work we completed for Event Emporium was no exception and rather than working with a single dimension such as graphics for print or screen we were required to think and design in three dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Event Emporium commissioned us to flex our creative muscle for Samsung on a new product launch of the Audio Multiroom, an innovative new way to integrate wireless speakers so you, the listener, can enjoy music in many rooms at once. Such smart technology required a smart approach.
          </p>
          <p>
           We transformed an exhibition space, which featured a life-size replica of a home interior, whose stark white walls were graced with light grey vinyl decals of familiar household objects; and furnished with a white couch, bar and stools. All this was designed to draw the eye to the starring attraction, the exquisite black unit.
          </p>
          <p>
           The result was a resounding success. As any immersive experience, it took the audience through the space where they were able to see hear and feel the equipment first hand. The whole display spoke volumes about our ability as designers to adapt our design skills to the built environment.
          </p>

           From farm to fashion
          </h2>
          <p>
           This year Easter came early for us when we were requested to work with the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW on signage for The Royal Easter Show. Large scale images of wool, alpaca, cotton and angora graced the large-format graphics for The Natural Fibres Showcase along with products that are produced from these raw materials and a mix of modern and classic typefaces.
          </p>
          <p>
           Two major components came together for the project: promotional banners and an interactive stand designed as an educational experience about Mohair.
          </p>
          <p>
           The promotional banners that teased people back to the Natural Fibre Showcase featured lifestyle photography and muted, earthy tones, with the key messages splashed across them  100% Natural, 100% Responsible and 100% Australian.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the Mohair stand the raw wool was interspersed with finished products such as jumpers and socks, photos from the farm and informational charts. All of this was designed to engage the customer in discussion around the process and benefits of using the natural over the artificial. This is essentially the key message of the show itself, use of Australian, all-natural products that are farmed and produced locally.
          </p>
          <p>
           We had the pleasure of being taken on a behind-the-scenes tour by our client Mike Burgess, to meet farm animals and speak directly to farmers, and last but not least, indulge our love of carnival rides and fairground food.

           Designing for excellence
          </p>
          <p>
           At Another Colour we love a good challenge and this particular one was no exception to the rule. We designed an event identity and supporting collateral for
           <a href="http://www.eventemporium.com.au/" target="_blank">
            Event Emporium
           </a>
           , event managers of MFAAs gala dinner. As this was celebrating those in the industry who excel, the program had to be well in a word, excellent.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Commonwealth Bank was the major sponsor, so we drew inspiration from the brands colour palette and created a geometric pattern: a contemporary, yet timeless arrangement that tumbles across the cover and throughout the inner pages.
          </p>
          <p>
           From all reports the night was a big success, which can be seen in the photos above, supplied by Event Emporium. Its great to work alongside fellow creatives and watch it all come together. We are currently working with Event Emporium on the next MFAA event so stay tuned for an update.

A unique and creative approach to the campaign was needed to bring these tigers back from the brink of extinction.
          </p>

           With this vital statistic in mind, only 400 copies of the record were pressed and distributed to famous and otherwise influential people on Earth Day this year. As they listen to the vinyl it degrades over time and the track can only survive if it is digitised. This concept was intrinsically linked to the plight of its subject.

           We have worked with our clients at Taronga Zoo on projects both old and new to similarly raise awareness for this beautiful animal. In 2010, our

          <p>
           This year we have designed a Save the Date postcard for Zoofari 2014, to be followed with an event invitation and collateral for the charity dinner to be held at the Zoo. It will raise funds and awareness for the Tigers, continuing Tarongas commitment to this majestic animal.

           Recently we were privileged to be taken on a behind-the-scenes tour where we met the Sumatran Tigers of Taronga Zoo. Once you have seen them up close, coupled with some insider knowledge from their keepers, you have a greater empathy for their plight.

           Call us suckers for soppy news but we were all smiles when we learnt that client and good friend, Sas Lyon, was pregnant with her first child. When she chose us to help design the invitations to her baby shower we were equally as excited and a little honoured.
          </p>
          <p>
           To know Sas is to know and understand her wicked sense of humour. With this consideration we designed an invitation in the form of a balloon with the cheeky opening line Sas is ready to pop emblazoned across it. The lolly pink balloon (its a girl) had to be blown up by guests in order to read the event details.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the baby-to-be we thought it would be fun to design a custom-made outfit. We used one of our original designs and had this printed on a cotton onesie from American Apparel. Yes, we branded Sass baby but we guess thats okay because she has requested an exact replica in her own size so they can be matching while they watch Peppa Pig together.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are very happy for both Sas and her husband Matt and wish them both the best in the exciting times ahead. Cant wait to meet the little one when she is born! Shes going to be the most stylish (and colourful) baby girl on the block.

           Its probably safe to say that for most of us the only reason we tune in to the Oscars is for the red carpet spectacle. It's an endless procession of actresses, draped in either the finest couture or fashions most infamous failures. Part runway, part performance and ever-so-slightly ridiculous, it is a guilty indulgence that is best enjoyed with pizza and friends and we never miss it.After many years of avid viewing we decided to turn this obsession into a quantifiable (or informative) pictogram, hoping to learn the science behind these famous frocks.

          <p>
           Its probably safe to say that for most of us the only reason we tune in to the Oscars is for the red carpet spectacle. Its an endless procession of actresses, draped in either the finest couture or fashions most infamous failures. Part runway, part performance and ever-so-slightly ridiculous, it is a guilty indulgence that is best enjoyed with pizza and friends and we never miss it.
          </p>
          <p>
           After many years of avid viewing we decided to turn this obsession into a quantifiable (or informative) pictogram, hoping to learn the science behind these famous frocks. Looking back at the past fifty years (basically from when colour photography was made readily available) we collected images of the winners for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress to see if there was a winning formula or trend in what the recipients of these awards wore.
          </p>
          <p>
           Each award winners outfit was represented as a single predominant colour. This gave us the first insight into what constitutes a winning dress  the use of single note tones. This might be because, like the Queen of England, it makes it easier to spot them in a crowd. Very rarely did a winner wear more than one colour (different shades of the same colour dont count). In fact, the most colourful dresses to grace the awards stage were not worn by the winners but by someone accepting the award on their behalf  Angela Lansbury in 1984 for Best Supporting winner, Peggy Ashcroft and Raquel Welch in 1969 on behalf of Goldie Hawn. Notable runners up are Halle Berry with her wine-mint-and-flesh Elie Saab gown in 2002 and the rosette-printed floral dress worn by Jessica Tandy in 1989.
          </p>
          <p>
           On a side note, we also began to stocktake the tuxedos that the winning men wore but it wasnt long before we realised that it was all just a thousand shades of black. Aside from Daniel Day-Lewis in 2012 and Christopher Plummer in 2012 who both wore shades of navy blue, it seems that men are incredibly unwilling to break from tradition. Either that or they need more adventurous stylists.
          </p>
          <p>
           The trend we noticed was that black is hands down the reigning colour for the winners, as can be seen in our Pantone-style Oscar swatch set. This may not be all that surprising but it does highlight that a lot of actresses stick to classics and play it safe. Unless youre Cher. Then youll go dressed like youre the Evil Queen from a futuristic fantasy film or the reincarnation of Nefertiti.
          </p>
          <p>
           After classic black came what commentators tend to call old Hollywood glamour or what the rest of us would call metallics  silver and gold tones. This palette includes the dress that Charlize Theron wore when she won her award for playing serial killer Eileen Wernoz in
           <em>
            Monster
           </em>
           and Sandra Bullocks dress from 2009, worn to collect an award for
           <em>
            The Blind Side
           </em>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Surprisingly, the grunge-fueled 90s seemed to be when winners were at their most colourful (we were totally expecting the 80s to win this too): Barbie-pink (Gwyneth Paltrow); robin-egg blue (Helen Hunt); mint green (Kim Basinger); and even a lovely rusty velvet (Juliette Binoche).
          </p>
          <p>
           So far, the least colourful times have been well, now. The past decade has seen the winners for both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress blending into each other with many sticking to safe shades of beige, black and greys with maybe a dash of red or blue. The winners for the past three years have all worn the same neutral colour, albeit in different shades. This probably has something to do with both the the role of the stylist and, more likely, the increasing power of celebrity as a brand.
          </p>
          <p>
           Personally we miss the days when celebrities would turn up looking like a hot mess. Celine Dion wearing a suit backwards; Bjrk in her swan dress and Cher in anything. These dresses stole the limelight for all the wrong reasons, which in our minds, were all the right reasons  because they were fun!

           The word on the street
          </h2>
          <p>
           Right around the corner from our studio is a freshly painted mural from the street artist who goes by the pseudonym of Numskull. In fact, in many of the surrounding streets and on any available surface lives a piece of art whose brush strokes or sprayed droplets are a testament to talented artists working outside of conventional galleries.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a street artist and typographer extraordinaire Numskull brings his art straight to the people. Theres a pearl of wisdom to be found in his popular turns of phrase, illustrated in large scale decoratively painted font displays the world over, on a wall near you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Not only does Numskull do site-specific work like his memorable Taupo, New Zealand mural, which takes its cues from Ghostbusters with the quote when theres something strange in your neighbourhood, he also works from a studio. When he strays from his staple street style he can be seen adorning canvas and paper with cartoonish characters reminiscent of daffy duck or pluto pup, with bulbous eyes peeking out at its viewers.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the one we adore is the one we walk past each day coming to work. What a wonder full day to go painting! he exclaims in giant metre-high letters, and we concur it was. For what he produced on that day conveys his message in succinct, bold type while appearing effortless and fun.
          </p>
          <p>

           ) we were excited to see someone else felt the same.
          </p>
          <p>
           We took a fun, yet minimalist, approach to designing the invite using light pastels for the background and solid black for the type and images. Taking inspiration from Geralds family heritage, the copy for the invite was written completely in Italian (for which we thank Gerald for so kindly translating this and making sure it was all correct). The completed job was then printed up by the ever wonderful guys at Digital Press.
          </p>
          <p>
           We hope you had a great birthday Gerald!

          <h2>
           Cherish our Chimps
          </h2>
          <p>
           Taronga Zoos annual Zoofari gala dinner is something that we are always very proud to be a part of. Their tireless work in conservation and raising awareness about endangered species from across the planet is genuinely inspiring.
          </p>
          <p>
           For 2013, the focus was on the Chimpanzee. Once found in forests throughout Equatorial Africa, the number of chimps in the wild has declined rapidly due to the destruction of habitat and the illegal trade as pets and bushmeat.
          </p>
          <p>
           To create a motif for the event we sourced images from vintage biology books showing Chimpanzees amongst their native flora and, using a collage technique, placed them against backgrounds of muted neutral tones that captured the fragility of not only the Chimpanzee but the forests they need to thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
           E-invites were sent to guests so as to be more environmentally friendly and uncoated, recycled stock was used for the evenings program and collectable postcards. The images from the collateral were then repurposed for the dcor and signage found throughout the event.
          </p>
          <p>
           The event was a huge success, raising a grand total of $297,000 through ticket sales, auctions, raffles and pledges, and will go towards the protection and conservation of the African Chimpanzee.
          </p>

          <h2>
           Shake it like an aura-filled picture
          </h2>
          <p>
           After testing our fear of heights earlier in the morning (and eating an entire sushi tray apparently intended for twenty people but demolished in no time between the five of us) we were treated to the second part of our day  having our auras photographed.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kirlian photography was first discovered in 1939 by Semyon and Valentina Kirlian who observed that when electrodes were brought near the skin, it caused a faint glow to be perceived. The procedure is said to show a coronal discharge  energy  from objects and people that it captures on film. The colours of the depicted can then be interpreted to show emotional and mental states of the person in the picture.
          </p>
          <p>
           We booked a session with local Kirlian photographer and aura reader, Jann Morgan. The whole setup was admittedly rather fascinating  the camera looked like it belonged to the 18th Century and was attached to two metal plates where you rested your hands and what looked like an old fashioned fax machine. This was used to create an algorithmic measure of the colours found within the aura. This was all set up in front of a wooden stool with a cute, velveteen curtain as background, decorated with some tinsel. It was all rather quaint but still a little daunting what if our aura revealed some deep dark secret?
          </p>
          <p>
           When the process was all done, we put all our photographs in a line to see what our auras apparently look like and the results were rather amusing.
          </p>
          <p>
           With all of us, there was a definite trend towards the warmer end of the spectrum  red, orange, gold and yellow with dashes of pink and green for good measure. Jann explained that these were the more creative colours and that the consistency throughout the group was indicative of why we all get along so well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then, as we started to compare each individual image, we noticed that some of us were definitely more alike than others. Which is also true in real life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both Steve and Lauren had solid, bright red auras. This, according to Jann, was the colour of willpower and leadership and the auras of resourceful and creative individuals and while we dont want to say that either of them are stubborn it might just be a little bit true.
          </p>
          <p>
           Next up was Ben, Clint and Min. All three had a lot of orange but, when we looked at them a little closer, each had their own quirks and peculiarities. Which, again, if you have ever met Ben, Clint or Min, this makes complete sense.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bens aura was made up of bright orange, gold and a touch of bright yellow green in the middle  all the colours of creativity, a rather odd sense of humour and a bit of a nerd. Mins aura was orange, pink and red  meaning that she is charismatic, outgoing but abounding in maternalism (which she absolutely is!). Finally, Clints aura was probably the most fun  dubbed the unicorns aura Clint had more colours than the rest of the team put together with orange, red, green, blue and a bit of turquoise for good measure. Creative and outgoing, yet empathic and a bit of a dreamer, this was also the most accurate description of our team.
          </p>
          <p>
           Are we convinced that we are surrounded by a luminous cloud of energy that captures our inner essence? Maybe not. But it was a fun experiment that showed us just one more way that colour can be used to create meaning and express parts of ourselves.

           We recently worked on exhibition materials for Mason Grogan Industrial, which really opened up our eyes to the level of detail that goes into something that we often take for granted  trains, and the materials involved in their production, ensuring we get from A to B in safety and comfort.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Leading up to the AusRAIL industry expo, Mason and Grogan asked us to prepare a set of collateral to showcase the unique, hard-wearing materials of the Industrial rail-focussed branch of their business. Following on from the success of
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/blog/design-feat/" target="_blank">
            the podiatry folder and compendium
           </a>
           , we had big (design) shoes to fill.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           We were tasked with the project of taking a few existing flyers and giving them a refreshed look, and overall consistency, with a modern feel. All nine of which were to be encased in an eye catching folder with a wrap around cover and a spot UV to highlight text and a logo.
          </p>
          <p>
           The interactive space was a lifesize replica of a train carriage, where attendees were able to get on, touch and see the materials in action. The whole experience reminded us a little of going to Questacon in Canberra as kids where you could touch all of the fun things and learn at the same time! Graphics were created for the open plan exhibition panels and a video highlighting key features was produced to complete the experience.

          <p dir="ltr">
           Known for their use of high profile artists (previously, they have worked with the likes of Marc Newson and David Lynch), French champagne house Dom Prignon have recently teamed up with American Neo Pop artist, Jeff Koons, to create a limited edition sculpture to showcase their
           <em>
            2003 Vintage Ros
           </em>
           . The result is a metallic hot-pink replication of Koons infamous
           <em>
            Balloon Venus
           </em>
           , a 1.27m high sculpture inspired by the prehistoric
           <em>
            Venus of Willendorf
           </em>
           statue that is considered by many to be an early icon for a fertility goddess and one of the oldest symbols of feminine beauty in Europe. The re-envisioned artwork literally embodies the bottle, opening up to reveal the delicious ros nestled inside. Almost like a delicious pink Transformer!
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Our job in helping launch the collaboration was to create a limited edition postcard that was distributed to VIP clients and patrons. On one side, the postcard depicted the
           <em>
            Balloon Venus
           </em>
           (which sells for a sweet US$20,000 should you be interested in investing) and on the other, the artist himself interacting with the work. To capture the impact of the sculpture, we used a matte black laminate for the background and the image of the sculpture was then embellished with a shiny spot varnish. In keeping with the ros theme, hot pink foiling was used for the text heading and Dom Prignon logo.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           We loved taking part in the project  and not only because we are all avid fans of the odd bottle of Dom and secretly wish to own a Koons or two but because it is not often you get to participate in a project with luminaries of taste and design.

           According to
           <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/video/hillarylevine/surprising-facts-about-creativity" target="_blank">
            Buzzfeed
           </a>
           , creative personalities like to take risks and enjoy getting out of their comfort zones. Then again, according to
           <a href="http://12most.com/2012/03/13/12-striking-tendencies-creative-people/" target="_blank">
            this list
           </a>
           creative people also have all the hallmark signs of having ADD but for now lets just focus on how, for our staff Christmas party, we put the comfort zone theory to the test and passed with flying colours.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           To celebrate a big year full of changes and lots of hard work, the team at Another Colour were treated to a surprise day at
           <a href="https://secure.sydneytrapezeschool.com" target="_blank">
            Sydney Trapeze School
           </a>
           in Tempe. How Steve managed to maintain this secret is beyond us but it was a great trick because in the lead up to the event our imaginations truly got the better of us as we tried to figure out what we were actually going to be doing (paintball, obstacle courses, endurance training and ultimate cage fighting were some of the more interesting ideas that were thrown around). Nicely played Steve, nicely played.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           When all was revealed, to say we were excited would have been a bit of an understatement although, by the looks on some faces, ultimate cage fighting might have been a less confronting option. After a quick introduction with the amazing instructors and a warm up session we were strapped in and ready to go!
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Now, in theory eight metres doesnt sound that high. But when youre forced to climb a rickety metal ladder that wobbles the entire time to reach a platform from which you are meant to jump, it doesnt matter how brave you are or how many ropes are secured to your harness, you get a little scared. And even though some of us had done it before, by the time we reached the top rung of that ladder our hands were damper than a dish rag and our knees were knocking. Maybe it was because, like Buzzfeed suggests, creative types enjoy risk taking or maybe it was because a group of eight-year-old girls were doing it at the same time and our pride got the better of us but no one chickened out.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           After a few practice runs, mastering the legs-up and learning the commands, it was time for the grand finale  the catch. Steve was like a proud stage mum, when we all succeeded in mastering the art of trapeze. Not a single catch was missed thanks to the fantastic direction and encouragement from the STS staff members, although we are convinced that it was our innate athleticism and natural ability that really got us through
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           After a quick stretch and a chuckle as we watched the photos of our day, it was on to the second part of our Christmas Party Challenge. Watch this space to read more about that later
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           We were able to get some videos! Be amazed at our grace. Marvel at our elegant bearing. Laugh at our landings.

           One of our newest clients, Brigitte Mancini, contacted us all the way from Port Douglas. After receiving her accreditation as a civil servant, Brigitte wanted our help to create an identity and marketing collateral for her company, Sweet Ceremony.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           After talking to Brigitte about her ideas for the business and the direction she wanted it to take, we thought it was important to create an identity that would be suitable for all the services that she provided: not just weddings but funerals, naming ceremonies and vow renewals too. In order to achieve this we decided early on that this meant avoiding the traditional or cliched images or the colour pink. Instead, we chose a bold, black background with a gold filigree pattern to create a contemporary yet classic identity that would be appropriate for all occasions.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Once the job was completed, we thought it would be interesting to have a chat with Brigitte about her experience in starting up a small business and learn what advice she had to offer others who were going through, or about to start, the same process.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            Hi Brigitte, thanks for taking the time to chat with us! Can you tell us a little about yourself and Sweet Ceremony?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Well I am 55 years old, wife to a man I have passionately loved for 39 years and a mother to two children who have truly taught me to be a more tolerant and better person, inspiring me to always achieve what I thought was not within my capabilities. I have worked in hospitality for many years and have always thought how wonderful it would be to get into the celebrancy business. I am a hopeless romantic and a strong believer that love can heal almost everything. It was after a conversation with my daughter that it clicked, and in that moment my Sweet Ceremony journey began. The next day I was busy researching courses, starting my own small business and gathering thoughts on what this new business would be called.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            What made you want to start your own business?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Since we first got married, I have always operated my husbands air conditioning business. My time in this role was incredibly beneficial because it provided so much knowledge and I learnt so many applicable skills, but you never feel the pride nor the passion you get when youre driving your own affair. When you have your own business you are the recipient of your own criticism and rewards and you are responsible for your improvements and successes. Starting up Sweet Ceremony came when I was ready for a new challenge which allowed me to use all my skills and strengths acquired over my adult life. Sweet Ceremony is also operated from my home office, where I still manage my husbands administrative affairs also. These two roles mean Im lucky to be never doing the same routine all the time  theres never a dull moment and inspiration surrounds me.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            When you contacted Another Colour, what were the most important things that you wanted to achieve through dealing with them?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           I approached Steve whilst I was designing my website. I needed and wanted a logo I would be proud of; one that represented my business. The name Sweet Ceremony was reflective of my delivery, and my logo would reflect my style. Its design needed to look how the name sounded but be classy and professional. Another Colour did just that.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Steve supported my thoughts and led me away from some of my initial ideas, and for that I am so grateful for his professional advice. Steve and his team were invaluable with some professional advice and were forthcoming with creative input about the website.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            What was the process you followed in creating your company identity? What were the most important elements you wanted represented in the final creation?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           I researched my business online and made a note of each reaction made from each website observed. Some I admired and some I hoped my business would never resemble. The elements I wanted to portray were what my business and services offer, how these are offered and their outcome. Being on the wise and mature side, I am a little reserved with business concepts and ethics. What I wanted to represent was honesty, simplicity, professionalism and style.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            How did the team at Another Colour help you achieve this?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           The members of the team I dealt with were approachable, interested and creative. They listened to me and understood exactly what I had in mind but found difficult to describe. Steve knew what I wanted done, and he provided me with new ways of thinking about what I wanted to achieve. Steve and his team got things done quickly and well, and they were extraordinarily helpful at every step. They also came up with a business card that has received endless positive responses. Every recipient of my business card compliments me on its appearance and design and it always manages to get more than just a quick glance and a slide in the pocket. The card is a great conversation starter.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            Can you describe your overall experience with Another Colour?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           One of the best decisions I have made on my Sweet Ceremony journey. The identity created by Another Colour is the most crucial business tool I will ever possess that speaks volumes about what I do and who I am. Dealing with Another Colour was about the quality, the promptness, the attention to detail and the effectiveness of their work.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           <em>
            Do you have any advice for other people interested in starting their own business? Or even people who may already have their business and would like to develop their brand more?
           </em>
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           For someone interested in starting up their own business I would advise them to never underestimate their own abilities and potential. You will never know unless you take that step. You are not alone, and sourcing a good creative agency to assist with design and branding will see you succeed.

            We recently posted a story
           </a>
           about the way the human eye perceives colour and in particular the ability for some lucky people to detect more colours than the rest of us (98 million more, to be exact). The idea that some of us are capable of extraordinary forms of perception intrigued us so we started to investigate other vision-related phenomena and found some interesting stories about certain artists. Namely the father of Impressionism, Claude Monet.
          </p>
          <p>
           Famous for his loose, impressionistic style of painting, Monet created controversy in the 19th Century Paris art world for breaking free from traditional painting styles and conventions with his aggressive brush strokes and visible workings of paint. But it was this style of painting that allowed Monet to explore the way natural light affected our perception of colours in the environment.
          </p>
          <p>
           Monets most famous  or most beloved depending on how you look at it  paintings are those done at his cottage gardens outside Paris. Painted later in his career,
           <em>
            Waterlilies, The Artists Garden,
           </em>

            The Garden Path
           </em>
           are unique in that they give the viewer an acute insight into the impact that Monets deteriorating eyesight had on his painting. As progressive documentaries of Monets failing eyesight, the paintings in this series grew increasingly darker, filled with deep blues and reds in comparison to the lighter pastels of his early career. It wasnt until 1923 that Monet succumbed to science and finally underwent the surgery that would repair his eyes and enable him to see normally again.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to some
           <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.skepticalartist.com%2F2013%2F06%2F25%2Fclaude-monet-and-ultraviolet-light-did-the-master-impressionist-painter-have-uv-supervision%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFB6u2JjuY2bYf0lmyVfj00aPrisw" target="_blank">
            theorists from both the art and scientific worlds
           </a>
           , this was the operation that gave Monet more than just his old eyesight. Based upon a comparison of paintings done before and after the surgery of the same scenery, its been argued that this early form of cataract surgery provided Monet the ability to see ultraviolet hues undetectable to the average eye. In fact, those paintings done after the operation show a distinct difference in the way Monet perceived colours. Blues became more vibrant, richer and almost electric, there was much more violet throughout Monets palette than ever before.
          </p>
          <p>
           But apparently this is not an uncommon occurrence in cataract patients.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ultraviolet light exists all around us and the eye contains a lens that filters these rays out. When this lens becomes opaque due to cataracts, surgeries such as the one that Monet had that removes this, ultimately removes the eyes natural UV filter, thus enabling people to see light that they were previously (and naturally, because its harmful) unable to detect. Monets later paintings were consistent with the side-effects reported by other aphakic patients (removal of the eye lens) who all confirmed perception of colours and light that had previously been invisible to the naked eye.
          </p>
          <p>
           We love these kinds of stories, not only because they highlight the supposed hidden superpowers of the human body, but because it also reminds us that when it comes to colour we have barely scratched the surface of what we are capable of seeing.

           The Fiction Faction
          </h2>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Have you ever noticed that when youre reading, the power of your imagination is so intense that it has the ability to recall and replicate certain sensations as theyre described in the book?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           For example, read about the taste of an apple and your body begins to trick itself into tasting an apple. But what happens when books describe something that the body has never experienced before? Something like a brand new colour?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Chances are youve never heard of the fourth primary colour Squant, the dark saturated red Sangoire or even the shade of blue called Hooloovoo. But youd be forgiven for such ignorance as these colours only exist in fictional film or literature and the imaginations of its audience. A more infamous example is probably Terry Pratchetts Octarine from his
           <em>
            Discworld
           </em>
           series. In the books, Octarine is the eighth colour of the spectrum, is the colour of magic, and is described as being a greenish yellow-purple colour in other words, impossible to replicate in the real world. Or is it?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Making up names and describing colours that dont exist isnt such a wild idea. Colour is, after all, a spectrum of perception and there is an enormous variety of shades and hues that the naked human eye cannot perceive. Humans, along with some other primates, are normally trichromatic meaning they have three cone cells in their eyes that are used to pick up colour (red, blue, green). These three cone cells allow us to detect roughly one million hues although on average woman can see up to 50 shades more than the average male. It also doesnt help that more men than women suffer from some form of colour blindness which probably explains why a lot of men need help choosing the right tie each morning.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Recently, however, colour vision researcher Dr Gabriel Jordan in the UK discovered the existence of what she called a tetrachromat  someone who has four cone cells in their eyes. This one additional cone cell means that the owner, a woman, can see 99 million additional colours not visible to the average person. Some of which could potentially be considered a shade of Octarine or Squant?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Discoveries in colour perception such as this, and similarly other cognitive and visual peculiarities such as Colour Blindness, Synesthesia or Tetrachromacy teach us that colour is never black and white, and cannot be viewed with standardised measures. Unlike humans many animals including some species of spiders, most marsupials, birds, reptiles, and many species of fish, enviably perceive a much wider range of colours.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           When Douglas Adams, author of the
           <em>
            The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
           </em>
           series speaks of a super intelligent shade of blue he names Hooloovoo, or Reese from
           <em>
            Malcolm in the Middle
           </em>
           mixes blue and yellow to create Blellow, naturally we laugh. But as the world is rich in biodiversity with species yet to be discovered, is it not too much to ask that the colour spectrum is only limited by ourselves and our understanding?
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Next time you are flicking through a science fiction novel, scanning the net or watching some fantastic film that makes reference to an absurd colour, that sight has not seen nor ear heard, pause for a moment and wonder if this colour is science fact, waiting to be proven.

           Every now and then a project lands on our desk that will at first challenge us with its scope but surprise us with its results. Mason Grogan Medical gave us a collection of dense information that we turned into an easily navigated, beautiful-to-thumb-through product portfolio.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Mason Grogan Medical provide innovative and high performance materials to medical professionals and pride themselves with Materials Intelligence. Aimed at podiatrists with the need for quick, easy to read information, the big challenge for us was to make sure there was both consistency and readily accessible information, whilst appearing well-designed and visually appealing to encourage sales. Sophisticated divider pages showcased macro photography of the technological materials available.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           At the The Australian Podiatry Conference held at the Sydney Convention Centre we designed an interactive exhibition stand that extended the use of the macro photography. Business cards, advertisements, screensavers, flyers and posters that showcased the new-look were also created.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Our clients at Mason Grogan Medical have received overwhelmingly positive feedback from within the company and from clients. We recently received an email from their Managing Director, Meredyth Grogan, saying that the catalogue has already been snapped up by universities as a learning tool.

           The Blue Bias

           <em>
            For me, each nuance of a color is in some way an individual, a being who is not only from the same race as the base color, but who definitely possesses a distinct character and personal soul.

           Yves Klein
          </p>
          <p>
           Its hard to imagine a career based upon the use of a single colour but thats exactly what French artist, Yves Klein, did. In response to what Klein said was a complete misinterpretation to an exhibition that explored a range of monochrome textures, and thus began an era in his art that focused on the exploration of one colour only  blue.
          </p>
          <p>
           This era, known as the Blue Epoch, was to become Kleins legacy to the art world. Not only did it revel in going against the established notions of art and practice, but it was also the setting for the creation of Yves Klein Blue, or as he called it, IKB International Klein Blue. For an exhibition held in Milan, Klein  with the aid of friend and paint dealer Edouard Adam  created a unique ultramarine pigment that resembled the bright blue once created by crushed lapis lazuli in religious iconography.
          </p>
          <p>
           This bright, almost electric, blue was created through suspending the ultramarine pigment in a synthetic resin known as Rhodopas, or what Klein was to call The Medium. This allowed the pigment to retain its natural brilliance that, when used in traditional linseed oils, would often be rendered dull. For the exhibition, Klein applied the paint in a thick, layered technique across eleven canvases that surrounded the viewer in a sea of bright, iridescent blues. To promote the exhibition, Klein released 1001 blue balloons and sent out postcards with stamps of IKB attached that he had bribed the local post office to accept as legitimate. That is colour dedication right there!
          </p>
          <p>
           Klein went about applying this blue to various approaches to art  appropriating mass-produced recreations of famous sculptures, he painted them with his shade of blue and turned them into something rather alien and uncanny. He painted the bodies of women who then rolled themselves across large sheets of canvas and paper laid out on the floor  capturing their curves and motion in an electric, vivid blue process of movement.
          </p>
          <p>
           For us, that something as simple as the colour blue could be used to revolutionise the art world is incredibly inspiring. We particularly appreciate Kleins obsession with the impact of colour and the idea that colour can still be an area for the development of groundbreaking ideas.

           How do you make an event app more fun? Just add colour, and movement.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           To help relaunch their event app, IStageEvent, Staging Connections asked us to develop a suite of e-brochures and a video that explained the apps features and benefits. IStageEvent is designed to replace the traditional (and rather wasteful) paper flyers handed out at events and conferences. It informs you of keynote speakers, schedules, site-maps and bios, all in the one place, and keeps you up to date with reminders and any last minute changes to the program.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           When approaching this brief, we needed something that was entertaining, communicated clearly and stayed in line with the Staging Connections brand. During this workshopping process we remembered how we learnt most things while we were growing up  cartoons!
          </p>
          <p>
           Using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects, we created a short video that used simple white icons and colourful backdrops. We developed a soundtrack to play in the background and collaborated with the Marketing Team to create an appropriate script with vocal talents provided by one of their tech guys. It was a lot of fun making the illustrations pop, zoom about and come to life on the screen.

           Some of us here at Another Colour are old enough to remember when television stations actually turned off late at night. There would literally be nothing but test patterns across all channels until 5am when the early morning news and cartoons would begin. And while they might not have intended to be, the geometric shapes and combinations of colour were a lot of fun. They inspired us to make our own test pattern for the Coming Soon holding page of this website. With our own twist, of course.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           Recently, we had the pleasure of experiencing an altogether different kind of test pattern. As part of the ISEA (International Symposium of Electronic Art) and Vivid Live festivals, Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda turned one of the halls at Redferns Carriageworks into a large, interactive light- and sound-scape that was called
           <em>
            Test Pattern #5
           </em>
           , an immersive audio-visual installation inspired by computer programming data which converts information into barcode and binary patterns.
          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           To say it was overwhelming would be an understatement. As soon as we walked in, we were immersed in a room that was filled by a thumping bass and overlapped with digital sounds. These sounds were then translated into a corresponding digital light show that ran down the middle of the room where you were invited to stand (or run as some of the kids clearly loved doing). It was disorientating, mind-blowing and completely amazing all at the same time. One of the most interesting parts was watching people move, as their bodies seemed to jump from one spot to another making their way through the juxtaposing lights of the installation.
          </p>
          <p>
           We captured a little of it on video where you can catch a glimpse of our resident writer, Ben, hidden amongst all the other kids. Warning: loud!

          <p>
           Welcome to the very first entry of our new blog on our new website to celebrate our new identity, Another Colour. This will be a place where we will share news, updates on current projects, what inspires us, ideas, and all of our random thoughts and thinks about the wonderful industry we work in.
          </p>
          <p>
           But first things first  why the change? Whilst we still offer the same quality of work and service, we felt that we had reached a point where we had outgrown the simplicity that Steve Scott Graphic Design implied. And for several reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most obvious was that we had become just that  a we. Eight years after its humble beginnings in a home office in Darlinghurst, SSGD had grown to become a collective of creative people. This has also meant that we have definitely outgrown our living room, and we now occupy a sparkling new office in Surry Hills at the Interchange (fun fact  the studios are owned by the one and only Ken Done) and a satellite office in Melbourne.
          </p>
          <p>
           Secondly, as the nature of the industry and the requirements of our clients changed, so have our range of services and skills developed in tangent. More than half of our work is now online: websites, social media and electronic direct marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thirdly, our no frills name wasnt inspiring  we thought it needed to be changed to reflect the scope of what we now do. Add to the fact that it also created the longest ever email address! SSGD had finally reached a point where it was no longer represented who we had become.
          </p>
          <p>
           And we think that Another Colour does exactly that. Its about seeing things in another light. Its about being a different studio  embracing the challenges that come with your project and understanding pragmatism and creativity are not mutually exclusive. Its also about never forgetting to have fun with what we do  to play, experiment and learn whilst doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
           This isnt just a website about our new identity and the work we do. Its a place where we hope to share, discuss and inspire. It will be our gallery, our laboratory and our playground. We hope you visit us often.

           Over the years we have been involved in many naming projects: from company names to more fleeting names such as those used to brand an event or a campaign. By far the hardest naming project has been re-naming ourselves: from Steve Scott Graphic Design to Another Colour.
          </p>
          <p>
           So how do we go about choosing a name? There are five phases to our naming projects.

          <h2>
           The fourphases of namingour design studio
          </h2>
          <p>
           Over the years we have been involved in many naming projects: from company names to more fleeting names such as those used to brand an event or a campaign. By far the hardest naming project has been re-naming ourselves: from Steve Scott Graphic Design to Another Colour.
          </p>
          <p>
           So how do we go about choosing a name? There are four phases to our naming projects.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Phase one  the assessment
          </h2>
          <p>
           Sometimes you just feel like a change: you might get a haircut, or buy a colourful pair of sneakers. But you rarely change your name (unless youre on the run). So why did we do it?
          </p>
          <p>
           This was something that we thought about long and hard. Do we really need a new name? Or do we just need a new look? What were the pros and cons? Changing our name could be costly  registering the new name, updating stationery, changing signage and relaunching our website all adds up. Would we lose all our brand equity that we have built up? After months of discussion we decided that a new name should really only be adopted if our current name was truly ineffective. And since it no longer was (read about that story
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/blog/another-colour-our-new-identity/" title="Another Colour  our new identity">
            here
           </a>
           ) we decided to take up the challenge.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Phase two  the word map
          </h2>
          <p>
           To come up with a name, we started a list. Anytime we heard a word we liked we added it to the list. It didnt have to be for any reason in particular  could have been spotted on the side of an ice-cream truck. If we liked it, we just added it. Seeing words from other team members often catalysed a string of new words that were completely unexpected. We used
           <a href="http://www.wordnik.com/" target="_blank" title="Wordnik">
            wordnik
           </a>
           to uncover synonyms and hyponyms. Then we paired different words for poetic effect: rhymes, alliteration, consonance and assonance. We looked for words that had multiple meanings, words that were relevant to our business and words that were euphonic.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Phase three  the shortlist
          </h2>
          <p>
           In reality, this was actually a longlist. A very long list. We toyed with numerous ideas that ranged from the technical (
           <em>
            Flux, Twindragon, Vertex
           </em>
           ), to cute (
           <em>
            Lost Mittens, Ugly Duckling, Plastic Kitten
           </em>
           ), to random (
           <em>
            Blushing Crow
           </em>
           ). Old names (
           <em>
            Loom, Challice, Harbinger, Talisman
           </em>
           ) and names we made up (
           <em>
            Vixo, Ography
           </em>
           ). Pretty names (
           <em>
            Gossamer, Lucent, Inkling, Meld
           </em>
           ) and ugly names (
           <em>
            Concoction, Fat Lattice
           </em>
           ). Word plays (
           <em>
            Hue Diligence, About Space, Colourbind
           </em>
           ) to names that were poetic (
           <em>
            Rubber Hydra, Shapeshift
           </em>
           ). We really liked
           <em>
            Playpen
           </em>
           (we play with pens)  but googling that kept bringing up porn.
          </p>
          <h2>
           Phase four  trying it on
          </h2>
          <p>
           When we finally settled on Another Colour, we put it through
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/blog/the-naming-checklist/" title="The Naming Checklist">
            The Checklist
           </a>
           , a series of questions we ask to ensure the success of a new name. We ran the name past a test group to see it there were any pitfalls.
          </p>
          <p>
           We stuck it up on the pin board in our studio in large letters and over the next few weeks it became a little shrine that we looked at every day as we tried to decide if it suited us. Gradually, the cheeky half-rhyme grew on us more and more and it inspired a lot of other ideas to roll out with our new identity.
          </p>
          <p>
           We liked the many different and relevant meanings the name could convey. It highlighted the ways we do things differently from our competitors  offering both creativity and pragmatism to all our projects. It also represented the importance of having fun with design and a celebration of colour. One of our favourite aspects of the name is that on each page of our website our logo literally becomes, another colour.

            How to Nail a Name

          </p>
          <p dir="ltr">
           1. Keep it simple.
           <br/>
           2. Keep it short.
           <br/>
           3. Will it stand the test of time?
           <br/>
           4. Does it resonate with the target market?
           <br/>
           5. Can it be easily pronounced?
           <br/>
           6. Can it be twisted around by a mischievous journalist?
           <br/>
           7. Consider cultural sensitivities?
           <br/>
           8. Does it have layers of meaning?
           <br/>
           9. Never chose the first name you like (people are likely to pick the familiar over the new).
           <br/>
           10. Be prepared for people to hate it at first (it can take time).
          </p>
          <p>
           Through our own experience we have added the following:
          </p>
          <p>
           11. Is it unique and original?
           <br/>
           12. Is a url available?
           <br/>
           13. Try the say it back to me test. Say the name to a friend and ask them to repeat it back to you. If they say what? or huh? it might not be the most effective. If youve made up a word, phonetic spelling may help (
           <em>
            Google, Accor
           </em>
           ).
           <br/>
           14. Is it memorable? Alliteration (
           <em>
            American Apparel
           </em>
           ), onomatopoeia (
           <em>
            Bing, Snap
           </em>
           ), consonance (
           <em>
            Kodak, Twitter
           </em>
           ), rhymes (
           <em>
            7Eleven
           </em>
           ), half rhymes (
           <em>
            Another Colour
           </em>
           ) and wordplays (
           <em>
            Avant Card
           </em>
           ) can help.
           <br/>
           15. Think twice about phunky spelling of everyday words (
           <em>
            Kwik Kopy
           </em>
           ). It can help people find you on google, but it can be hard to remember.
           <br/>
           16. Avoid highly generic names that are forgettable and hard to give personality.
           <br/>
           17. Does it allow for future growth?
           <em>
            Burger King
           </em>
           will always be associated with burgers but
           <em>
            McDonalds
           </em>
           have more opportunity to diversify.
           <br/>
           18. Does the name have positive connotations?
           <br/>
           19. Avoid old tricks. Acronyms (
           <em>
            BMW, IBM
           </em>
           ), spaceless names (
           <em>
            FedEx, TeamWorks
           </em>
           ) and Web 2.0 (
           <em>
            flickr, tumblr
           </em>
           ) have been done to death.
           <br/>
           20. Whats your gut reaction? Do you like it? Is it you? Even if you tick 1 to 19, this is the most important.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the beginning of the renaming process, its important not to confine yourself during word mapping sessions so you can allow for full creativity to flow. (
           <a href="http://anothercolour.com.au/blog/how-to-name-a-studio/" title="How To Name A Studio">
            How to name a studio
           </a>
           tells the process we used for Another Colour.) This is a great checklist to use at the end to whittle down your options and find a robust solution.

           Many would agree. Reminiscent of slime, snot, pus or that 80s fluoro top you used to own, there can be very primal objections to the colour chartreuse.
          </p>
          <p>
           For such a bold, brassy colour it has a name born from humble origins. The
           <a href="http://www.chartreuse.fr/">
            Chartreuse
           </a>
           liqueur website explains that the French word chartreuse means charter house  the monasteries that the monks of the Carthusian order live in, who started producing the liqueur in 1764. Made with 130 secret ingredients, chartreuse was originally sold as an elixir, or medicine.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you taste the liqueur one can pick up subtle hints of honey, native herbs and aromatic floral notes. These notes also translate visually creating a complex construction of shades. Chartreuse is known for its emotive qualities such as flexibility, growth and expansion (Jane Meredith Adams,
           <em>
            Natural Solutions
           </em>
           magazine).
          </p>
          <p>
           If you still hate chartreuse then maybe its not the colour, maybe you are just a plain jane, vanilla loving, neutral-ist. We love chartreuse for its story, its energy and because its a colour that moves you.

           Music is an integral part of our nine to five here at Another Colour. From the moment we step in the door each morning til the lights go out, its winding its way out of the speakers and into the studio. Bringing us anything from the relentless minimal electro beat of Robyns
           <em>
            Dancing On My Own
           </em>
           to the raw unfettered sounds of an acoustic guitar on the latest album by Wavves; a high soprano on Bjrks
           <em>
            Homogenic
           </em>
           or the syncopated rhyming of MIA on a track like
           <em>
            Bamboo Banga
           </em>
           . And then everything in between.

           Sometimes it can be found in the background but often it creeps to the fore when we least expect it and especially when our favourite song comes on  we could listen LCD Soundsystems
           <em>
            Someone Great
           </em>
           ad nauseum.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its there when we choose that corporate colour palette or refine a new brands identity, its providing the essential back beat to keep us well paced on a tough project or simply making ourselves that first, second or third cup of coffee to get us through the day.
          </p>
          <p>
           Few rules govern our selection of this daily soundtrack, but the need for variety and a thirst for the new oversee all playlists. Old, new, male, female, fast then slow, the hyped (Daft Punks
           <em>
            Random Access Memories
           </em>
           ) and the underplayed (anything by Alpine), sparse for a moment and a wall of sound the next. We never press pause because the music never stops.
