         Aleister Crowley
        </b>
        was born October 12th, 1875
at 36 Clarendon Square, Leamington, Warwickshire, England as
        <b>
         Edward Alexander Crowley
        </b>
        into a wealthy and religious family at the height of the
        <a target="main">
         Victorian era
        </a>
        .
Crowley despised and rebelled against his family at every
turn, even renaming himself 'Aleister' to avoid sharing the same
first name as his father, who passed away when Crowley was 11.

        <font size="3">
         Like many naughty young boys, Aleister entertained himself through
several activities, notably creating a "homemade firework" with
which he nearly killed himself, as well as torturing a cat in
several horrible ways to test the "nine lives" theory. He
dispensed of his virginity at age 14 with the help of a maid. At
17, he contracted gonorrhea with the help of a street walker.

        Crowley went on to attend
        <b>
         Cambridge University
        </b>
        , where he apparently studied alpine climbing, living in the
manner of the privileged aristocracy and having a great deal of sex
with both men and women. He also began working in the Diplomatic
Service, but as Crowley himself said "the fame of an ambassador
rarely outlives a century", and Crowley wished to make a greater
imprint on the world.

        Having had this epiphany, he began searching for more lasting
pursuits and in 1898, at age 23, Crowley began
his path of magical enlightenment by joining
        <a>
         The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
        </a>
        .
Led by
        <a>
         Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers
        </a>
        other members included such notables such as
        <a>
         William Butler Yeats
        </a>
        , Maud Gonne,
        <b>
         Constance Wilde

        ,
(the wife of
        <a>
         Oscar Wilde
        </a>
        ),
        <a>

        <a>
         Sax Rohmer

      <p class="link1">
       <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="3">
        The Golden Dawn's contribution to the Western Magical Tradition is
definitely worth noting, because it was their synthesis of the
        <a>
         Kabbalah
        </a>
        , alchemy, tarot, astrology, divination, numerology,
        <a>
         Masonic
        </a>
        symbolism, and ritual magic into one coherent and logical
system which led them to influence countless occult organizations
to come. Mathers adapted the system of magic outlined by
        <a>
         Eliphas Levi
        </a>
        ,
and through Levi, the spiritual ancestry of the Golden Dawn was
traced to the
        <b>
         Rosicrucian Brotherhood
        </b>
        and from there, through the Kabbalah to
        <a>
         Ancient Egypt
        </a>
        .
Mathers' authority was held in part by his link to the "Secret Chiefs", the
"true leaders" of the Order, with whom Mathers could
communicate with only through metaphysical means.

        Adopting the magical name Frater 'Perdurabo', Latin for "I Will
Endure", Crowley advanced quickly through the ranks of the Golden
Dawn, initially studying under
        <a>
         Alan Bennett
        </a>
        ,
who was Mathers' spiritual heir. Bennett left England in 1899 for health reasons, moving to
        <b>
         Ceylon
        </b>
        , what it now
        <b>
         Sri Lanka
        </b>
        , 
where he joined a
        <a>
         buddhist
        </a>
        monastery.  Unfortunately, Crowley,
left to his own devices, managed to severely fragment the order
through sheer force of personality. In 1900, he completed the studies necessary in order to obtain the rank of Adeptus Minor, however the London controllers of the Order, disapproving of Crowley's homosexual dabblings, refused to advance him. Crowley travelled to
        <b>
         <a>
          Paris
         </a>
        </b>
        ,
where Mathers himself performed the ceremony, which only served to further outrage the London members.

      </p>
      <p class="link1">
       <font face="verdana,arial,helvetica" size="3">
        The ensuing uproar caused several of the London members to resign,
and Mathers was eventually expelled from the Order, specifically on the
grounds that he had put its authority into jeopardy by revealing his suspicions that the founding documents linking them to an older occult order in
        <b>
         Germany
        </b>
        had been forged by another member (which they had been). Crowley attempted to obtain possession of the Order's property on behalf of Mathers, interrupting one of their rituals in full Highland regalia, wearing a black hood. As with any serious dispute between occultists, astral attacks ensued. Crowley reported that the rebels directed hostile magic against him as evidenced by the fact that his rubber raincoat burst spontaneously into flames and he found himself in a "furious temper" for no reason, so extreme that horses ran away in fear at the sight of him. In the end, however, it was the
        <b>
         police
        </b>
        who resolved the matter.

        Crowley was expelled from the Golden Dawn, only 2 years after joining,
chiefly through the efforts of
        <a>
         William Butler Yeats

        ,
who reportedly did not approve of Crowley's magical methods.

He also married
        <b>

        <b>
         Egypt

        ,
in March of 1904, that Crowley had the most important experience of his life. Crowley had been trying for several years to contact his
        <b>
         Holy Guardian Angel
        </b>
        using the methods described in
        <a>
         The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage
        </a>
        with no success. However it was in
        <b>
         Cairo
        </b>
        that Crowley finally encountered an entity known as
        <b>
         Aiwass
        </b>
        ,
whom Crowley believed was his

         According to Crowley's own account, while (unsuccessfully) trying to summon sylphs for his wife's amusement, she began to receive a very
powerful psychic message from the
         <a>
          Ancient Egyptian
         </a>
         god
         <b>

         Skeptical of his wife's sudden clairvoyancy, Crowley demanded answers to a series of questions from her, of which she had no possible prior knowledge. Upon answering all things correctly, he took her to a museum, and after passing several images of Horus (which the still skeptical Crowley reports, he "noted with silent glee"), she pointed across the room to a stele which could not be clearly seen from where they stood. When they examined the stele (now referred to as the
         <a href="http://images.staticjw.com/pop/9172/stele.jpg">
          Stele of Revealing

it was painted with the image of Horus, and to Crowley's further conviction, it was labelled as item number
         <a>
          666

personal moniker in rebellion to his religious upbringing many
years before. After invoking Horus, Crowley made his fateful breakthrough. For three days Crowley took dictation from the entity identifying itself as
         <b>
          Aiwass

         , the resulting text,

         Interpretation of what "Do What Thou Wilt..." in contemporary
times seems to have deteriorated into "do whatever you want...",
however it seems clear that the meaning was more along the lines
of 'doing that which your higher self dictates'. The higher self,
or "Will" is present in all of enlightened people. In order to
follow your "Will", one must know oneself. And self
knowledge is the central basis of most successful philosophies.

         According to Crowley, Mathers reportedly sent
one of his followers, a vampire, to him. She appeared to him in the guise of a "young woman of bewitching beauty", but was able to defeat her, and she was "transformed into hag of sixty, bent and decrepit". Mathers then sent a "current of evil" which struck Crowley's bloodhounds dead and caused his servants to fall ill. Crowley retaliated by summoning up the forces of the demon
         <b>
          Beelzebub

         and his 49 attendant fiends. Following this
effort, Mathers' magical assaults on Crowley ceased. Years later,
when Mathers passed away of influenza, many felt that Crowley had murdered him with magic.

         In 1909, Crowley divorced his wife, on the grounds of her
alcoholism. The divorce enabled Crowley to indulge in his passions for magick, drugs, and women unchecked by the constraints of married life.

         In 1910, Crowley was contacted by the head of a German magical
order known as the
         <b>
          <a>
           Ordo Templi Orientis
          </a>

(alternately translated as either "the Order of the Templars of
the East" and "the Order of the Temple of the Orient" in a variety
of sources.) The
         <b>
          OTO
         </b>
         accused Crowley of having published the secret of their IXth degree. Crowley was mystified until a conversation
revealed that a passage he published led the
         <b>
          OTO
         </b>
         to assume that
Crowley was involved in sex magick which they used in their
rituals. He join the order shortly thereafter, and in 1912, became
the head of the English speaking branch of the Order.

         The Abbey, however, was an "unsanitary hovel". Crowley's addiction to
both
         <b>

         and
         <b>

         ,
Crowley's hopeful novel about a couple struggling to free
themselves of their drug addiction. Sadly, the truth was much more
grim. Poupee died there, while Crowley was travelling between
London, Paris and the Abbey. It was when one of the Crowley's

         <b>
          Raoul Loveday

         There seems to be some confusion as to Crowley's spelling of the
word magic. According to Cavendish, the addition of the letter
'k' by Crowley represented the sexual aspects of his magical
studies, the letter 'k' being the first letter of
         <i>
          kteis
         </i>
         which is the Greek word for female genitalia. However I have been
told that reasons for the spelling change were purely
numerological by a member of the
         <b>
          OTO
         </b>
         . Either
reason seems likely and acceptable. What is not acceptable is the
profusion of words mispelled in some sort of pseudo-appropriation
of the power of the word magick. I have noticed several writers
freely using the word 'magickian', which I am willing to tolerate.
A reprehensible abuse of this is certainly 'astrologickal' which
I believe was repeatedly used in a book published by Llewellyn.

          Thelema

         is Greek for "The Will". Crowley used the word Thelema to
represent his most important concept, the statement "Do As Thou
Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law". Crowley's entire religion,
(Crowleyanity as it sometimes referred to by some cynical authors)
liberally mixes elements of
         <b>

mildly Crowley and his followers would have been received
if they were judged according to our contemporary standards. Thelemites, those who follow the laws of Thelema, often greet one another with the
shorthand "
         <b>
          93

         ", which is the numerical value of the phrase "Love

occultist, Crowley remains unparalleled. How many contemporary
practitioners can actually claim to have manifested a lasting change on
the world. After all, changing the world around you is what magic
is all about, and Aleister Crowley did it better than anyone. To
say that Crowley was ahead of his time would be an understatement.
Aside from the glamour of his "wickedness" which will always have a
certain appeal, his greatest gift was perhaps his ability to
reshape the theory of magic from a modern psychological standpoint,
refashioning it into a tool for the New Aeon, a contribution that
has yet to be matched or exceeded.
