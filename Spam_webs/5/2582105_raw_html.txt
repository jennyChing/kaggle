         Did You Know?
        </strong>
        In Texas, Electricity Suppliers check your credit before you can sign up for an energy plan.  Will shopping for electricity hurt your credit score?  There are two kinds of credit checks, a soft credit check and a hard credit check.  The soft credit check is a simple check that does not impact your credit score. A hard credit check can impact your credit score.  Luckily for you, energy suppliers only employ a soft credit check in order to approve you as a customer.  Shopping for electricity will not hurt your credit score.  So shop on!  Click

        We vet all plans on our site. We individually review each plan we put on our site. We only offer options that we feel are good, quality plans. We do not have teaser-rate, short-term plans on our site. Rather we choose to display quality, longer-term, fixed-price plans that give you some certainty around your energy budget for months to come.

         Fun Fact:
        </strong>
        According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, deregulated electricity markets, like Texas, are increasing the demand for renewable energy.  In fact, Texas now leads the country in wind powered electricity generation!

        Many of SearchForEnergys Suppliers offer
        <strong>
         Green
        </strong>
        or
        <strong>
         Renewable
        </strong>
        or even
        <strong>
         Wind
        </strong>
        powered electricity plans. Deregulated energy markets support renewable electricity generation by allowing you to express your demand for green electricity. Without the flexibility of plan offerings in deregulated markets, renewable energy generation capacity may not be where it is today.  Pretty cool.

        One big factor impacting your power to choose is that your plan eventually expires.  Once your plan expires, your supplier can raise your rate considerably.  You can wipe out all the savings you achieved in as little as one month by letting your plan expire.
