       : Mng Hao-jan (689-740AD) lived in the mountains where he studied the Classics and wrote poetry. He tried for the Civil Service but failed the examination. He was a friend of Wang Wei and Li Po. He was careless of worldly achievement and often arrived too drunk to work. The Dragon here is used to mean drink and Imperial disdain, while the blossom is the fragrance of the Tao.

       Waking to see the deep garden.

       One bird calls among the flowers.

       Is there wine? Ah, fill the cup.

       Sing and watch the white moon rise,

       Remember how Tung built us a place to drink in
      </p>
      <p>
       At Lo-yang south of the Tien-ching bridge?
      </p>
      <p>
       White jade and gold bought songs and laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       We drank forgetting Court and princes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those amongst us, wisest and bravest
      </p>
      <p>
       On all this side of rivers and oceans,

      <p>
       Hearts high as clouds, and you and I together,

      <p>
       Cared nothing at crossing lakes and mountains
      </p>

       Only to share our thoughts and feelings.
      </p>
      <p class="line-break">

       Then I went out south-east to cut the laurel,
      </p>
      <p>
       You north of Lo River still lost in dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
       No joy in being parted. Soon back again in mountains,
      </p>
      <p>
       Tracking the thirty-six twists and turns of valley,
      </p>
      <p>
       By the streams bright with a thousand flowers,
      </p>
      <p>
       By endless waters,
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing pine-trees sighing,
      </p>
      <p>
       Till we met the Hang-tung Governor
      </p>
      <p>
       On a gold and silver saddle,
      </p>
      <p>
       And Hu the True-Taoist drew us with his pipe playing,
      </p>
      <p>
       Making unearthly music out of the high tower,
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange sounds of the mating phoenix.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governors sleeves kept time to the music,
      </p>
      <p>
       So that he rose, drunk, and danced a little,
      </p>
      <p>
       Brought his brocade coat, covered my body.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fell asleep, head resting in his lap.
      </p>
      <p>
       By day our hearts rose to the nine heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
       At evening we scattered like blown stars or rain,
      </p>
      <p>
       I to my far mountain over hills and waters,
      </p>
      <p>
       You to your own house by the bridge of Wei.

       Sharing your wealth, thinking nothing of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wine there - in cups of amber,
      </p>
      <p>
       Food there - on plates of jade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ate and drank, no thoughts of returning.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went out to the west. The river parts there,
      </p>
      <p>
       Round the ancient shrine of a Prince of Chou.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boats on the waters to drums and piping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Waves made of dragon scales. Jade-green rushes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We drank and drank, lived the passing moments,
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgetting how they go like blossoms or snowfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flushed with wine, warm in glow of sunset,
      </p>
      <p>
       The hundred-foot deep pool mirroring bright faces,
      </p>
      <p>
       Dancing-girls delicate as willows in the moonlight,
      </p>
      <p>
       Notes lost in the silken sleeves fluttering.
      </p>
      <p>
       A white breeze blew their song to the sky,
      </p>
      <p>
       Winding through the air, twisting in the cloud-lanes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never again. Never again such joy.

      </p>
      <p>
       Met once more south of Weis bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parted again north of Tsos terrace.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you ask my feelings at parting,
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       No way to say whats in the heart. Never.

She is no longer young, herself a chilled autumn moon. The grievance is unspoken, but implicit.

She has exchanged the Phoenix zither for the Mandarin Duck zither (decorated as such?) that is she has exchanged sensual feelings symbolised by the Phoenix for those of conjugal affection symbolised by the Mandarin ducks. The sidelong glance was the way a dancing girl might attract a mans attention. The Yang sunlight has faded. Yin mist, petals, damp silk and white moon bringing dew are emblems of her tears.

      <p>
       Keeping company with the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking back I see the paths Ive taken
      </p>
      <p>
       Blue now, blue beneath the skyline.
      </p>
      <p>
       You greet me, show the hidden track,
      </p>
      <p>
       Where children pull back hawthorn curtains,
      </p>
      <p>
       Reveal green bamboo, the secret path,
      </p>
      <p>
       Vines that touch the travellers clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love finding space to rest,
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear wine to enjoy with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wind in the pines till voices stop,
      </p>
      <p>
       Songs till the Ocean of Heaven pales.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get drunk and you are happy,
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of us pleased to forget the world.

       Quiet again I cast in dark waters,

       </strong>
       : The Mulberry and Garlic Rivers are north and west beyond the Great Wall (as in the old song they represent short-term and ultimately worthless objectives). The Parthian Seas denote the far West and Turkestan, say Parthia and Central Asia of Han times, from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian and Aral Seas. The Tien Shan are the Celestial Mountains dividing China from Turkestan. The Huns are the Hsiung-nu of Central Asia. The Tang armies were defeated in northern Turkestan at the battle of the Taras River in 751AD. The last lines are a paraphrase of lines from the Tao Te Ching (Book I, XXXI).
