            The Amsterdam Court of
Appeals has ordered the
            <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7842344.stm">
             criminal
prosecution
            </a>
            of a Dutch Member of Parliament for criticizing Islam. The
courts ruling overturns a previous decision by Dutch public prosecutors, who had
determined that there was not enough evidence to charge
            <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/17/netherlands.islam">
             Geert
Wilders
            </a>
            , leader of the conservative Freedom Party, for hate crimes after he
produced a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitna_(film)">
             hard-hitting film
            </a>
            that says Islam promotes violence. In a written judgment, the appeals court said
that by attacking the symbols of the Muslim religion, [Wilders] also insulted
Muslim believers.
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            The ruling will please
the Dutch Muslim immigrant groups who asked the appeals court to force the
justice department to prosecute Wilders for expressing his opinions. But many
others say the prosecution is an alarming attack on free speech by politically
correct activist judges who are trying to silence criticism of the growing
power of Islam in Europe.
            <o p="">
            </o>
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Wilders, who
frequently speaks out against the Islamization of the Netherlands, said the
judgment of the court [is] an attack on the freedom of expression.... Participation
in the public debate has become a dangerous activity. If you give your opinion,
you risk being prosecuted.... Who will stand up for our culture if I am
silenced?
            <o p="">
            </o>
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Of course, Wilders is only
the latest in a line of Dutch citizens who have run afoul of the pro-Muslim
thought police in post-Christian Holland.
In 2002, Dutch politician
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pim_Fortuyn">
             Pim
Fortuyn
            </a>
            was assassinated for his views on Islam and Muslim immigration. In
2004, Dutch film maker
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_van_Gogh_(film_director)">
             Theo van Gogh
            </a>
            was stabbed to death for producing a movie that criticized Islam. In 2006, former
Dutch lawmaker
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_Hirsi_Ali">
             Ayaan
Hirsi Ali
            </a>
            was forced to flee the country after criticizing the mistreatment
of women in Islamic societies.

            </o>
           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            What makes the Wilders
case different, however, is that the Dutch state itself is now caving in to pressure
from Muslim immigrants who seek to criminalize any opinions that could be
deemed to insult Islam or criticize Muslim immigration.

            But Holland is not the only European country at
war with the exercise of free speech. In Austria, for example, Member of
Parliament
            <a href="http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/446266/index.do">
             Susanne
Winter
            </a>
            was convicted for the crime of saying that in todays system the
Prophet Muhammad would be considered a child molester, referring to his
marriage to a six-year-old child. She was also convicted for incitement for warning
that Austria
faces an Islamic immigration tsunami.

            In Italy, the journalist and author
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriana_Fallaci">
             Oriana Fallaci
            </a>
            was taken
to court for writing that Islam brings hate instead of love and slavery
instead of freedom. She died in September 2006, two months after the start of her
trial. In France,

             Michel
Houellebecq
            </a>
            was taken to court for calling Islam the stupidest religion. He
was acquitted in October 2002. More recently, animal rights activist
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Bardot">
             Brigitte Bardot
            </a>
            was
convicted in June 2008 by a Paris
court for inciting racial hatred for demanding that Muslims anaesthetize animals
before slaughtering them.

             2006 Racial and
Religious Hatred Act
            </a>
            , which creates a new crime of intentionally stirring
up religious hatred against people on religious grounds, has led to zealousness
bordering on the absurd. In Nottingham, for
example, the

             Eid

             Yorkshire
Coast College
            </a>
            removed the words Christmas and Easter from their calendar so
as not to offend Muslims. In Scotland,

            apologized for featuring a German shepherd puppy as part
of a campaign to publicize its new non-emergency telephone number. The postcards
are potentially offensive to citys 3,000-strong Muslim community because
Islamic legal tradition says that dogs are impure.

also made to disrupt council meetings to allow for Muslim prayer. Meanwhile, the
council renamed a staff Christmas party as a festive meal.

            Nor are Muslims the only
ones trying to restrict free speech in Europe.
In Britain,
for example, the government is facing pressure from homosexual rights activists
to overturn a
            <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmbills/009/2009009.pdf">
             free
speech protection amendment
            </a>
            added to a controversial gay hate law. The
free speech protection clause, which states that criticizing homosexual practice
or urging people to refrain from such conduct will not, in itself, be a crime,
was added to the new offense of incitement to homophobic hatred. But now the
government wants to remove that protection. The crime of inciting homophobic
hatred includes any words or behavior which is threatening and intended to stir
up hatred. It carries a maximum sentence of seven years in prison.

            At the European level,
meanwhile, government ministers from the 27 member states of the European Union
are debating a draft

             EU
Directive
            </a>
            that aims to outlaw discrimination and harassment in the
provision of goods and services. The new legislation would, for example, shut
down Christian adoption agencies if they refuse to provide same-sex couples
with children. Indeed, the definition of harassment is so broad that even moderate
explanations of Christian beliefs on sexual conduct or other religions could be
considered a crime.

           </p>
           <p class="MsoNormal">
            Europes war on free speech is the result of a
profound identity crisis, one that is being generated by the blanket abandonment
of traditional Judeo-Christian values coupled with mass immigration from Muslim
countries. But in their zeal to criminalize free thought and free speech, the leftwing
guardians of Orwellian political correctness are systematically destroying European
democracy.

            Not only are European
elites using hate crime legislation to silence people with opinions that do not
conform to official state policies. They are also dividing Europeans into two
groups (the majority and the minority), each with different rights and
responsibilities. The minority (Muslims, homosexuals, Socialists) is imposing
its will upon the majority (non-Muslim, heterosexuals, non-Socialists) by aggressively
prosecuting those who refuse to fall into line.

            , which means they can be punished for expressing the wrong
opinions. But Europes war on free speech
should serve as a warning to Americans about the perils of complacency. Indeed,

            says it intends to strengthen federal hate crimes legislation,
expand hate crimes protection by passing the Matthew Shepard Act, and
reinvigorate enforcement at the Department of Justices Criminal Section. Some
politicians have also expressed support for re-imposing the

             Fairness

            More than 200 years
ago, Thomas Jefferson warned of the slow drift from freedom to tyranny when he observed
that there are rights which it is useless to surrender to the government and

thinking and publishing our thoughts by speaking or writing.

             The freedom of speech does include the freedom of hatred. If I decide to hate blue-eyed people, who can stop me? As long as I follow the law, who can blame me for prefering green-eyed peoplein my life? I can even say out loud that I find blue eyes unpleasant to look at! There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Yet, I would consider myself an idiot to judge people by something they can't influence. The fact that we CAN do something doesn't lead us to doing it, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             But once somebody claims to be a follower of a certain holy book or manifest, I am completely free to judge that person based on that fact. And hatred has absolutelynothing to do with that anymore! I don't hate muslims, I merely understand their holy book to be in direct contradiction to my values, my existence, good manners and the laws of the country I live in. Christianity and Judaism are not doing much better in my eyes, to be honest. Naturally, if I am free to hate, I am even more free to express an unhateful, logical conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a friend who really hates gays. And I have a friend who happens to be gay. And I don't think there's anything wrong with either of them. Most importantly, all 3 of us see Islam as a threat to our lifestyle.

             Having the misfortune to have been born under the sign of Libra, I find it cruel to discover the blindfolded lady now actually sees the justice she delivers,with one eye open. PC'ers, the many, will call us jaundiced, but what of the macular degeneration? Has the Lord appeared before her, and healed her sight that she may now see what the multi-culturalists desire she see?

              GLOBAL ELITE IS NOW CARRYING OUT A WAR AGAINST WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND WESTERN PEOPLE

Other means are used : destruction of moral values, financial globalization, destruction of national sovereign power and freedom of speech, etc.

              Amen, Ribera. Western man is free because Christianity acknowledges his transcendental identity that cannot be monopolized by any worldly power. Hence the doctrine of government by consent, a fundamental Western principle whether the government in question is monarchical or republican. Out of self-interest or ideological fervor, the Western elites now seek to place their governance beyond the reach of Western self-government, self-determination, and liberty. Westerners must renew their jealousy of infringements on constitutional order and reestablish individual, local, and national jurisdictions in their proper arrangements. International jurisdiction should be peripheral, trivial, and revocable.
             </p>
             <p>
              The present economic downturn exposes the risk to nations of placing all their eggs in the international basket. The elites will use it as an excuse to aggrandize their power. The Western peoples should resist in the name of liberty and self-determination, as well as simple prudence and self-respect.

             Obviously, your question cannot be easily answered. Once theginny is out of the bottle, it is very hard to put it back. When freedom of political speech has been lost, it is very difficult to prevent futher encroachments on individual liberties. On this website you can occasionally read about limited attempts in Europeto turn the tide of 'illiberalism'. Think of President Klaus of the Czech Republic, think tanks like Mr Kern's, small new political groupings, this website and others....
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that it is very difficult for contemporary Americans to understand what it means to have to live in a society in which mere speech or opinion can be criminalised by the State, because they have not experienced that in their life-time. And, as tourists they tend to be oblivious to that kind of thing.Some of them may have experienced it to a limited extent as 'speech codes' incolleges and universities, but that was generally not taken 'seriously' and viewed as mere 'child's play'. In any case, at a young age in college they tend to have other 'diversions' and interests....

             I, too, think that is a 'great' flag. Perhaps the swords should be replaced with a pusher and spoon, symbolizing the spoon-feeding of the Eurabia project to the hungry masses.

              Phase I of the experimental cohabitation of Moslems with Westerners has been completed. After decades of Moslem immigration, it is now crystal clear that Moslems and Westerners cannot cohabit without the Moslems asserting their "right" to transform Western cultural, legal, and institutional environments into Moslem environments, thus totally denaturing Western environments. Call it assimilation, if you like, or call it colonization, but Westerners have absolutely nothing to gain, and everything to lose from this process.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that the results of Phase I of the experiment are in, there is no need to proceed to Phase II, the integration of Western and Islamic nations. Instead, all our energies should be focused on reversing the damage that resulted from Phase I. This means: ending 100% of Moslem immigration; encouraging Moslem outmigration; criminalizing Moslem organizations and activities; and eliminating Moslems from the legally protected classes in the various kinds od civil rights legislation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Intelligent people knew long ago, on the basis of history and common sense, that Islam was the devoted enemy of the West and that Moslems were inherently enemies of the West as well. In our supposedly scientific age, history and common do not suffice to determine policy in the face of opposing temptations and delusions, in the absence of empirical information. Now, however, the experiment has been run in a wide variety of Western environments. There is no excuse for a willful refusal to accept the results. The time to begin reversing Phase I is now.

             @ Frank Lee
            </p>
            <p>
             At the bottom of Kern's article, it says it was first published at Pajama's Media. This probably means he originally wrote the article for an American audience.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think Kern is half American and halfEuropean, he lives in Spain and works for a conservative think tank there. Most of the thingshe writes areobviously for mostly American readers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I cannot presume to speak for Kern, but Ido not think he is motivated by Schadenfreude.Nor does he expect the Americans to bail out the Europeans, like Lee seems to think.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like many of us, i thinkKern is genuinely concernedabout what is going on in Europe and is worried about its implications for the US. So i would say, don't shoot the messenger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Americans need to wake up and take their head out of the sand or they will end up in the same mess that Europe is in. I think that is what Kern is trying to say in his article. it is completely clear, I think.

             I understand your point,yet you conclude, "Americans should learn from the bad European (and Canadian!!) example, and should dedicate themselves to ensur[ing] that it does not get repeated in the US." Where in Mr. Kern's article or in your response do either of you suggestwhat Europeans should be doing to rectify the situation in Europe? Isthe situation in Europeso hopeless that one's focus naturally wanders to America? And, by the way, I did not express Schadenfreude at the current predicament in Europe (though Iwould be fullyentitled to considering the generally petty attitude Europeans take toward America's problems). I expressed puzzlement. I am still puzzled.

             @ Frank Lee
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that you are being a bit unfair to Mr Kern. He is reportingon recent deleterious developments in Europe that are very real and truly alarming.He is NOT saying that Europeans expect Americans to do anything about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, with his last rethorical question he is indirectly expressing a fear about possible similar developmentsin the US in the future. Is that so unrealistic? I don't think so. There is little (cultural) difference between much of the European left and much of the American left today. In the US today, at the federal level the left controls both the Executive and the Legislature, while the Supreme Court is (for the moment) in some rough balance, with Justice kennedy holding the wip position.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the positive side, it is true that the First Amendment provides a major bullwark against similar attempts in the US to undermine free speech. And I also think that the US public is probably still much more sensitive to this issue than the European public.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the negative side, however, there is no denying that various parts of the US left are making similar 'noises' of wanting to control mediaoutlets. And the presence of millions of illegals in the US, i.e. the whole immigration debacle, shows that'rule of law' is no longer guaranteedin the US in major areas. Only a few days ago, President Obama signed anExecutive Order that essentially extends government benefits (health care insurance) to a few million children of illegals. So much for rule of law and law enforcement by the Federal Government!
            </p>
            <p>
             While the situation in Europe is dire today with respectto the actual situation of 'freedom of speech' (opinion), do not forget that most European Constitutions also publicly proclaim freedom of speech as a constitutional right.The Second Amendment in the US, also,is only a piece of paper.Whether it 'holds' or gets respected, in the end, is a matter of maintaining a certain civic culture. If the culture further deteriorates, the actual practices in thepolitical system will also deteriorate, and no legal words on paper will preserve liberty.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, there is no rational justification for Americans toexpress Schadenfreude at the current predicament of Europeans. On the contrary, Americans should learn from the bad European (and Canadian!!) example, and should dedicate themselves to ensure that it does not get repeated in the US.

             If Europeanstruly arein the process of losing the right to freely express their beliefs--a fairlymonumental development, if true--Mr. Kern and other European observers should be surveying the practical means by which to rectify the situation.Mr. Kern makes no mention ofpossible ways tohandle the problembut instead concludes his pieceby focusing his attention on the possibility of threats to free expression in the United States. This is puzzling. Why does every problem in Europe lead Europeans to gaze westward across the Atlantic? You are big boys and girls. You can do something about this on your own, can't you? If President Obama does in fact reimpose the so-called Fairness Doctrine, the last thing the American electorate is going to do is take a close look at how messed up Europe is. Rather,American voterswill make a stink and take matters into their own hands, through the ballot boxor by other means. Is yourdemocratic process so deeply corrupted thatthe electoratecan no longer effect change at all? If so, what exactly do you expect the Americans to do about that?
