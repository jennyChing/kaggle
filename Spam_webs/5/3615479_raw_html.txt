    No amount of evidence will dissuade a conspiracy theorist, but when they 
appeal to scientific evidence, they're fair game. And the 9-11 conspiracy sites 
have some very strange science.
   </p>
   <p>
    9-11 conspirators seem to be a mix of liberals still smarting over 2000 and 
ultra-conservatives angry that George Bush Jr. hasn't opened the national parks 
to a land rush. But if Dubya orchestrated a massive conspiracy to bring down the 
World Trade Center as a pretext for launching a Mideast War, why didn't he pull 
off the far simpler trick of faking the discovery of weapons of mass destruction 
in Iraq? Think of it - his biggest political liability could have been avoided 
with a piddling investment in special effects, Bush would be seen as America's 
savior, his strategy would be completely vindicated, and he'd be politically 
unassailable. All it would take would be spritzing an empty factory with the 
ingredients for nerve gas, with just enough cross-contamination to create a 
whiff of the real thing. Yet for some strange reason he didn't do it.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Cause and Effect
   </h2>
   <p>
    We live in a universe of patterns. Once a pattern is established, the burden 
of proof is on people who claim the pattern does not hold. When some philosopher 
of science points out that we cannot
    <i>
     prove
    </i>
    that the sun will rise 
tomorrow, I say he's absolutely right. There is no way to prove axiomatically 
that the sun will rise tomorrow, and nobody in science cares in the slightest. 
When the sun doesn't rise as scheduled, call me. Until then I absolutely refuse 
to waste time worrying about it. When Immanuel Velikovsky claimed the planets 
underwent wild disturbances in their orbits, the burden of proof was on him to 
show that it happened. The burden was not on scientists to show it didn't.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of 9-11, we have planes hitting the World Trade Center and the 
buildings failing at precisely the level of impact. The observational evidence 
clearly shows a cause and effect relationship.
   </p>
   <h2>
    It Looks Like A Controlled Demolition
   </h2>
   <p>
    What else is a large building collapse going to look like?
   </p>
   <p>
    Until 9-11, our only experience in bringing down very large buildings was 
controlled demolition. The highest buildings (apart from broadcast towers) brought down were in the 30 story 
range. Once the building starts to fall, the physics is going to be the same 
regardless of the initial cause. So alleged similarities between 9-11 and 
controlled demolitions prove nothing. You might as well argue that the collapse 
of Mount St. Helens in 1980 was set off by explosives because it looked just 
like a landslide caused by explosives.
   </p>
   <p>
    One thing radically different about 9-11 is that controlled demolitions 
always set off charges
    <i>
     low
    </i>
    in the structure and let the weight of the 
building do the rest. Nobody ever set off charges
    <i>
     high
    </i>
    in a building to 
pancake the stories beneath. So why resort to a radical and unproven method if 
you want to bring down the World Trade Center?
   </p>
   <p>
    Probably the most revealing commentary on the controlled demolition theory is
    <i>
     Bringing Down The House
    </i>
    by Michael Satchell in US News and World Report 
(June 30, 2003). This article describes the work of Controlled Demolition Inc., 
far and away the world leaders in controlled demolition, and Mark and Doug 
Loizeaux, who run it.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    Like most Americans, the Loizeauxs were transfixed by the televised scenes of 
destruction shortly after the first jet struck. But as experts in buildings' 
vulnerabilities, they knew right away what few Americans realized. "I told Doug 
immediately that the tower was coming down, and when the second tower was hit, 
that it would follow," remembers Mark.
    <p>
     Horrified, the Loizeaux brothers watched first responders streaming into the 
doomed towers and tried frantically, and unsuccessfully, to phone in warnings. 
In the following days, CDI was called to ground zero to consult on safety and 
develop plans for demolition and debris removal. What if the twin towers, though 
badly damaged, had somehow remained standing? Without doubt, the Loizeaux family 
would have been called upon to bring them down. "Quite simply," says Mark in a 
rare moment of introspective uncertainty, "I don't know how we would have done 
it."
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    So according to the world experts on building demolition:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     It was immediately obvious that the towers were going to fall
    </li>
    <li>
     They have no idea how they would have brought down the towers in a 
	controlled demolition.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Of course, you can always claim the Loizeaux brothers were in on the plot. 
Some sites link to a story about Controlled Demolition later being charged with 
illegal campaign contributions, which certainly proves something. Or other.
   </p>
   <p>
    Actually, the collapse
    <i>
     doesn't
    </i>
    look like a controlled demolition. Real 
controlled demolitions try very hard to avoid flinging debris far beyond the 
building itself. They blow the lower stories and the center of the building to 
cause the building to collapse in on itself. The collapse of the World Trade 
Center doesn't look remotely like a controlled collapse, apart from stuff 
falling down.
   </p>
   <p>
    Implosion World, a site dedicated to controlled building collapse, agrees (
    <a href="http://www.implosionworld.com/wtc.htm">
     http://www.implosionworld.com/wtc.htm
    </a>
    )
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    DID THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TOWERS ACTUALLY IMPLODE? No. They collapsed 
	in an
    <i>
     uncontrolled
    </i>
    [emphasis added] fashion, causing extensive damage 
	to surrounding structures, roadways and utilities. Although when viewed from 
	a distance the towers appeared to have telescoped almost straight down, a 
	closer look at video replays reveal sizeable portions of each building 
	breaking free during the collapse, with the largest sections--some as tall 
	as 30 or 40 stories--actually laying out in several directions. The 
	outward failure of these sections is believed to have caused much of the 
	significant damage to adjacent structures, and smaller debris caused 
	structural and cosmetic damage to hundreds of additional buildings around 
	the perimeter of the site.
    <p>
     HOW DOES THIS EVENT COMPARE WITH A NORMAL BUILDING IMPLOSION? The only 
	correlation is that in a very broad sense, explosive devices (airplanes 
	loaded with fuel) were used to intentionally bring down buildings. However 
	it can be argued that even this vague similarity relates more to military 
	explosive demolition than to building implosions, which specifically involve 
	the placement of charges at key points within a structure to precipitate the 
	failure of steel or concrete supports within their own footprint. The other 
	primary difference between these two types of operations is that implosions 
	are universally conducted with the utmost concern for adjacent properties 
	and human safety---elements that were horrifically absent from this event. 
	Therefore we can conclude that what happened in New York was not a building 
	implosion.

    Check out the videos of the demolition of the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. 
Fireworks. Big pyrotechnic countdown clock. None of that on 9/11. Not even 
remotely similar. Silly? Yes, but still above the intellectual level of most 
9/11 conspiracy theories. I mean, the similarities the conspiracy buffs point to 
are on the same level of superficiality as whether or not there were fireworks.

   <h2>
    Jet Fuel Doesn't Get Hot Enough to Melt Steel
   </h2>
   <p>
    For the umpteenth time, nobody ever claimed the steel
    <i>
     melted
    </i>
    . It got 
hot enough to lose its strength.
   </p>
   <h2>
    So Where Did All The Molten Steel Come From?
   </h2>

     <td>
      There are lots of accounts alleging that rescue workers encountered molten 
steel. The first question that comes to mind is whether these witnesses know the 
difference between
      <i>
       incandescent
      </i>
      and
      <i>
       molten.
      </i>
      Steel can get hot 
enough to
      <i>
       glow
      </i>
      long before it gets hot enough to
      <i>
       melt
      </i>
      . The fact 
that glowing steel was pulled out of the rubble doesn't mean it was molten.
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>
    One particular red herring that crops up frequently is that temperatures in 
the rubble were high enough long after the collapse to melt aluminum. Since 
aluminum melts at 660
    <sup>
     o
    </sup>
    C (1220
    <sup>
     o
    </sup>
    F) I don't have the slightest doubt of it. Since a 
backyard trash fire can melt aluminum, so what?
   </p>
   <p>
    Apparently, the melting of steel signifies the use of explosives or thermite 
cutting charges. But the purpose of either is to
    <i>
     cut
    </i>
    steel, not
    <i>
     melt
    </i>
    it. A controlled demolition simply does not produce large amounts of molten steel. You 
might as well argue that all the concrete dust shows the buildings were taken 
down by an army of gnomes armed with grinding wheels.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the World Trade Center was hot enough to melt steel, where's all the 
molten
    <i>
     concrete
    </i>
    ? Iron melts around 1500
    <sup>
     o
    </sup>
    C but so do many of the silicate 
minerals in concrete, and a mixture of silicate minerals would melt at a 
temperature lower than any of the individual minerals (I'm a geologist - I get 
paid to know about stuff like that). The fine particle size of 
the concrete dust would facilitate melting. So why wasn't there a huge puddle of 
molten concrete at Ground Zero? (There was some, but about what you'd expect 
from a large fire; certainly not what you'd expect from something hot enough to 
melt large amounts of steel.)
   </p>
   <p>
    In a paper by Steven E. Jones, who bills himself as a "Physicist and 
Archaeometrist," there are pictures of glowing material falling from the World 
Trade Center, together with this comment:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    Who can deny that liquid, molten metal existed at the WTC disaster? The 
	yellow color implies a molten-metal temperature of approximately 1000
    <sup>
     o
    </sup>
    C
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    1000
    <sup>
     o
    </sup>
    C, is about 500
    <sup>
     o
    </sup>
    C
    <i>
     below
    </i>
    the melting point of iron.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh, by the way, there would have been cutting of steel during the 
construction. And there's another construction process that melts steel. 
Welding.

   <h2>
    No Steel Frame Building Has Ever Collapsed Due To Fire
   </h2>
   <p>
    So if something happens for the first time, it can't happen because it never 
happened before?
   </p>
   <p>
    No 110-story buildings were ever hit by fuel-laden airliners hard enough to 
strip the insulation off the structural steel before, either. Steel-frame 
buildings are incredibly strong. They have survived major earthquakes and fires, 
and the Twin Towers merely rocked when hit by airliners at full throttle. But 
the towers were not designed to survive an impact by fully-laden airliners at 
full throttle, then a fire in contact with unprotected steel. An impact from a jet approaching JFK at 200 miles an hour, with 
nearly empty tanks, and one slamming into the building at 450 miles an hour with 
full tanks, are two quite different things.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Free Fall
   </h2>
   <p>
    According to Roedy Green's
    <i>
     How You Know 9-11 Was an Inside Job
    </i>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    All three World Trade Towers fell faster over the first half of the 
	collapse than physics allows by free fall. That meant they had to have an 
	assist, e.g. an explosive push from pre-planted demolition charges, not just 
	gravity pulling them down. The maximum collapse for free fall is computed by
    <div class="java">
     distance =  g t
    </div>
    <p>
     where g is the acceleration due to gravity 32 feet per second per second, 
	and t is time in seconds. In other words, free fall collapse should start 
	out slowly and accelerate faster and faster for the big finale.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    This is just plain weird. Whether a building falls by deliberate demolition 
or catastrophic failure, the collapse will be governed by gravity. Even if you 
used a teleporter to magically make several stories vanish, the part above would 
only fall as fast as gravity would accelerate it. Only if there 
was some kind of thruster pushing the building
    <i>
     down
    </i>
    could it fall faster. 
Why install a useless Rube Goldberg device? Once the building begins to 
collapse, who needs anything to accelerate it? Gravity has a pretty reliable 
record of pulling things down. And where's the evidence for 
faster than free fall collapse?
   </p>
   <p>
    The videos show that the towers took 15 seconds to collapse. The free-fall 
time for something to fall 400 meters is about 9 seconds. So, no, the towers did
    <i>
     not
    </i>
    fall faster than free fall.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     911Research
    </i>
    claims:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    This rate is still much too fast to be explained by a 
gravity-driven collapse given that the descending rubble would have to crush and 
accelerate almost 1000 feet of vertical intact structure. It is especially 
revealing that each tower disappeared at about the same rate as the rubble fell 
through the air, as if the tower's structure provided no more resistance to the 
descent of rubble than did air.

      All photos of the collapse show a plume of debris extending far 
below the main level of collapse. So the debris
      <i>
       did
      </i>
      fall 
appreciably faster than the building itself. The building provided little more 
resistance than air for the simple reason that a skyscraper
      <i>
       is
      </i>
      mostly 
air.
      <p>
       In the photo at left the collapse is about where the cloud fills the 
		entire width of the picture, but the debris in free fall has almost 
		reached the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the debris is at least a building width 
		beyond the building itself. No competent controlled demolition flings 
		debris that far.

   <p>
    The fall doesn't have to
    <i>
     crush
    </i>
    the stories beneath. It merely has to 
stress the structural elements until the fasteners pop and the welds break. The 
impact of that pancaking material will cause the outer vertical members to bow 
outward, then fly outward violently when failure occurs. There's no need to 
appeal to explosives to fling material outward from the buildings.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a story is 4 meters high, it will take an object about 0.9 seconds to fall one 
story, by which time it will be going 9 m/sec. So once the collapse starts, the 
overlying structure will be falling at 9 m/sec by the time it has fallen one story. If 
we crush the collapsing story into rubble half a meter thick and expect the collapse 
to stop at that point, what kinds of forces are involved? We go from 9 m/sec to 
zero in half a meter, or 1/18 of a second. However, during that deceleration the 
velocity is decreasing, and the average velocity turns out to be half of the 
initial velocity, so the crunch time is 1/9 second. So the acceleration is -9 
m/sec divided by 1/9 sec = -81 m/sec
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
    , or about 8 g's.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the difference between a
    <i>
     static
    </i>
    load and a
    <i>
     dynamic
    </i>
    load. In the north tower, with about ten stories above the impact, the dynamic 
load was about equivalent not to ten stories but to
    <i>
     eighty, nearly the total 
height of the building
    </i>
    . I doubt if the tower at that level was engineered to 
support eighty stories - why waste the steel? Actually the loads are much 
greater because the initial collapse involved a fall of about three or four 
stories, not just one, and the dynamic loads on the points that actually resist 
the fall - the welds and the rivets, will be far greater. If you try to stop the 
collapse in the millimeter or so a rivet or weld can deform before failing, 
you're talking
    <i>
     hundreds
    </i>
    of g's. In the south tower, where the top 25 or 
so stories fell, the impact load at eight g's would be equivalent to 200 
stories, or
    <i>
     twice the total height of the building
    </i>
    . Some conspiracy buffs 
argue that engineering standards require a safety factor several times the 
actual load on the structure, but the dynamic loads would far overwhelm those 
standards.
   </p>
   <p>
    This, by the way, is the reason controlled demolition works at all. If 
physics worked the way 9-11 conspiracy buffs think, once you blew the lower 
stories of a building, the upper part would just drop and remain intact. Of 
course it doesn't because once the building begins to fall, the dynamic loads 
are far beyond the static strength of the building.
   </p>
   <p>
    <i>
     911Research
    </i>
    devotes a lot of effort to debunking what it regards as 
disinformation campaigns designed to deflect attention from the theory of 
controlled demolition. But we keep coming back to the fundamental issue how any 
building can fall
    <i>
     faster
    </i>
    than gravity or why a conspirator would feel the 
need to set up a mechanism to do something so useless.

   <h3>
    "But the Government Said So"
   </h3>
   <p>
    9-11 troofers keep blind-siding me because they keep on coming up with things 
I can't believe any toilet-trained human being would be dumb enough to say. 
Lately I've been hit a couple of times with the assertion that the 9-11 
Commission Report states, on Page 305, that "At 9:58:59, the South Tower 
collapsed in ten seconds" Indeed it does. The 9-11 Commission Report deals with 
events leading up to 9-11, agency responses to the crisis, and possible changes 
in procedure and policy to cope with future crises. It contains no technical 
information whatsoever about the causes of the building collapse. Nevertheless, 
because the report says the South Tower collapsed in ten seconds, 9-11 troofers 
insist that is the official Government position.
   </p>
   <p>
    People who take that stance aren't merely scientifically illiterate; they're 
verbally illiterate as well. Insisting that ten seconds is meant to be a 
scientifically definitive finding in a paragraph dealing with firefighting 
efforts shows a complete lack of critical reasoning. A person who reasons like 
that is completely lacking in the critical reasoning necessary to sort out the 
events of 9-11.
   </p>
   <p>
    The technical information on the building collapse is in the NIST reports, 
not the 9-11 Commission Report. There is little discussion of the chronology of 
the collapse once the buildings began to fall, but the NIST FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions) site has the pertinent information.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    The seismic spikes for the collapse of the WTC Towers are the result of 
	debris from the collapsing towers impacting the ground. The spikes began 
	approximately 10 seconds after the times for the start of each buildings 
	collapse and continued for approximately 15 seconds.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    So according to the seismic record, the first impacts are about ten seconds 
after the onset of collapse. That's the free-falling debris. Seismic signals 
continued for 15 more seconds. So it took at least about 25 seconds for the 
buildings to collapse. The seismic records are probably the best information 
because the last stages of collapse were obscured by dust, but a time indexed 
series of video frames on the 9-11 Research site shows the collapse of one tower 
still in progress after 19 seconds. So the collapse speed was less than half of 
free-fall speed. Also:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    From video evidence, significant portions of the cores of both buildings 
	(roughly 60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) are known to have 
	stood 15 to 25 seconds after collapse initiation before they, too, began to 
	collapse. Neither the duration of the seismic records nor video evidence 
	(due to obstruction of view caused by debris clouds) are reliable indicators 
	of the total time it took for each building to collapse completely.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And the people who like to take "ten seconds" and "essentially in free fall" 
literally don't seem to care much about paragraphs like this:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    In other words, the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 
	to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting 
	structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the 
	floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so 
	greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the 
	structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The 
	downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to 
	the increasing mass.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    9-11 troofers are a lot like some Biblical fundamentalists. Anything that 
they want to believe is to be taken with absolute literalness, and anything that 
contradicts what they want to believe, they just ignore.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Building Collapsed Straight Down
   </h2>
   <p>
    Gravity tends to do that. You can't extrapolate what happens in the collapse 
of a small building, which may tilt intact, to what happens in the collapse of a 110-story building. 
The videos show clearly that the top floors of the South Tower
    <i>
     did
    </i>
    tilt 
during the first few seconds of collapse.
   </p>
   <p>
    A lot of conspiracy sites talk about "sequential collapse" as if there were 
explosive charges placed on every floor detonated in sequence, like the 
destruction of the Empire State Building in
    <i>
     Independence Day
    </i>
    .
    <i>
    </i>
    But 
controlled demolitions don't do that - they use a small amount of explosives and 
let the weight of the building do the rest. Thirty-story buildings have been 
brought down with only a few hundred pounds of explosives.
   </p>
   <h2>
    The Concrete Is All Pulverized
   </h2>
   <p>
    What exactly did you expect? Actually photos of the site show lots of 
concrete, admittedly broken into small chunks. Falling 1000 feet, or having 
stuff fall from 1000 feet onto something else,
    <i>
     will
    </i>
    pulverize it.
   </p>
   <p>
    Firefighters reported that no office furnishings were recognizable either. 
Did somebody rig a bomb to every single desk, chair, computer and telephone in 
the buildings?
   </p>
   <h2>
    Too Much Dust
   </h2>
   <p>
    From
    <i>
     911Research
    </i>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    If the collapses were merely gravity-driven, then any clouds of debris 
	produced in the immediate aftermath should have occupied about the same 
	amount of space as the intact towers before they had time to significantly 
	mix into the surrounding air. The bulk of the clouds could only come from 
	the expulsion of gases in the buildings as they collapsed, and the mixing of 
	ambient air into the clouds.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    This just makes me shake my head in wonder. First, the expulsion of air from 
the towers would have been pretty impressive, second, air rushing in to fill the 
space formerly occupied by the towers would have been equally impressive. 
Falling debris would also have displaced a large amount of air. Together they 
would have created a huge amount of turbulence, just what was seen at Ground 
Zero.
   </p>
   <p>
    Actually the dust cloud at street level bore a remarkable visual resemblance 
to a pyroclastic flow, a hot, dense mixture of volcanic ash and gases. The dust 
cloud was cool, but the cloud itself was a
    <i>
     density flow
    </i>
    , a mixture of 
dust and air much denser than normal air. Density flows, whether in air or 
water, maintain their identity for quite a while. They stop moving when they run 
out of momentum, the denser parts of the flow settle out, and the lighter parts 
mix with the surrounding medium. Now here's a theory for conspiracy buffs to toy 
with - maybe someone triggered a volcanic eruption under the Twin Towers.
   </p>
   <p>
    I should know better than to ridicule conspiracy theories on line. I simply 
don't have enough imagination to top what conspiracy theorists actually come up 
with. If you search 9-11 and "pyroclastic," you will find sites that assert the 
dust cloud was an actual pyroclastic flow. I could assist these folks in 
learning the difference. All they need to do is find an active volcano and stand 
in the path of a real pyroclastic flow. I guarantee it would cure them of 
posting nutty stuff on the intartubes.
   </p>
   <p>
    The drywall used around the central core of the towers was
    <i>
     an inch and a 
half thick
    </i>
    . Now that will create a lot of dust.
   </p>
   <p>
    Somehow the collapse of a quarter-mile tall building was supposed to produce no 
turbulence so that the dust cloud would remain over the footprint of the 
building and mix gradually with still air. Shades of the Road Runner, who goes 
"beep-beep" and leaves a road-runner shaped dust cloud behind. This is 
physics several levels beyond weird.
   </p>
   <p>
    A lot of people confuse
    <i>
     optical density
    </i>
    with
    <i>
     amount of dust
    </i>
    . 
The fact that the dust cloud was opaque means only that light didn't penetrate 
it. The clouds that hung above the site weren't much denser than air so the 
total volume of dust in them was not large. Typical clouds in the sky contain a 
few grams of material per cubic meter. If we assume the 9-11 cloud had 10 grams 
per cubic meter - far more than even thick water droplet clouds, and the dust 
cloud occupied a cubic kilometer, far more than its actual volume, we have a 
billion cubic meters times ten grams per cubic meters, or ten billion grams, ten 
million kilograms, or 10,000 tons of dust, paltry compared to the million ton 
mass of the towers.

   <h2>
    The Crime Scene Was Not Preserved
   </h2>
   <p>
    So what exactly were 52 FBI Evidence Recovery Teams, totaling more than 400 
agents, doing on Staten Island for nine months?
   </p>
   <p>
    This just in, the FAA doesn't leave the debris from plane crashes in place 
either; they take it to a hangar and lay it out for study.
   </p>
   <p>
    Paired up with this question is why the cleanup trucks were so carefully 
monitored with GPS units. These days, trucks routinely have GPS units, so that's 
not particularly unusual, especially since a truck driver could probably sell a 
load of 9-11 steel for a tidy sum on the souvenir market. One driver who took a 
1-1/2 hour lunch was fired, but that can get you fired lots of places.
   </p>
   <p>
    So not leaving the debris in place is evidence of a plot, and tracking it en 
route to make sure it gets where it's supposed to go is also evidence of a plot.
   </p>
   <p>
    The people clearing the site and examining the debris were responsible for 
removing a continuing hazard, recovering human remains, and finding any evidence 
that might shed additional light on what the obvious visual record shows - that 
the buildings collapsed after being hit by aircraft. They were
    <i>
     not
    </i>
    responsible for doing an archeological dig to satisfy the objections of every 
conspiracy theorist on the planet. Don't like that? Too bad. Deal with it.
   </p>
   <p>
    When I did a radio interview with a truther a while ago, the discussion came 
around to temperatures in the fire. According to government reports, samples 
from the floors where there were fires showed only a few indications of very 
high temperatures. A much more significant question is this: if evidence wasn't 
properly collected,
    <i>
     how did investigators know which floors the debris came 
from
    </i>
    ?
   </p>
   <p>
    Ironically, the fact that personal effects of hijackers and passengers were 
found is
    <i>
     not
    </i>
    evidence that evidence was carefully sifted, for some odd 
reason.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Seismic Evidence
   </h2>
   <p>
    Again, from Roedy Green:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <a class="offsite" href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/LCSN/Eq/20010911_wtc.html">
     Seismic

    evidence shows the two main world trade towers were taken down 
	by demolition.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The link goes to a site of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth 
Observatory showing seismic records of the plane impacts and tower collapses. 
The impacts registered below magnitude 1, the collapses a bit over magnitude 2. 
The records look like perfectly ordinary seismograms. There's no elaboration on 
how exactly the seismic evidence shows demolition. Apparently some conspiracy 
thinkers believe a seismic imprint must mean an explosion, but the collapse of a 
large building will do very nicely. Oil companies routinely do seismic soundings 
by dropping masses of several tons, called "thumpers," to generate seismic 
waves. A million-ton building will make a very good thumper.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other sites look in detail at the seismograms, arguing that a slow buildup of 
the signal shows a progressive use of explosives. But a building collapse spread 
out over 15 seconds
    <i>
     will
    </i>
    produce a signal of growing amplitude.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Why Did WTC 7 Collapse?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Good question. The investigators were baffled. But the conspiracy theory 
doesn't explain anything. Why bring down an empty 
building hours after the main attack?
   </p>
   <p>
    Photos published to support the claim of a controlled demolition show puffs 
emerging from the
    <i>
     top
    </i>
    of the building. These could be explosives. Or they 
could be concrete suddenly failing, or windows shattering. But again we have the irritating question, 
why start a collapse
    <i>
     from the top
    </i>
    , completely at odds with the way all 
controlled demolitions are done, especially if you want the building to fall 
onto its own footprint?
   </p>
   <p>
    If it was actually a controlled demolition by the Fire Department or the building 
owner, or both, as some people allege, so what? The remains of the World Trade Center 
itself were brought down 
in controlled demolitions after 9-11. What does that have to do with the 
collapse of the Twin Towers? It seems unlikely that a demolition crew would 
enter a burning building and install charges to bring down something 15 stories 
taller than any other recorded controlled demolition, all in the space of a few 
hours, but if the building
    <i>
     was
    </i>
    brought down by the owners or the Fire 
Department,
    <i>
     what's the connection to the Twin Towers?
    </i>
    How does a planned 
demolition of one building prove the Twin Towers were deliberately brought down?
   </p>
   <p>
    I've gotten a fair amount of flak over this issue but I've yet to see anyone 
present a coherent explanation of what, exactly, the collapse of WTC-7 proves.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Complexity
   </h2>
   <p>
    "Osama Bin Ladin, sitting in a cave in Afghanistan, could never have pulled 
off something of this complexity."
   </p>
   <p>
    What complexity? You put 19 guys on four airliners on the same day armed with 
box cutters, after first giving a few of them enough flight training to allow 
them to perform some rudimentary maneuvers. Any travel agent who couldn't book 
19 people on four separate flights on the same day needs a new job. The complex 
part would have been gaining and keeping control of the passengers and crew once 
the hijacks were in progress.
   </p>
   <p>
    If Bin Ladin had known what would happen, he would certainly have had the 
hijackers hit the buildings lower. That would have trapped far more people while 
increasing the load on the heated steel, resulting in faster collapse. So if it 
wasn't Bin Ladin, why 
didn't the alleged conspirators do it? More outrage, more backing for the War on 
Terror. Why did they miss such an obvious opportunity?
   </p>
   <h2>
    Suppose It Was A Conspiracy
   </h2>
   <p>
    What was the intent? If it was to bring down the Towers, why demolish from 
the top down? That's not how any other controlled demolitions are done. Why not 
strike low, maximizing the number of casualties and more fully galvanizing the 
country for war?
   </p>
   <p>
    If the intent was to collapse only part of the Towers, keeping casualties 
limited but providing a pretext for war, then the total collapse was 
unanticipated. Or maybe the intent was simply to crash planes into the Towers 
and produce casualties but not cause building collapse at all. In either case, 
if the building collapses were unexpected, they happened through structural 
weakening and gravitational collapse and all the alleged "evidence" for 
sequential explosive charges and so on becomes worthless.
   </p>
   <p>
    Why use planes at all? Why not simply stage a bigger and better remake of the 
1993 attack? Why not claim the terrorists detonated a large truck load of 
explosives at the central core of the building, or smuggled explosives into the 
core? Instead of passenger planes, why not have the terrorists steal a FedEx or 
UPS cargo plane and fill it with explosives?
   </p>
   <p>
    Why have a time gap between the plane crashes and building collapse, and why 
did the South Tower, which was hit
    <i>
     later
    </i>
    , fall
    <i>
     first
    </i>
    ? That makes 
perfect sense in the conventional scenario, because the South Tower was hit 
lower and thus the load on the damaged structural members was greater. It makes 
no sense at all from the standpoint of a conspiracy.
   </p>
   <p>
    Like all conspiracy theories, the 9-11 conspiracy idea suffers from the fatal 
flaw of having the conspirators engage in a complicated Rube Goldberg process to 
do something a rational person could do more effectively in a much simpler way.

    Neal Boortz is a conservative-libertarian talk show host who gets under a lot

A listener e-mailed him asking him to explain about "chemtrails," which the

   <h2>
    Dueling Conspiracy Theories
   </h2>
   <p>
    Since a lot of people have begun to catch on to conspiracy theories, 9-11 
theorists have begun putting their own spin on the term. Just like creationists have begun using the word "pseudoscience" to brand 
evolution and blur the distinction between their own ideas and those of science, 
9-11 conspiracy theorists have begun using the term "conspiracy theory" to label 
the conventional view of 9-11. So you get 19 guys, give some of them rudimentary 
flight training, they board airliners, hijack them, and fly them into buildings. 
Yup, that's a conspiracy all right. So the term "conspiracy theory" is entirely 
accurate.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the other hand, government operatives spent days planting explosive 
charges in the towers, then crashed the airliners or flew them to a secret 
location, brainwashed, imprisoned, or killed the passengers and crew, and that's
    <i>
     not
    </i>
    a conspiracy theory? Or the videos of the airliner crashes are
    <i>
     all
    </i>
    fake and some exotic particle beam or energy weapon disintegrated the towers 
into dust and that's not a conspiracy theory, either?
   </p>
   <p>
    Well, they're both conspiracy theories, so they're both on the same plane, so 
you get to pick whichever one you like. This is the classic relativism of the 
pseudoscientist.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fortunately, there's a way to sort through the conflicting claims. Which of 
the two is more consistent with well known facts? Do Middle Eastern terrorists 
hijack airplanes? Check. Do Middle Eastern terrorists target civilians? Check. 
Do Middle Eastern terrorists deliberately cause mass casualties? Check. There's 
absolutely nothing in the standard picture of 9-11 that conflicts with these 
facts. Number of previous cases where U.S. government operatives have hijacked 
airliners? None known. Number of previous cases where the U.S. government has 
collapsed a building full of innocent people? None known (apart from artillery 
or bombing in war). Number of previous cases where the U.S. government has 
collapsed a building full of its own citizens? None known. So one conspiracy theory has a host of historical 
precedents, and the other has none at all.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fascinating, isn't it, that the fact that no steel frame skyscraper had ever 
collapsed due to fire is touted as ironclad proof that planes couldn't have 
brought down the World Trade Center, but the total absence of historical 
precedent for the government doing it counts for nothing?

   <h2>
    Who Stands to Profit?
   </h2>
   <p>
    A question much asked by 9-11 truthers, who point to gold allegedly being 
removed from the World Trade Center, investigative files being destroyed, a 
pretext for invading Iraq or declaring martial law, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    A few months ago I agreed to be on a truther talk show (I'll try almost 
anything once.
    <i>
     Almost
    </i>
    .) and the commercial breaks were a revelation. 
There were endless spiels for crank medical remedies and nutritional 
supplements, investment schemes that ranged from shady to crazy, newsletters for 
conspiracy cults, and wacko theories on how to avoid taxes. One former truther 
who became disillusioned said he would no longer help the movement sell T-shirts 
and DVD's. It's a lot more than just T-shirts and DVD's. Look at the Web sites, 
the newsletters, listen to the talk shows
    <i>
     and look at who's bankrolling them 
and advertising on them
    </i>
    . Truther sites are to conspiracy thinkers what 
televangelists are to lonely Christians: a place to send money to buy a feeling 
of participation and fulfillment.

    The towers didn't collapse onto their own footprint, not by a long shot. They 
didn't topple like trees, but debris flew and did damage a long way away. The 
whole reason we have controlled demolitions beginning at the base of buildings 
is to prevent debris from flying as far as it did on 9-11.

    Really? 9-11 conspiracy buffs can slander government officials, accuse them

    being 
pejorative? If people are going to talk like that they should at least have the 
guts to take criticism. The conspiracy buffs supposedly have the courage to 
expose a massive high level conspiracy, but they whine like pre-schoolers when 
anyone attacks their ideas. Some courage. They can play these games because they 
know perfectly well that nobody is really going to do anything to them no matter 
how much they blather about conspiracies. It's all play acting. How else can you 
call bull$*** what it is without being pejorative?

    The amazing thing is this guy can slander people he's never met and who have
