           and Ladders, most of us have sat with a version of it at some point in our young lives, but its origins are much more than just childs play. The game is a potent teaching tool whose simple design has been used for centuries, arguably even millennia, as a way to embody and reinforce religious teachings and cultural values. Along the way its evolved and adapted to incorporate the themes and aesthetics relevant to each people that played it, from ancient India to Victorian England, to the US and far beyond.

           For the one among you who hasnt played some version of it, Snakes and Ladders progresses players in a zig zag pattern up a grid of about 100 squares by the roll of dice, or cowry shells originally. Planted on various squares are ladders that move players further up the board and snakes (or chutes) that slide them back down. The first player to reach the final square, entirely by chance, is the winner.

           Bookending each ladder and snake is a moral lesson, whether in the form of an illustration or explicitly written out. This is where a lot of the games most obvious moral and religious didactics happen. But in playing, people are also made to experience the course of fate, and the consequences attached to virtues and vices. The experiential and communal nature of games is what makes even (maybe especially) the most basic of designs so effective at reinforcing culture.

           Devout laypeople would play these games as a form of meditation or communal exercise, reinforcing the teachings of their religion in a form of study that didnt involve books or sermons.

           of each square were carefully considered, their connections intended to invite contemplation about specific tenets and the larger worldview they reflected when taken together. Predictably, landing on a snake square for drunkenness would drop your piece a few spaces, but that squares relationship to those around it was also relevant to the message of the game. Their groupings would divide and classify various spiritual concepts, or outline a religions cosmology. Its possible that even the ratios of snakes to ladders (one version had 40 to 22) were a means of communicating how fraught and narrow the righteous path could be.

          <p class="graf--p" id="95e5" name="95e5">
           The designs were also beautiful. Many boards have squares adorned with elaborate illustrations of religiously relevant phrases, figures or architecture, framed by flora, fauna, and symbols of spiritual planes. Rows of squares are sometimes arranged by levels of enlightenment, even in shapes suggesting the human body, simultaneously reflecting concepts like karmic paths, chakras, or other conceptions about various levels of the spiritual realm. One surviving board is even divided into sub-games corresponding to distinct spiritual or earthly states of being, an elaboration on the basic mechanic that enhances the religious content. Many of the old boards are genuine works of art, as telling as any manuscript or painting (and in a sense, theyre both).

           Games are an art form, and the aesthetics are important, Macklin says. Its kind of like ritualand of course games are very tied to ritual.

           Nomenclature is another major distinguishing factor between versions of Snakes and Ladders. The final square of a rare remnant of a 200 year old Sufi board, for example, speaks of extinction into God, echoing the Sufi doctrine of death before death. Though distinct, these notions arent dissimilar from the Jain and Hindu versions goal of reaching

           Imperial Britain is largely responsible for any of us in the west being exposed to this game. It was imported to Victorian England and soon caught on, even keeping the Indian iconography in its boards until around the 1930s. The virtues and vices became more generalized, endorsing grace and success under the ladders with warnings of poverty and disgrace adorning the snakes. Pregnant religious inscriptions were replaced by the two-part cartoon dramas, separated by a ladder or a serpent (and eventually a chute), as the snake to ladder ratio was generally evened out.

These games are vehicles for culture, another reason the chameleonic nature of Snakes and Ladders is so interestingit provides a window into numerous places and times in world history. In their look, feel, and design, we see the priorities, values, aesthetics, and mentality of people well never get a chance to meet.

           Games like these arent designed to be won, but to teach and communicate through experience. In our time, games are still as much an amplifier of culture as films, music or literature. A game like Grand Theft Auto probably says a lot about our culturenot all of it goodbut little of that message really comes from the mechanics or design of the game itself.

           As a design, this game model is robust enough to last for centuries precisely because of its simplicity and adaptability. The reason todays most popular video games are unlikely to survive for another century, let alone another few decades, is largely because the complexity of their underlying code renders it impossible to adapt them to new ideas and perspectives. Theyre closed systems, whereas games like Snakes and Ladderswhose underlying mechanism is akin to guided readingallows any message or idea to be tooled to fit its time and place.

Predictably, landing on a snake square for drunkenness would drop your piece a few spaces, but that squares relationship to those around it was also relevant to the message of the game. Their groupings would divide and classify various spiritual concepts, or outline a religions cosmology. Its possible that even the ratios of snakes to ladders (one version had 40 to 22) were a means of communicating how fraught and narrow the righteous path could be.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":187,"end":208,"href":"http://www.hinduismtoday.com/education/games/Snakes&amp;LaddersGameBoard.pdf","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0}]},{"name":"ce2b","type":1,"text":"My impression is that some boards (including Jain ones) seem more pessimistic in that they include a lot of snakes and fewer and shorter ladders to aid the upward path, says Andrew Topsfield, keeper of Eastern art at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and a leading scholar on the game. This may reflect the very highly developed nature of Jain karma theory and the many subtle spiritual pitfalls that the Jain scholars identified. The bhakti or devotional worship-based boards (Hindu and Muslim) can seem a little more balanced in this respect, though not without generous provisions of dangerous snakes of their own.","markups":[{"type":3,"start":223,"end":247,"href":"http://www.ashmolean.org/","title":"","rel":"","anchorType":0},{"type":2,"start":434,"end":441}]},{"name":"95e5","type":1,"text":"The designs were also beautiful.

One surviving board is even divided into sub-games corresponding to distinct spiritual or earthly states of being, an elaboration on the basic mechanic that enhances the religious content.
