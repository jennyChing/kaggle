     2009 Edwards AFB Open House
    </h1>

    <p>
     Update (Nov 13,'09) - added sound clips for various planes.
     <br/>
     Edwards AFB hasn't had an open house event for 3 years, so there was a lot of interest in the 2009 show.  Edwards is the main Air Force flight test center for the U.S. with a rich aviation history behind it.  One of the more famous exploits there was Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier in the X-1.  Edwards is also known for being the alternate landing site for the Space Shuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some reason, I wanted to get there before the gates opened at 7am.  In retrospect, it was a darn good thing I did!  Even at 6am, there was a line of vehicles waiting to get in.  By 7, there was a long line of headlights stretching back on the one lane road from the main entrance.  I found out later that as the day wore on, that line would get longer and longer, and it would take some people almost 5 hours before they parked, went through security, got on a bus, and finally make it on base!  Needless to say, getting out was really quite nasty as well.  The traffic flow and control did not take into account trying to get 250,000 people out at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, IF you could get past the traffic situation, you were in for a treat, as there were some fantastic displays and flying to be seen at the Edwards Open House air show.  Oh, and it got HOT too.  Something about being a desert and all that.

    At the entrance to the base was this grand old B-52.  This 0008 plane was used by NASA to launch the X-planes. Lit by the orange rays of the early dawn light.

    Another interesting and unusual aircraft there was the F-16XL.  With a cranked arrow delta wing, it had twice the wing area of a standard F-16.

    Don't know much about this, just thought it was a cool picture!
    <br/>
    Update: It's a Lockheed YO-3 'Quiet Star'.  Designed for night battlefield observation during the Vietnam war.  It was a very quiet plane, and can fly as low as 200 ft over the enemy without being heard. Thanks to Charlie Baumann for the ID!
    <br/>
    Christian Jacobsen had this to add about this plane: "One of the programs I saw while I was at NASA was a project for developing quieter helicopter rotors (or for downtown VTOL public airports). They would mount microphones on the wings of the YO-3 and follow our helicopters around to do real-world testing of the various rotor designs. (A Blackhawk, an Apache, and a Little Bird.) Because it could fly slowly, silently, and close to the helicopters, it was the perfect platform for the audio testing aspect of the project."
    <br/>
    "Every aspect of the plane was developed to be as quiet as possible... which was part of the reason it had that odd looking wooden propeller. Apparently it was the quietest prop ever made!"
    <br/>
    Got the following from Kurt Olney, who was a crew chief on a YO-3A in Vietnam, and was helping out at Edwards with the plane: "The elements that made the plane ulltra quiet--some might say silent when it flies 800-1000 feet overhead--were the following 1. Slow turning prop 700 rpm (minimizes tip noise.)  2. An exhaust system that runs the length of one side of the airplane, 3. IO-360 continental engine enclosed in acoustic deadening cowling and silicone in the rocker box covers  4. 12 v-belts--reduction drive- (we use to call them rubber bands) that eleminate gear noise. 5. A streamlined plane. (plane is based on a Schweizer 2-32 glider but greatly modified.)  6. Duct tape.  Before planes went on a mission, they would fly about 300 feet over the maintenance shack. If we heard whistles, rattles etc, we would bring her in put some tape on her. After a while we pretty much knew where the problems were likely to be so we taped her before she went up."

    Here's a British Spitfire.  I have no idea which Mark!
    <br/>
    update: It's a replica Mk IX Spitfire (registration # N1940K).  Hand built by Robert Deford, and took 8 years to complete.  Uses the real Spitfire gear, canopies, and control stick.  The plane has a steel tube frame covered in wood and metal.  Uses a Allison V-12 engine and the prop off a DC-3.  Thanks to Greg (the Acemaker pilot), and others who've sent me info on the plane!

    Also shiny is the B-25 Pacific Prowler.  It's been pointed to me that the Pacific Prowler is not part of the CAF, but operated by Jim Terry.  Jim currently keeps the plane at the Vintage Flying Museum in Fort Worth, TX.

    This modified F-16 is used as an in-flight simulator.  It can be programmed to have its flight response mimic that of any aircraft.  The dorsal hump housed the computers and electronics needed for that simulation.  Of course, the same computing power can be performed nowadays by something the size of a cell phone! :-)

    They overflew the base and broke the sound barrier at exactly 10am.  The double sonic boom reverberated through the open hangar in a loud and most shocking manner, scaring the crap out of me!  Love it!!

       Virgin Galactic is trying to break ground as being the first company catering to space tourism.  WhiteKnight 2 will carry the smaller rocket SpaceShipTwo high in the air.  When released, SpaceshipTwo will ignite its rockets and go into the very edges of space - then fall back to earth.  It should work... they won the X-prize with the earlier SpaceShipOne and White Knight.

           I LOVE this shot.  This was actually after the demo was over, and he had taken off AGAIN (presumably to go back home).  After take off, he banked hard left towards the crowd and we got this unusual and wonderful look at the C-17!

             This Bone is from Edwards (note the ED).  The official name for the B-1B is Lancer.  But Bone is so much cooler.  By the way, B-1 = B-One = Bone.  How about that!

               <br/>
               TORA, TORA, TORA refers to the code phrase for complete surprise achieved for the Japanese Dec 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.  This was made famous by the 1970 movie of the same name.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <img src="DBZ_7243.jpg" title="DBZ_7243"/>
               <br/>
               A pair of Japanese planes turn in tight formation.  The Kate and Zero are replicas.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <img src="DBZ_7336.jpg" title="DBZ_7336"/>
               <br/>
               A T-38 trainer taxis by as their airfield is being bombed by Japanese replica planes!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <img src="DBZ_7426.jpg" title="DBZ_7426"/>
               <br/>
               Most of these planes started out as AT-6s.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <img src="DBZ_7460.jpg" title="DBZ_7460"/>
               <br/>
               The Kate required a lot of work.  It started as an AT-6 airframe, rear and tail removed.  A 7 ft extension added to rear of cockpit, then the tail of a BT-13 grafted on.  A longer section added to the front of the firewall.  Canopy redone into a 5 section piece.  Wingtips extended and reshaped.  Fin and rudder reshaped.  3rd seat added facing rearwards.  In the end, it really does look like a B5N Kate!
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <img src="DBZ_7476.jpg" title="DBZ_7476"/>
               <br/>
               For the Zero, changes were made to the AT-6 cockpit canopy area, and engine cowling.  Wing tips and rudder were reshaped to match the Zero's.  Wheel pants and wheel well shapes were also changed.  This one is missing the large spinner that the others have.
               <br/>
               <br/>

               Well, no P-51s at Pearl Harbor - we'll just imagine it's a P-40.

               The background explosions added some nice black smoke for some of the shots.   After a while, it did get very smokey to see anything though!
               <br/>
               <br/>

               <br/>
               The smoke interacted with the air/wind to make some interesting patterns.  Note the orange glow from the fires.
               <br/>

                   It was an unbearably hot and dry day in the Mojave dessert - but the Raptor still could generate a tiny bit of vapor!

                   I have no idea what that green splotch is.  At least it's a uniquely Edwards Raptor shot!!

                     Update: Charles Petersen identified it as a "Czech built Blanik L-23, successor to the L-13 which was the primary flight trainer for most every Eastern Block military pilot".

NASA uses a lot of military planes for their own purposes.  Here's Predator redone as Ikhana.  Instead of Hellfire missiles, it has an instrument pod payload.
                     <br/>
                     Slight correction:  It's a Predator 'B', otherwise more commonly known as a Reaper.  Thanks to Bob Drabant for that catch.

                     NASA X-48 flying models, and a NASA Global Hawk version in the back.  There is this chain mail going around with photoshopped Boeing X-48s talking about this new Boeing super jet.  Well, this is the real thing folks - only about 20 ft. wide! :-)

                     In development forever, the F-35 is meant to supplement the F-22.  This one actually flies, and is not a mockup!

                     One of the Air Force test pilots who will be flying the F-35 (soon).  He said only contractors are flying the plane for now, as it hasn't been turned over to the Air Force yet.

                      I was very happy with the way the pictures turned out.  It was a really nice show!  Too bad I left my hat in the car - the desert sun totally fried me!  Though the morning started out really cold, it was downright hot by 10am! Only got worse from there.  At least I had sunglasses (racoon face) and sunscreen.  I thought it was very considerate for Edwards to provide free drinking water - in the form of 500 gallon water buffalos.   (More) people would have passed out with heat stroke if not for that!  For maximum enjoyment, remember to get there EARLY, keep your cool, and don't be in a hurry to leave!  Thanks to the Air Force and all the volunteers who made this event possible!
