        Spatial Thinking
       </a>
      </h1>
      <p>
       Most humans are used to spatial thinking. Even if - like mine - your desk is a huge mess, you can probably find your stuff pretty quickly because you just know where you put it. Each thing on your desk has a fixed place in space which does not change on its own. If you put something somewhere, itll still be there the next day, and youll know where you can find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="My Desk (Partial Shot)" src="/blog_images/spatial/desk.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       When designing user interfaces, its important to keep peoples ability for spatial thinking in mind. People can easily find things based on position. If a human puts something somewhere, hell probably be able to find it again if the user interface doesnt move it. If possible, the user interface should always display things where the user put them, and allow for spatial organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, most modern user interfaces dont accept this notion. Both Windows and Mac OS X like to move and resize Icons and Windows, which makes it hard to build a mental model of where your files actually are. Earlier versions of Mac OS did a much better job of this. Ironically, its the often user-unfriendly Linux operating system which does this right. Ubuntu Linux ships with the Nautilus desktop, which was built by former Apple employees and supports full spatial navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Apple hasnt completely forgotten its spatial past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, the iPhone had a set number of applications installed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Original iPhone home screen" src="/blog_images/spatial/iphone1.gif"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Each application has a preset position. Its pretty easy to find an application if its always on the home screen and never changes its position (unfortunately, not all cell phones have learned this lesson - there are many phones which use most of the home screen to show a clock or an image, and then display a small scrolling list of applications instead of using the screen real estate to facilitate the task the user actually wants to do).
      </p>
      <p>
       When it was hacked and users started to install additional apps, people started to run out of space to put them, and a solution was needed to get to these apps. What hackers did was implement vertical scrolling on the iPhones home screen:
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="Hacked iPhone home screen" src="/blog_images/spatial/iphone2.gif"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems like a neat solution. Unfortunately, it makes finding applications really hard, because they never appear in the same place, and while you might know that an application is somewhere down on the right, its hard to scroll to the exact position where the application is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apples own solution to having more applications fixes this issue. With iPhone version 1.1.3, people can add icons to the iPhones home screen. Instead of scrolling the screen vertically, Apple allows users to horizontally switch between screens:
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="New iPhone home screen" src="/blog_images/spatial/iphone3.gif"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can swipe your finger across the screen to move between pages gives it even more of a physical space feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a much better solution, as it allows for precise spatial reasoning. Users know where exactly their applications are (the third icon in the second row of the first screen, for example).
       <sup id="fnref:7.iPad">
        <a href="#fn:7.iPad" rel="footnote">
         1
        </a>
       </sup>
       People also know which screen they currently are due to a number of small dots at the bottom of each screen, which indicate the number of screen and the currently active screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of going with the most obvious idea, Apple took a step back and came up with a much more usable solution which is much more in tune with how humans think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another nice implementation of spatial navigation can be found on the Wii. Both Sony and Microsoft present downloaded games in a huge, one-dimensional vertical list which makes it cumbersome to actually find anything once the list contains more than a dozen entries. Nintendo, on the other hand, lets you arrange games on several two-dimensional screens.

          Unfortunately, the iPad breaks this feature.

     If you liked this, you'll love my book. It's called
     <i>
      Designed for Use: Create Usable Interfaces for Applications and the Web
     </i>
     . In it, I cover the whole design process, from user research and sketching to usability tests and A/B testing. But I don't just explain techniques, I also talk about concepts like discoverability, when and how to use animations, what we can learn from video games, and much more.
