       I just arrived on the island of Great Abaco, in the Northern Bahamas. Jane and  our son have dashed off to the grocery store before our bags are unpacked.  Its a small but well-stocked resort grocery which hasnt changed a lick  since I first came here at the age of five. Even the grocery items dont  change much  Ritz Crackers, little cellophane wrapped pork cuts with green  jelly mints, Goombay Punch, Conchy Joes Hot Sauce, and Bay Rum in plastic  bottles.
       <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Technically, my family is about a quarter mile away when I see it in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its noon, and Ive only been in the Abacos for an hour, when I see a strange  bird pass over me. The sky is bright blue, the underbellies of the clouds  are turquoise  the effect of the shallow sea illuminating them. Under these  clouds is the raptor, black and white, with streamers on its tail, and then it  vanishes behind the pines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walk down to the white sand beach, and I look out towards Great Guana Cay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two years ago I was there, and I sat on the deck of Docksiders restaurant,  where a dozen
       <a href="../guana.htm">
        Great Guana Cay
       </a>
       Bahamians and a handful of foreign landowners  came to meet me. The evening was the first time I was to meet many of the  members of
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a stressful time for members of
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       . Their  lives were wrapped up in the most unlikely bid to derail the
       <em>
        Bakers Bay  Golf &amp; Ocean Club
       </em>
       , a radical and rapacious mega-development which was  being built on the northeastern end of their tiny island, without their  consultation or approval. The development was bankrolled by the biggest  names in North American finance, and Bahamian officials stamped approvals left  and right. Big Hollywood names  Tiger Woods, George Clooney, George Strait had  been flown in to play golf or to be pampered. Lance Armstrong, just  before being investigated for substance abuse, giddily Twittered about his  experience at the unfinished resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       had been opposing the development through the  Bahamian legal system, where they hoped to nullify the agreement between the  Bahamian Central government and the California golf developer, which was  granted rights to their islands public land  threatening their most precious  resources  a coral reef, a vanishing culture, and a small island economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Bahamian Court of  Appeal, the locals case had been thrown out, and four years of fight had then  seemed hopeless. Two heart attacks had come after the Court of Appeals  announcement, and, unrelated to the case, a senior member of
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay  Reef
       </em>
       passed away. Although the Bahamas is so often associated with  luxury and wealth, native Bahamians on islands like
       <a href="../guana.htm">
        Great Guana Cay
       </a>
       live modest  lives, often as fishermen or home caretakers. The reef defenders were by  no means wealthy, and they relied on small donations from Bahamians and  concerned homeowners to keep their resistance moving through the legal system.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       A heavy fog had hung over this group of barefoot patriots, who believed that a  golf mega-development on an island only a quarter-mile wide would effectively  destroy their way of life. This was, to them, the Bahamian equivalent of
       <em>
        Red  Dawn,
       </em>
       and if they failed, everything they knew and loved would be lost.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That night back in 2008, the eyes of these Bahamians looked heavy, almost  fearful of what was to come. But then a cell phone rang, and one man  excused himself. When he came back, he announced that he had just  received a call from their lawyer.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       That was Fred, he said.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Were going to Privy Council.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Looking out at Great Guana Cay, I remember that somber night, perched above  Guana Cays har harbor. To go forward with Privy Council, the locals  would be turning up the heat on an issue which had already captivated attention  around the Caribbean.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       My family came back, and Jane, pulling out the peanut butter and pickles, said,  I saw a new bird in the sky. It wasnt something weve ever seen  before.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Jane will never admit it, but shes developed that same dewey decimal system  that helps her narrow in on the species. Because we evolved to categorize  plants and animals, just a fraction-of-a-second glance at something in the  natural world can tell us all sorts of things about what it is we are looking at. And what my  glance is what Janes glance says. And thats the glance that says things  need to be investigated further.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On July, 7, 2009, barristers representing the Bahamian government, Discovery  Land Company and Save Guana Cay Reef assembled at the Privy Council in London.
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       had fought their cases through every court in the  Bahamas. For a case to make it all the way to Privy Council is the  equivalent of a case making it to the U.S. Supreme Court. The difference  is that Privy Council is the court of final appeal for overseas territories,  Crown dependencies and Commonwealth nations such as the Bahamas who have yet to  separate their legal system from the UK.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The Privy Council has played a role throughout history in the U.K.s empire.  Even Benjamin Franklin had to appear before Privy Council.

       or three days, the barristers would argue the merit of  Save Guana Cay Reefs case.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       was represented by a young lawyer from Muirhead &amp;  Burton, a highly respected solicitors firm in London, among whose specialties  included Privy Council and human rights work. The barrister took the case  to a new level. The case, which had been building in complexity and  detail for four years, had become dizzying collection of paperwork. The case was so far-reaching, that it touched on some of the fundamental components of the Bahamian legal system. It was just a development case, but it was more than a development case.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       On day one, the five Lords listened intently to the appellants case. Over  and over again, the Lords returned to the evidence in the Environmental Impact Statement that the  defendents deliberately avoided consultation with the local Bahamians of Great  Guana Cay. The trial became extremely intense. The lords appeared  to be, quite simply, disgusted by the Bakers Bay Golf &amp; Ocean Club. They  showed their disgust especially as images of the development before-and-after  images were shown. The Lords also appeared to be appalled by the  deliberate policy by the developers of non-consultation with the locals.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Throughout the days in the court, the developer and Bahamian government were  railed on by the Lords on many of the appellants points. It was apparent,  however, that the Lords were conflicted by the fact that the development had  already made so much progress in construction.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       All sides waited for months before the Lords announced a  ruling: the Lords did not declare the Heads of Agreement between the developer  and the government as null and void. The  Lords made it clear that they had no legal mechanism to protect Great Guana Cay  from what they called indiscriminate development.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       They wrote in  the judgment,
       <em>
        
       </em>
       The Bahamas has no comprehensive legislation  for environmental protection, or public consultation on the disposition of  public lands
       <br/>
       <br/>
       In a press  release, the locals explained that they will continue their fight against the  Bakers Bay Club, Challenges through the courts have been only one  avenue of challenge. SGCRA will continue to bring domestic and international  publicity to this abuse and to the injustice to which the people of Guana Cay  were subjected by the delays in the judicial process, the collaboration between  the Government and the Developers, the financial pressure brought by Bakers  Bay and the destruction of the environment and the ruination of the peaceful  Family Island style life which this $500,000,000 mega anchor development  project and Central Governments dictates and abuse have raped the Cay with.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Again, the  news came hard on the Bahamians of Great Guana Cay. The President of
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       , however, stated that something about the  ruling made him feel good, because now, when Bakers Bay fails, it will be  entirely in their own hands.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       But as the  loss at Privy Council became clear, something else was beginning to crystallize:  the hard fight had literally changed the Bahamas, and even the Caribbean.

       t Beef Island  in the British Virgin Islands, a local group had found that a five-star  development project would destroy a key natural asset of the island; a salt  pond and mangroves area called Hans Creek.  Fishermen and local citizens joined  forces to protect the area. They  had learned about the Great Guana Cay strategy and contacted attorney
       <em>
        Save Guana Cay Reef
       </em>
       attorney Fred Smith, who  started them off on a legal plan to fight the development.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 2009, the  British Virgin Islands golf development had been halted by the locals through the British Virgin Islands court system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shannon Gore, a marine biologist in the British Virgin Islands lamented the  decision in the Bahamas, explaining, Sustainable  development has a balance between economic, environmental, socio-cultural and  governance components but when there is an imbalance, this simple framework for  sustainability becomes skewed and the other components become compromised.  Alienating a community or breaking down the socio-cultural component is what  happened at Guana Cay and will most likely continue to hinder its developments  from ever being truly sustainable. The economic side has probably had a drastic  effect on everyone involved, just the cost of litigation alone has probably far  exceeded what was in the original budget of the development.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as the locals in the British Virgin Islands won their case, Gore  explained, Because the Guana Cay community came together as one and fought the  developer and government, they have led the way for other island communities to  stand up and fight for what they truly believe to be as sustainable. Inspired  by and following in the footsteps of Guana Cay, the case of the Beef Island  development was the first time a group of concerned citizens in the BVI had  ever taken a developer and the government to court, and won. While the Beef  Island development may not be entirely shut down, it has empowered the  community to fight when they believe something is not sustainable for their  environment, their culture or the economic welfare of the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an article in the BVI News,  the director for the group that derailed the developer plans, explained the  larger significance of the ruling: [It] sets an example for others  throughout the Caribbean that they can be heard when challenging these types of  ecologically destructive mega-developments.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Guana Cay case was  also inspiring groups across the Bahamas.  During the governments anchor development phase, of which the Bakers  Bay golf development is a product of, the Bahamian government set out to create  megadevelopments in every major island chain.  But groups, inspired by Save Guana Cay Reef, were formed around almost  every single one of these megadevelopments.  Today, Bakers Bay is one of the last-standing megadevelopments from the  Bahamian governments megadevelopment policy.
      </p>

       A day later, I  am with my wife and son on a beach of mainland Abaco. I see them on the horizon  Jane is picking  up shells and handing them to our boy. I  look away from them, and up at the sky, and there I see it again, the white  bird, circling in the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time,  there is no doubt as to what it is  a swallow-tailed kite  a type of hawk known more  for Southern Florida and the airstreams above the jungles of Latin America. Why is it here?

       As of October  2010, six years after the project began, Bakers Bay has begun construction on only  six homes, even though pundits had claimed only two years ago that over  two-hundred units would be sold by now.  According to contractors working on the project, there are no more  contracts for homes in the works, and some are saying that all six units are for Bakers Bay investors. This means absolutely no homes are being  built for non-investors.

       Just last  month, the parent company for Bakers Bay saw one of their flagship golf  developments, the Spanish Oaks property in Texas, fall to foreclosure. Some  golf analysts are privately saying the industrys golden era is over, and that  perhaps, even, that newer gated communities with hundreds of golf-side  megamansions, as a model, is over with.

       A few days  later, we kept seeing birds we had never seen in the Bahamas before. I ask a well-known birder in the Abacos why I  am seeing swallow-tailed kites in the Abacos, why Im seeing other strange  birds, like a goose that is known to live in Greenland, and which has never been seen before in the Bahamas. He says the weather has been weird this year.  He says the birds got thrown off course, maybe.  Thats one way to put it. But to get  here  to achieve those incredible distances  those hawks and warblers and  geese achieved incredibly and unlikely distances - they pointed their wings toward the storm and flew.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to whether  the development will fail or succeed is anybodys guess. But to the people of the Abacos, I ask, why  not at least consider what might happen to Great Guana Cay if the development  fails? What a lovely restoration project  that land would make. A place for  families to plant mangroves, and begin the land anew, to return Great Guana Cay  to a place known for the integrity of its coral reef and the beauty of its  settlement  not as the place George Clooney visited or where mean, rich  golfers swear and honk their golf cart horns.  What a lovely place for a national marine park. What a lovely place to remind Bahamians that the  destiny of places are better realized by the people who live there. What a great place for the people of the Caribbean  to turn to, and to say, this is the place where the people fought to save their  coral reef, and who taught us to point our wings to the storm and fly.
