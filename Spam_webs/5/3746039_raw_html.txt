              Yet another amazing episode.  Thanks so much Pat and Ryan.  I didnt want it to end.  In addition to creating and selling your own products, Id be very interested in learning and about sourcing and reselling from existing manufacturers.

                Hey Paul, the process that Pat and I outlined does indeed work with existing manufacturers, but they have your label on them, so its YOUR business. That is the key difference. Glad you didnt want the show to end!

              Why do I listen to these podcasts while running?  I cant take all of the notes that I need to.  This episode was awesome!  Thank you Ryan and Pat. Next listen will be with a pen and paper. I appreciate all of the information that Ryan shared.  I currently run an eCommerce store and have considered adding Amazon as a distributor.  I thought I was in the growth mode, but I think Im still in the grind.  Off to take action!

                Thanks Alice! Using Amazon is a great way to get out of the grind mode and into growth, because youre using a proven sales channel. Ive built all my businesses around the idea of using existing channels.

                  Ryan, do you have a podcast or any information for existing eCommerce sellers that want to sell on Amazon? I guess it is a similar process

                    The process is exactly the same  you still send your inventory to Amazon and run through the same process.

                    Thank you! It seems like something I should have done long ago. I have an existing customer base so getting those initial sales with a big coupon should work. Really appreciate this information!

              I have been following Ryan Daniel Moran for a while now, but I just found Pat Flynn. Ive really enjoyed Pats Podcasts thus far. I was checking FreedomFastLane.com for a new podcast and then I came back to this website and was surprised to see Ryan Moran on this Podcast. It was two of my new favorite podcasters in one place! Thanks so much to both of you!

                  Hey Nessa, we should be all good now. The increase in traffic broke a WordPress plugin, which brought the whole site down. I lost some sleep and some hair, but we fixed it.

              Hey Ryan and Pat,
             </p>
             <p>
              Im very fascinated by the concept of selling private label products on Amazon, though it does seem daunting to jump into without any prior success in online business. Ive heard very good things about the ASM course, which is expensive and exclusive, but which some folks describe as near essential for any hope of success in that space. Would you advise wantrepreneurs like myself against jumping into the Amazon jungle without a comprehensive education like ASM?

              I was so excited to hear this episode! Ive been developing my product for the last few years and have finally finished a new and much improved version after a successful Kickstarter Campaign validated the idea (trying to use Lean Start-up methodology).
             </p>
             <p>
              I got some pretty harsh feedback from the Kickstarter community  deserved it  but it was really useful in figuring out what needed to be improved. Ive spent the last few months organising to have it shipped from Shenzen to Amazon FBA (its a big job with a lot of moving parts). Its now on its way to the United States!
             </p>
             <p>
              After this podcast, today I already commissioned for a new variation on the existing product so I can have current Product A on Amazon to start with and then in about 6 months, try and get Product B on Amazon too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you so much Pat and Ryan, Im so grateful to you both for sharing this info and reinforcing that Im on the right track. If youre interested in any way in my story, you can visit my blog  hope my very humble journey might help you? I share my Chinese suppliers info etc. Definitely trying not to spam.

              Hey Pat and Ryan! Ive been looking for more content from trusted sources on this topic as well as drop shipping, which I would also like to know more about. Ive done quite a bit of research on both (but always have more to learn!), and am nearly done finishing my website for the ultra-light backpacker (www.thelightestbackpacker.com) with several guest bloggers and products (yay!). Definitely bring back Ryan when you can, as I think we all want to soak in more gems

              Great episode but curious as to why those yoga mats are priced so high? Is it b/c no one questions it? As someone with an avid practice, I can get my eco friendly mats much cheaper with free shipping in a variety of colors. Just paid 21.00 for a new one. I might check Amazon out but would not choose to buy these types of products from them. With the prices you are charging,  there is absolutely no reason to.

             <p>
              Im in the beginning stages of sourcing a product so I havent gotten near sending anything to Amazon yet but I have done a lot of research.  One thing I havent been able to figure out, and was eluded to on this podcast, is how do you call your customers?  If Amazon doesnt give you any customer info, how do you call your customer to make sure they are happy and push them towards giving you a review?  Where does their number come from?
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks again

                Ive had trouble with this myself. Emailing customers through Amazon does not elicit many responses. I have emailed 50 customers and only received 1 response. I am at 20 reviews and it took me forever to get those. Ill have to search for the customer contact number and see if that works.

              Great episode. One thing I felt like was brushed right over was product design, and patents. Who is actually designing the product? Are you basically just pitching an idea to the manufacturer (hey, could you just make the mat a little thicker?) and leveraging their experience with that type of product to come up with something new? Yoga mats are simple compared to other products, so Im curious how the prototyping and design process goes for a more complex product. Also, there wasnt any mention of patents, either stepping on someone elses patent or protecting your own design. Any concerns on that?

                Hey Matt,
               </p>
               <p>
                We ran into an issue with patents on our yoga towel. After we did some research, we found out that one company had a patent on a certain shape of non slip towel. However, the patent was on the shape, and nothing else.
               </p>
               <p>
                Because of that, we were able to easily create our own product that didnt violate any patents.
               </p>
               <p>
                Regarding the rest of your questions, Ive tried to outline those details as specifically as possible in my interview with my business partner, Sean. Its the Step By Step to Six Figures On Amazon episode on my podcast.

                  Thats really interesting. When listening to your interview with Pat, I had the impression that you created a product that was completely new to the market, but after a quick search on Amazon, its evident that there are a TON of yoga mat products out there, and many even emphasize the same features you described with yours. I say all this just to let you know that Im even more impressed at your success after seeing all the competition for that product. It goes to show that your strategies and persistence through the grind are really where the success is found.

              Hey guys, great podcast.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ryan, the thank you link wont work for me, brings me to a idk what youre looking for page.
             </p>
             <p>
              Heres what I got out of it:
              <br/>
              1. Think about an industry that is growing offline
              <br/>
              2. Go on reddit to see what people actually want in that industry
              <br/>
              3. Find products on alibaba for that match what you learned
              <br/>
              4. By as much as you can and send it to amazon
              <br/>
              5. Reach that market using facebook
              <br/>
              6. Get them to buy and review
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess my concerns are about how to know what product to start selling and how to reach the people that want to buy that.

                Dang it. Of course this would happen. Fixing now. Thanks for the heads up.

               <p>
                Regarding what to sell: just let the market tell you. Look for things that sell offline and increasing trends.

                  This was a sincere question to Pat actually.  But with your sarcastic response, you missed an opportunity to win my trust.  This podcast was the first time I had even heard about you.  I do not have a good impression of you at this point, and really I dont think Pat intends for his followers to be treated poorly by his guests. But I guess you didnt take that into consideration when you thought you were giving a smart alec response to my question directed at Pat.

                    Hey M, thanks for the honest question. Ive met Ryan in person and have had long chats with him outside of the podcast. From the interaction Ive had with him hes totally down to earth and so I think his reply was more of a joke than anything, but Im not here to change your first impression of him. That has been already made. But I will take the time to share one more thing about validating guests and their claims.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    To be honest, its hard to 100% know if what anybody is saying is actually 100% true. You could even say the same thing about what i do, the income reports that I post, the stories I share, etc. Did I really come from an architectural background? So on and so forth. Of course, I have all of the documents and everything to back up my claims, but it would be crazy for me to ask every guest for a tax report if you get what I mean. I have a lot of people ask to get on this show and I dont pick just anyone, and I feel I have a good sense of who to trust and who not to trust. A lot of people asked the same thing about Dane Maxwell in episode 46 but I did my research (like I did with this podcast) talking to other people to verify as much as I could, but the only thing that truly can be tested, which is why I feel like Ive been able to grow so quickly in such a short period of time, is if I do what they say does it work? Thats why I said in this episode that Id love to put this to the test and try it out. A lot of people tried out Danes stuff and have seen amazing results, which backs up my research and his claims, and Id love to test Ryans stuff out myself too. Hope this makes sense M. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

                    Interestingly enough, Jarran in a more recent comment has expressed that hes done what Ryan laid out in this podcast before as well, and has seen great results. Let me know if youd like to discuss this further. Thanks M!

                    Pat, thank you for your thoughtful reply. I have just witnessed a huge contrast on how 2 entrepreneurs respond to a situation, and your response is admirable and one that many budding entrepreneurs can model after.  It is respectful of the challenges that new entrepreneurs face, without mocking the basic questions that arise when coming across something that sounds too good to be true.  I believe that this is one of the qualities that sets you apart from all the others, because you have not forgotten what it is like to start out from scratch. You provide information, warts and all, to help your followers navigate through obstacles that you may have also experienced.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Ryan may have thought he was being funny, but his response struck me as odd and out of place.  You graciously lent him your influence with your followers and he pretty much squandered it away.  Look at his second response for example.  Another wasted opportunity to be helpful.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    On the other hand, your other guests Ryan Coisson and Daniel, gave people who participated in their recent free webinar a whopping THREE extra hours AFTER the webinar to answer every question imaginable that was thrown at them. It was almost after 1:00 AM when all was said and done. I mean, it was really impressive how well they represented you after you lent them your influence with your viewers.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Your explanation on how you check out guests who ask to be featured on one of your podcasts is actually informative. Thank you again for taking the time to answer my question. I really really appreciate it. You empower others, which is why you are much beloved by your followers.

                    Hey M, I love Pat, too. Hes a wonderful, genuine, inspiring person. At least we agree on that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I quit the internet marketing world two years ago because I didnt like the people in the community, and Pat is pretty much the lone exception of people that does things the right way. Thats why I came onto the show and revealed everything I possibly could to help his community. Ive only ever revealed this information with my own community or at my $5,000 events. I hope the interview was immensely valuable to you.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If my style isnt like yours (which it clearly isnt), thats cool too. And if you are anti-handsome-people (as you seem to be), thats okay too. Im cool either way. You wouldnt be the first, and likely not the last person to dislike me (unless I get killed by a car in the morning, which is totally possible, because I plan on jaywalking. In that event, then you would actually be the last person to dislike me).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I always had a hard time attempting to judge a person with only one textual sentence, but if youve been able to do that with me as you indicated above, then I am very impressed with your ability to read people.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Regardless of whether you thought the interview was helpful or not, whether you like me or cant stand me, whether you find me helpful or rude, whether you think Im handsome or ugly, I hope that you still find joy and fulfillment wherever you go next.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Best,

                    Its great to see another side of you Ryan. Actually I do
                    <br/>
                    find you funny, but your comedic timing needs work. And sorry Im not that
                    <br/>
                    great of judge of handsomeness when I havent actually seen the person (a
                    <br/>
                    microscopic thumbnail photo of you doesnt count).  But Ill take your word for it, if that makes
                    <br/>
                    you feel better.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You know Ryan, you and I do have something else in common. I
                    <br/>
                    also quit a marketing job because I could no longer stand the arrogant, amoral
                    <br/>
                    people that surrounded me day in and day out. I am trying to find a better life
                    <br/>
                    for myself and my family, which is why I am carefully weighing my options. Do
                    <br/>
                    you know why I posed my question to Pat? It is because I cannot afford to mess
                    <br/>
                    up in what I do next. I have to get it right this time, because failure is not
                    <br/>
                    an option at this point in my life.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I am not looking for sympathy. I am looking for something
                    <br/>
                    that is sustainable and will provide me and my family the freedom of choice.
                    <br/>
                    The motivation is freedom. I listened carefully to the podcast several times,
                    <br/>
                    because I was genuinely interested in what you had to say. Currently, I am in
                    <br/>
                    the process of setting up an LLC to start an Amazon FBA business. In the back
                    <br/>
                    of my mind I am very concerned that it will take too long to generate income.
                    <br/>
                    Whatever funds I have set aside are getting swallowed up by all sorts of fees
                    <br/>
                    (accountant, lawyer etc.) before I have even made my first sale.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Thank you for wishing me well in my journey. I wish the same
                    <br/>
                    for you. Peace.

                    Thanks for the kind words M, and thanks to you both actually for handling this in a respectful manner. Its okay to disagree, to question and to raise your hand. Its great to reply and have a conversation. I want that, or else I would close the comment section of my blog (which I will never do). These discussions add so much value to the post or podcast. Thanks again, and wishing you both the best!

                    Absolutely. A strong jaw line is key to success! Just ask our friend Tony Robbins!

                    thanks for the light hearted exchange. Good to have a little fun every once in a while.
                    <br/>
                    For anyone else out there, Ryans interview with partner Sean was also very informative and may close the loop on other questions.  Youd be doing yourself a favor if you subscribed to the podcast.  Againthank yoy Pat for the interview. Peace!

                    You do realize that when you or others make explicit claims to money made it opens the door for challenges. You post numbers but no tax filing to back up your claims. I am not asking for nor do I feel it necessary to  ask for this data but we all know that this approach adds credence to your posts and podcasts as well as making you a potential target in future. Perhaps fodder for a future post and podcast detailing the legal liabilities you and others must anticipate and the associated means and  costs of protecting yourself from associated  financial and emotional catastrophes.

                    Great response here. I think the toughest thing for many to grasp, including myself, is the amount of focus, hard work, and resolve you must have to finish the job and stick with it. You have to be extremely motivated and power through the initial failures before you see the results. I think this is what Pat and all the people he interviews, have in common. Being consistent in what you do. Pats blog is proof enough of this very fact. Think of the hours it takes Pat just to put up a high content and valuable post or podcast. This level of work will rival even the most productive people in the corporate world.  In an case, Im Failing every day and hopefully someday the hard work will pay off. I just take comfort in the fact I can come here and get my jolt of motivation. So take the examples, leverage your own creativity, and aim for the sky!

              What a fantastic episode!  Thank you Pat for hosting and thank you Ryan for all of the step by step detail.  I have already listened to this episode twice and I will probably listen again.  I live in rural Washington state (about 30 minutes from the nearest anything) and I do as much shopping on Amazon as possible.  I love their services and the deliver to my door convince.  I am currently a high school STEM teacher but I formerly was a manufacturing engineer.  I have been wanting to get back in the production game and think something like this would be a great way to supplement my loss in income.  I am definitely also going to check out Ryans Podcast too.  Thank you both for all the info.

You have already provided me with a great deal of value in just 4 episodes!  Thank you for teaching and inspiring us all.

                  Pat that is fantastic that your son is enrolled in a STEM school at such an early age!  Designing and building things is so much fun, I am glad schools are again putting emphasis on it.  Lets bring manufacturing back the the US!  Just today, I got to take a small group of inspired students to a shipyard in Anacortes WA to see STEM in action.  We got to see ferries, barges, and state of the art Navy research vessels being built.  Life is good!

                Kudos to you Matt for jumping into the education front. Especially STEM.  Its such a wonderful way to spark childrens imagination. I myself am an engineer and heavily into manufacturing as well as into art and design. Hoping i can get my kids into appreciating both technical and the creative side of their brain. Hope u crush it on Amazon! Love these podcasts but they always make rethink what i am currenly pursuing! One part tells me to stay my original course and the other side tells me to pivot.

                  Thank you drivenmavens for the complements / recognition.  I appreciate anyone who appreciates teachers.  I too hope that you are able to teach, inspire, and bond with your children while constructing fun projects!  My wife and I just had our first baby 5 months ago and I also hope someday share the same experiences with her.

                    Np Matt. We have a family of educators. My father being a distinguished prof at a University. My niche is in auto design education (though i am trying to niche out:)) So for me, drawing with my kids is a lot of fun and great for an adults creativity! Youre going to do great Matt! Just keep pulling forward!

              Dear Pat &amp; Ryan,
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you for this episode. It was great that each step was very actionable and goal oriented. Another episode would be great!
             </p>
             <p>
              I have a few questions:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Im in Istanbul, Turkey. So, outside of US, or any other countries Amazon is operating in (like Amazon UK), would this be possible? (Ive done a search but found some shady youtube videos)
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Are there links we can reach for each step you mentioned? (Like where to setup an amazon account for this, or how to set up an account for the forwarder)
             </p>
             <p>
              3) When you were going into the yoga mat business with your partner Sean, how much time did it take you each per day to form this business?
             </p>
             <p>
              4) If a mat breaks apart after 3-4 months of heavy use, can a customer return it? Is it hard to manage this process on your end?
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you very much for sharing Pat &amp; Ryan

              Since you said let me know in the show notes if you want to know more, thats what Im doing: YES, PLEASE, tell us more about what you actually do with your passive income once youve collected it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its so interesting to get to know the guy behind the website a little better, and I feel like the only awesome thing I know so far is that you and your wife walk your kid to school every day

              Ryan makes this sound really easy, just think of a popular product, order it overseas and start selling. Im curious how many failures hes had using this same formula. Has he tried this with 20-50 products and made money on everything or has there been a lot of losers in the mix with only a few successes?

                Like I mention in the episode, he does make it sound easy, which is why Id like to put this into practice to see how easy (or not) it might be.

                Gigi, Ive done it with about a dozen products. One loser. The reason: dying market, and way too competitive. All others have made money.

              Pat and Ryan just wanted to leave a quick note and express my immense gratitude. Pat the Podcast episodes that you have done thus far have had a staggering impact on my motivation as well as my bottom line in my businesses. A single example- my girlfriend and I have now partnered up with Feeding America and are now providing 21 meals to a starving person in need for each one of our products sold. Making our motivation the highest its ever been, so for that I thank you. And Ryan, to give the massive step by step value you did in this episode is astonishing. My girlfriend and I have gone through each step you mentioned in our businesses over that last few years and for any inspiring entrepreneurs involved in e commerce reading this, I implore you to take the step by step advice Ryan laid out. It is stone cold spot on. Needless to say Ryan we will be checking out and subscribing to your podcast. With a grateful heart we would like to wish you both the utmost happiness.

                  Insurance is generally recommended, but not always necessary. If you are using a domestic supplier, they will often carry insurance for you so that you dont have the overhead. Return rate is low  less than 5%  and processing is all in Amazons FBA fee. I was calculating all of that in when I said that my profit margins across the board are about 50%.

                The dirty little secret in product manufacturing is that most people dont carry it unless required by a large vendor like Walmart or Home Depot. Realistically, it is very expensive ($thousands, for something with a couple million coverage) and most people selling $30k worth of sunglasses a year wont be able to cover it. In those cases, the best thing to do, IMO, is to import things that are unlikely to cause personal injury (dining room tables, for example, have a very low chance of causing death!).

                Dade, I base ALL of my product decisions on what my customer is most likely to buy that will enhance their experience. I dont think there is any better way to roll out subsequent products than that.

              Hi Pat.  I love your podcasts!  Thank you so much for all of your incredible information!  As a yoga instructor trying to learn more about the how I can use my skills to help people online, this episode was uniquely awesome for me.  I was surprised and super excited to hear that Ryans business was yoga mats (and I cant wait to check them out!).  Together I thought you guys broke everything down really well.  The show was really interesting and I was sad when it was over because I liked it so much.  I would love to hear Ryan on your show again.  Thank you both for the great information!

              Two requests:
              <br/>
              1.) Please host Ryan again  you two are a fabulous combination of fascinating and informative.
             </p>
             <p>
              2.) Please geek out on the investing side of things. I have grown from someone who could barely balance a checkbook to someone who has an investment scheme that most of my friends cant understand. Im constantly disappointed by the lack of podcasts in the realm of financial independence field. Yes, there are a lot of fusty financial podcasts out there, but Ive found that their content is extremely stale. Id love to hear a dynamic investment podcast(s) geared towards families working their way to financial independence via a growing business.

                Katie, investment is my FAVORITE thing to talk about. While I reveal a lot on my podcast, Id love to be able to reveal more. Thanks for letting me know that this would be a great conversation  I hope to be back!

              I apologize if someone already asked this but what logo, tag or name did you actually put on the yoga mat? Ive bought several brand name mats over the years and was just curious how you handled this aspect?

                Amazon has two types of ads. Amazon product ads send people off Amazon. PPC send people to your product page on Amazon. Log in to your seller central account. At the top of the page you should see Advertising . If you mouse over that, you can click on Campaign Manager. That is where you set up Amazon PPC.

              Ryan, Im already on Amazon with a ton all of my beauty products but only a couple are selling at random and zero feedback.  What  should I do at this point?  Take all the listings off and start by building up the sales and feedback in the steps you recommended one by one?

              Hi Ryan
             </p>
             <p>
              I got a question about contacting customers through Amazon. Isnt against FBA policy for you to contact them and linking them to an outside site to get their emails? Or did I mishear the podcast?

             </p>
             <p>
              I really love this talk and am going to put it into action. I made a step by step process worksheet that Ryan described from 0 to 1 million.

              Hope you guys would like it and make it better together (It is open to anyones edit  please feel free to make it better.)  chances are I missed some steps

              Great Episode. Im now subscribed to Freedom Fast Lane.
              <br/>
              I have a product on kickstarter that is doing well, but it is in a phase where I need to educate the customer (Bottle Bit). Nobody will go to Amazon looking for it. I plan to sell it on my website and do my best at social marketing to get people there where they can watch videos to see what it does. Does it make sense to put something like this on Amazon?

              Hi Ryan &amp; Pat,
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you both for providing all this value, I am sure you are going to help and inspire tons of people and also save so many people from failure, me included.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have a question to you Ryan, and perhaps you too Pat if you can help me out here ( and of course everyone else here too!). I am starting my first Amazon business shortly and tackling few problems.
             </p>
             <p>
              Firstly, I am based in Australia and unfortunately Amazon does not have a warehouse here, that means I have to go through the inconvenience to somehow ship my items to US and then hire a freight forwarder of some sort that helps me from that end. Is that something you guys did as well Ryan? I know you mentioned your partner handled most stuff in regards to shipping so I dont expect a perfect answer here. Pat would you know who/where international shippers should turn their heads too? Ryan perhaps your buddy and business partner has a blog if you are willing to share that?
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly I have a question regarding branding and logo design etc. I know about 99design which is a super good websites for digital creations, but does that also go well for putting branding on cloth material? There was no mention who stood for the brand creation for zen active so I am a bit curious here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks heaps to both of you!
             </p>

             <p>
              Another great Amazon show! Please bring us more content like this. Ive been doing Amazon FBA ever since the Jessica Lawrew show. Prior to that, I was doing merchant fulfilled business on Amazon. FBA definitely increased sales beyond what I thought was possible, but as you alluded to, retail arbitrage tends to be time consuming. This is where Im struggling how do we set up the middle man system where our products get from the manufacturer to Amazon without us ever touching the process (short of emailing FBA product listing stickers to whoever is going to put those on).
             </p>
             <p>
              That was the one part of the show that was a little foggy (i.e. freight forwarding). Ryan even said that freight forwarding isnt a player if you use a US domestic supplier, but Im still confused of how the FBA prep is getting done even when using a U.S. based manufacturer. As you know, you need to set up a shipment plan and normally I would be purchasing the postage direct through Amazon. Im assuming there is a way to decline purchasing the UPS shipping through Amazon, but then wed also be losing the low rate that Amazon gets from UPS. Assuming our margins can deal with whatever the shipping cost from a manufacturer to Amazon is, how do we set up a system with them to ensure that stuff gets prepped properly and sent to the Amazon warehouse?
             </p>
             <p>
              It sounds like Ryan doesnt touch that process in his business much, but for those of who dont already have private label products, we dont know how to get that relationship and system set up. If you could do an episode that addresses that specifically, I think it would mean the difference between making some extra money and building a scalable business. Weve gotten great information on how to do product development and marketing, but Im just confused on the logistics piece. Do you think that is possible to have a show like that or do you have some resources we can look at that would help us better understand how that part of the logistics is handled?
             </p>
             <p>
              Thanks so much for all the great content you put out and thank you to Ryan for coming on the show. I look forward to listening to his podcasts now as well!

              Only halfway through this episode and its already blown my mind. Thanks, Pat. Thanks, Ryan. (Really appreciating the way Ryan checks in with Pat from time to time throughout the conversation, just to make sure Pat AND his audience are clearly able to follow along, step by step. Theres a patience in Ryans teaching style that appeals to me.)

              Hello all,
              <br/>
              Kinda slow to the party on this one, but I hope I havent missed the boat. Ill admit, it is something that does trouble me sometimes with this stuff, especially online business as it moves so quickly.
              <br/>
              Anyway, had a quick question for Ryan (or anyone that could help, for that matter) regarding sourcing from Alibaba and the rather grey areas of Intellectual Property Rights/Copyright infringement it brings up.
              <br/>
              I am creating a new line of products (which Ive been working on for a little while) and I wondered what the position was as far as taking an existing Alibaba product and changing it adding logos, changing colors, changing the size etc. and how that affects the original version. Especially when the Alibaba product youre looking at is pretty much a direct rip-off of a pre-existing product. I guess Im asking, how far do you have to change it for it to become safe? Also, what happens if that company (with the original product that Alibaba has pretty much copied) is no longer trading or in business  where do I stand there?
              <br/>
              Hope anyone can shed some light on this situation, Im stuck at this road block and cant hit purchase on the units until I have eased my doubts. Many thanks, Richard.

                Keep in mind, theres millions of direct copy cat products at almost any store. Think about all the generic Ketchup you buy from the supermarket. Looks just like a heinz bottle!
               </p>
               <p>
                Trademarks and copyrights are pretty easy to navigate. Basically, dont brand something that is going to cause obvious confusion for consumers or capitalize on anothers brand (i.e. importing an MP3 player called iPood).
               </p>
               <p>
                Patents are a little more dangerous though, but generally, most products arent patented.

              Hi Ryan! Thanks for an interesting podcast. One question how did you order a prototype on Alibaba when most of suppliers have minimum order quantity like 500 pieces? Did you send inquiries to all suppliers no matter of min. order quantity stated by supplier or you look for a supplier allowing small orders?

                If youre simply private labeling a product, you can find a supplier that will deal with a lower order quantity (especially if youre a low maintenance customer who basically just wants their bank info to send the money to). If youre prototyping an entirely new product, youre either going to have to suck it up for the MOQs or have such a compelling product that the promise of giving them selling rights for other territories is worth the risk of manufacturing the entirely new product.

              NUMBERS NEVER LIE! Unfortunately people do every day.  Im a big fan of this site mostly because of Pats transparency and willingness to share both his wins and losses but Im sorry to say the same cant be said for Ryan.  Ryans numbers just dont add up  I suspect because inflating his actual numbers makes his business advice sound more authoritative resulting in increased sales.  Quick example  in this Podcast Ryan claims you dont get out of the grind phase until your first product is selling at least 20 units a day.  He then goes on to say after adding a second product (the yoga block) his sales for the yoga mat alone went up to 50 units a day and combined sales between the two products went up to 250 sales a day.  This all sounds great and everyone is on their way to making an easy $1Million but hold on a sec.  A quick check over at Ryans site Freedom Fast Lane shows his detailed income report for December 2014 that lists monthly income for Zen Active Fitness as $23,000.  Thats great money in my book but a far cry from being a $1Million company (according to Ryan he sold this business for an undisclosed sum the following month).  A further breakdown of this figure shows the following  according to Ryan the yoga mats sell for about $35 each  if he sold 22 yoga mats a day that would bring in just over $23,000 per month  according to his own reported revenue his first product, the yoga mat, is barely even out of the grind phase as he describes it and it is a mathematical impossibility he could be selling over 50 yoga mats a day and making 250 sales between all his products as he claimed in this podcast.  These are all figures Ryan himself put out there for public viewing pleasure so I dont know why he left such a glaring gap between his claims on this site and what he self reports on his own site  maybe he just assumed no one would bother to cross check the info.  Again, I have no axe to grind, I dont even no Ryan so I mean him no harm but I cant stand being lied to  those kinds of lies only serve to cast the shadow of a desperate internet marketer on the whole conversation here  its dissapointing.

                Well Im not following his advice! Itd suck to only have an extra $23k income per month when I was hoping my $1M sales at 50% margin split with my business partner would generate Oh yeah about $23k per month! You know what they say, Haters gotta Hate.

                  Youre missing the point  the numbers on his site appear to reflect the total revenue for the sales each month  you can go back through history and and see the prgression of revenue  it is not split out between partner sharing and profit margin.  So, back to my point, if the numbers are that far off than the crediblity of the whole business model is out the door in my opinion.  If this is such a viable, profitable venture why is there a need to inflate/make up results?  In fact, if you go to Ryans website he actually has a couple posts about a day of reckoning coming for Amazon sellers  essentially, unless your business is pulling in over $50K a month he believes your business wont survive thus new wave thats about to sweep over the Amazon market.  So on one hand he is beating the drum selling his story on how successful you can be following his lead on Amaazon and on the other side hes predicitng a doomsday scenario for fledgling Amazon sellers  which one is it?  Im not hating, just pointing out some concerning discrepencies  makes me wonder what is legit and what is just hoopla being promoted to attract new paying customers.

                    If I was trying to mislead you, dont you think Id try to do a better job of hiding my lies?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Youre confusing companies. I have three different Amazon projects  one that I talk about very publicly which I recently sold, and two others that I am less public about. When you read my income reports, I break them all out, but when I tell stories, I will pull from all three. I have no incentive to inflate anything.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also, I believe the day of reckoning as you call it is what I call a market consolidation. Ive recently posted an episode all about this that address this.

                   <p>
                    Hope this clears things up,

              You mentioned that you had the manufacturer ship directly to Amazon via FBA. Did you have the manufacturer create the labels that Amazon requires or did you pay amazon to place them on the item?

              @ryanmoran:disqus and @patwithspi:disqus  Thank you immensely for this episode!  I was way behind on listening to my podcasts and this one got bumped out of my queue some time back.  It was recently brought up on one of the latest episodes (I think 159) and so I had to go back and download it.  This is one of my favorite episode sessions of all time, from any podcast.  Thank you Ryan for the in depth view of what you did to grow an Amazon businesstruly amazing stuff. I know the devils in the details but at least you gave us a great road map of how to get there!
             </p>
             <p>
              I am curious though  you said you were about to break away and start selling through your own channel as well.  I understand the dont keep all your eggs in one basket and thats the reason to consider selling via your own site, etc.  The fulfillment with Amazon approach is beautiful in that they literally handle everything from customer service to packing, shipping and returns.  So with that in mind, is it really worth doing this on your own knowing youd have to employ full time employees to meet all those rolesthen your mostly passive source of income turns into a business that you have to manage constantly.granted, your margins would likely increase but your time would (more than likely) take a sharp decline.  Just wondering your thoughts on this as well as if youve come up with a strategy to keep your involvement as low as possible while increasing your margins and broadening your brand?

             <p>
              In LNW, I teach people about different IM strategies that will allow for total freedom from work while making lots of money. This is a no BS straight edge course. The name of the course says it all  its Loving NOT WORKING, not loving your job.
             </p>
             <p>
              The course includes at least 10 awesome passive income strategies that I have tested myself and thats how I made over a million dollars. Theres even a lesson that specifically explains how to make a million dollars. And the course package also includes personal access to me, so that I can personally help LNW students become successful in their chosen online business.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would really appreciate your help in spreading the word around so that Internet Marketers can benefit from this awesome product.
