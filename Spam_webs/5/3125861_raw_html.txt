           What is link building in seo?
          </h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
           A simple definition of link building in 2015 is that it is the art of gettingother websites to link to your website to improve your rankings in Google. There are many ways to build links in 2015. Some techniques are legitimate or white hat and many  perhaps most  are now classed as black hat, e.g. techniques that violate Googles Webmaster Guidelines are called black hat or web spam.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
           This
           <span style="color: #3d3d3d;">
            link building guide
           </span>
           is for beginners  its not a guide on how to spam Google. One mans quality linkbuilding tacticis another mans unnatural link profile.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
           Remember that because if you have spammy links pushing up your rankings, the Google web spam team is aiming to demoteyour business inits free listings. And so are your competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
           Link building (a big part of offpage seo) is, if you followindustry news, a
           <em>
            dirty phrase to use
           </em>
           in 2015 and for some, is a tacticto be shunned  and thats largely because Google has, very successfully, equated linkbuilding with spam, and the industry newsmachine is basically started almost entirely  all the time  and fuelledby Google saying or doing something.
          </p>
          <p>
           Not all link building is web spamand in fact building links in 2015 is still an incredibly important aspect of search engine optimisation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Natural Links V UnnaturalLinks
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Google is on record saying it does not want to count any link that is not editorial  or freely given.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google wants to rewarduser value add highlightedby organic  NATURAL  links. They want to reward agood user experience, basically  and unnatural links dont form any part of that concept.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google never has wanted to count inorganic links  but its algorithms dont work as well as they would like or at least they say they do, so some marketers shortcut the value add task of the job and justbuild unnatural links to a site whichaffects how a links based search engine  like Google  rates the popularity  and so ranking ability  of a particular website.
          </p>
          <p>
           The more links Google hasnt classed as spam  the higher you rank  and the more traffic you get. Sort of.
          </p>
          <p>
           The type of links Google wants to count does not scale easily, and in fact, the type of links that scale easily are exactly the type of links Google wants to (at best) ignore or retroactively punish the violation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Perhapsthat is the whole point.
          </p>
          <p>
           Critics willsay this is because seo is the biggest threat to Adwords, Googles sponsored advertising channel  but if Google didnt take action on industrial scale manipulation  it would make the existence of theirguidelines redundant.
          </p>
          <p>
           If a link is manipulative it isspam  accordingto the Googleplex.
          </p>
          <p>
           You dont need machine automation to be classed as a spammer. Somebody sitting at a desk making these low-quality links all day  manually  to fool only Google thats spam too  manual or not.
          </p>
          <p>
           Posting lots of low-quality guest posts or low-quality press releases on sites with a history of spamming Google  thats spam too.
          </p>
          <p>
           It all comes down to the end product  the type of link you generate as a result of your activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           If links are designed JUST to manipulate Google 
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/unnatural-links/">
            Google calls them unnatural links
           </a>
            and if you have too many of them  you get a penalty  or at least swept up in the carnage of the next negative algorithm update designed specifically to de-rank sites with those kind of links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ranking adjustments, I think, couldbe based on how long you got away with foolingGoogle and what Google thinks that deserves.
          </p>
          <p>
           The website link building industry was largelybased on that kind of link building activity  and of course many still do practice those techniques now clearly out-with the guidelines  I know my first links I ever built would today be labelled unnatural  and so would my first optimisation techniques  but its a recognisable trend in Google whats grey hat seo today is black hat tomorrow.
          </p>
          <p>
           Take note that if it works to manipulate Google
           <em>
            without
           </em>
           you jumping through the

           <em>
            demands
           </em>
           you jump through  its spam. In short, it is evident if it is a scalable approach to manipulating Google  its spam.

           Some can say link building is dead but the fact is  in 2015  building links (any kinds of links) STILL affects your rankings in Google, in a BIG way, either positively  if from a trusted source  OR  negatively  if flagged as suspicious, over time.

          <p>
           For the most partGoogle will ignorea lot of your links, and will reward any site with

          </p>
          <p>
           Its been the case historically that more domain authority you have, the less unique offering you need when it comes to content.

            Recent History
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Just beforeApril 2012, after a few years of Google doing very little to combat this type of off page seoat scale, even an in-experienced link builder could make just about anything rank for anything by creating a 300 word article and building 500 unnatural links to it from (even very low quality blogs) with unique anchor text, spread out over a few months. They could do this largely free of fear that Google would do much about it  because everybody seemed to be doing it (at the top of Google results anyway).
          </p>
          <p>
           Its was relativelyeasy, compared to today.
          </p>
          <p>
           Industrial scale link building services were dictating the very SERPS owned by Google,
           <em>
            just
           </em>
           by taking advantage of the way Google works counting links as votes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just as many were about to turn the dial on article spinning to blogs up to 11 and go on holiday, Google nuked this and a lot of other low quality links with the
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/beware-google-penguin-3-imminent-in-2014/" title="CONFIRMED: Google Penguin 3 Update October 2014">
            Google Penguin update
           </a>
           and an old mantra shouted even louder  earn rankings based on
           <em>
            merit and uniqueness.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           When I say nuked  of course this practicestill goes on.
          </p>
          <p>
           It can still work (surprising tosome) for at least 6 months but only if you want to burn a site and entire network out of Google  and it is still soldas linkbuilding services and packages to unsuspecting business owners).
          </p>
          <p>
           If you dont want to burn a site  those are next years unnatural links youll need to pay someone to clean up, if you want to keep yourweb address that is (if thats important. Maybe it shouldnt be THAT important going forward, but thats beyond the scope of this article).
          </p>
          <p>
           Google has a few surprises for web masters bending the rules using what they call spammy links. As well as investing more manpower to hand out MANUAL ACTIONS (penalties), Google introduced a myriad of algorithm changes including the
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/google-panda-making-high-quality-websites-in-2015/" title="Google Panda: Making High Quality Websites in 2015">

           </a>
           , we think, to deal with those low quality (see easy to generate) pages, and PENGUIN to deal with those low quality (see unnatural) links.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Google PANDA and PENGUIN are algorithm changes
           </strong>
           (as opposed to
           <em>
            penalties
           </em>
           )  but critics will say that is splitting hairs.
          </p>
          <p>
           FYI Ive very much simplified these two algorithm changes in Google, but trip a PANDA or PENGUIN filter, and traffic levels take a nosedive over night  and they might never come back.
          </p>
          <p>
           A kick in the balls is a kick in the balls  youll think youre penalised and it will feel like one.

           This is not a black hat seo blog, so I wont go into link wheels, link hubs, blog networks, three way links, tiered link building service, illegal hacks or redirects (other than mention them) because I dont do any of that any more (not that I did much anyway).
          </p>
          <p>
           For me (at least) the focus since Google Penguinin April 2012 (and especially since the disavow links tool was introduced) has focused entirely on building something useful that will attract links so I dont need to build unnatural links and be looking over my shoulder at every major seo update.

            Negative SEO Killed Unnatural Links
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           My notes in this article are for money sites  sites you DO NOT want to burn in Google  sites you want to build something useful to people (that makes money). If youknow your only option is to break the rules and have a short term focus, hire a link buyer or linkbuilding specialist who can help you with your business model, too, because youll need it  and thats not me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I work with companies who are thinking of the long term health of their business and who understands that the key to ranking in Google in the future is bymaking the website better, richer in content and the best user experience it can be.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its much easier to get links to something thats useful, and when you earn rankings, its a more stable existence in Google these days. Too many people submit spam reports and too many people engage in
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/negative-seo/">
            negative seo
           </a>
           for me to invest too much in unnatural links these days.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive counted at least SEVEN Negative SEO attacksagainst this site in the last 2 years (as expected) so Negative SEO pointed at this sitehas basically killedany chance of me building usefulbut lower quality links to the site, even if I wanted to.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Todays negative seo efforts now looksalmost indistinguishable from genuine backlink building efforts a few years ago
           </strong>
            but thats the point  negative seo effortswant to basically make it look like YOU built the links yourself when they submit your site to Google next month to get you penalised for a year.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            That
           </em>
           kind of negative seo WILL work. Seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
           It was a great moveby Google to turn the gameon its head  and get seo fightingthemselves to kill cheap linkbuilding.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fortunately, the truth is, if you work on your site and put a bit  OK a massive amount  of effort into creating a unique offering, you can still wintop rankings and better traffic, month on month, while your competition is chased downby Googles algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you are totally new to building links to your website  Id recommendyou focus on creating the best page on the web for what you want to rank for  and then think where is my next great link coming from. Or  do it the other way around.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google might have said recently (when they agreed with Bing)  a good link is a link you dont know where its coming from. I dont agree with that in every case because I have spent a career looking for links on really good, relevant sites and thinking I would love a link on there and then creating content that might get me that link. For me  an editorial link is just that  editorial. If I put content in front of someone and THEY CHOOSE to link to it freely  thats editorial enough for me, and a good way to track down some links  even today. Havent authors
           <em>
            always
           </em>
           yearned to be cited by the media, and specific media journals?
          </p>
          <p>
           You can also identifythe types of great content being linked to in your niche  and emulate that, to chase down similar links. If you want to rank in Google with any confidence in the long term, you are going to have to INVEST in GOOD, IN-DEPTH content, and a few GREAT links. If you dont want to do that  you better hire a great black hat spammer and get some backup domains at the ready.
          </p>
          <p>
           The number of low quality links pointing at your site will affect your rankings adversely, and Ive not seen many paid links age well. Eventually  those unnatural links will catch up with you. Get links from REAL sites that doesnt sell links and youll soon see results.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2015, Id rather have NOlinks and lots of content than lots of unnatural links pointing to a site I care about. You can ALWAYS pick up the odd decent link to good content.
          </p>
          <p>
           I spent the last whilecleaning up my blog. This page is an example. I deleted some old posts on the Hobo blog, reworked some out of date advice, merged similar content. added some videos from Google who now advise on the subject where they once did not, and created this one page that I hope is of some use forbeginners in terms of marketing a website successfully in Google in 2015.

          </p>
          <p>
           Content will always be king (especially in the future) but without links, content can still be a moot point.
          </p>
          <p>
           You can have the best content in the world, but if you dont have links pointing to it from other sites, it may lose out to better optimised content on hotter sites, even if that content is of poorer quality.
          </p>
          <p>
           To properly visualise this lasers or seo heat analogy, youve got to accept success in search engines for competitive terms comes down very largely to links  the number of links, the number of right links the number of hot links.

           Links are like lasers.
          </strong>
          A link to another site heats that site up a little. A lot of links has the potential to ignite a site its so hot, and send a site to the top of the results. Some links get hotter in time, some get colder, some disappear as each site is affected by those linking to it and from it. With this constant shift, every sites heat signature is in constant flux, and theres little you can do to it except getting more of the right links to keep your site hotter than the competition for particular terms.
          <p>
           Some burn hot and then go cold, and vice versa.
          </p>
          <p>
           OK  Now Forget about the links. Thats been worked out  Googles counted the links, and filtered the crap.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the diagram below, you can see in any collection of pages, there is natural heat, naturally hot and cold sites, because of the natural inter-linking going on between pages.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because of the nature of the web, popular sites are hotter than unpopular sites, generally.

            Hot Sites, A Heat Signature and Those Out In The Cold
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           So Google now has Hot sites in its index, and Cold sites.
          </p>
          <p>
           Everywhere in-between, Google has sites that generate some sort of heat signature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hot sites are well known and well linked to and more likely to rank for any term if a page is properly optimised on-page and via the internal navigation structure of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hot sites are relatively trusted to inject content directly into Googles index, especially if its unique, probably with a good amount of natural words to keywords.

           Cold sites are not well connected (by links) to any neighbourhood or heat signature and virtually invisible in Google, except for very specific terms.

          </p>
          <p>
           If its on-site architecture is tuned to promote a certain term leading to an optimised page, it will rank  if the page itself meets 2015 ranking requirements on page quality, utility and user experience.

            Hot Sites, Hot Links &amp; Why Google Hates Paid Links
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Google hates paid links because it is an obvious way to generate heat signature a site might not deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
           Identifying one or two hot sites, and purchasing links on hot pages within that site, is enough to ignite an undeserving site and entire network and send it to the top of the SERPS.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google likes it natural, because that way, we do Googles work for it and identify hot sites by linking to them. One things is for sure though.
          </p>
          <p>
           If Google was confident they could via algorithmic calculation clearly identify paid links, the whole internet marketing industry would not have been talking about the war on paid links.

           In this example we see a hot site linking to a cold site  instantly generating a heat source on this new site.

           An Example Of A Hot Site
          </strong>
          <p>
           Wikipedia is an example of a hot site. Everybody links to it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its probably the hottest site on the planet alongside Google.
          </p>
          <p>
           Wiki ranks for just about anything, and could be optimized further to rank for everything  guaranteed (and not ONLY because its a REAL AUTHORITY  its an INFORMATION site! Many critics askif this the real reason Google ranks Wikipedia at the top of a LOT of TRANSACTIONAL serps.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, Wikis a natural phenomenon now.
          </p>
          <p>
           It has links from cold sites and hot sites in both related and unrelated markets.

            Features Of A Hot Site
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           A hot site is one which a lot of sites link to it from other sites, all with a different heat signature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hot sites can rank for anything if a page on the site is optimised in both the architecture of the site and on-page seo.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hot sites are natural phenomenon created by other sites linking to them  the more popular the site, the more hot and cold links it will accumulate. Its possible neighbourhood and relevance are just natural occurrences of sites dividing the heat up within a particular network.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hot sites generally link to other hot sites. Generally speaking a hot site wont link to a typically cold site unless that site has content on it thats nowhere else or is new, in turn making that a hot(ter) site.

           What You Need To Do To Get More Visitors From Google
           <br/>
          </strong>
          <p>
           Lets assume your page is optimised, you need heat. The hotter a site, or rather page, the better the link for your site.
          </p>
          <p>
           If a keyword is in the anchor text of the link, even better.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course the easiest links to find out there are from pages with very cold, or at least very diluted heat signatures.
          </p>
          <p>
           Itll take a lot of these to get hot  and usually  too many cold links could be a sign of unnatural link activity.

           When you are not spamming the algorithm, and the Google webspam team is not on holiday, ranking in Google today is about patience, ACCESSIBILITY, RELEVANCE, REPUTATION, USER EXPERIENCE and above all  TRUST  however Google works that last one out.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            It is evident Google wants to reward UNIQUENESS
           </strong>
            because that scales not.
          </p>
          <p>
           I prefer focusing on improving those signals above, rather than just manipulating link popularity. Alink building campaign devoid of any quality, or of any use (or value add) to anyone, is not the type of back link profile Google wants to reward with any long term consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google calls that spam, and will punish you for it if it detects an intent to deceive its algorithms. Not that that stops a good spammer of course. If youre reading this, chances are you are not a good spammer, so I would keep it clean until you know what you are doing.
          </p>
          <p>
           And maybe even then..
          </p>
          <p>
           How to do high quality link building that works:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Get links from real sites to build real domain authority.It doesnt hurt to get a link from a low or high Google Page Rank page. Todays No-PR page might be a PR 5 page in reality, as
            <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/google-pr-update/">
             Google Toolbar Pagerank
            </a>
            is out of date, and not a metric to bet your house on.
           </li>
           <li>
            Try and get links from authority websites in your niche. Find that circle of sites  the hub  where authorities in your industry link to and are linked from and think about how you can get involved.
           </li>
           <li>
            Dont worry too much about theme of websites linking to you but stay clear of irrelevant sites just for irrelevant links. In fact  going off topic once in a while on your blog can lead to great natural links from unrelated sites.
           </li>
           <li>
            Review the link building tactics yourcompetitorsemploy to EARNlinks and think about how you can emulate the better quality strategies you may find. Dont build links just to build links, or just to copy somebody else.
           </li>
           <li>
            Join social networks, not for the links themselves, but to get your content noticed by the people most likely to share your type of content, to build your personal network, and to build your Authorship signal  youre going to need those for the future!
           </li>
           <li>
            Get links from relevant sites, but understand that ANYeditorial link is a good link, regardless of the page and site it is on (unless its a negative seo attack of course).
           </li>
           <li>
            Focus onquality link building techniques and strategies toavoid future unnatural links notices in Google Webmaster Tools which will be followed by penalties that can last  well  forever  depending on what you have been up to
           </li>
           <li>
            Dont annoy folk with link begging emails and, for sure, not without a good pieceof content for them, and dont bombard friends you make on social networks with your sales message.
           </li>
           <li>
            Help others achieve their goals today, and some will help you in the future. Ive always found that to be a simple truth.
           </li>
           <li>
            The more people abuse certain links, the faster they turn toxic. Dont go with thatlink herd because you, as a beginner, will be the weakest in it.
           </li>
           <li>
            Automated link building or manual link building  if the end result is an unnatural link youve placed yourself, Google doesnt want to count that
           </li>
           <li>
            Outsource link building with extreme caution in 2015.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you want links, you had better have linkable assets e.g pageson your website need to be a destination.
           </li>
          </ul>

           Unless you have no clue about what is going on and think GooglePlus counts are the number one ranking factor, youll realise
           <strong>
            buildinghighquality links to your site is STILL the single most important thing you can be doing to improve the rank of an already relevant page
           </strong>

          </p>
          <p>
           In competitive verticals  you can easily follow Bing/Yahoo clear linkbuilding guidelines to rank in Google, but forget to try and rank in Bing/Yahoo with this same technique because to do so, you need to use Google Webmaster Guidelines as a rulebook for success, and that will penalise you in, em, Google, which no sensible person wants.

           Basically two of the 3 major (UK) search engines encourage you to ask websites for links to specifically improve the ranking of your site, and the biggest, Google, tells you not to do it at all. Bings SERPS (which go a way to power Yahoo searches) look pre penguin and pre-emd Google serps.

           Building Links Is Easier When You Have Content Worth Linking To
          </h2>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Getting other sites to link to yours is easy when you have content worth linking to
           </strong>
           . it really is that simple in some cases. Your content should be original, but it doesnt need to set the world on fire. The more content you add to your site, the more likely people will link to it, today or in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Im still getting links from stuff I wrote years ago. So first thing you should be doing is, er., adding content to your site. I personally think
           <em>
            How-To
           </em>
           articles, or articles that discuss a common problem often discussed in forums etc  some call it timeless content  is best suited to linkbait (and visitors!). This is always going to get linked to at some point if its presented slightly differently, and interesting. Once you get enough links and you feature in the top 3 results, youll find you start to pick up more and more natural links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Where to start?See that little FAQ on your site? Those frequently asked questions nobody asks about? Those need expanded  each FAQ couldbe its own page with a good page title and in a well structured site. Alternatively  turn a smaller FAQ into a long-form content piece focused on the topic at hand. You are reading one of these now.
          </p>
          <p>
           You need to ask your self what do people want to know about your products, or your industry  not necessarily your business.
          </p>
          <p>
           Having content on your site makes it so much easier to pick up links. If you have no content, while you can still rank in Google via links alone, youre limiting yourself in a way you might not recover from. Try not to add content to your website thats not just about your boring company. Most folk are not interested.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember  Google wants to reward UNIQUENESS. Its a pretty simple
           <span style="color: #222222;">
            extrapolation to mean that translates into unique INDEPTH  or LONG FORM, INFORMATIVE PAGE COPY and guess what  that type of content picks up links when it DOES rank in Google.

           Tell The World About Your Site But Dont Ask For Links!
          </h2>
          <p>
           Google used to say:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Have other relevant sites link to yours.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Then its guidelines changed to:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>

            create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community.

           Its clear.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Google does not want you asking specifically for links or building links you make yourself
           </strong>
           because this is a clear attempt to manipulate rankings. Its a bit slack advice when the
           <em>
            key
           </em>
           to ranking and traffic success in Google is getting other relevant authority sites link to your site.
          </p>
          <p>
           Links are what the web is about though and it is why Google is the number 1 search engine. Links were about before Google,though. Theres nothing wrong with getting other sites to link to you as long as it doesnt stick out like a sore thumb youre looking for Pagerank or improved rankings for particular terms.
           <em>
            Private discussions with people you know are another thing
           </em>
           , but when I ask for links (which I dont do very often), I very very rarely ask for specific keyword anchor text.
          </p>
          <p>
           If I send out an email, Ill point someone in the direction of the page, and Ill point out that linking to it might have some benefit to their own audience. On some occasions in the (long gone) past, Ive offered to reciprocate the link IF it is of benefit to the readers of the other page. I never specify any attribute of the link either e.g. whether or not it is search engine friendly, or not. I would not go on record these days sending an email out saying:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Link to me using the following keyword text on a page with Pagerank of minimum 2.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            and neither should you.
          </p>
          <p>
           You never know who will end up reading that and it makes it clear
           <em>
            you dont have a clue
           </em>
           what you are on about and
           <em>
            will take links from and link back to anybody
           </em>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           If you want people to link to you in a particular way, make sure the title of the page you want links to, has the keywords you want to rank for featured, and a lot of folks will use those words to link to you. I sometimes change the title of pages for this exact reason.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is presuming, of course, the page is useful in some way!
          </p>
          <p>
           And dont send out spam email requests.I get hundreds of bottom feeder link requests and dont answer any of them. It is a waste of time for most of us.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is many ways to skin a cat of course, but this is how my linkbuilding company does it  and Ive said before, were a content focused link building agency. We dont build links to crap anymore (not even crap links). How do you tell the world about your site? Twitter. Stumbleupon. Facebook. TV. Press Ads. Articles. Blogging. Linkedin.

           Sometimes its hard to explain to people what a quality link is but in simple terms in 2015 Google wants you thinking nothing but a natural link is a good link.
          </p>
          <p>
           Links do not have to be relevant to your industry to build your domain authority (far from it), the linking site you earn a link from doesnt have to be an authority in its niche, and itdoesnt have to be the same links as your competitors to get the same rankings. Even if the site is irrelevant to your site (and you just bagged a lucky link on a well managed website)  THAT is a good link.
          </p>
          <p>
           Any type of editorial link is a good link. What it should NOT be is
           <strong>
            a website (or websites) that ONLY exist to provide links to other sites to boost rankings.
           </strong>
           This is what is defined as a link scheme  and Google has a bit of an after hours hobby of going after a lot of
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/webspam/">
            link schemes
           </a>
           in these days. Just about everylink building specialist I talk to today LOVES EARNED LINKS  loves white hat link building  although a lot of experienced link builders just wont give up on manufactured links while spam prevails in Googles listings  and theres a lot of that.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think about how I get links from real sites, and the more authoritative the site, the better, of course. Ideally:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            You dont just want alink on a useful links page, but as long as the links page is a useful resource, and not abusing anchor text, then it could still be a good link
           </li>
           <li>
            You dont necessarily want it on a page on a site obviously selling links as chances are the links will not age well, at least
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           You do want it on a page thats in Googles index, on a legitimate website which pages ranks in Google.
          </p>
          <p>
           Earned contextual links are the holy grail of building links, for me, but if the link is on a good domain, with a high PR and is not abusing anything, just aboutany type of link isa great link.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you want to
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/google-pr-update/">
            increase Google Pagerank
           </a>
           of your site, you better make sure the pages that link to you have PR, can transfer it and are making your link the focus of the article.
          </p>
          <p>
           This takes a bit of experience though. youll naturally accrue Pagerank if you invest in remarkable or compelling content on your site  and that can take just about any form you can think of.
          </p>
          <p>
           Do the stuff above (and a lot of it) and youll have a natural link profile as is possible that will probably stand the test of time. I dont use that many link building tools to identify opportunity because I dont really want the same links as my competitors for my clients  you just need Google and your brain, in some cases.
          </p>
          <p>
           Theres many ways to SEO the cat (and I dont IGNORE competitor research) but if I was a link builder picking through a competitors back links instead of trying to think a bit more creatively about building a brand online I think I would shoot myself in the head. I filter competition back links and identify quality linking patterns  but often, competitor research is best for inspiration, rather than bagging the same link.
          </p>
          <p>
           Focus on building better content, a better user experience, and get links from REAL SITES. Remember that.and you will probably always be ok.

           . write about anything that is timely  especially when its even slightly topical.
          </p>
          <p>
           News jacking stories **in related** niches (or your own) is still a great way of picking up natural, socially driven links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive went off topic on a number of times to chase links. Because of that Ive been linked to by authority sites that wouldnt have any reason to link to a seo company.
          </p>
          <p>
           I had a PR 9 link once because I wrote about something 
           <em>
            slightly
           </em>
           off topic.
          </p>
          <p>
           RecentlyI was editorially linked to a .edu on a 
           <em>
            slightly
           </em>
            off topic subject to an article I wrote 2 years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
           Onceour site got a home page link on what I can only determine was the Brazilian version of TechCrunch and sent me nearly 5,000 visitors on a link that was buried 4 pages in on the article (to an article that was a year old).
          </p>
          <p>
           The link was to a 
           <em>
            slightly
           </em>
            off topic post on my site that ranks pretty good because of my domain authority  and that new link will only increase that domain authority.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you go off topic into less competitive niches, you can sometimes have a better chance of ranking on the first page of Google  and so  pick up natural links even further down the line.

            The Best Way To Earn Natural Links Is TO Be Top Of Google!
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Ranking no1 in Google actually makes natural link building that much easier. If you are the number 1 link in a SERP, you wouldnt believe the amount of natural links you get just because you are already No1  it truly is a self re-enforcing affect and can be a powerful way to attract links over time.
          </p>
          <p>
           The number 1 position truly is a self reinforcing position especially if theres any semblance of a natural linking profile in that particular keyword vertical  ie tutorials, research, how-to etc. So  a strategy is to rank for as much as possible from the start  even if that is LONG-TAIL queries  and so that starts with IN-DEPTH CONTENT on YOUR SITE. If you are building links to 500 word articles  thats not going to stand the test of time over even the next year or two.
          </p>
          <p>
           These links from trusted sites help ranking your content  especially your new content. A natural link from a trusted site (or even a more trusted site than yours) can do nothing but help your site. I would think when a trusted site links to your site, the trust Google places in your site because of that link raises your own trust levels, and while not helping you rank immediately for your main terms, can help you when you publish new content in the future. Of course if the off topic trusted site links to you with good keywords, you dont get much better.
          </p>
          <p>
           The art is to pull all that together in a way that benefits you the most, without giving Google a reason to place less trust in your site. Now for sure, I dont go that far off topic and expect to get links that will really count. But certainly,

            , especially with a helpful article on your blog
           </strong>
           certainly gets you links, sometimes tons of traffic, some you wouldnt normally receive in your boring niche.
          </p>
          <p>
           You know you can monitise anything if you can be bothered and take advantage of any page thats been linked to heavily, but the point is the natural links you earn from this type of activity might well be the only links you need to beat off a competitor.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sometimes  its surprising the quality of links you get with a bit of off-topic content.

           Any link that sends you traffic could be seen as a good link
          </strong>
          , but what are quality links, what are good links and what are crap links, when it comes to improving the actual ranking of your own pages in Google SERPS?
          <p>
           First, you need to be aware that
           <strong>
            the
            <em>
             quality
            </em>
            of a link (that affects a ranking improvement for your own site in Google) is dependant on the page the link is found and site it is on
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Is the site trusted, is the page trusted, is the page in Googles index at all, how many links point to the actual page your link is on, are people actually going to click this link (that in itself is a good measure of the quality of a real link)? Most importantly, its all about the page the link is on.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just because you get a link on a high PR domain does not automatically make that a good link.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its the page you need to be interested in.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Testing Google
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Google used to tell you through their own cache results if a link was being counted at least in some fashion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back in Nov 2011 Google removed the cache message:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            
            <strong>
             thesetermsonlyappearinlinks pointingtothispage
            </strong>
            
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           While this was regularly an inaccurate statement for the cached pages to declareI always found this information in cached pages useful  when looking at backlink profiles to investigate weird ranking results  or rankinganomalies/false positives  that shed light on how Google worked on some level.
          </p>
          <p>
           This feature of Google cache was also very useful when testing, for example,
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/first-link-priority/">
            first link priority
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           It was alsouseful to really investigate why a page ranked for a keyword, for instance, when the word was not on the actual page.
          </p>
          <p>
           You could often catch a glimpse of backlink building efforts that worked looking at this  which led to a fewsurprises, more often than not.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Now Google cache only tells us
           </strong>
           
          </p>
          <blockquote>

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Pity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet another small window on determining how Google might work, at a granular level, disappeared to lead to more obfuscation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Which Links Are Worth Addressing?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           You should have a light mixture offocused anchor text links,unfocused anchor text linksandURL citations (www.hobo-web.co.uk etc)in your link profile to ensure long standing rankings (e.g a natural link profile).
          </p>
          <p>
           What follows is my general rule of thumb:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Your internal links
            </strong>
            Not THE most important links, but the best place to start. Get your site in order before you get links.
            <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/optimize-website-navigation/">
             Google loves a good site structure
            </a>
            with plenty of text links pointing to each page on your site. I prefer a minimal sitewide navigation and a lot of in content links if you have a lot of useful content, and I consider all the time if
            <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/first-link-priority/">
             Google is only counting the first link on a page
            </a>
            . Dont forget to
            <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/link-to-important-pages/">
             link to your important pages often
            </a>
             ENSURE your get them into Googles index in the first place.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Links on mainstream news sites

             links from Brands
            </a>
             the holy grail in my opinion  promotion, old style. Purely because they are trusted and have a lot of links to them.

           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Link on a useful links page
            </strong>
            (often very low quality, but sometimes very high quality  its all dependent on the INTENT of that page in question, and the quality of the site it is on).
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Reciprocal links
            </strong>
            (often abused and very very low quality, but sometimes just a natural part of the link graph, if its done with user experience in mind)

           include any link that is self made and obviously self made, on a site with only self made links.
          </p>
          <p>
           It doesnt matter if THEY WORK to manipulate Google in the short term  if you use a lot of low quality techniques and there is an obvious INTENT to rank using low quality means, these links might very well cause you ranking troubles a few months later.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would avoid:

           Nofollowed links (like those on most blog comments  are not counted as links (though can be used to generate traffic if you link to a popular blog post or comment on one). NOTE many claim Google DO follow nofollow links in certain cases  but I performseo not expecting nofollowed links to have much impact on my rankings either way. If they do  good  but I dont
           <em>
            rely

           on them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Remember too ,links need to be complimented by well structured title tags, GOOD IN-DEPTHcontent, and a good site architecture. Its not enough to be popular  you also need to be relevant and unique and have it in spades.
          </p>
          <p>
           For me, another rule of thumb is, often,the EASIER a link is, that everyone else can get, the LESS quality it is for you in the long run.

           SHORT ANSWERNOTIF THEYLOOK LIKE PAID LINKS.
          </p>
          <p>
           Buying linksthat are search engine friendly and flow Pagerank is against Google TOS.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you buy links you take the risk that Google will penalise you for unnatural links.. If buying links was ineffective, it wouldnt be against Google TOS. Think about what that means.
          </p>
          <p>
           I cant remember the last vertical I checked there wasnt people buying links to improve search engine placement  so the competition is doing it. Last time I checked, they were ranking pretty good, but its not all plain sailing in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google is getting better at dealing with some form of paid links. It depends what you are trying to achieve  although I will point out again Google will take you down if it finds out.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you are buying links, make sure your links arent obviously paid links, though. That is, dont buy links from obvious places. If Google gets better at detecting these, its the obvious paid links that will be hit first.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can say,I dont buy links, and I would recommend you not do either.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is too risky at the moment in 2015and there are still plenty of ways to get links without paying for them.

           Start, for instance, with a private email address, and open up a conversation before you show folks what you have got? I sent the email back with a link to this post to see what they say.. DOH!

           Ive long thought it quite funny the situation between the mainstream media v Google. Some media sites say its all one sided and Google are stealing their content, are putting up pay-walls, even when seo have been saying for years about how Google is falling over themselves giving them tons of trust, tons of traffic AND making their links some of the most valuable on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google uses big trusted sites like news media sites, and their links, to help them
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/online-business-authority/">
            sort out the cess pool of the web
           </a>
           (when they Google is notranking news sites own content above smaller businesses). A quick look around some newspapers websites (the top UK ones) and some of the seo efforts are shocking  they dont even seem to know how to make sub domains rank well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, some newspaper sites HAVE woken upto the fact they have massive domain authority and are rolling out everything from dating sites to  wow low quality business directories.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would do some of that too I suppose. I mean Google has made newspaper sites authority sites in niches like online dating.
          </p>
          <p>
           A quick look around some local newspapers too and you see they dont link out to anyone, anywhere. Oh wait  theres some paid link articles to personal injury lawyers lol and an advertising network of links that have clearly affected the sites trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yeah  you need to know when to get out of those things before it goes t*ts up as they say in Scotland.
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont buy links but at the same time I dont think its hypocritical to say the least that search engines frown on bloggers selling links and do little to deter newspaper sites obvious link selling tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some newspaper sites are so stupid they send outcrazy link selling emailstoo, like above, and indeed, some folk
           <a href="http://www.malcolmcoles.co.uk/blog/mirror-moneyextra/">
            do out them
           </a>
           . The fact is 
           <strong>
            only SHOCKINGLY bad  not just bad  seo will get these sites penalised
           </strong>
           in a NOTICEABLE WAY  and even then  only if outed, then a discussion about inappropriate domain authority in particular niches might focus the spotlight.
          </p>
          <p>
           Idont out seo strategies, but I wonder if its worth examining newspaper seo in the future. They do make a business of outing other folk. Right? To be honest at this time, I think as a link builder, its more appropriate
           <strong>
            NOT to out others under just about any circumstances
           </strong>
           but it is something I think about.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its probably more useful to think how you are possibly going to combat mega

           Guess what  that involves newspaper / big media websites at the moment..

           Another question I get asked daily.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many new clients send me unsolicited emails from companies that ask for reciprocal links between their site and yours, usually because it will improve search engine rankings for both websites. I can tell you I usually
           <strong>
            ignore all reciprocal link exchange requests via unsolicited emails
           </strong>
           and recommend you do to.
          </p>
          <p>
           I spend some of my time looking forquality linksand believe me, Ive not found ANY in any email like I describe above.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its alsoagainst Google TOS to do this type of reciprocal link exchange:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Your sites ranking in Google search results is partly based on analysis of those sites that link to you.The quantity, quality, and relevance of links count towards your rating. The sites that link to you can provide context about the subject matter of your site, and can indicate its quality and popularity. However,some webmasters engage in link exchange schemes and build partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking,disregarding the quality of the links, the sources, and the long-term impact it will have on their sites. This is inviolation of Googles webmaster guidelinesand can negatively impact your sites ranking in search results. Examples of link schemes can include
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Excessive reciprocal links or excessive link exchanging (Link to me and Ill link to you.)
            </li>
           </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Now I suppose thats rich advice coming from a seo (whose supposed to be
           <em>
            manipulating
           </em>
           search engines if you listen to some of the bollocks some big name web designers linkbait with these days), but reciprocal link exchanges like the one I mention above offer NO MASSIVESEO benefit to YOUR site (especially when they are on link partner pages) and Google says link schemes might NEGATIVELY impact your rankings.
          </p>
          <p>
           IF YOU TAKE A SECOND AND VISUALISE in your head the link scheme in place and the relationship between pages via links in the reciprocal links hub scenario, you can see how easy it is to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
           Google can probably compute and identify that one a lot faster than you can its so obvious. I IGNORE ALL SPAM EMAILS ASKING FOR RECIPROCAL LINKS especially if they are from some company who sells something totally unrelated to my site.
          </p>
          <p>
           I honestly cant even remember the 0.1% Ive responded to but I assume I did at least once back in the day  I know I asked for them when I started out over a decadeago, now, but thats when this type of link was of some use. Usually
           <em>
            they
           </em>
           will put your link on auseful links page thats not useful at all to anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
           A useful links page out to
           <strong>
            unrelated
           </strong>
           sites on a low quality domain is just spam to Google and more often or not the pages your links are on will just be ignored by Google so there is no point getting a link from these pages.
          </p>
          <p>
           Too many of them and you WILL get a notice of unnatural links.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Unrelated Sites
           </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Should you reciprocate links with irrelevant unrelated websites? NO  Its a waste of time and potentially damaging.
           </li>
           <li>
            Should you link out to other unrelated sites at any other time? OF COURSE YOU SHOULD BUT NOT JUST TO MANIPULATE SEARCH RANKINGS. If the page is relevant to an article on your site, then its a good link. These types of links are the currency of the web.
           </li>
           <li>
            Should you worry if unrelated sites link to you? No. Although Negative SEO is a concern for some and should be checked out.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Linking is the foundation of the web, without links, there would be no web as we know it, no Google even, so never be scared of linking to good sites or pages  in fact, Google WANTS or at least EXPECTS you to do this and will thank you for it at some level. probably.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bear in mind reciprocal links with a website may indicate to Google the two sites are related in some fashion. Do you
           <em>
            really
           </em>
           want that?

            Should You Ask For Reciprocal Links?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, you should ALWAYS be LOOKINGfor high quality links, wether you link back to those sitesor not. One-way links are better for ranking in search engines as they indicate editorially approved links from other sites, to yours.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thats the best kind of links you can get.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am working with a client at the moment in a global market who makes something amazing a lot of blue chip companies pay a lot of money for. Their website has a very poor link profile. We are currently asking for them to contact all these big brand companies and ask them for a link on their websites to the client website because this COULD NEVER HURT ANY OF THE SITES INVOLVED and links from these big brand websites who have bought their products  ie testimoniallinks from REAL sitesthat dont just link to anybody, are good quality links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Well probably reciprocate those links (if they ask us) but only AFTER Google sees the big brand sites linking to us first (thats a habit)  I use a few methods to ensure this is the case.
          </p>
          <p>
           The aim is to get the BRAND websites to VOTE for our site FIRST, so OUR search engine rankings improve, because Google now TRUSTS our site because of these new quality links on sites it already trusts.
          </p>
          <p>
           The brand websites dont need our links for search engine purposes  all we need to ensure is we are linking out to their sites in a more appropriate manner that is probably more useful to them. I think all Brand managers would like another good-news-page in the SERPS, so creating a case study for their brand, on your website, is probably better than a link on a links page google will probably eventually ignore.

           Should I Always Avoid Reciprocal Links?
          </h2>
          <p>
           <em style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">
            Theory  If someone links to my site, and I dont link back to them, thats said to be a good link. A one way link. When you link back to that site, thats what a reciprocal link is.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           If a very trusted site links to my site, and gave me a ranking boost, am I expected to believe that linking back to them will remove my ranking boost? I dont believe that to be the case. I dont think it aligns what Google is trying to do (when not trying to make money)  ie improve their search results for the end user looking for information (and thats the vast majority of Google users).
          </p>
          <p>
           When a trusted site, or a site with online business authority, links to a site it deems trustworthy, and boosts rankings to improve its SERPS in line with its algo, its not going to dump that site back down the rankings just because it reciprocates. I dont think, anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
           Linking back to a site that links to you is actually a very common thing on the web. All these links build your own sites trust and authority in Google, which you can unlock with fresh topical content via a blog for instance  which I think is more useful these days than ranking for a major key term.
          </p>
          <p>
           Consider the small site that links to its industry body, and a year down the line the small site is a big player, with links from the industry body. Is that link useless? I would think Google is a lot smarter than that, at some level anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think Google would at all times
           <strong>
            take into account the trust and authority of the sites
           </strong>
           in question, and wether or not it has any reason not to trust the sites.
           <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;">
            My rule of thumb is I dont mind reciprocating links at all, especially if the other site is more authoritative or is highly relevant to my audience.
           </span>
          </p>
          <p>
           I dontuse low quality reciprocal linking between untrusted sites as an actual ranking improvement strategy, wether it works or not. I never link to a site JUST BECAUSE THEY LINK TO ME, because the chances are, they are linking to ANYsite out there regardless or not if it is in, or has the potential to be one day, a
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/bad-neighborhood-google-penalty/">
            bad neighbourhood
           </a>
           , and Google reserves the right to penalise you badly if you link to one of these, or are linked from one of them.
          </p>
          <p>
           So:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            avoid low quality reciprocal links where possible, and avoid get-links-quick schemes
           </li>
           <li>
            try and get other sites to link to you first
           </li>
           <li>
            dont worry about reciprocating links with real trusted sites
           </li>
           <li>

           The Perfect Link Building Strategy Is To Mix It Up
          </h2>
          <p>
           The best piece of advice I can give you is to FOCUS ON BUILDING A LINKABLE ASSET, and VARYyour linking strategy while ensuringto avoid low quality links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its the only way to be sure youll achieve good rankings, and keep them  which I always thought was the point. Remember that what works today might not work tomorrow  so its worth experimenting while all the time hunting for those quality links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Surely everybody knows by now, Google, and indeed the Internet, is powered, by HTML Links. Good rankings, and success, in all the search engines results pages, eventually lies in getting links from other sites to your site. Effectively, the more the better.
          </p>
          <p>
           Bearing in mind Content Is King on the web, no matter how great your content is, no matter how search engine optimised your page is, if you dont have inbound links, youre usually next to nowhere in the Google SERPS  especially in competitive markets  probably because a competitor has got in there first and generated some content and links before you.
          </p>
          <p>
           But what is the perfect link? What is the best linking strategy? The answer is  everybody has a different view of a perfect link, and everybody has different ways of measuring exactly what a perfect link is. Heres my take on what I look for when i am link hunting (all, I think worth thinking about and in
           <strong>
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             no
            </span>
            particular order
           </strong>
           ).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            1. Pagerank
           </strong>
           Did I say Pagerank? Yes. Google Pagerank is still important regardless of what some seo people claim. Google (well, Matt Cutts, said (a long time ago admittedly) the easiest way to get your internal pages out of the supplemental index (Googles back up listings) is to get PR to those pages. A high Pagerank can also mean your site is crawled more frequently than it might be (good if you are constantly adding content to your website  which of course, you should be doing.) Dont blindly trust Pagerank  but it can be a good indicator. If Pagerank is real  its a great indicator somtimes.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            2. Anchor Text
           </strong>
           Anchor text is simply the text in the link. If I want to rank for something and I have an optimised page waiting to get links to it, Id like a link with my actual desired keyword or keyword phrase in the actual link ie link building expert instead of click here or something. My thinking is, Im not trying to rank for click here am I? I would be VERY careful though  Google is on the look out for anchor text abuse. I would encourage it, rather than overtly advertise it. For instance  what you put in your page title often ends up in links. so changing your page title every now and again can mix this up.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            3. Contextual Link within text, surrounded by text

           Google can easily spot a long list of links (like navigation arrays etc) so I would always try and get a link from within the actual text on a page so it looks more natural. Ideally the surrounding text would also be relevant to my page. Sometimes the only sure way of generating these links is to write good content on your site to force people to link to you (unless you own the other site of course). These type of links are in my opinion the creme de la creme of links (which is why some seos actually buy these type of links (I dont).

            4. Trust / Authority
           </strong>
           Trusted sites pass trust factor. Basically the thinking is, trusted sites rank well in Google, because they are, well, trusted! (stop me if this gets too complicated!). Trusted authority sites rarely link to spammy sites  they only link to quality, probably related, sites. If you can manage to get a link from a trusted site in your niche, this could be worth its weight in Gold. How do you tell if a website (or page within a website) is trusted? Well thats the question thats on the lips of every seo! How do i determine it? Well, if you think simply, if its all about HTML links, then trust would be calculated by Google by the number and quality of links to that site / web page. Simply, get links from sites with links and pages with links!

           <strong>
            5. Relevance / Relationship / Theme
           </strong>
           How relevant is the page that is linking to you? I mean, if you have a seo site, are you trying to get links from search engine optimization related websites? Where possible, Ill try and get a link on a page that is actually about the same subject matter as the web page i want a link to. HOWEVER  a site with massive domain trust that has NOTHING to do with my site is still a very powerful link in building your sites REPUTATION.

           <strong>
            6. Hub / Neighbourhood
           </strong>
           Every niche has an authority hub, an inner network of sites every other site in the niche links to. This is the neighbourhood a (remarkably!) few seo, including myself, harp on about. Getting a link from these sites has got to be a good idea in any campaign, as these sites, that Google already trusts and rates, pass along a portion of this trust thingy Google calculates. Linking out to these sites is also thought to be useful, as these links determine the online neighbourhood your site resides within.

           Dont get me wrong, Ill take a link from anyone! Feel Free! But links vary in everything from quality and trust etc  I just spend my time trying to get quality links where possible, and at least from relevant pages. Its these kind of links that will help you in Google. And dont think I dreamt all this up myself.

           </a>
           with every option! Its always a good idea to vary your link building strategies, so your not susceptible to massive ranking algorithm changes when one strategy is devalued. The best piece of advice I can give you if you are intent on coming at backlink buildingfrom this angle is tovary your linking strategy. Mix it up. Its the only way to be sure youll achieve good rankings, and keep them. Remember that what works today might not work tomorrow. While youre mixing it up, youll also make it harder for others to reverse engineer your hard work, creating noise in the search engines, but I would be VERY CAREFUL in 2015  avoid unnatural links.
          </p>
          <p>
           The aim is to get sites with more domain trust to link to you so your domain trust will increase.

           Why Vary Anchor Text When Building Links?
          </h2>
          <p>
           The theory is simple. Mix up your anchor text to avoid important links being filtered out of your link profile. But in 2015  its got a lot to do with the ratio of low quality sites involved  rather than just the anchor text used.
          </p>
          <p>
           Imagine you could see Googlebot record your links as it finds them by spidering sites in real time.

           In 2015, I would avoid most, if not all directories. If I did submit a site to any directory, it would meet these criteria from

           <p>
            Directory entries are often mentioned as another way to promote young sites in the Google index. There are great, topical directories that add value to the Internet. But there are not many of them in proportion to those of lower quality. If you decide to submit your site to a directory, make sure its on topic, moderated, and well structured. Mass submissions, which are sometimes offered as a quick work-around SEO method, are mostly useless and not likely to serve your purposes.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           I dont think the links are worth paying to be reviewed by, and many of these seo friendly directories end up turning into low quality link farms.
          </p>
          <p>
           One things for sure, most directories send you little or no traffic and on their own in little numbers have little impact in SERPS. Directory links are clearly not the type of links Google wants to count as a vote  which render most directory submission services redundant in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
           In short I would not bother with directory submissions at all if youre focusing on creating good content on your site.
          </p>
          <p>
           Its worth remembering that just because a strategy may work on some level, it still might get you into trouble further down the line. Youll probably end up paying the same company to remove the link next year!

           Broken Link Building
          </h2>
          <p>
           Broken linkbuilding is all about hunting for and spotting opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
           A log time ago (site-wide links are not really in fashion now) I used a very simple method to get 500 links from a PR 5 site with over 3000 links to it. Yes a real site. Ive used the same method to contact 10 other sites with exactly the same request about the exact same matter.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive used this method a bit over the last couple of years. Looking at the SERPS I was interested in, I spotted anexpiredsuspended domain that was ranking for a term I cherished. The site was actually suspended, and had been like that for the last six months. There was no content on the site, so I knew immediately it was the strength of the incoming back links alone that was keeping this high. I could of course look to buy the expired domain (but it belongs to a competitor  Im sure if I expressed a value in it Id lose out!) So i ran theexpiredsuspended domain through a back link checker, identified the most powerful links, contacted the site owners in question and explained to them:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            They were linking to a dead site (and had been that way for 6 months)
           </li>
           <li>
            I had exactly the same (nay better and up-to-date) content on a site that they could link to if they wished.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Not only did I get a friendly email thanking me for pointing out they had broken links on their site (
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/broken-links-are-a-waste-of-link-power/">
            broken links are never a good thing
           </a>
           ), I now have 500 new links on a real site pointing to my site.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back link creation for me is all about opportunity  spotting it and actioning it to get real back links from real sites. If you can see a win-win (something as simple as links in return for pointing out another site has broken links on it) jump on it. If you cant see win-wins  youre not a linkbuilder  hire somebody. By the way, the result is I now rank and that suspended domain has sunk  oops :) TIP  Find a site you want a link from, spider it, find broken links  see if you have content that matches it. Email them (and send them the list of all the broken links).
          </p>
          <p>
           Its not as easy to find such sites in Google today  but there are many sites out there that discuss this in more detail.

           Links To Useful Sites Pages
          </h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
           Consider how much value these links really are, especially if there are lots (100+) of links on there  as any benefit to your site could be microscopic (and potentially damaging to your rankings if the site in question is of a very low quality). Certainly  do not buy any of these type of links, and I would AVOID like the plague any of these types of pages where you can spot obvious anchor text abuse, often to unrelated sites.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you have a choice of where a link is going, dont just take a link from useful links pages,unless the useful links page is a on a reputable site, with a lot of back-links itself. The more relevant the page is to your business, the better.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are some indications the useful links pages is a decent link:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Check if the links page is indexed by Google at all utilising the
            <strong>
             info
            </strong>
            operator

             info:www.hobo-web.co.uk
            </a>
           </li>
           <li>
            Consider howauthoritativethe site in question is  is it an important site within your industry or known as a reputable source throughout the world? (If it is, get a link if you can!)
           </li>
           <li>
            Check the
            <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/automatic-google-pagerank-update-monitor/">
             Google Toolbar Pagerank
            </a>
            of the actual page the link is going to feature on  not just the PR of the home page. Note that Pagerank, or what we see of it, is not a 100% positive proof of the reputation of a website, but it might be an indicator of recent quality.
           </li>
           <li>
            Check how many backlinks point to the links page from within the actual site(my favourite linkbuilding tool is probably Majestic SEO, reviewed on my
            <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/best-seo-tools/">

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           Links pages can be a useful target for any link hunter if the page is on a very authoritative site, but a lot of link pages go the way of the Dodo within time.

           Article syndication (for search engine optimisation purposes) is a big no-no for me in 2015. You just dont know where that article will end up, or on how many low quality sites.
          </strong>
          <p>
           Ive learned to live without it, after a few years of abusing it a little. I still think the place for your articles should be on your own blog, on the whole, to attract traffic and links, and to build your own reputation as an authority.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ive always found article syndication useful for finding the odd trusted site willing to link to your content, albeit on a more trusted domain than your own. I once wrote an article that had a signature link back to my site, and while testing how well it had penetrated the SERPS and in how many instances, there was one trusted domain with the content republished, and THAT had attracted a link from a then PR 9 page on a very old trusted site.Bonus!
          </p>
          <p>
           I immediately contacted the PR 9 (page) site owners and asked them to link to the original source of the article, on my site, and they did  which was nice. I also found another couple of sites that were willing to link to that kind of content for future reference. The moral of the story is  track where your content is being published, if you publish a lot of it, and watch out article syndication does not backfire on you, if youre using it for seo purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Be wary of extremely low coast article marketing services, article submissions services &amp; free press releases. In todays SEO, you do not want your article links duplicated across only low quality domains  and that is where most of these type of articles end up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Use sparingly and with GREAT caution.The problem is  you lose control ofwhere you syndicate your articles to, and that can turn problematic very quickly. I avoid article submission sites these days. Period. The first place for your articles is your own blog, next, its getting those article noticed viasocial mediasites.

          Some traditional companies create press releases and dont think for a minute how these could be used to successfully promote their website when syndicated online.Every time you send out a press release, you should be ensuring youre getting a few things right.
          <p>
           For instance, you should know by now you should always include your web address.
          </p>
          <p>
           A big thing to remember in 2015 is to watch Google doesnt think youre intent is to spam their algorithm with press releases. A responsible press release agency will add
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/what-is-nofollow/">
            rel=nofollow
           </a>
           to your links to prevent it from passing Pagerank (and possibly prevent you from getting an unnatural links warning in the future).
          </p>
          <p>
           Google wants the secondary links (from buzz about the
           <em>
            news
           </em>
           in your press releases) to count toward your ranking, not the actual press release links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Example: If I were sending out a press release to a third party and relying on them to publish it (which I dont but hey!) Id previously ensure my web address was in it. Id ensure my website address was written in the correct manner ie
           <a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/">
            http://www.hobo-web.co.uk
           </a>
           (with the http:// because on some sites theyll automatically make this a link.)
          </p>
          <p>
           Your web address appearing just likewww.hobo-web.co.uk (not a clickable link) wont obviously help in Google rankings when compared to a html link.
          </p>
          <p>
           Be careful publishing too many press releases without rel=nofollow on the links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Stay WELL AWAY from anchor text rich article marketing, press releases and advertorials. Google made that clear when they added the following to their guidelines about what not to do:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Links with optimized anchor text in articles or press releases distributed on other sites.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Google published a pretty comprehensive video on advertorials, too (above).

The idea of people picking the best sites, rather than counting links the traditional way, is an ideal situation, of course  but I dont see much real evidence of this incompetitiveverticals so I need to say traditional links are still relied on HEAVILY, by Google at the very least  and what I would prefer if given a choice.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I dont think I see much of evidence of tweets having a massive impact (compared to traditional html links) in Googles competitive SERPS  it is worth considering what search engines SAY they are working towards with regards to social buzz':

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           The rewards from building artificial links will narrow  as the rewards from social increase  thats for sure. Even at the moment  to compete in Google organic results, a top 2 or 3 is essential  and you need links from websites to do that. I actually agree with Eric on this too:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Id take the blog post link because it can continually provide traffic, new tweets, shares, etc., whereas a single tweet, even if by an authority, is fleeting and has a shorter half-life. Much more hit or miss.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           If I get a choice between a 100 Tweets and a 1 link on a
           <em>
            real
           </em>
           website, today 
           <strong>
            I would take the links from real websites or blog posts every time.
           </strong>
           The safe answer is,
           <strong>
            yes, you should be on social sites
           </strong>
            and you should be getting your site mentioned on these sites, regardless of exactly where the search engines are on social links at this point  as they will only get better at determining links to trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           Great content probably has lots of links from many sources, and lots of tweets, too. I will tell you, though, I am

            especially with my new sites. I may use Google+, Twitter or Facebook to get new content INDEXED (Bing certainly follows FB fan pages links and there is evidence Google Plus gets a page indexed) but I dont expect
           <em>
            aged
           </em>
           content to rank that much
           <em>
            better
           </em>
           because of tweets- NOT at the moment, in Google, at least.
          </p>
          <p>
           I much prefer to use social sites to reach
           <em>
            real
           </em>
           people, and I dont expect Google to factor in any ranking signal they cant control themselves. Would they base their algorithms around a 3rd party metric? It would surprise me if that were the case.

           Matt Cutts Debunks Google Plus Votes as Important Ranking Factors

           Do Google +1s Improve rankings in Google natural SERPS?
          </p>
          <p>
           Theres a lot of strange seo newsaboutat the moment. Mostly down to correlation studies showing Google Plus votes correlationwith high rankings. That observation may well be true  but
           <strong>
            important ranking factor
           </strong>
           it does not automatically make them, and thats what a lot of people on the fringes of seo think when they see these studies. Google +1s are NOWHERE near as important as good link from a trusted site, in my experience.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I chimed in on

          <p>
           .thoughshortly afterwards, somebody with a lot more clout than myself chimed in too. Matt Cutts from Google:

              Just trying to decide the politest way to debunk the idea that more Google +1s lead to higher Google web rankings.

             Lets start with correlation != causation:http://xkcd.com/552/
            </span>
            But it would probably be better to point to this 2011 post (also from SEOMoz/Moz) from two years ago in which a similar claim was made about Facebook shares:http://moz.com/blog/does-google-use-facebook-shares-to-influ.
           </p>
           <p>
            From that blog post from two years ago: One of the most interesting findings from our 2011 Ranking Factors analysis was the high correlation between Facebook shares and Google US search position.This all came to a head at the SMX Advanced search conference in 2011 where Rand Fishkin presented his claims. I did a polite debunk of the idea that Google used Facebook shares in our web ranking at the conference, leading to this section in the 2011 blog post: Rand pointed out that Google does have some access to Facebook data overall and set up a small-scale test to determine if Google would index content that was solely shared on Facebook.
           </p>
           <p>
            To date, that page has not been indexed, despite having quite a few shares (64 according to the OpenGraph).If you make compelling content, people will link to it, like it, share it on Facebook, +1 it, etc. But that doesnt mean that Google is using those signals in our ranking.
            <span style="color: #000000;">
             Rather than chasing +1s of content, your time is much better spent making great content.

           Do we always listen to Matt Cutts? Well, in between his PR, there are a lot of truths, too. I think so, anyway. Do you listen to Moz? This seo community has a history (some of which is seen in the above quote) of producing, at least, controversial studies.

            Is there anyone out there who still wants to say that being on Google+ doesnt matter? Anyone?Because when being on Google+ means that you potentially can have your Google+ page leap to the top in those sidebar results, Google+ matters. It matters more than ever before.

              Googles classification system:
             </strong>
             How Google classes your site  or rather YOUR INTENT, will have a major impact on your rankings. If your intent is to be an end-point of traffic stop  to make money from Googles free traffic  and offer little in return  then Google is not your friend. If you are willing to play the long game game Googles way (which isnt easy), there are still plenty of OPPORTUNITY, plenty of organic listings to be filled  even if they are under an amount of ads Googles own top heavy algorithm would choke on.

             Domain Reputation
            </strong>
            : I dont keep up with the terminology  but this is about how much Google trusts your site. This is a main reason as to why certain pages rank at the top of Google without (many) inbound links and sometimes have lots of social activity noise, and hence why we see crazy articlesabout social media having a bigger impact on rankingsthan links. Domain trust  or online business authority, I think  is basically based on factors I go into below. But getting, and keeping, domain trust, is all important now for real businesses who want to rank in natural listings using a quality content programme.

             Low quality links
            </strong>
            : The low quality links well is poisoned. Get out, now. Disavow them, remove them. Google killed low quality link building techniques in most of the competitive niches I am in  probably yours, too. Its NOT just a matter of does this technique work any more. Low quality links are not a defensible link strategy for most small businesses these days.

            <strong>
             Low Quality SEO
            </strong>
            : If Google has a reason to put you in the sin bin, they will. Usually  they will do this by algorithmic means or lately by MANUAL ACTIONS in Google Webmaster Tools. So if flagged for manual review, your site had better not scream seo. You dont want to be caught milking Googles cash cow for yourself, whether that be pushing limits of technical seo, or just plain old keyword stuffing. NOt unless your business model allows for this.

             High quality links.

            Still, THE most important ranking factor. Link building just got HARDER, and MORE EXPENSIVE, just as Google wants it to. Low quality link building is not defensible anymore and WILL get you into trouble, now that Google is policing itsguidelines. The game now is to get high quality links your competition CANNOT get (by hook, or by crook, you dont want caught doing it). This is not an easy task, when Googles PR is making people even scared of linking out to reputable sites, for fear of appearing manipulative.

            : If you side with the visitor, you will win, Google says. Ultimately  its a moot point if you believe them or not. If you want free traffic from Google, you better get used to giving it free, high quality content that will satisfy their visitors. Google wants to be the best search engine  it does want to satisfy certain users intent to find information. Google wants in-depth articles in organic listings  we even have new code for in-depth articles too.

            <strong>
             The correct keywords
            </strong>
             this is genuinely the simplest thing you can do in seo to get free traffic  proper keyword research. Sometimes  having A word on the page can be the difference between ranking no1 and not ranking at all, even with very relevant traffic. THIS is one way Google uses to share all that lovely free traffic about.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Availability of your site
            </strong>
             if Google cant find your site for a few days  you will lose rankings that in some cases take some time to regain (smaller sites). If you block content from Google, you dont rank. Its a simple error I still see a lot of folk making  even theoretical physicists can foul foul of this**.

            <strong>
             Satisfaction score
            </strong>
             the amount of time people spend on your site, and the success rate of your visitor (e.g. did you help Google serve
            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
             their
            </span>
            customer? did they stay on your site for a long time, and not go back to carry out the same search? And its not just visitors from Google  if you want a page to rank  it better satisfy the curiosity of a Google web spam team reviewer, too. The author who created the controversy yesterday about Google Plus votes, actually wrote a GREAT ARTICLE about user satisfaction (ignore the title, it is sensationalist and inaccurate, again). The article itself is a great read.
           </li>
           <li>
            <strong>
             Speed of your web pages
            </strong>
            : Id wager this was more important today than first introduced. Google even said that mobile sites rankings WILL suffer if not fast enough(and I have witnessed this I think). Its all about  user experience and satisfaction. If you make your website faster, everybody is probably happier.
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           Even as I write those  I can still think of other factors. In fact, I can say I dont really factor Google Plus votes  or any other social share  in at all (at this time).
          </p>
          <p>
           Google plus, for my purposes, is a channel to get the word out  to get real links to a post (if I have my seo hat on). If they are in play  its far too lightweight a factor for me to have noticed above other things I expect to have an impact.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Are there more ranking signals?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           TONS. The above are some of the main things you can do SOMETHING ABOUT without knowing the more technical aspects of seo or falling foul of Googles guidelines. Google is in constant flux, constant testing, constant UI change. Where you are in the world, and how often youve used Google from that location, and whether Google knows its YOU that is searching, has a MASSIVE impact on the listings Google personalise for you.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am not saying ignore Google+  there ARE reported benefits in other areas  just not when it comes to ranking your content about other content using more traditional methods.
          </p>
          <p>
           I just dont think Google are turning off links as a source of identifying quality any time soon, not when they are raking in the cash, and not when they are putting so much effort into punishing low quality link building.

           LinkBaitWith Information-Rich Content
          </h2>
          <p>
           Adding information rich content to your site is a great method of attracting natural links from forums and blogs, and the more in-depth the article, the more chance of it ranking high in Google for(especially) long tail variations of high traffic high value keywords.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you are at the top of the SERPS for particular keywords, particularly how to tutorials, you start picking up organic links from forums and blogs who see these articles as trusted articles because, well, they are at the top of Google!
          </p>
          <p>
           When helping each other out, forum contributorsoften use Google to find an authority article, and link to it to help newbies. Often they will usually just copy and paste the URL like so: http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/***** Not ideal.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sometimes its worth it go one step further and provide them with the BBcode and HTML versions of a nice anchor text rich link to start getting those keyword rich links to your site. Every now and again, change the anchor text to mix your back link profile a little. Sometimes you do pick up that natural looking keyword rich link.

           Social media platforms have all but replaced the old forums  but some can STILL drive a lot of traffic, and some can also offer some seo value. If you do nothing else to help people share your content  ADD SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTONS for the most appropriate social media channels. Those links themselves might not carry much weight, but secondary links from such activity can.

           was kind enough to share some insights ofLinkbait  or Baiting Links using social media  and that advice is still sensible in 2015.

          <blockquote>

            Social media marketing is more complicated than you think, in certain ways its simple, but you have to adapt tactics to suit the situation and thats wear instinct is important.

           Five things you need to think about before you post a piece of linkbait
           <strong>
            :
           </strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Headline
             </strong>
             : I would say the headline is the most important as if you dont have this you have nothing. But a good headline can still get people to look at bad content.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Formatting
             </strong>
             : This is actually quite important, by formatting I mean the way the thing looks. There are specific looks which certain people associate with something they would like to link to, the aim is to emulate the look, which is different to different target groups.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Images
             </strong>
             : The web is multimedia, so use it. A great picture can do the work for you, a video even more so. If you can get an image in your linkbait do it, but not everyone has a good eye, check it with friends you know will tell you its crap if it is before you press submit.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Audience
             </strong>
             : Absolutely crucial, you have to know who the piece is intended for. You have to craft your idea to be able to fit snuggly into the minds of your intended audience.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              Spelling
             </strong>
             : I work very fast, so I make a lot of spelling mistakes, and I dont usually bother with grammar. But diggers, for example are nazis for grammar and spelling, so if you want anything dugg, its best to triple check.
            </li>

           Do Hunt For Local Links
          </h2>
          <p>
           A quality link for me is an editorial link on a real site  a site thats been around for years. The site in question is well linked to itself, and doesnt sell links  and is careful who they link to. These sites are kind of hard to get links from  but thats the point
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Strategy
           </strong>
           ? Well you live somewhere. You live in a town or a city, in a region, in a wider region. Just type these 3 regions  one at a time  into Google, and Google will return a list of potential link partners. Hundreds of them. Live in the wilderness? Look at your nearest city.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Deployment
           </strong>
           ?Offer a discount, orgive away free stuff(Google does this) for a mention on their site IF they dont have any real reason to link to you.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Other sites will link to your site if you give them a reason to:
           </em>
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            Your localCouncil a lot of council sites have local business directories
           </li>
           <li>
            Your localCollege or University offer a student discount
           </li>
           <li>
            Your localChamber of Commerce join, or offer a discount to members
           </li>
           <li>
            Your localNewspaper you should always be trying to get a mention in the local press  consider a competition
           </li>
           <li>
            Localfootball club &amp; supporters club discount = mention on their site
           </li>
           <li>
            Localsports clubs theres a ton of them in every town usually with crusty old sites  offer them a discount, donate or sponsor them for a mention on their site.
           </li>
           <li>
            LocalBusiness Directories More often than not, somebody has built a local biz directory covering your local area. Get in there, as long as they are not a low quality directory just made to spam Google.
           </li>
           <li>
            Localfaith groupsor otherlocal community groups When it comes to business, I aint got no denomination. Discount anybody?
           </li>
           <li>
            Localcharities a link you can probably buy! Sponsor a charity site for a mention  Google would be REALLY MEAN to penalise this sort of link buying on a small scale  and anyway, their attention is probably on bigger sites.
           </li>
           <li>
            Localbusinesses offer a discount to staff
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           These links arent all easy to get and will take time to get(if your comparing them to how fast you can buy or get links on sites these daysthat offer no value to your site in the long term). See what I did there.
          </p>
          <p>
           So while your competitors are off buying links on crap third world domain hosting companies, submitting to 100,000 useless search engines, submitting to 100 useless directories, spamming dofollow blogs and forums or hiring a social media consultant to get 10,000 non-paying visitors from Stumbleupon or Facebook etc etc you are picking up nice little, quality long term links on trusted sites that probably are not being abused, and will fly right under any Google manipulation-radar, and all will help to build your domain authority and trust in Google results pages. And all these kind of links above can be mixed and match to a national campaign if you know how to scale your efforts in a sensible manner.
          </p>
          <p>
           These are good links for beginners to chase down  but remember  the best links will need some GREAT CONTENT to point to.
          </p>
          <p>
           When hunting for links  I always remember some advice

            Well, if I were to see a link somewhere, and were ask to value its SEOs worth, then Id look at the page where the link is located on, and compare it where that link links to. From the ad page, Id see what percent of the internal links link to that page, then Id check the internal link text used to link to that page, then Id check external links to that page, and link text used from other sites that link to that page, then Id look at the title tag of the page, then Id look at the content of that page, I could peek at the age of the url, edus, edus to page, other links on that page (co-citation), related pages of that page, and a few other things too.theres tons you can analyze, and all have a certain value. In the end it comes to you get what you can get, its not always the perfect link.

           When you build a wall, you do it bit by bit, with the same kind of identical bricks until you have a lot of bricks that all look the same presto, you have a wall. Thats building. You cant
           <em>
            build
           </em>
           links that way in 2015 and EXPECT to win the ranking wars in Google as Google is actively fighting you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Your bricks kind of need to be different, brick to brick, to avoid annoying Google or a competitor. Theres a thought out there. Get 200 or 300 or 400 links and youll rank. So its natural that you think Ill buy some links from
           <em>
            that

           mob (and I mean mob) for $200 and Im sorted.

           Youre not. Those cheap link building effortsare s*&amp;t (sorry no other word to describe it). Depending on how good the search engine optimisation company is of course  theres different varying colours of s*&amp;t but generally speaking you stand in it when you open your email and it says:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            We noticed you dont rank for any of your keywords. We are an expert link building company..

          <p>
           Theyll come from spammy blog and forum comments that might hurt your brand, or web hosting companies with an obvious unnatural paid link profile.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even if they are decent at their job  a competitor will just report you for buying links if you do it too much. It will stick out like a sore thumb youre buying links and thats against Google TOS. Stopthinking about building links.Startthinking of creating and promoting useful content. Beware buying any affordablelinkbuilding service promising you guaranteed top rankings, even if they do have apparently great reviews on forums or blogs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Theres no automated link building programthat will not get you penalised, eventually, in my experience, but maybe I wasnt doing it properly.
          </p>
          <p>
           Conversely, Id give advanced link building courses a miss too, and just focus on making your site a better landing page. Free link building software will probably have lots of free software you dont know youre installing on your pc.

           EarningMedia Links
          </h2>
          <p>
           I love picking up media links. The best way to get them is to be an authority on a subject, and that usually means WRITING posts that illustrate some expertise on the matter. A PR agency is a great way of getting you these types of links  they have the contacts. Legitimate PR is one of the most valuable assets in your link earning strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also like trying to get (or give) testimonials for links although I dont over do it  and I would only do it for products I like.

           The Perfect Link Request Email

          <p>
           First, theres probably no PERFECT link request email. :) but heres how I do it (for the Hobo site, every so often).
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            I dont send that many out  only one in the last year  which I got.
           </li>
           <li>
            I keep the email short and to the point
           </li>
           <li>
            I use a title like FAO Organisation Website Name Website
           </li>
           <li>
            I never automate them  each one is crafted personally and (much like the blog) in a laid back manner.
           </li>
           <li>
            I CORRECTLY IDENTIFY the exact PAGE I want a link on (after identifying its a good page (and yes, Pagerank comes into it regardless of what others say but I also look to see if that page ranks high, gets traffic and is itself internally (at least) well linked to.
           </li>
           <li>
            Its never JUST a links page with no content I want my link on, and its never on their home page.
           </li>
           <li>
            I also correctly IDENTIFY if they have a habit of linking out to relevant articles.
           </li>
           <li>
            I NEVER ask them to link to my home page.
           </li>
           <li>
            I always provide them with the URL I desire them to link to
           </li>
           <li>
            I ALWAYS have a piece of content thats of value and WORTH linking to  after all, I wouldnt link to pap.
           </li>
           <li>
            I NEVER specify anchor text that should be used.
           </li>
           <li>
            I NEVER even mention reciprocal links
           </li>
           <li>
            I only contact them once (ok, maybe twice over the course of a year, as it turned out)
           </li>

            I am honest as to who I am, when doing it for myself
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Most importantly  I am honest about why I want a link
           </strong>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           I dont tell them it will help them, I tell them (usually) its more up to date information than they currently link to and it will help us and might be useful to their readers. And it is. I dont tell them it will help their rankings, or that I was browsing the web and came across their site.
          </p>
          <p>
           Im not exactly sure what above is the killer, but this method works more often than not. Lastly, if I spot something amiss on their site, Ill point it out in a friendly manner, and tell them to contact me if they need any assistance in the subject of what I do  SEO. Not exactly rocket science is it.

           In Summary
          </h2>
          <p>
           Dont let anyone tell you link building is dead  becausethats not true.
          </p>
          <p>
           You SHOULD STILLbe thinking of WHERE your NEXT BEST LINK should be coming from  its incredibly important if you have no links. You should avoid unnatural links.
          </p>
          <p>
           Idfocus on building better in-depth content than your competitors have, and spend time making friends online who might throw you a bone and share your content, so you have a chance of picking up those EDITORIAL LINKS you need to rank in Google with.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would certainly avoid like the plaguelink building packages with promises of guaranteed ranking  even with no footprint claims  even those you spot on Adwords. Those are VERY rarely going to be expert black hats pimping thoseservices  and often  the end result is your site will burn. If you dont want to jump through all these hoops and avoid penalties  get some ageddomains together for your business and hire a good black hat 
           <strong>
            its redirect, burn and churn time  but look out  Google is out to burn you
           </strong>
           :)

           <p class="text">
            Is your website ready to build links to? If it's not - link building will NOT have the same affect as it did a few years ago. And if you do not build the 'right' links, you will soon find your website penalised and potentially removed from Google. I can review your website and look for less risky ways to drive more traffic to your site.
