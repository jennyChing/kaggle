         <span class="il">
          Jim
         </span>
         founded Heart of the Customer to help companies of all sizes increase customer engagement. Before launching the company,
         <span class="il">
          Jim
         </span>
         led customer engagement initiatives at Best Buy, Gallup and UnitedHealth Group. In the process, he became an expert in using Voice of the Customer research to identify unmet needs, develop new products and improve customer service. His Heart of the Customer Customer Experience ModelT is a powerful tool designed with one simple goal: customer loyalty. Customers ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies use his processes to improve customer-focused results. His fascination with customer experience led him to test himself by becoming a Certified Customer Experience Professional, only the second in the world to earn such a designation.

         <strong>
          The best way for a company to build customer loyalty is to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Operate the way your customers want.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sell the way they want to buy, and transact the way they want to. Data is critical  but only once your company really understands your current and ideal customer journey, and can then use the data to see how theyre doing against that.
        </p>
        <p>
         We worked with a large manufacturer of home furnishings who focused their entire marketing efforts towards their dealer channel. But once we studied the customers purchasing journey, we discovered that huge sections of customers dont want to go to dealers just to learn about the products. They were scanning social media, websites and blogs to learn about products, and were frustrated because they couldnt find it. Once we understood what to look for, then our client was able to take a fresh look at their data, and recognize that the traffic was there all along  they just didnt understand what customers were looking for. This knowledge enabled them to build a new strategy to disintermediate the dealer channel, and go direct to their customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also worked with a non-profit who was seeing low levels of member commitment, but werent sure why. By studying their member journey, they were able to realize what that data was telling them, and are now developing a new strategy to raise that level of commitment.

        </p>
        <p>
         Humanize the customer service experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         When most people think about leveraging data, they dont often think about the human component behind the data. Automated customer satisfaction surveys and review programs allow us to listen to our customer needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         However humanizing that experience to better interact with our customers goes a long way to show we care for them as an individual not just a number. We try to complete many of these surveys over the phone, so that there is still human interface with customers. These programs allow us to provide a better overall customer experience for each person that signs up for our service and plays a big role in customer retention and loyalty.

          What I believe will bring the new customer intelligence data necessary to improve customer loyalty for enterprise businesses is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The Internet of Things.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opportunity for otherwise inanimate objects to come alive in the Internet-of-Things provides what I believe to be the most dramatic source of data that will help service organizations build customer loyalty and, in a way, turn themselves into heroes in the eyes of customers. Heres how.
        </p>
        <p>
         By relaying their state of function, machines in the IoT are going to enhance human component of service delivery, and the value that service organizations can bring to the table, by helping them carry out problem resolutions, upgrades and maintenance tasks on behalf of customers in a more predictive way. The IoT, in short, lets service engineers interact with any given machine from their desktop or mobile device  before, during and after a service visit  to decide what needs to be done, when it needs to be done (urgency) what parts are required, and whether the prescribed fix took care of everything.
        </p>
        <p>
         Take for example, a connected washing machine. It will be able to detect that it is starting to fail and, rather than signaling to the owner and putting the onus on them to take action, it instead notifies the appliance stores service department to reach out and schedule an appointment with that customer. In so doing, the appliance store creates a new, predictive-based service offering and solidifies its standing by virtually preventing downtime for the appliances it sells, customer after customer.
        </p>
        <p>
         This pattern will replicate for other, more urgent systems such as heating or A/C, where the prospect of avoiding a break down on a Sunday in the dead of winter or summer carries unspeakable value.

          When it comes to successful customer interactions, the consumer is still often interested in speaking with a real person before making a purchase; in fact, 64% of people get frustrated when they are only able to interact with a company online.

         Use the insights gained online via conversion tracking and take them to the call. This means having strong links between a call centre and the marketing division.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data gained from conversion tracking allows us to build a consumer profile, which we can then take to the call. This means the sales agent is already clued in about the needs of the customer before theyve picked up the phone, making them much more likely to deliver great customer service. When on the phone to a company, 78% of people in the US find it most important to be put through to a well-informed person on the other end of the line that solves the problem.

          Customer data can be leveraged in a variety of ways to build loyalty:
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Hooking up a proper understanding of usage data lets you know where your customer is on their individual journey and you can wire that into marketing automation technology to nurture your users intelligently.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, if you know a customer is getting stuck at a particular part, you can message them guides, walk-throughs and and instructional videos. If theyre still getting stuck, you can utilize that data to escalate so that theres a personal outreach.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can take it a step further by incorporating your customers input and data into your product in a meaningful way. Think about the example above: If a majority of users continue to get stuck at a portion, that feedback should be looped back into Product to eliminate the issue in future versions. Communicating to the user that their input made a demonstrable impact on the product can also create great customer loyalty.

          The #1 way enterprises can use customer intelligence data to improve customer loyalty is by
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Using it to create an emotional connection.
        </p>
        <p>
         Loyalty is created only when there is an emotional connection. Why would we ever become loyal to something toward which we have no feelings? Were only fans of teams we care about  and were only loyal to organizations that create some type of emotional connectivity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, the fundamental way in which data can have a significant impact on loyalty is when our information creates a competitive advantage that makes our interactions with customers more intensely personal.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are three progressive levels at which any business interacts with its customers. First is Processing  flawlessly delivering everything the customer has a right to expect, because theyve chosen to do business with youas opposed to your competition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Next is Service.Customer service consists solely of the activities you undertake to make Processing more convenient, friendly, and efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third, and highest, level of customer interaction is Experience. This level adds the critical element of personalization  which creates emotion connectivity. When the customer is convinced that we know  and care  more about them than a mere transaction, we stimulate loyalty and referrals.

         The primary manner in which we can create personalization is through superior information. In other words, we become able to leverage our data so we deliver insightful ideas, suggestions, and offers based upon that customers individual tastes, tolerances, and preferences.

         This also means that we need to know more than their name, phone number, and e-mail address. The friends we know best are frequently the ones we know the most about  the same is true with customers. This isnt a Big Brother type effort; rather, it is rooted in a desire to deliver the type of customer experience that reveals the most appealing aspects of our business to them  therefore, ensuring their reciprocal loyalty to us.

        </p>
        <p>
         First and foremost, centralize your consumer data to gain a holistic understanding of your customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, many customer experiences with brands are dispersed and fragmented across an array of channels, including in-store POS, ecommerce platforms, mobile apps and social networks. Brands that are able to synthesize this data with consumer management technology are gaining the advantage of a 360-degree view of their customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         This helps them to accurately identify their best customers, while understanding their behaviors, habits and interests on a multidimensional level. It also, in turn, helps develop meaningful relationships with relevant promotions, impactful rewards and streamlined communications across disjointed email clubs, promotional newsletters and reward programs with a focus on earning loyalty, motivating evangelism and growing the bottom line.

         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Loyalty is no longer a function of rewards programs and incentives; it is a function of great customer experience.

        <p>
         A comprehensive assessment of non-traditional data sources (call center data, pain points on the web, etc.) and understanding how these channels support each other in solving customer problems is key. Naturally, looking for attrition triggers based on customer interaction with services or products will arm the enterprise with the comprehensive information needed to improve customer experience, therefore improving customer loyalty.

         A reminder program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Using a customers past purchase data you can discover patterns in their ordering and then remind them when it is time to make a purchase..
        </p>
        <p>
         For example if a customer order flowers for their wifes birthday last year sending them a reminder that their wifes birthday is 10 days away is powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another example could be someone who purchased 30 diet pills that should be taken one a day. At the 20 day mark send them an auto reminder to re-order.
        </p>
        <p>
         If it is positioned as a helpful service more than a marketing piece customers will value the reminder.

         I have had clients experience 7-10% response rates to direct email reminders.

         Our inside sales team uses Mintigo to create a customerDNA about each prospective customer with hundreds of data points that are attributes of the customers business.

         <li>
          Where are they hiring and expanding?

          What are the job titles for which they are hiring?
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         These are data points our sales reps already know before they engage with a customer. While they dont know everything about the customers businessthey know a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
         This helps break the ice, demonstrate interest and empathy, and avoid the selfish element of many of the worst sales calls. In a recent article we wrote about top 3 sales mistakes, one of the biggest mistakes is not knowing anything about the prospective customers business. By doing the analysis of the data before the first sales call is made, you can actually predict the key elements of the sale in advance and increase customer loyalty.

        <p>
         Delivering a story that customers can relate to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Common to every great organization is the ability to tell their story in a way that is compelling; a way that resonates with its customers and instills pride in its workforce. The story creates an emotional response that is felt by the people who connect to the brand.
        </p>
        <p>
         For any organization to consistently do this successfully, they need to have a deep understanding of their audience. In other words, they need to know their customer and be able to articulate their customers needs, wants and desires, often better than customers can articulate on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
         As Henry Ford once said, if we had merely asked our customers what they wanted, they would have told us, a faster horse. Generating profitable customer loyalty doesnt happen by chance. It happens through robust design. Organizations that get to know their customer in a meaningful way, do so because of the customer intelligence they gather, and the way they incorporate it into the story they tell.

        </p>
        <p>
         Focus their analysis on three transaction criteria, recency, frequency, and value, while maintaining a frictionless customer experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         Enterprises tend to get bogged down focusing on the concept of get more and more data. In reality, exceptional personalization and retention marketing thrives without so-called Level 3 insights. Starbucks, for example, boasts one of the most widely successful loyalty and payment schemes in the country. Customers receive rewards based on their visit frequency and lifetime value, not whether they bought a Venti Mocha Frappuccino or simple house blend.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reducing friction is also imperative. Faster throughput translates into real revenue and consumers demand fewer steps at checkout, not more. Enterprises should use the Apple Pay launch as a roadmap, where speedier checkout drove strong consumer adoption, and focus on eliminating check-ins, extra plastic cards, and additional 2D code scans. Without consumer participation, loyalty program dont exist  regardless of the customer intelligence data analyzed.

        <p>
         Use it to support better human interactions with your customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         While there is a lot more information available to businesses on consumer behavior leading to trends and predictive outcomes, I always suggest that companies be cautious not to overlook the fundamental fact that we are all in the business of people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Analytics and other measurable data that relate to your customer relationships are great but should feed a human interaction. If you do not translate this information into a communicable human interaction youre left with the cold mechanical data which doesnt foster engagement. The value is in the way data is translated into actionable relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
         This also doesnt mean automated text messages or emails with contextual reminders, even as convenient as they are becoming. Thats the number one way enterprises can leverage customer intelligence toward loyalty.

         Target new customers with the greatest lifetime value.
        </p>
        <p>
         The simplest way to do this is to compare the profile of customers with single purchases to customers with repeat purchases and develop a character profile of the repeat purchasers.
        </p>
        <p>
         What makes these individuals unique? What differentiates them from single purchasers? Once the character profile is created, use the profile in new customer acquisition to maximize the marketing budget.

        <p>
         Ive heard of a few IT companys in Austin TX building dedicated online support forums as a means of collecting customer intel as well as a source of lead generation. How ever you decide to gather intelligence, the focus should be finding ways to incentivize brand promoters online with customer intel. Analytics will be an important means of gathering intel and tracking repeat interactions with your brand in 2015.

          The #1 tactic that has begun to be the biggest thing a business can do to improve customer loyalty,but so many dont know how to or where to start, is
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Listening and reacting.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some businesses even think theyre too big to listen to what customers are saying but its the most important thing they can be doing to improve loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Imagine a customer of Nike has a problem with a pair of sneakers they purchased and they shout about it online, Nike hears them, publicly answers back and replaces their purchase, for free. Now they not only have a loyal customer but hopefully one that gets them 20 more customers because of the way theyve been positively treated, all because the big company listened and reacted.
        </p>
        <p>
         And more and more tools exist to surface what people are saying and enable you to respond as well as track and analyze. There has never been a better time to be able to take big data and boil it down into something you can take action on and track what happened.

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Through our research we have come to realize that customers reveal huge amounts of information about their preferences through their cross-channel activity and interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Theyd often switch between mobile, social, and web channels. So it becomes nearly essential for companies to follow that thread of interactions and customize display in a manner that would increase the chances of conversion.

        <p>
         <strong>
          The best way for enterprise retailers to use business data to improve customer loyalty is to
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         First identify quantitative measures of what a loyal customer is, and what a regular customer is.
        </p>
        <p>
         The objective is to determine the measurable differences between loyal and regular customers, and then implement strategies and tactics that specifically target moving these metrics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Key metrics are customer lifetime value (CLV), average order value (AOV), likelihood to churn (%), purchases per year, and proclivity to refer friends (using Net Promoter Score).
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally, enterprises will implement different strategies at different stages of the customer journey. The ideal customer journey is: Visitor &gt; Purchaser &gt; Repeat (loyal) purchaser &gt; Brand advocate.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example: an enterprise that discovers repeat purchasers make an additional 3 purchases per year (when compared to a regular purchasers) should implement a rewards program where points are set to expire at a frequency that motivates an additional 3 purchases per year.

         Participating in social media, and through social listening.
        </p>
        <p>
         Digitally interacting with fans and followers gives a brand a friendly, relatable vibe. Consumers feel special and cared for when a brand takes the time to engage.
        </p>
        <p>
         But which platform is best? What tone of voice should be used? What types of content would consumers enjoy?
        </p>
        <p>
         These are all questions that can be answered through social listening. Social listening is the modern day focus group. Far more efficient and accurate, it involves gathering organic mentions of a brand across all digital and social platforms including websites, blogs, forums, Facebook, Twitter, and more. Social listening is the #1 way enterprises can obtain and leverage customer intelligence data to improve customer loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
         By employing social listening through a service such as Radian6 or Crimson Hexagon, analysts are able to see not only what is being said about a brand, but who is saying it. From there, they can dive into demographic andpsycho-graphicdata tobe put to use in their social media strategy. Mining nuggets of data about consumers such as why they love the brand, their affinities, the social platforms they use most, their geographic location, and their age and gender, puts marketers in a position to understand how to best communicate with their consumers. Brands are able to find the right tone of voice, the best platforms, and applicable subject matters to delight their followers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leveraging social media, with the help of social listening, is the #1 way enterprises can improve customer loyalty.

         By crunching feedback from your customers so that you can see what youre doing right and what youre doing wrong, at both the macro and micro levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         You can use text analytics to analyze tweets, emails, survey responses, and other customer feedback to provide insight in many ways. Creating new leads/opportunities, confirming a target market, helping with customer churn, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of our clients is one of the biggest airline companies in the world, and they analyze all social platforms using sentiment analysis to make sure that all of their customers are reasonably satisfied. A customer sent an angry tweet about how the airline lost his bags on his recent flight. This airline company was able to filter through the thousands of tweets they get per day and extract only the ones with negative sentiment. The airline company was able to respond to the customer, return his bags and offer him a free upgrade on his next flight. The responded by sending multiple tweets of gratitude, showing their loyalty to the airline and everyone on the twitter sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another client specializes in developing video games. They use text analytics to see how the gaming community feels about their games. They feed the engine comments on reddit, the games blog, community forums, and they extract the popular themes that run through this dataset. If one of these themes, like gameplay, is very negative, then their development team will read some of the most negative comments, see how many negative comments there are that surround this theme, and take action accordingly. They do the same process to see what theyre doing right.
        </p>
        <p>
         This helps keep their customers loyal to the particular game, as well as the company for doing such a great job at listening and making the changes that their customer actually want.
