     <h3>
      Introduction
     </h3>
     <p>
      The term "demons" was not always understood to have the absolutely negative
connotation that it does today. Homer used the terms "demons" and
"gods" more or less interchangeably. Another opinion was that demons were
intermediaries between men and gods, and that demons had once been men. Plutarch
speaks of "human souls as commencing, first heroes, then demons, and afterward as
advancing to a more sublime degree." Philo of Byblus seems to draw on
this same tradition when he states that, "The most ancient of the barbarians,
especially the Phoenicians and
      <a href="egypt.htm">
       Egyptians
      </a>
      , from whom other people
derived this custom, accounted those the
      <strong>
       <em>
        greatest gods
       </em>
      </strong>
      who had
found out things most necessary and useful in life -- and had been benefactors to
mankind."
     </p>
     <p>
      Our current use of the term "demon" is to denote a malignant spirit, and
comes to us primarily form New Testament writers. However, there is still
uncertainty as to whether or not demons are considered to be distinct and separate from
the Devil and his fallen
      <a href="angels.htm">
       angels
      </a>
      .

     <h3>
      <a name="Demoniacal Possession">
       Demoniacal Possession
      </a>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Demon possession - that is, a human who has become inhabited or "taken over"
by a demon and who cannot, consequently, exercise his own will - is noted in
the New Testament, specifically in Mark, Chapter 5, ver. 12. Josephus also mentions
a method of exorcism prescribed by Solomon, which had "prevailed or succeeded greatly
among them down to the present time." Unfortunately, Josephus does not describe
the method used.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is little doubt that most of what was described in older times as "demon
possession" would today be diagnosed as some sort of mental illness, and treated
accordingly. Nevertheless, a few cases of possession do seem to crop up from time to
time, and the Roman Catholic Church does continue (sparingly) to perform exorcisms.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h3>
      Periods of Increased Demon Activity
     </h3>
     <p>
      Some historians of times past believed that there were cycles during which demonic
activity increased, and used this theory to explain various occurrences, much in the same
way as today's economic historians might explain historical events in terms of trade,
productivity and other factors. These older historians saw a rise in demonic
activity accompanying such occurrences as the destruction of Jerusalem, the fall of Rome
and the French Revolution, and would in all likelihood also have viewed the demonic theory
at work in relation to the rise of Nazism and World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <h3>
      Demoniacal Prophesy
     </h3>
     <p>
      Ancients also had a sort of faith in the prophetic words spoken by those whom they
believed to be possessed by demons, and this was sometimes a component of
ancient oracles. In connection with this, it is worth
pointing out that a respected modern-day professor of psychology once witnessed a friend,
who was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia make a specific and surprising prophecy that
turned out to be perfectly accurate. The professor had no explanation for this
event. although one is tempted to hypothesize that there is a link between altered mental
states and psychic ability. Some also associate the
      <a href="ouija.htm">
       ouija board
      </a>
      with demoniacal prophesy, and those who have seen Linda Blair in
      <i>
       The Exorcist
      </i>
      will recall that this was how her character's problems began.

      "These beings, because of pride, did not
return God's love. God did not destroy them, but permits them a limited scope of
activity. Their condition is permanent for no creature can turn away from the
perfect good of the beatific vision once he has come to enjoy it, and no
additional reflection could change the mind of a purely spiritual being who has
turned away."

      Does God Ever Make Use of Demons?
     </h3>
     <p align="left">
      Before answering "no," one might wish to refer to the Book of 
Tobias. In it, a virgin named Sara weds, only to have her husband slain by 
the demon Asmodeus on her wedding night. Sara, still a virgin, marries 
again, and the same thing happens. Actually, the same thing occurs a total 
of
      <i>
       seven
      </i>
      times. Then Tobias marries Sara - this would make him the 
young woman's eighth husband - Raphael banishes the demon Asmodeus, and Tobias 
and Sara presumably live happily ever after. Some readers have 
hypothesized that the demon may have had a personal attraction to Sara, but the 
Catholic Encyclopedia makes the interesting claim that "God allowed the demon to 
slay these men because they entered marriage with unholy motives," and 
that "the permission given by God to the demon in this history seems to have as 
a motive to chasten man's lust and sanctify marriage."
     </p>
     <p align="left">
      I will not make any comment regarding the demon's motivation, 
but would like to point out that the idea of God giving a demon permission to 
slay men in order to illustrate a lesson in morality strikes me as somewhat 
worrisome. For more on this question, see
