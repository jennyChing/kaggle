           </div>
           <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
            What we have is a chemical arms race between the pesticide companies, who are developing ever more powerful pesticides to kill bugs and to kill weeds, and the bugs and weeds that keep evolving and become more resistant to those pesticides. So another new generation of pesticides have to be invented. So were on this treadmill.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the process of deploying more and more pesticides to deal with pests and weeds that are resistant, we are killing non-target organisms, according to Olson. Thesenon-target organisms are often
            <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2014/05/06/spiders-in-your-garden/">
             beneficial insects
            </a>
            
            <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2014/10/29/flupyradifurone-bad-news-bees/">
             bees in particular
            </a>
            that help keep pest populations in check and pollinate crops.
           </p>
           <p>
            How do these pests and weeds become resistant? Its basic evolution, says Olson. A pesticide can wipe out 99.9 percent of pests or weeds but that 0.1 percent that survives is resistant and they produce offspring that are even more resistant, according to Olson.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thats why experts like Andy Dyer, professor of biology at the University of South Carolina,author of
            <em>
             Chasing the Red Queen: The Evolutionary Race Between Agricultural Pests and Poisons
            </em>
            and a guest onyesterdays show,say
            <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2014/05/23/food-systems-affect-biodiversity/">
             gigantic monocultures
            </a>
            one single crop in a fieldare a huge problem. Wevetaken highly diversified ecosystems and reduced them to a single species, providing pests with an all-you-can-eat buffet, according to Dyer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dyer says he wrotehisbook becausethe connection between pesticide resistance and the underlying principles of evolutionary biologywhile theyre understoodhave not really been closely linked. Dyer says, we have to realize each chemical pesticide has a lifespan and it will lose its effectiveness over time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Les Glasgow of Syngentasaid on yesterdays showthat because herbicides like Roundup are so effective in the short term, they get overused to the point where theylose their effectiveness. The future really is about diversity for weed management, says Glasgow. If we can introduce more diversity in the tactics that we use for weed control, then we can certainly avoid the resistance. Glasgow says products like Roundup and now Enlist Duo are not intended to be used on their own.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thats not common practice, though. Farmers of commodity crops like soy and corn, which tend to be
            <a href="http://ecowatch.com/news/food-agriculture/gmo-genetically-modified-organism/">
             genetically modified
            </a>
            , use herbicides like Roundup more or less indiscriminately because its their one tool in pest and weed control, says Dyer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aaron Hobbs, president of Responsible Industryfor a Sound Environment,says pesticides are merely a part of the solution. He calls for integrated pest management, which is an approach to controlling pests that relies on a combination of best practices. Hobbs agrees with the other guests that weve completely overused Roundup, dousing fields with it and as a result weve killed off a lot of the milkweed, a plant that Monarch butterflies feed on. With milkweed wiped out, the
            <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2014/01/30/monsanto-culprit-record-decline-monarch-butterflies/">
             Monarch butterfly population has collapsed
            </a>
            as well. The increased reliance on chemical pesticides is effecting the entire food web.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only are these chemical pesticides destroying human health and the environment, but, according to Olson, it can cost millions of dollars to develop a new pesticide, and yet they can become obsolete within a few years. So we need to work with nature using these more innovative tools of
            <a href="http://ecowatch.com/2015/01/06/regenerative-organic-agriculture/">
             sustainable agriculture
            </a>
            , Olson says.
           </p>
           <p>
            Allen, a listener whocalled into the show is a former EPA employee, says 2,4-D should have been phased out years ago. It was half of agent orange and its just being brought back and its a really bad idea.Olson and Dyer agree were on a backwards trend:were using dangerous chemicals on fewer and fewer crops with less and less genetic diversity. We need a wide variety of crops with high genetic diversity in order to move away from this chemical dependency. Olson says, I think we can all agree in this room that taking an integrated approach to solve a pest problem is the way to go.

                  Simply not true. Glyphosate is 50 times less toxic than Atrazine, the product it replaced. The product that has been used in agriculture for over 50 years.
                  <br/>
                  Much less persistent in the environment.

                      No, that is not the LD50 of Bacillus thuringiensis in Bt corn. That is the LD50 of  bacterial Bt toxin, not the one produced in plants. Big difference.

                          GMO Bt was a ruse thought up by the industry in cahoots with the regulatory agencies to fool the public into thinking that the plant Bt has been well-studied and is safe..so that they could fast-track their invention on to an unsuspecting public.

                          The Organic version contains 54% of the Bacteria Spores, Fermentation Solids and Toxins.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Toxins are the Cry Proteins. (different strains of bacteria produce different Cry proteins of which there are many: Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, Cry2Aa, Cry3Aa, Cry3Bb, Cry4Aa, Cry4Bb and Cyt2A.)

                          In contrast, the GMO plants currently in use ONLY express one specific Cry Protein, so you can in fact isolate that protein and use it in acute toxicity studies (that way you can feed far more of the protein to an animal than it could possibly consume by eating the grain).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          For instance Cry1A(b)  is only a small portion of MON809 plant protein. In MON809, Cry1A(b) makes up 1.63, 0.55, and 1.23 g/g of leaf, grain, and whole plant tissue, respectively.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So what we eat is the grain, which is but 0.55 g/g.
                          <br/>
                          There are 28 grams in an ounce.
                          <br/>
                          Say you eat a pound of corn, thats 448 grams, or 25 g or 0.25 mg
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Which is why feeding trials of just the protein are more effective at showing no impact, regardless of how much you eat since they have done mouse studies fed at the rate of 5,000 mg/kg with no ill effects.

                        First of all Bt is not produced by plants unless it has been introduced into the plant to do so. And actually the Bt used in GMO crops is the same as that found in the soil. And the LD50 of the Bt toxin in GMO crops is the same has that found in the soil. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is an insecticide with unusual properties that make it useful for pest control in certain situations. Bt is a naturally occurring bacterium common in soils throughout the world. Several strains can infect and kill insects. Because of this property, Bt has been developed for insect control. At present, Bt is the only microbial insecticide in widespread use.

                    Less toxic than frog sex-changing Atrazine?  Thats some recommendation.  Its like saying arsenic is preferable to strychnine.

                      Theres only one guy out there making that frog claim about atrazine.  No one that Ive seen has been able to duplicate that guys research, so I wouldnt take those frog claims seriously.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But glyphosate has a lower Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ) than atrazine.

                      and less toxic than salt. Here is a little something on the subject.

                      less toxic than table salt  look it up  its LD50  more is needed than table salt  that means it is less toxic

                      You have to love when they say things like, Glyphosate is 50 times less toxic than Atrazine, the product it replaced.
                      <br/>
                      According to the EPA in 1993(before GMO crops)
                      <br/>
                      Atrazine use was between 70 and 75 million pounds.
                      <br/>
                      Glyphosate use was between 15 and 20 million pounds.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      According to the EPA in 2007(after GMO crops)
                      <br/>
                      Atrazine use was between 73 and 78 million pounds.
                      <br/>
                      Glyphosate use was between 180 and 185 million pounds.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Obvious FarmersSon63 is really bad at math since Atrazine use has increased a few million pounds and Glyphosate use has increased over 160 million pounds since the introduction of GMO crops.

Your reference is to a website run by a biased genetic engineer, two of her students and a guy who runs another website with a guy who conducts seminars for Monsanto.  LOL!  Looks like about more than half of the references on that list were conducted, contracted or funded by biotech companies or affiliates and you think that is unbiased?

                          Lets test your herbicide knowledge.  What is a better choice for weed control in corn, glyphosate applied at 22 oz./acre or something like Balance Flexx (isoxaflutole) applied at 3 oz. acre?

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Is there a difference in how the two herbicides are applied?  How might that make a difference?

                          Since the introduction of RR crops and the related increase in glyphosate tolerant weeds, both glyphosate and isoxaflutole based herbicides are often applied and there are even deregulated GE crops that are tolerant to both.
                          <br/>
                          So your question of either or is just absurd.

                         <p>
                          The claim was glyphosate has replaced atrazine, which you are obviously too stupid to understand, yet the overall weight for atrazine has not really changed much and if anything it has slightly increased.  In comparison glyphosate use has increased a huge amount.  So since the weight of both glyphosate and atrazine has increased your strawman argument is irrelevant.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I realize you are too stupid to do basic math and you dont even remotely understand toxicology, but as I stated already.  Since the introduction of RR crops and the related increase in glyphosate tolerant weeds, both glyphosate and isoxaflutole based herbicides are often applied and there are even deregulated GE crops that are tolerant to both.

                          Anyone could answer your strawman question by doing some simple math, but since the EIQ is inadequate there is no need to.

                          Why wouldnt we be concerned about the increased use of glyphosate?  Certainly you realize there are numerous studies suggesting adverse impact to NTOs at environmentally relevant levels which correspond with agricultural use, right?  Denying that only makes you an anti-science flatearther.  LOL!

                          Fishes were exposed to herbicide at a dose of 4 mgl-1 generally used by farmers to control weedsSevere damage, shrinkage and degeneration of pentagonal cellular contour of stratified epithelial cells (SEC) were observed in gill. Shrinkage of SEC resulting in degeneration of microridges was observed in buccopharynx. Slight necrosed and distorted SEC was observed in oesophagus. Severe mucus secretion was observed in stomach. Erosion on the apical surface of mucosal folds and columnar epithelial cells (CEC) and necrosis of CEC was also noticed in stomach.

                          The objective of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup to blood and liver cells in the Neotropical fish Corydoras paleatus  (Jenyns 1842) following short term exposure (3, 6, and 9 days) to an environmentally realistic concentration of the herbicide (6.67 ug/L Roundup).We conclude that for the low concentration used in this research, the herbicide shows potential genotoxic effects.

                          Fishes were exposed to herbicide at a dose of 4 mgl-1 generally used by farmers to control weeds
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4 mg/l exposure?  Thats interesting, since USGS survey data shows waterway glyphosate concentrations less than 10 ug/l.  Im having a hard time seeing how a study that exposes fish to a RoundUp concentration 400 times greater than found in situ is relevant.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of Roundup can pose a health risk for fish populations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And that study used concentrations of 58 and 116 ug/l, which is 6 to 12 times the concentration found in situ.  How is that relevant?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These results indicate that AChE-a neurotoxicity biomarker-in C. decemmaculatus may be affected by exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And that studys lowest glyphosate concentration was 1 mg/l, which is 100 times the glyphosate levels found in situ.  How is that relevant?
                         </p>
                         <p>

                          LOL!  You cant really be this stupid, can you?  I gave you references to 4 species of fish, none of which are found in the U.S. rivers in the USGS survey data and that is what you reference?  You anti-science flatearthers are hilarious!

                         <p>
                          Why wouldnt we be concerned about the increased use of glyphosate? Certainly you realize there are numerous studies suggesting adverse impact to NTOs at environmentally relevant levels which correspond with agricultural use, right? Denying that only makes you an anti-science flatearther. LOL!

                          I think Joefarmer is a classic example of how pesticides are not only suspected of impacting health/immune systems but also intelligence  and the ability to reason rationally. Either that or he is a plant for the chemical industry, a weed if you will for this blog . If that is the case then maybe he is a good candidate for Roundup.

                    <br/>
                    New research finds that glyphosate causes cell and DNA damage to epithelial cells derived from the inside of the mouth and throat [1]. It raises concerns over the safety of inhaling glyphosate, one of the most common ways in which people are exposed to the herbicide.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Siegfried Knasmueller and his colleagues the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, found that Monsantos formulated version of glyphosate called Roundup Ultra Max caused cellular damage and DNA damage including chromosomal abnormalities and ultimately killed the cells at higher concentrations. Importantly, DNA damage occurred at concentrations below those required to induce cell damage, suggesting that the DNA damage was caused directly by glyphosate instead of being an indirect result of cell toxicity.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    These are not the first findings of glyphosate-based herbicides cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. Numerous independent research teams have been documenting the hazards of glyphosate exposure over the last few years with in vivo, in vitro and clinical studies.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    DNA damage was observed in blood samples from exposed residents in Argentina and Ecuador [2, 3]. Lab mice were found to harbour chromosomal and DNA damage in bone marrow, liver and kidney cells as well as lymphoid cells [4]. Similar effects were found in non-mammalian species, including sea urchins [5], goldfish [6, 7], eels [8], tilapia fish [9] as well as the fruitfly [10]. These experiments show that glyphosate herbicides are dangerous for humans and many other animals. Glyphosate is highly soluble in water, so impacts on aquatic wildlife may be of particular concern, especially following the recent report on the presence of glyphosate in rain water, groundwater, rivers and air [11, 12]. Its extreme toxic effects on amphibians such as frogs has already been shown (see [13] Roundup Kills Frogs, SiS 26). Cell damage has been documented in many cell types including those derived from the rat testis (see [14] Glyphosate Kills Rat Testes Cells, SiS 54), human placenta, umbilical cord, and embryo (see [15] Death by Multiple Poisoning, Glyphosate and Roundup, SiS 42), rat and carp neurones [16, 17], and liver [18, 19].

                      TZ, share with us a confirmed instance of illness or death from humans or livestock consuming glyphosate residues on crops. It should be very easy if glyphosate is as extremely toxic as you claim. It should be very easy since glyphosate has been on the market for 40 years.

                          You do realize that the inert ingredients are surfactants that are used in your shampoo and hand soap too, dont you?
                          <br/>
                          These tests were conducted in a petri dish, bathing cells in the product.
                          <br/>
                          You know what? When cells are bathed in Coca-Cola, 100% of the cells die.

                          Yes, I agree. The surfactants and soaps listed as inert ingredients are often more toxic than the pesticide active ingredient.
                          <br/>
                          These are the same surfactants and soaps that every US household is sending down their home drains every day.
                          <br/>
                          Agricultural pesticide applications only account for less than 1% of the US usage of surfactants and soaps.
                          <br/>
                          It is pretty obvious we should be looking at other forms of use BEFORE we look at agricultural uses.

                    Maybe its because they tended to be itinerant farmers and were mining the soil.  And their lifespan wasnt so great, either.

                        Death rates in 2012 continued to decline among most groups defined by sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Although changes in mortality are relatively small from one year to the next, long-term trends show the apparent progress in reducing mortality. For example, the age-adjusted death rate in the US decreased 15.7% from 869.0 to 732.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population from 2000 to 2012.

                        Results: On average, GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries.

                          You dont think it has more to do with the 7+ billion of us?

                         <p>
                          Farmers are producing FAR more food on the SAME amount of land.

                         <p>
                          If they werent using these techniques they would be cutting down forests like crazy, but they arent. The amount of forest land in the US is the same today as it was 100 years ago.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The UN also reports that there were 1 billion hungry people in 1990-92 and and the world population was 5.4 Billion, thus 18% were hungry (and many were actually starving).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Today while there remain 870 million hungry, divided by 2013 world population of 7.1 Billion is but 12% and starvation has been virtually eliminated.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This represents a HUGE reduction in hunger in a short period of time while the words population has SOARED.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Why?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Because improved agricultural methods, adopted throughout the developing world has allowed agriculture to produce 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase. A small
                          <br/>
                          percent of that is because of GMO. Over this coming decade, the value of GMO will only grow as crops like Golden Rice and Banana become adopted in areas were lack of Vitamin A still causes millions of children to die or go blind.

                          You must work for either Monsanto, Dow, Syngenta, Dupont, BASF, or Bayer.  Instead of creating borders people would get out of their environment to make food. GM and pesticides are just another way for a single company and a small handful of farmers to create a greater profit margin.  Health is not in the GM farmers best interest.  Do your own research people.  Its people like this who try to convince you otherwise but is only in the best interest of his pockets.  Not only will Organically grown food restabalize soil and earth quality, but will create more jobs in the long run!  PRO ORGANIC! BOO GMO AND PESTICIDES! ITS A PYRAMID SCAM!!!

                          Mike, You are accusing farmers of poisoning their friends, families, and customers, without evidence. That is despicable,. Also you have no clue how Arthur earns a living and no evidence he works for any of those companies. Again despicable. Furthermore, it is in the farmers self interest for customers to be healthy enough to buy more food. So, you do not understand economics either.

                          I apologize for my accusations before doing my homework.  That is something I am currently learning. I apologize if I offended anyone. I am lacking in the understanding of communication before accusation. I will be restructuring my approach to my fellow neighbors and be more understanding before I am condescending.

                          Excuse, Sorry I got your name wrong. I got a little angry myself. Your apology shows some class, often not seen in these arguments. Thanks and please follow up on the suggestions made to help you understand farming. A lot of folks have an either/or attitude. My belief is that as local circumstances change the farmers must change. Certain principles will remain constant though. I sell at the Haile farmers market in Gainesville Fl. You can sign up for the market news letter. They even showed a pic of some of my stuff last month. Also, ask questions in these forums and folks like Loren and Arthur will answer. probably Joe and Farmer 63 as well. You will not get perfect answers. But the percentage of correct ones will be high.

                          and calories? are you serious  Nutrients are way more important than calories.  What is the nutritional value difference in GMO and organically grown?  Not only in the food, but the soil and the bugs around it?  How would we continue to feed 9+ billion people if we push all the bugs out?  This method is satanic!  Another form of control.  You cant control things forever.  YOU WILL LOSE!

                          All calories come with nutrients, but tracking calories is our indirect measure of food per person, including nutrients.

                          Still the way we track global nutrition is by calories per capita because it is a good proxy for the general level of nutrition in a population.

                          So since we fed Africans gmo foods. HIV and AIDs came about but blamed it on monkeys.  WOW I hope Im wrong but if I were to guess sounds possibly correct. Because they werent recieving the vital nutrients due to the lack of nutrient absorption they acquired human immuno deficiency. Just like your animals needing vaccinations.  Hmmm.

                          We are getting to a point I dont fully understand yet. So I will write this down and get back to you. It goes back to that posting I copied and pasted. If the glyphosate blocks tryptophan and tryptophan links with cell production and serotonin causing cell damage and depression. I will have to look into it more scientifically and do some homework.  I appreciate your feedback and time on this discussion.

                          Abstract: Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is the most popular herbicide used worldwide. The industry asserts it is minimally toxic to humans, but here we argue otherwise. Residues are found in the main foods of the Western diet, comprised primarily of sugar, corn, soy and wheat. Glyphosates inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics. Thus, glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Here, we show how interference with CYP enzymes acts synergistically with disruption of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, as well as impairment in serum sulfate transport. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimers disease. We explain the documented effects of glyphosate and its ability to induce disease, and we show that glyphosate is the textbook example of exogenous semiotic entropy: the disruption of homeostasis by environmental toxins.  *entropy

                          Damages cellular systems. Therefore your immune system becomes weak. Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  We will be hitting the heart of whats been happening since 1983 apparently. We just dont know it yet. But this is just an opinion.  Im not a dr.

                          Mike, like just think about what you are saying for a moment.There was no GMOs back in the early 80s Not one.
                          <br/>
                          Look Mike, you are falling for the oldest deception, the thing that you are supporting is the one that is deceiving you. Why do they put out all this crap info? Why is does your side lie so much? Even you have to see it? Like really AIDS caused by GMO 10 years before hand? Time traveling GMOs?
                          <br/>
                          Honestly, Mike if you really want to learn about agriculture and how it works, just ask, if I dont know the answer, I will hook up up..

                          That is why Im discussing this with you. If you can provide answers and proof I will follow what your saying. But so far your just telling me things Ive heard many times. Just look around. Compare and contrast different countries, different people, different lifestyles.  Its much deeper then your mind is willing to travel. If Im wrong please provide proper information otherwise. But so far you have only informed me of you differences with the 2 sides of belief systems.

                          What different countries? And it is not a belief system, that is your side.\
                          <br/>
                          Here are some facts:
                          <br/>
                          Gmo is just a trait, not a new plant, you can buy the same plant w/wo GMO
                          <br/>
                          Gmo farming is far more sustainable or farmers would not buy them
                          <br/>
                          less pesticides are used on GMOs or farmers wouldnt buy them
                          <br/>
                          You get a greater yield with GMOs or farmers would not buy them
                          <br/>
                          All new plant varieties are patented including apples and lettuce

                          Excuse, I went through a stage about 4 or 5 years ago in which sometimes I was the one posting stuff from these sites. Until I hear from someone I personally trust or unusual circumstances occur. I no longer go to these sites. They have cried wolf so many times that I have no confidence that  there is a chance I will find anything useful there.

                          Maybe insulin, That is g.e. now. Think it started being g.e. back about 1980, but check me on that date.

                          I do remember from working in a drug store in the late 1970s, pre GM insulin, that there were basically 2 kinds of insulin available, porcine, which was (as the name would clue you) made from hog pancreases and the kosher kind whose name escapes me.

                          The FBI was arresting Chinese nationals last summer trying to steal GM technology in Iowa and Illinois.  I seriously doubt that the Chinese had GM crop technology in 1980.

                          That is incorrect.  GM corn was accidentally dumped into Kelloggs cornflakes in the late 1980s.  Although I agree with you that there is no correlation between GMOs and HIV.  Although, interestingly, HIV began around that time.

                          Essentially Organic and GMO crops dont compete.
                          <br/>
                          The majority of our Organic crops are Vegetables, Fruit, Berries and Nuts. Which only compete with a small amount of GMO sweet corn, squash and Papaya
                          <br/>
                          Almost all of our GMO is Corn, Soybeans, Sugar Beets, Canola and Cotton.
                          <br/>
                          What isnt GMO is almost all conventional for those crops.
                          <br/>
                          The biggest organic grains are Wheat and Oats, and they arent GMO.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So if you are an Organic grower, typically you arent competing with GMO at all but with conventional growers. In most cases your yields will be lower (~20 or so percent) but the higher price you get for Organic produce will usually make up for your lower yields and higher labor costs per acre.

                          I completely disagree with you.  IMO you might want to check other sources for your facts.  Nutrients and calories go hand in hand.  Nutrients are more important.  There is a difference in GMO and non GMO nutritional values.  Look it up.  GMO depletes nutrients and deters vital insects and weeds.  There are other ways to fight them besides pesticides. Its satanic because its for profit not the healthiest foods in the world

                          Knowing that your product is 100% produced by the organic earth and not these scientific chemical formulas to hand down from one business to the next. It costs because your cutting out the seed supplier, chemical company, soil distributors, and possibly fertilizer depending on your farming crop and stock.  Thats why it cost. Your no longer the man on the end. Your independent. But the label laws and cents are expensive because thats the last thing these industries want you to do to cut them off entirely. Investors losing money. Boom!

                          First of all all my crops are 100% grown from the earth. Second I grow Forage crops, and since the dawn of forage crop growing, you have to buy seed. (forage crops are harvested just before they go to seed)
                          <br/>
                          Adding chemicals improves soil health, or why would the crops grow better? Duh.
                          <br/>
                          What the heck is a soil distributor?

                          Ummm, we do. with some or our fields we grow grasses and Alfalfa (legume), The alfalfa helps the grasses grow fast in the spring, we cut in early summer and then the alfalfa  grows.

                          Try thinking, not feeling. Drop the emotion and look at the facts. Ask a few questions instead of just arguing.

                          I guess it sometimes gets to a point when you state facts and they are just completely denied.  So how do you explain facts to someone who completely denies the facts?

                          You do realize that forage crops are intended for livestock, right?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Are you familiar with alfalfa?  Great for livestock, not so great in your salad.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And there are lots of things like BMR corn (aka corn silage) where a farmer grows corn but harvests it before the ears fully develop.  Its for livestock feed, most usually for cattle, especially dairy herds.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And theres haylage, wheatlage and a whole bunch of other crops that are intended for livestock and not the peeps.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          It really sounds like you should get out and actually meet a farmer and find out what he/she does for a living.

                          Great!  I have no idea where you live, and I dont really care to know, but within about 20-25 miles from any major city, theres a modern farming operation.  Maybe you could check with your local university or community college to see where there are farms that you could visit.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Ill guarantee youd learn a lot.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          If youre not able to actually visit a farm, there are a lot of great ag universities like Iowa State, Purdue, Cornell, UC Davis, etc. that you can get a lot of great info from.  Plus, they are taxpayer funded, so you might as well learn something from them, right?

                          Do a few google searches on farming. Quickest way might be to simply shop at a farmers market. Go a bit late in the market day when farmers o answer questions. A couple more Ag U.s are MSU, [both of them] and U. of Fl.

                          Yep, every state has good ag universities.  My list was based on my Iowa location, didnt mean to exclude anyone, and I forgot to mention University of Nebraska, the University of Missouri system, Kansas State, etc.

                         <p>
                          The great thing about ag universities is that they tailor their knowledge to local conditions.

                          University of New Mexico has a chili pepper institute.  They probably know more about growing chiles than anyone anywhere.  Not really applicable to what I grow, though.

                          I, however grow no forage crops as I have no livestock. And I eat my fruits and veggies. I also trade with other farmers and many folks are very happy to receive my conventionally grown crops. Because they are aware of ho farming works. Next time you get a chance get out in the countryside a bit and introduce yourself and learn a little something about food production.

                          Farmers are ignorant to the medical, agricultural, and  ecological benefits and benigns within their food. IMO not by choice but we have been duped for a long time.  IMO unless you guys can come up with some things to back your case us so called trolls will continue to back our evidence until proven otherwise. So keep calling us trolls and we will keep calling your bluff

                          Farmer use the lest amount of chemicals that they can. For some reason you folks think that chemicals are free, they are expensive.

                          no it doesnt help.  Because I asked you if glyphosate is in the Krebs cycle.  These chemicals and GMOs are dangerous.  Lethal and damaging overtime.

                          Heres some more evidence for you. Doesnt matter if its a very little or a large amount. Here are the facts on glyphosate. I have worked with chemicals everyday for over a year now and it does not matter if it is a very minimal count based on OSHA PELs. A minute amount of chemicals will be harmful to cell structure. So read this and tell me once again glyphosate is safe.

                          Chemicals are neutral. It is all in how they are used. Also even organic growers use chemicals. For example, Rob Wallridge told me he uses sul-po-mag for a soil amendment.

                          Please consider that intercropping is limited by the design of equipment used. However I have read of a guy who has modified his equipment to facilitate intercropping. A short cover crop, say clover sown between corn rows might become practical.

                          Intercropping is an interesting concept.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Im assuming that the intercrop is sacrificial, since a fully-canopied corn crop uses up 95-96% of the available light.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There are mechanical issues, like how do you plant two dissimilar crops.  And how does the intercrop compete with the cash crop for nutrients and water.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          My thought from reading research so far is that the weed suppression potential from intercropping is given up by what Ive mentioned above.  Im always open to research links, though.

                          Hi Joe, I think Rob Wallbridge posted an article about a guy that was planting 2 crops in groups of rows, that his equipment could straddle and had modified his equipment accordingly. so, the shade was not an issue as the groups of rows gave the shorter plants enough sun. I dont grow that way. Grow pineapples, and rotational crops in greenhouses. So while interested. did not really learn it. Rob is organic and writes for biofortified and you can contact y finding one of his articles and commenting to him.

                          All I can tell you is that corn will completely canopy over by about V12 stage, maybe V10.  By that time any intercrop will be starved of light.  Which is why I made the specific point that a fully developed corn crop will absorb 95-96% of available light.

                          Dont blame you, Botrytis is problem and you need to drench roots with fungicide. Did you know that poinsettias require more molybdenum than most crops? Also you need to keep an eye out for whiteflies. Finally I have run into a few guys that do a lot of direct seed grains and actually dont know much about growing in containers.

                          Ok, I have diligently researched this. It is an expensive attachment that runs off the PTO on your tractor. Many design features are similar to a manure spreader. They are used to make sure soil is distributed evenly on top of the ground. This allows for maximum destruction of all soil life and penetration of the glyphosate/g.e.toxins into the cell membranes of consumers thus achieving the corporate agenda of killing all customers and consumers. This will allow them to declare bankruptcy ahead of schedule and turn the population free Earth over to the last 4 surviving members of the illuminatti. Who will be hidden somewhere near area 51.

                          Probably means potting soil distributor. Organic growers sometimes use sterile mix just like conventional ones do. Some make their own mix from compost and other ingredients.

                          We figure that 6 inches of topsoil per acre weighs 2 million pounds on our farm for the purposes of calculating base saturation nutrient application.  I wonder how much propane it would take to make a batch of that sterile mix on our farm?

                          Hi Joe, Most native soils do not drain well enough to use as potting soils and weigh too much as well. I use 2 types Fafard Number 2 for germinating seeds and growing seedlings to transplant stage and a bark mix I buy in bulk for larger containers. I grow some ornamentals, and for disease and nematode reasons some of my veggies in large containers. Okra in particular is susceptible to nematodes.

                          Maybe this is a southern thing. But most everyone down here starts seedlings in greenhouses before frost date, and then sets out transplants just after the date. Helps get a jump on getting a crop in before the rain, heat and humidity set in. And gives the root systems a headstart on soil born diseases. Especially damping off. Though I still get damp off in my papayas, especially if I run them a bit wet and we get cloudy and cold in Jan. People think we have a real long season. That is only partially correct. When the rains start, usually in June. The melons, tomatoes, and others crack and split from the unneeded water, and the fungal and bacterial problems can get bad.

                          Its not that I dont believe what he says. He lacks the will to search even further into the information he is providing. They are making us stronger and more intelligent by giving these types of info. I am learning more from them by them trying to deter the information but only revealing more information to continue to back our points. They are only contradicting themselves. Digging their own graves. Keep the positivity and inform the public of the information they provide and use it against them since they lack the will for truth. They have good points but have been lost in their own beliefs.

                          So if glyphosate blocks vital nutrients from being absorbed. That means the calorie count in GMO is a false calorie count. Because we cannot even absorb some vital nutrients due to being blocked by this gm seed. Therefor causing iron deficiencies and what not in women, men, and children.  Therefor causing immunodeficiencies and other diseases because we cannot absorb vital nutrients due to the blockage of gmo

                          Thanks to this companys careless handling of its toxic by-products, over 50 Monsanto locations have become Superfund Sites across the United States alone, affecting hundreds of communities and their environment with health and ecological consequences. This epic run of pollution can be counted as the worst in the history of this country.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Despite this, Monsanto has arranged not only to survive, but even to thrive, maintaining strong ties inside in the US government (especially the FDA). The corporation wages widespread campaigns of misinformation, persecuting institutions and individuals, including scientists, farmers and activists that dare to disclose these crimes. Today, Monsanto is addressing a new chapter in its history of successful failures, through the creation and commercialization of Genetically Modified Organism or GMOs. Monsanto continues to spread new technologies and products which are ringing alarms among scientific, human rights and ecological organizations around the globe for concerns over public health, food safety and ecological sustainability

                          Nick congrats on a well written, but out of date post. Did you know that the folks who made the criminal decisions of the 60s are now in mid 80s or older? Retired or gone. did you know that many Monsanto employees and owners were not even born yet when tis happened? Are you aware that Monsanto sold the division that produced the products and problems?  Did you know that because of some transactions that Monsanto did not survive? It actually did not exist for a while.  Did you know that some of the companies we buy from regularly, powered the Axis war effort during WW2? However the last sentence of your post is incorrect. The groups you mention are activist groups.

                          So in your mind, scientific, human rights, ecological organizations, with concerns about public health, food safety, ecological sustainability can be discounted and thrown aside by labeling them activist groups. Got it. Thats a common theme with you guys. Activism means they are meaningless.

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Yeah. I imagine your investment portfolio largely consists of AstroGlide and Cheetos.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Its looking like rational thought is beyond you.
                          <br/>
                          Got any chemtrail stories?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Why dont you just admit you have no subject matter expertise and that you are talking out your backside?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You are a dumbass.

                          But its more like removing hitler from germany.  Like removing Bin Laden from Iraq is how we look at it.  There are more signs of negatives then positives based on readings.  Believe it or not we are on the other side of the belief system.  Even though both sides can claim that its fact not a belief system.

                          No, very wrong. Not meaningless at all. More like dishonest hypocrits and in the Phiippines and several other places recently criminals.

                          I would to if I was trying to change the fact that Monsanto is a person under the law. Persons cant just walk away a deny their previous activity.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          If Monsanto were a real flesh and blood person and not a legal fiction we would call their behavior sociopathic.

                          Not defensive to bring up the fact that anti-g.e. criminals  have vandalized G.R. test plots in the Philippine Islands.
                          <br/>
                          If you think corporate law needs to be updated to reflect modern technology and that execs and stockholders need to have more liability risk. You have a point. I know nothing of moving around anyone. and the folks running things today may be different. Proof of that can be found in the lack of liability suits by powerful law firms that would quickly move against biotech firms if there investigators said the evidence was there fo victory. Essentially I am saying that those investigators are good at their jobs and understand the facts Waaayyyy better than you.

                          Like I said before, get a job at McDonalds and get some dignity in your life. Maybe then you might grow up beyond childish name calling

                          Sorry pipsqueak, you dont have science on your side.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I feel sorry for your children having to grow up in a dysfunctional environment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Yeah. I imagine your investment portfolio largely consists of AstroGlide and Cheetos.

                         <p>
                          Its looking like rational thought is beyond you.

                          Its a sign of anger.  Anger comes from insecurity.  You can usually see it when someone cant back up their case. Its uncalled for for name calling.

                          Based on everything Ive read from Mike Adams has been true.  The only thing Ive seen him over exaggerate were his  Ebola videos warning the US that it could take over.  But besides that he puts up some pretty good believable information.  So yea I am so far associated with this so called vermin.  He seems to be only trying to warn the people of the misinformed science of things

                          Try reading what mike said about scientists. and then provide evidence for your ongoing Gmo pesticide industry claim. You know the evidence that does not exist..or at least that you seem to be unaware of as you do not post it.

                          I am not blaming farmers; I am however blaming those companies who are producing deadly products and Monsanto is well known for this. As for the forestslook at all the forests being cut down in many parts of the world. So we get more food and in exchange more poisoned air to breathe. Makes sense.

                          Vitamin A is naturally available in greens not bananas and rice. It would be safer to help these Africans and other vitamin A deficient populations on proper farming techniques or even providing vitamin A supplements. But no, Monsanto and their slime sisters want to fortify rice and bananas with vitamin A . Disgusting, as it is just another attempt to take over land and farmers in other countries with your gmo poison.

                          First of all, arid regions, like much of Africa dont grow rice in the first place.

                          If youre talking about Golden Rice, there arent any commercial interests involved.  Biotech patent holders like Syngenta and Monsanto have waived patent rights for small farmers.

                          But maybe you could explain how we should encourage Asian farmers to grow organic carrots in submerged paddies.  Last I knew, root vegetables dont do well when theyre submerged, but its possible I missed something.

                          I know my geography, I know what continents those 2 crops are grown in. Waiving patent rights for small farmers is only done to get the governments of these guinea pig countries to approve your GMO poison. Like I said, vitamin A supplements would be safer and would stop more take over of these poor countries natural resources.

                          Why would they fortify it in bananas and rice?  Is it because bananas and rice have a larger profit market?  So people would get all the supposed nutrients through those so they can sell more and keep people off the greens?  Im trying to think like these companies

                          Mike, the answers to your 1st and 2nd question are the same it about promoting   GMO crops thru out the world. The GMO rice is called GoldenRice as it is grown using traits of GMO corn which contain beta-carotene.  Rice is the largest crop grown in the far east. The development of this rice was funded by the Rockefellas and Bill Gates in conjunction with Sygenta. It was tested in the Phillipines and local farmers pulled it out of the ground by it roots. You would need to eat eat 20 bowls of rice per day for your rda of vitamin A. The Rockafellas stopped  their funding. As far as the gmo bananas they are grown using green pepper traits. The last I heard these were tested on some college kids in Iowa. Uganda is slated to put these bananas into production in 4 or 5 years. Many experts say providing vitamin A supplements is way more effective and much less expensive. But as we all know from history the 3rd world countries have and are being raped of their natural resources and the majority of their people kept in absolute poverty.

                          The fact is, in this climates greens dont travel well, but RICE and BANANAS do, thats why this is important, because these are the STAPLE crops of these areas.

                          Right, farmers have eradicated a pesky weed and secondly, our demand for Ethanol for our cars has caused us to grow ever more corn, but the problem is NOT that glyphosate is to blame, but because weeds and agriculture dont mix. Even Organic farmers would keep milkweed in check.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          All that is needed is to proactively plant milkweed in non farm areas, and we have no shortage of those. Talk to your local city council and just get it done.

                          You do realize that in ethanol production from corn, only the starch is used, right?  The protein and fiber are separated out and used for high-quality animal feed and the oil is separated out too.

                          What is the problem with using the starch from corn to make ethanol and still have the protein and fiber for animal feed?

                          Are you familiar with our agricultural universities?  Animal science folks have spent about the last 125 years or more studying animal nutrition.  And Distillers Dried Grains from ethanol plants are a very useful component of animal feed rations.

                          I know it is edible and baked in an oven with butter and pepperdelicious. But not the corn that is left over after being processed for fuel  the rest is given to pigs, which doesnt help a hungry world.

                          Freedom of religion means feed yourself. In this case probably with chicken. They may use a bit for feeding them as well. Failing that eat beans.

                          Probably by reading posts that insinuate that religious taboos on pork are somehow relevant. Also, if you dont want folks to reply regardless of who you responded to. Try writing on a blackboard in your living room. Again eat chicken or beans. Or are you to stupid to understand?

                          Commas are useful. Not quite as useful as spell-check, but nonetheless.

                          My comment on religion was due to his comment about hungry people not being allowed to eat pork. How could you not follow that? It is
                          <em>
                           right there
                          </em>
                          !

                          Im not 100% certain, but I believe kale is not forbidden due to it not being indigenous to the desert regions where the current religions were founded.

                          As far as pork and shellfish are concerned, Ive heard two main reasons given for why theyre banned. One being due to the split hooves of the pigs resembling Lucifers own and the antennae of the shellfish looking like his horns. The other is due to their supposed filthiness. Either way, banning food is ridicules.

                          I cant see to which of my comments you are posting a reply. Is it about full tanks or full stomachs? And how many farmers have been displaced in Africa, and also South America, just so the large agri businesses can plant soya  mostly? Perhaps I should say full wallets or full stomachs.

                          Death rates in 2012 continued to decline among most groups defined by sex, race, and Hispanic origin. Although changes in mortality are relatively small from one year to the next, long-term trends show the apparent progress in reducing mortality. For example, the age-adjusted death rate in the US decreased 15.7% from 869.0 to 732.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population from 2000 to 2012.

                          The nations largest health care organization sent a newsletter to their patients. In that newsletter was An article by one of their nutritionists who explained GMOs and then told the patients to avoid them so as to not degrade their health. The health care organization had no official policy on Roundup laden GMOs because of the politics, but it cared enough about the concerns of its medical staff, its patients, and its bottom line to send out the warning

                          There have been no long term independent studies of the health effects of Roundup laden GMOs on human health. Many health care organizations are recognizing that severe unexplainable symptoms that are being reported by their patients get better when Roundup laden GMOs are removed from their diet.

You have to look everywhere around you. They are only helping us prove our points. Evil and wrong doers will lose. Final

                        I was referring to the ones who collapsed from food supply issues. That is not a problem today as with these chemicals fewer farmers feed more people than ever before.

                          Agreed. And with todays unemployment levels, those 95%  of farming jobs that were lost since we industrialised farming, would sure be nice to get back. Smaller, more sustainable farms is the way to go, according to the WHO (World Health Organisation.)

                          There is no long line of people wanting to be farmers.

                          Yeah, the fact that we feed 155 people per farmer these days is insignificant.  As long as people have 4G service to whine on the interwebs.

                          Except what they dont realize is that agricultural progress allowed people to do actual useful stuff, like be tradesmen, scientists, doctors and nurses, etc.  Building a nation  thanks to boring stuff like the Homestead Act and Morrill Act way back when.

                          Against my better judgement I looked at this. It is an editorial consisting of a list of editorials posing as sources by anti big ag groups. They are all full of unsubstantiated accusation. and, as usual, No proof.

                          No, editorials by the organic consumers association do not interest me. Neither did the other one. No definition of big ag, So without a definition you have  no clue whether any of the farms in question are really big. Further you seem to think big is bad. That is crap. Big is neutral and the companies are providing goods and services that people are voluntarily buying.

                          Of course it would not interest you to learn about the other side of this coin. Yes, in this case bigger is bad   when smaller farmers are extorted and forced to sell their lands. It is being done in the US, in Latin America and in Africa.

                          extort and forced to sell Another emotional claim with no evidence. Where are the news articles about the criminal cases and the funerals of the farmers. I know if someone tried to extort or force me I would kill them. Then there would be news and trials. Especially in the U.S. So, wheres the proof. And big is nuetral. Both Big and small are capable of good and evil equally.

                          Why dont you ask your MSM why it keeps stories about this quiet? And there are many other subjects your MSM doesnt report. So much for freedom of the press which has been turned into freedom to suppress.

                          Well, since I have no idea what an MSM is. It will be difficult to ask. And if evidence is being suppressed by the press. How would you know?????Do you have special insider access?

                          Well, I dont pay much attention to jingoisms or jingoists. So such acronyms are not often something I recognize. I did notice you failed to answer my question. BTW I read Smithsonian, Archaeology, American History, Audubon, and National Geographic. I listen to NPR and did you know that NPR recently did an actually honest show on g.e. crops recently? You should try to find it. And quit assuming that you are morally superior to those who have more facts. It doesnt help to be wrong yet again.

                          Brilliant strategy, calling me a goon is truly the result of a magnificently superior intellect. Although you have a point. I was a very physical and hard hitting high school football. The TV character Al Bundy may have even been modeled after my career.

                          The American dream has turned into a nightmare not only for Americans, but for the rest of the world too. The 1%ers vs the 99%ers. A disappearing middle class  the rich richer and the others a lot poorer. Now, please dont come back and tell me where I have read this. I would have to ask you where are YOU NOT reading about this because you just plain dont give a damn about others? As long as you have yoursto hell with others. Right? You and the US lack a social consciencebut then, you would not understand what I am talking about.

                          More horse hockey, My economic status is finally recovering from bad decisions That I made. The so called 99% does not ever offer me a good job. Concentration of wealth in the hands of business investors, not speculators like day traders, is beneficial. There is not a finite amount of wealth. More is created every day. Your rant is essentially a temper tantrum that shows ignorance of basic economics. I care about others, The leftist myth that they have a monopoly on caring is just that. A myth that is used to attempt to create a class warfare lack of mentality. You have no idea how much I care. And our comparative caring has no bearing on the fact that glyphosate is less toxic than salt. lack a social conscience more unsubstantiated crap. Your comments are designed to put folks that you claim to care about out of work and make farms less efficient. Thus leading to food prices for the poor rising. Get a grip Vera and go outside this spring and grow some milkweed.

                    If you want to live like they did 200 years ago, be my guest.  But their life span was very short and I wonder how many of those harvests were tainted with fungus and bacteriaand how many died and were sickened as a result.  Your sappy sentimentality is way off base and has no place in the policy making of today.

                    The boomer generation has witnessed the population double in their lifetime.  In year 2000 the population hit 6 billion.  The population is now above 7 billion.  We are exponentially growing and 9 billion is not far off.  When the American Indians were farming the land there were a lot less people.  In order to survive the population, they relied on artificial selection to increase their crop yields and get the largest foods. Maize -&gt; corn is a common example.  Dont think that they had it all figured out, no generation has.  Its a daunting task to feed large populations of people.

                      Its so obvious that gentle family planning programs in every nation is the solution because it would remove the growing mass market the big corporations depend on. So why am I the only one here willing to say so? Whatever website I post at its the same. Why?

                      We currently produce enough food worldwide to support twice our population. We currently waste about 40% of all the food we produce. The myth that we are facing food scarcity dangers is just that  a myth. The reason people go hungry in the world today is because of corruption, food waste, terrible food distribution management, and corporate greed.

                        The world produces enough food to feed everyone. World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase. This is enough to provide everyone in the world with at least 2,720 kilocalories (kcal) per person per day  according to the most recent estimate that we could find (FAO 2002, p.9).  The principal problem is that many people in the world do not have sufficient land to grow, or income to purchase, enough food.

                          We apply Glyphosate at the rate of about 1 lb per ACRE.
                          <br/>
                          Not including the end zones, thats ~ equal to the size of a football field.
                          <br/>
                          And we apply it at the START of the growing season for GMO crops.
                          <br/>
                          So by the END of the season, its nearly gone.

                        Ex, there is no other crop on earth that can yield as many calories per acre as corn. AND is so adaptable to many climates. No other crop is even close. When you are struggling to produce enough calories to feed the worlds growing population..You are going to have to grow the highest producing crop.

                          If you watch the news.  We are throwing away just as much food as we are producing.  So we havent hit that point of feeding the growing population.  You have jumped the gun on that.

                          That is one of the biggest selling points for corn.
                          <br/>
                          Corn can be kept in storage for many years without spoiling.

                          I would not consult an agronomist to diagnose and treat a medical condition. You may be up to date on the latest dogma on growing more row crops with chemicals and GMOs.

                          There have been no long term independent studies of the health effects of Roundup laden GMOs on human health. Many health care organizations are recognizing that severe unexplainable symptoms that are being reported by their patients get better when GMOs are removed from their diet.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The nations largest health care organization sent a newsletter to their patients. In that newsletter was An article by one of their nutritionists who explained GMOs and then told the patients to avoid them so as to not degrade their health. The health care organization had no official policy on GMOs because of the politics, but it cared enough about the concerns of its medical staff, its patients, and its bottom line to send out the warning.

                          I suspect they wont be listening to any agronomist who denies their own personal experience.  But, yet here we see it GMO pesticide industry disinformation goons trying to spin away the truth.

                    Roundup is primarily used on Roundup-Ready GMO crops:  corn, soy, canola, cottonseed and sugar beet (almost all non-organic are now GMO).  Unfortunately, Roundup is also used as a drying agent on non-GMO crops such as wheat and legumes.  Not only is it environmentally destructive, it has been implicated in a host of chronic diseases.  It was only tested for safety for 90 days on lab rats by Monsanto, the equivalent of about 10 years in humans.  Many chronic disorders like cancer take longer than 10 years to appear.  Basically, were the guinea pigs.  Roundup has only been heavily used for the past 10 or 15 years, its increased use (in millions of lbs.) correlates almost exactly with the rise of chronic illnesses.  Of course, the paid commenters for Monsanto (typically using a homey farmer in their I.D.s) are correct in saying that correlation doesnt mean causation  this is how these companies side-step legal responsibility.  After 10 or 20 years its almost impossible to prove that your cancer was caused by years of eating Roundup-dosed products.

                          These latest studies confirm a wealth of evidence on the toxicities of glyphosate and Roundup formulations [2] ( Glyphosate Toxic &amp; Roundup Worse , SiS 26), and pinpoint the different sites of action, all of which result in cell death. Epidemiological studies have previously linked glyphosate to spontaneous abortions, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Laboratory studies showed that glyphosate inhibits transcription in sea urchin eggs and delays development. Brief exposures to glyphosate in rats caused liver damage, and adding the surfactant in Roundup had a synergistic effect, causing greater liver damage. Roundup was also found to be much more lethal to frogs than to weeds, and could have contributed to the global demise of amphibians within the past decades [3] ( Roundup Kills Frogs , SiS 26).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We have called for a new regulatory review on glyphosate and Roundup in 2005 [2]. There is a now a strong case for restricting, if not phasing out glyphosate and Roundup; in the first instance, by banning the release of Roundup tolerant GM crops worldwide. For the same reason, no further Roundup tolerant GM crops should be approved for commercial release.

                          Laboratory studies showed that glyphosate inhibits transcription in sea urchin eggs and delays development.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Because there are huge sea urchin populations in midwest corn and soybean fields?
                          <br/>
                          Roundup has zero effect on frogs-we have a 72 acre property surrounded by corn and soybean fields-all the farmers use Roundup-the frog population is the same as its been since the early 70s when the family first bought the property.
                          <br/>
                          Farmers are actually using LESS Roundup now,NOT more.

                          JoeFarmer, you just have to understand that you are dealing with people who arent concerned about the truth.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The USDA has always kept track of pesticide use by weight.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Because it is a good way of tracking the use of a SPECIFIC pesticide from year to year.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These people though use it to compare use of pesticides whose weight of Active ingredient varies greatly by pesticide.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We wouldnt ever hear of this except for the fact that the WEIGHT of glyphosate makes it one of the heaviest of herbicides.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Consider, on Corn, the average application of Glyphosate is 0.931 lbs per acre.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But for MESOTRIONE, the average application was but 0.121 lbs per acre
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          or for ISOXAFLUTOLE the average application was but 0.066 lbs per acre

                          Yep, youre correct, and that was the point I was trying to make for NoGMO, but as you said, they dont want to listen.

                         <p>
                          Take a look at the part of the thread where NoGMO tries to prove the dangers of glyphosate by trotting out obscure studies that have nothing to do with the actual levels of glyphosate found in U.S. waterways!

                          What you are up against here is a contempt and arrogance that  on a very profound level undermines whatever the other poster is saying. You are ignorant and I can prove it is entirely inappropriate for any farmer to say, particularly when the subject is a well justified suspicion on the part of the public about food safety and farming practices and the public regulatory agencies and institutions. It is irresponsible to an extreme degree, and it is also counter-productive. As well as representing a threat to public safety,  it is a threat to the integrity of the public agriculture infrastructure and a threat to  farming itself.

                          You might notice that the pro-privatization crowd will criticize members of the public for being confused about this issue when they themselves are working night and day to confuse the public. Then they will criticize people for promoting various alternative approaches that may or may not be supportable, when they themselves are forcing the public to look for alternatives.

                         <p>
                          It is not science they are defending, nor the public ag infrastructure, though they will claim that they are, and it most certainly not public health and safety they are defending. They are defending privatization of the infrastructure.

                         <p>
                          Farmers are using more glyphosate because they are growing so many more crops tolerant of Glyphosate, but the amount PER ACRE hasnt been going up, and the amount of herbicide per acre hasnt been going up on an EIQ basis.

                          This chart summarizes herbicide use on soybeans in 1996, before HT crops were widely adopted, and in 2006, after HT crops were widely adopted.

                         <p>
                          For the column headings,
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Use = % of this pesticide compared to the total of all pesticides;
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Rate = pounds of active ingredient applied per acre of soybeans;
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Toxicity = chronic toxicity score (higher is safer);
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Half life = number of days it takes for 1/2 of the herbicide active ingredient to degrade in the soil.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          EIQ (Environmental Impact Quotient, lower is safer)  EIQ is a numerical representation of the risks a pesticide poses for the environment, consumers, and farm workers. (The EIQ for 2,4-D is an average of the EIQs for 5 different formulations of the herbicide.)
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          By 2006, the majority of farmers had switched to glyphosate, the least toxic of the herbicides, with it making up 85% of herbicide use. So the total amount of herbicides is trending down and the total environmental impact due to herbicides has also decreased.

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Yet, in 1997 the EPA has glyphosate use at between 34 and 38 million pounds.  Between 1997 and 2007 there was about an 8% increase in Permanent cropland (% of land area) so that means if you were correct the new glyphosate use numbers in 2007 should be about  36.7 to 41 million pounds.  However, the EPA says glyphosate use in 2007 was between 180 and 185 million pounds.  So there is like 140 million pounds unaccounted for.  I guess you believe the glyphosate fairy is using it.

                          Again, you are only looking at ONE herbicide. See the chart above, and notice that the other herbicides WENT DOWN as Glyphosate went up.
                          <br/>
                          Notice the TOXICITY of Glyphosate is less than all the other herbicides.

                          There is a wealth of evidence on the health hazards of glyphosate. Its approval, along with other hazardous chemicals, relies on systematic flaws in the EU and US regulatory processes, which to this day, do not require evaluation by independent research, and instead rely solely on the industrys own studies. Approval is therefore often based on data not available to the public or independent research scientists. Nevertheless, raw data have been obtained from the industry through the law courts, which, when re-analysed by independent scientists, also provide evidence of toxicity.

                         <p>
                          Taken together, glyphosate is implicated in birth and reproductive defects, endocrine disruption, cancers, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, respiratory problems, nausea, fever, allergies and skin problems.

                          Joe Farmer and Arthur Doucette are known pro-GMO biotech trolls and shills. They spew pseudoscience and misinformation 24/7. They are either incredibly ignorant, or they are being paid by the biotechs to spread their misinformation and propaganda. Pay them no mind, they are not worth your time

                          Cletus posted a list of some of your comments, I believe that could be proof of my claim that you cant comprehend critical thinking, but as far as that goes I think everyone should make up their own mind if they want to take a fake farmer posting on the internet seriously.

                         <p>
                          Sorry pipsqueak, you dont have science on your side.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I feel sorry for your children having to grow up in a dysfunctional environment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Yeah. I imagine your investment portfolio largely consists of AstroGlide and Cheetos.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Its looking like rational thought is beyond you.
                          <br/>
                          Got any chemtrail stories?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Why dont you just admit you have no subject matter expertise and that you are talking out your backside?
                         </p>
                         <p>

                          You should probably stick to posting about hair dye and anal bleaching, you know, the stuff you actually do for a living. Leave the science to the people who actually farm for a living.

                          The point, Rob, is that NEITHER ONE OF THEM causes autism.  However you present it, it shows correlation and not causation.  Lets replace it with electric cars or cell phone or the rise of Chipotle.

                          Phony?  That is a real chart showing real statistics.  What it also illustrates is that you can show a correlation between many things and it doesnt say a single thing about whether there is any causal relationship.  I could show that The rise in smartphone use correlated to the rise in autism diagnoses.  Does that mean they are related?

                      How about you try some common sense? I dont care what report you want to quote, eating glyphosate is not healthy. Ill stand by that and state it will eventually be realized. Please feel free to eat as much of it as you like. You can take your data and USDA report and eat those too.  I just want to know where it is and avoid it. Free choice.

                          Your junk science agenda is pretty transparent as it the FACT that you are not debating science and it is disingenuous to claim that you are. You are using science, selectively, to promote a political agenda.

                      Not everyone agrees with this perception of glyphosates safety. The first Roundup resistant GMO crops, soybeans, were introduced by Monsanto in 1996. The same year, the first glyphosate resistant weeds began to emerge. Farmers responded by using increasingly toxic herbicides to deal with the new super weeds that had developed glyphosate resistance.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In addition to the concern about the emergence of super weeds, a study in rats demonstrated that low levels of glyphosate induced severe hormone-dependent mammary, hepatic, and kidney disturbances. Recently two activist groups, Moms Across America and Thinking Moms Revolution, asked the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to recall Monsantos Roundup, citing a host of adverse health impacts in their children from the herbicide, including failure to thrive, leaky gut syndrome, autism and food allergies.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Glyphosate is no ordinary herbicide. Besides being the most used herbicide on earth, it is also the central pillar of Monsantos temple. Most of Monsantos seeds, including soy, corn, canola, alfalfa, cotton, sugar beets and sorghum, are glyphosate resistant. As of 2009, Monsantos Roundup (glyphosate) products, which include its GMO seeds, represented about half of Monsantos yearly revenue. This reliance on glyphosate products makes Monsanto extremely vulnerable to research challenging the herbicides safety.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Glyphosate-resistant seeds are engineered to allow the farmer to drench his fields in the herbicide to kill off all of the weeds. The glyphosate resistant crop can then be harvested. But if the combination of glyphosate and the heavy metals found in the groundwater or the soil destroys the farmers kidneys in the process, the whole house of cards falls apart. This may be what is happening now.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      An ugly confrontation has been unfolding in El Salvador. The US government has been pressuring El Salvador to buy GMO seeds from Monsanto rather than indigenous seeds from their own farmers. The US has threatened to withhold almost $300 million in aid unless El Salvador purchases Monsantos GMO seeds. The GMO seeds are more expensive. They are not adapted to the Salvadoran climate or soil.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The only advantage of Monsantos GMO seeds is their glyphosate resistance. Now that glyphosate has been shown to be a possible, and perhaps likely, cause of  Chronic Kidney Disease, or CKDu, that advantage no longer exists
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What is the message from the United States to El Salvador exactly? Perhaps the kindest explanation is that the United States is unaware that glyphosate may be the cause of the fatal kidney disease epidemic in El Salvador and that the government sincerely believes that the GMO seeds will provide a better yield. If so, a sad mixture of ignorance and arrogance is at the heart of this foreign policy blunder. A less kind interpretation would suggest that the government puts Monsantos profits above concerns about the economy, environment and health of the Salvadorans. This view would suggest that a tragic mix of greed and callous disregard for the Salvadorans is behind US policy.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Unfortunately, there is evidence to support the latter view. The United States seems to be completely behind Monsanto, regardless of any science questioning the safety of its products. Cables released by WikiLeaks show that US diplomats around the world are pushing GMO crops as a strategic government and commercial imperative. The cables also reveal instructions to punish any foreign countries trying to ban GMO crops.

                        Totally false: Glyphosate is applied at the rate of ~1 lb per acre or 16 ounces.

                        More importantly, glyphosate on GMO crops is applied at the START of the growing season, when the weeds are out (has to be applied to the leaves of the weeds to kill them), and this is MONTHS before harvest.

                          Nick, you are referring to PRE-HARVEST applications of glyphosate.
                          <br/>
                          This is done on a few crops, but NONE that are GMO.
                          <br/>
                          Why?
                          <br/>
                          Because glyphosate has no impact on GMO crops as they are immune to it and of course there is no value in killing weeds just before harvest.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But glyphosate IS used on some NON-GMO crops in a pre harvest application, like Wheat, Potatoes and Carrots to dry them or kill off the green portions to make harvesting more efficient.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The reason they can do it at this time is that the wheat grain, tubers etc are essentially grown, and so while the green portions dry/die, their is little movement into the food portion of the plant.
                         </p>

You Monsanto cheerleaders show up en masse, and unsuccessfully try and defend the indefensible, all the while making yourselves look foolish, while you bang the drums for a treadmill of ever increasing pesticide and herbicide usage.

                    FDA doesnt test for glyphosate in our food, they say it is too expensive to do so even though it is the most used pesticide.

                    University science departments depend on corporations for reseach grants, studies are controlled.  Monsanto and their friends have infiltratd government agencies with the likes of Michael Taylor and Vilsack. Bought Congressional representatives finish the job, Dark Act anyone?

                      Its not the FDAs job to test for glyphosate in agricultural products.  Thats the USDAs job, and they do indeed do it.  Try looking up the USDA Pesticide Data Program instead of shooting your mouth off in ignorance.

                  It is always amusing (and scary) to read pieces such as this about agriculture in which none of the experts are from Land Grant Universities or have any background in Ag-research. Heres a thought  lets convert the entire North America agriculture system to organic! Hey hasnt it worked so well for Africa!? They have been farming Orgaically since the dawn of time and millions starve each and every year. You people need to grow the Hell up and understand where food comes from and why is is so safe and abundant because of large-scale production agriculture as practiced in the US.

                      Ever hear of Norman Borlaug?  Looks FATUDA is on the right track.  If we switched to only organic we could feed 6 billion people.  (I take it you guys will be volunteering to go without?)  The massive surpluses that help keep those Africans alive in times of drought and famine sure as hell dont come from organic ag.  But they sure do allow people like you and TZ to wax idiotic about the idea that we have enough food.

                    organic farming done properly can be just as efficient as conventional, there is a 3 to 4 percent margin of error in there.  There is more than enough food on the planet for the current population.  Its a distribution problem, logistics.  The US alone wastes 40 percent of their food.  And china wastes even more on their imported food.

                      Totally dependent on your definition of waste.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      For instance that high number starts with what is left in the field.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But we cant economically harvest 100% of any crop.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That number includes all packing, shipping and distribution losses, but they are already very efficient, still vegetables are perishable, so of course there are unavoidable losses along the way.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That number includes all cooking scraps, as we prepare food to eat, but these are normal trimmings that we do, not what most people would consider waste (potato peels for example)
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That number includes all weight loss from cooking, again not what people would consider waste.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That number includes all table scraps we feed to our pets (any food not eaten by humans is considered waste)
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That number includes all plate scraping, where there is too little to save, and from all restaurant meals.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So no, we dont waste nearly as much food as you think we do, nor could we make it go down significantly
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And finally Organic farming isnt nearly as productive as conventional Ag, particularly for our big Ag crops, Corn and Wheat.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Scientists from McGill University in Montreal, Canada and the University of Minnesota looked at 66 studies that compared yields of 34 crops grown using organic and conventional methods. They found that crop yields produced using organic methods can be up to 34 percent lower  than those produced using conventional techniques.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Organic farming practices appear to be particularly inefficient for grain and vegetable crops. The researchers suggest that lower yields are the result of the types of fertilizers that organic farmers use and how they use them.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Organic yields were lower than conventional yields across the board, but the scientists found that organic methods could produce yields close to those of certain conventional crops, such as strawberries and soybeans.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is still a big yield difference but the study does suggest organic systems have the potential to produce comparable yields, but in a very limited number of crops, Sonja Vermeulen, of the Copenhagen-based Consultative Group On International Agricultural Research, told Nature.

                  The benefits of round up far out weigh the use of other more toxic herbicides include the favorite yellow one and the other one talked about in these comments.  When used correctly Round up is safe.  As far a it being used as a dryer for small grains those grain are not to be used for human food only animal feed.  Meaning Round up does not reach the human food chain in such foods.   Our grandfathers use chemical that were much more harmful for the environment and their families, compared to what we use today.  Also the agricultural user of these chemical are trained and have to keep records on the application of these chemical where as the round up and other chemicals used by Joe public to maintain their lawn and or gardens/property dont have to be trained, keep records and account for every drop applied.  Think about that and then think why food is cheaper to buy here compared to overseas.  The American Farmer feeds more people per acre than any other area in the world.

                        Oh brother, most pro-GMOers know that and admit it, you really havent done any research have you. Here is another shock for you, glyphosate is now in the rain and even ground water! Do you need a skewed biotech funded peer reviewed study for that as well?

                          LOL!  Im not surprised you wouldnt admit it, even though you admitted it before. For everyone else, think about this, the EPA allows an acceptable limit of glyphosate residue on our food, which means we are eating it. Unfortunately not all harmful toxins are filtered out through our body, some is absorbed into the blood stream and doing who knows what kind of damage. You dont need skewed biotech studies to tell you that, just basic anatomy and physiology.

                          What levels of glyphosate do you think actually exist in food?  You could look up the USDA PDP to find out, but I doubt you will, since its easier for you to just make stuff up.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There are also plenty of studies about how glyphosate is metabolized.  But again, I doubt you will bother to read them since they would disrupt your faith-based beliefs.

                      So many reports of how your Bosses poison is killing people
                      <br/>
                      Like the cigarette companies, Monsanto continues to defend Roundup  (Glyphosate) as safe to use, but accumulating scientific evidence shows  it could be among the most dangerous products on earth.
                      <br/>
                      The  worlds top selling herbicide is now implicated in a series of epidemics of fatal chronic kidney disease thats affecting poor farming regions  across the world, according to research published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
                      <br/>
                      In Sri Lanka, 15% of the population is affected   400,000 patients and  20,000 deaths. Therefore, the president ordered that glyphosate be  banned a couple of weeks ago.
                      <br/>
                      An  investigation carried out by medical specialists and scientists reveals  that kidney disease is mainly caused by Glysophate. President Mahinda  Rajapaksa ordered the immediate removal of Glyphosate from the local  market soon after he heard of the contents of the report, S.M.  Chandrasena, Deputy Minister of Economic Development told reporters. He  said the 25,000 people currently fighting the disease would be assisted  with funds for  medical expenses and clean drinking water.
                      <br/>
                      The paper, Glyphosate, Hard Water and Nephrotoxic Metals: Are They the Culprits Behind the  Epidemic of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology in Sri Lanka?, suggests that a combination of  glyphosate in areas where there are heavy metals in the drinking water can lead to the disease.
                      <br/>
                      Glyphosate acts as a carrier or a vector of these heavy metals to the kidney,  explains Dr. Channa Jayasumana, the studys principal author.
                      <br/>
                      Metals like arsenic and cadmium can be present naturally in the soil or added  by spreading fertilizer. Heavy metals, glyphosate and other herbicides  have been found in urine samples of kidney patients, according to health officials there.
                      <br/>
                      This mysterious form of kidney disease has been  killing tens of thousands of agricultural workers in Central America,  Sri Lanka and India. Although it is completely treatable in wealthier  countries, more people have died from it in El Salvador and Nicaragua  than from diabetes, AIDS and leukemia combined over the last five years, reports Center for Public Integrity.
                      <br/>
                      El Salvador also passed  legislation to ban dozens of agrochemicals including glyphosate last  year, but it has yet to be signed into law.
                      <br/>

                      Brazil, Chile Move Against Monsanto
                      <br/>
                      Action against glyphosate is also underway in Brazil, where the  Federal  Public Prosecutor is calling on the Justice Department to ban  it. Other GMO herbicides are also targets: 2,4-D and active ingredients methyl parathion, lactofem, phorate, carbofuran, abamectin, tiram and paraquat, according to GMWatch.
                      <br/>
                      Legal actions have been filed to compel Brazils National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to reevaluate the toxicity of those active  ingredients. The prosecutor wants the products banned until a final  conclusion is reached.
                      <br/>
                      The previous week, Brazils Federal Appeals Court unanimously ruled to cancel cultivation of Bayers Liberty Link GM Maize.

                          The research study conducted by Dr. Channa Jayasumana of the Rajarata University found that while the weedicide itself is not nephrotoxic, when it combines with hard ground water containing metals such as cadmium and arsenic, either naturally present in the soil or added through fertilizer, glyphosate becomes extremely toxic to the kidney.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          However, since then the validity of Dr. Jayasumanas research had come under question as the manufacturer Monsanto and other agrochemical producers have raised objections to the findings saying that there is no evidence to suggest the conclusion that glyphosate is responsible for CKDu.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          A European glyphosate task force also has concluded that there is no true link to the kidney disease.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          GM Watch comment: As for the European glyphosate task force mentioned in the article, which has concluded that there is no true link between glyphosate herbicide and chronic kidney disease, lets hope the Sri Lankan government recognises that this task force is entirely made up of the pesticide companies that make and sell glyphosate herbicide!

                          Loren, I think you just proved our point. Youre financially dependent on these biotechs. Why wouldnt you defend and support them? And how could you possibly criticise anyone for calling you a pro-biotech shill and troll?

                          No, from what Ive read of Lorens posts. He is employable in many areas of industry. Not dependent. Probably is smart enough to have emergency savings and a small business on the side. Worst things I have learned about him is that he has bad taste in football teams, and he may be to old to run my farm. I may need a manager or partner soon. Should I talk to him about this. After all he is certainly more qualified than rob,

                          jr, it is common knowledge that ground water containing metals such as cadmium and arsenic cause kidney failure without glyphosate residues in the water.

                      Yea I would say we can play the shill card when we are talking to people whose mission is life is to nullify and dismiss any scientific article that comes to a negative conclusion about GMOs but glorifies any article that says there are no problems associated with them. Its not like there isnt enormous evidence of the negatives, but you GMO cheer-leading trolls spend about all day every day doing the same thing that Right Wing Think Tanks, PR companies and marketing experts do. But you guys claim to do it all for free. Thats hilarious as Arthur would say. Its also kinda sad how much those professionals get for doing it, but youre doing it just because your missions in life just happens to be trying to save the world with Monsantos seed patents!

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Yeah. I imagine your investment portfolio largely consists of AstroGlide and Cheetos.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Its looking like rational thought is beyond you.

                         <p>
                          Got any chemtrail stories?

                         <p>
                          Why dont you just admit you have no subject matter expertise and that you are talking out your backside?
                         </p>
                         <p>

                         <p>
                          Time for you to try a little rub and tug on old Ronnie.

                         <p>

                          Im not a conservative, dumbass. I call out all fukktards for stupidity. And youre one of them.

                         <p>

                         <p>

                         <p>

                          You should probably stick to posting about hair dye and anal bleaching, you know, the stuff you actually do for a living. Leave the science to the people who actually farm for a living.

                          Now why would I bother doing that? By definition of you GMO crusaders, any research that that is anti GMO is automatically flawed and any article that is pro GMO is flawless. You can pick apart any research article just like Ken Ham argues against evolution. Its not hard, its a skill that any Freshman Criminal Justice major has developed by the end of their first debate class. Your agenda is very obvious, considering the amount of time you spend trying to convince the masses without Monsanto and the biotech industries seed patents, were all going to starve. Do you think  the research that is behind this article is funded by some competing corporation?

                          You can pick apart any research article..  You really are an amateur.  If the research is designed properly and the data supports the conclusions, NO ONE can pick it apart.  Or do you just not have any data to support your position?

                          Do you think we believe that GMO crusading trolls like you are qualified to debunk any of the numerous studies that have come out exposing the dangers of GMOs? I believe  youre a little delusional if you think you can insult our intelligence like that. Just like I repeatedly say, you seem to claim that your arguments are rock solid and anything that defies them is flawed. Most of you claim to be farmers and pretend you have the knowledge of Ph.D.s in biotechnology. You GMO crusaders have demonstrated time after time you dont come to these comment boards to be objective about anything, you come exclusively for one reason- to glorify your pesticides and GMOs and then sling insults like a chimp slings feces toward anyone that doesnt believe your spin. Your agenda is obviously to do PR for the Biotech industry! You all act like youre all busy farmers and then spend more time on Disqus being  trolls than my daughter spends on Facebook. Pretty sad if I do say so myself!

                          Easy, Because he has told the truth. Truth is an absolute defense against you accusations. Also he may be involved in medical research, not ASg. You know having to do with products like g.e. insulin that has helped diabetics for decades

                          Apparently you are considering you just said you can debunk anything. All youre saying is that you can twist anything around to suit your rock solid spin. Its not hard at all I see people like you do it every day. Do you think youre influencing anyone here that isnt already a GMO cheerleader? Yourre just a self righteous troll that would be more appreciated on corporate front group websites like The Genetic Literacy Project. All youre doing here is demonstrating your arrogance. But keep it up if it makes you feel better about yourself!

                          Alright, this time Ill type slower.  Send me a link to a study you think is solid.  Ill read it.  And not only will I critique it myself, I see if I can find others opinions as well.  I certainly never said I could debunk anything I havent read.  Are you being purposely obtuse?

                          Sorry, I really dont have a favourite research article that I could really care less about what a pesticide &amp; GMO crusader like you has to say about it. I have read numerous articles that have come from environmental and consumer protection organizations like the National Resource Defense Council, The Organic Consumers Association, The Pesticide Action Network, The Cornucopia Institute and the Environmental Working Group to name a few. They arent funded by corporations and arent serving special interests. They are funded by grass roots movements and donations.

                          Now its starting to make sense.  A veritable clown car of bad/no science organizations.  You can criticize industry all you want, but organizations that operate on donations require the presence of a bogeyman.  And thats where you get the drivel emanating from those groups.  They scare you, you send money.  Great scam.but hey its your wallet.  Articles and opinion pieces are not peer-reviewed science, no matter how much they stroke your sensibilities.

                          I would guess the way my likes are increasing exponentially and the only ones that you corporate crusading trolls are getting are by each other, that youre not going to convert a lot of people to your corporate funded ideology by dismissing those organizations as a clown car.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Those environmental &amp; consumer protection organizations educate people and they do use science, not just make things up like you imply they do. They expose corporate influence in the government by exposing where industry cronys came from and what they have done since they were placed their (usually regulatory) positions.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          They expose how industry makes up its own science and promotes it with PR companies, front groups and marketing campaigns (like you yourself and the other GMO cheerleaders swear you do it for free).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Those environmental &amp; consumer protection organizations explain and give examples of how your beloved corporations try  to pretend things like Climate Change, Ocean Acidification, the Dead Zones in the oceans are all just hysterical liberals making up anything to cut into their profits. Those organizations also talk about solutions that might cut into your favourite corporations profits. They talk about advances in clean energy, health and pollution, contamination of our drinking water and how politicians that come from industry raise the levels of acceptable contaminants like lead,heavy metals and arsenic in our drinking water instead of holding the offending corporations accountable.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          They talk about daily exposure to Endocrine Disruptors like BPA, Dioxins, Atrazine, Pthalates and  Perchlorate and how lobbyists like the American Chemical Council (ACC) fight to prevent them from being taken off the market with their bogus science. So please spare us your industry funded agenda. We see it every day from you and your ilk.

                        Interesting that these guys claim to be farmers, yet respond almost immediately to any anti-GMO post, any time of day, any day an article is posted.  Apparently their farms are fallow, as are their robo-comments like show us the studies showing the harm, which if you waste time posting theyll always counter that the study was discredited.  They know perfectly well the studies, as well as the fact that theyre legit.  If you mention the numerous health professionals who have successfully treated thousands by removing GMOs from their diets, their answer is that it is internet hocum.  Yes, there is a mass conspiracy to vilify the consumption of foreign proteins and chemicals via GMO crops  for what reason?  These farmers with all this time on their hands are getting paid by biotech companies like Monsanto.  What exactly do the scientists and doctors whove been alerting the public stand to gain besides a lot of nasty blowback?  Besides, the farmers underestimate the intelligence of the people who question GMO safety.  Many of us can read and understand the information and/or have personally recovered from health problems by eliminating GMO foods.

                  JoeFarmer perhaps you should look up the causes of Parkinsons Disease.  There absolutely is evidence, they just cant isolate the chemical because so many are used.  And if those chemicals can cause Parkinsons, they most definately can cause autism.

                    There absolutely is evidence, they just cant isolate the chemical because so many are used.  Wow, the second half of your sentence completely contradicts the first half.  And which chemicals causes Parkinsons before Round-Up came along?

                   <p>
                    And if those chemicals can cause Parkinsons, they most definately can cause autism.  Do you have proof for this, or is this from your expert biochemical opinion.

                       <p>
                        For pregnant mothers, there was a strong correlation between proximity to agricultural fields where certain pesticides were being sprayed and the likelihood that their children would eventually be diagnosed with autism.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In total, about one third of the addresses were within 1.5 km (.93 miles) of an agricultural field where one of four different types of pesticideswere sprayed during pregnancy. One class ofpesticides called organophosphates seemed to be especially important: mothers who lived within 1.5 km of fields where they were sprayed had a 54 percent increased chance of having a child diagnosed with autism.

                       <p>
                        But the time these pesticides were sprayed during pregnancy seemed to be especially important. If the sprayings occurred during the second trimester of pregnancy, there was an 85 percent increased risk. If it occurred during the third trimester, there was a 107 percent increased risk.

                       <p>
                        Additionally, there was a link between the total amount of pesticides sprayed and the risk of autism. For every additional 100 pounds of chloropryifos  a type of organophosphate pesticide most often applied to fields of cotton, corn, nuts, and fruit trees  sprayed within a mile of the parents homes during the course of a pregnancy, there was a 14 percent higher chance of having a child diagnosed with autism.

                        Use of GMOs reduces the use of Organophosphate Insecticides.

                          Well to start with, there is not nearly enough available manure for ~370 million acres of cropland, and the fact is most of the manure that is used in Organic farming comes from non-organic livestock operations and they are largely fed on GMO crops.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Secondly, this is NOT an issue with GMO.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These crops being sprayed are conventional VEGETABLES not GMO Corn, Soy or Canola.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Third, the yields per acre (and cost per acre) for Organic is such that a total switch (even ignoring the lack of manure problem) would drive up food costs to an unacceptable level.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Scientists from McGill University in Montreal, Canada and the University of Minnesota looked at 66 studies that compared yields of 34 crops grown using organic and conventional methods. They found that crop yields produced using organic methods can be up to 34 percent lower  than those produced using conventional techniques. Organic farming practices appear to be particularly inefficient for grain and vegetable crops. The researchers suggest that lower yields are the result of the types of fertilizers that organic farmers use and how they use them. There is still a big yield difference but the study does suggest organic systems have the potential to produce comparable yields, but only in a very limited number of crops, Sonja Vermeulen, of the Copenhagen-based Consultative Group On International Agricultural Research, told Nature.

                          So basically what Im coming to understand is under normal circumstances, the earth is not meant to have this many crops growing in one area.  Large ag and farming needs to be cut down to more individualized specific destinations.   We are forcing nature to do what we want them to do.  So it could be possible that even having a large area of farmland is unnecessary and monopolized in a way.

                          For suburban dwellers, the average lot size is ~1/2 acre, with probably less than half of that available for a garden, or 1/4 acre.  BUT shading from trees effectively makes most suburban yards unfavorable for any but the most modest of gardens.

Smaller farms actually lost money farming and earned 109 percent of their household income from off-farm sources.

                          but having people farm their own food in their backyard is an option.  This would cut down on a lot of pressure towards the farmers.

                          Have you ever read where I suggested people not have a garden?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          No you havent.

                         <p>
                          I have a large garden along with a mini-orchard and I have separate beds of berries, asparagus and herbs.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But that also makes me realistic about how much the typical person can provide for themselves. On a percent basis most wont be able to do that much, and only for about half of the year.

                          Consider in the US:
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          US Total Acres 2011 = 843,866,715
                          <br/>
                          That acreage includes ~470 million acres of pasture and range land.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          For just cropland
                          <br/>
                          US total Acres = 370,653,755
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But Field Crops (field corn, Soy, Wheat, Oats etc), which are not crops that home gardeners can grow was 326,786,000 acres of that crop land.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Fruit trees, Citrus and Tree Nuts accounted for 4 million acres.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In fact when you take out all the crops that home gardeners are not likely to grow (peanuts, cotton, sugarbeets etc) what is left is ~30 million acres.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Or less than 4% of our crop land.

                          There is approximately 90 millions acres of corn each year.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The average corn yield in 2014 for the US was 165 bpa.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The corn plant needs 1lb of N to produce 1 bushel of corn.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You would need 14,850,000,000 lbs of N to grow the 2014 corn crop .
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There is not enough manure in the US to meet that N demand.

                          So why dont we just teach people to grow their own food instead of modifying things. If its not broke why fix it?  What was wrong with the food before we modified it?  Why did we start feeding our own people who arent starving this modified food?

                          Nitrogen used for corn is usually NH3, Urea, 28/32 % solution, and/or any manure applied.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Grower may use multiply forms of N during the growing season.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          For example in my part of the world a farmer may apply NH3 in the fall with a N stabilizer and use 28/32 solution in the spring when applying their pre-emerge herbicide. It some cases an additional pass with a side dress does happen.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          N applied to each corn crop is based on the corn yield goal, carry over N, weather conditions, N sources available, and economic return.

                    You can not convince the purveyors of eco-hysteria with facts-they take discredited studies and keep posting them over and over on every website they can find,and on all of their enviro-whacko forums-and even though the studies they cite have been discredited multiple times-they still believe them to be true.
                    <br/>
                    Just like the idiots who claimed their water wells were polluted with methane from fracking in Dimock Pa-when the fact is their wells are drilled into coal seams/coal beds,and methane has been migrating into water wells in the township for decades before the first well was fracked-but noooo-its the evil oil companies fault.
                    <br/>
                    They only believe in science when it supports their extremist viewpoints.

                  It looks like youve hit a nerve with this piece.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Look at all the GMO pesticide industry disinformation operatives dispatched here to try and talk away the sordid truth about the latest poisonous chemical to be added to the already poisonous pesticide laden GMOs currently being purposely hidden in the food we are feeding our families.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So far I count 9 disinformation goons here already.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Readers should hang on to their wallets and their health with these sleazy operatives spinning lies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Congratulations on the good piece.

                      Anyone who would use a link to the bogus GMO pesticide industry disinformation biofortified through a website named starvinlarry and accuse me of not posting facts is obviously not here to talk about science.

                     <p>
                      Only a fool would believe anything from this industry controlled disinformation site. Biofortified contains only GMO pesticide industry talking points, disinformation, lies, and cherry picked agenda driven junk pseudo-science that only recognizes science that supports their corrupt agenda.

                          LOL, I saw all those comments you made with my own eyes so I know my claims of you calling several people a dumbass are true. It looks like Cletus posted several of your ridiculous comments, maybe he even took screen shots. Are you sure you really want those claims supported? LOL

                          You have seen it all before but it doesnt support your agenda so you wont admit it. Fortunately everyone else is able to do their own research and when they do they can look through all these comments and see that fake farmers cant be trusted to tell the truth.

                          Why wouldnt we be concerned about the increased use of glyphosate? Certainly you realize there are numerous studies suggesting adverse impact to NTOs at environmentally relevant levels which correspond with agricultural use, right? Denying that only makes you an anti-science flatearther. LOL!

                          When I asked you why we should be concerned about pounds of glyphosate applied to farm land, you are the one that made the claim that glyphosate was harmful to NTOs, right?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You provided links to obscure studies that exposed various forms of aquatic life to glyphosate concentrations that have nothing to do with glyphosate concentrations found in U.S. waterways.

                         <p>
                          You attempted to obfuscate with some kind of babble about the fishes in the studies not being found in the U.S., but that doesnt mean a thing.

                          Funny how you posted here instead of where anyone can scroll up a little and see I clearly supported my claim.  You have no argument so all you can do is make false accusations.

                         <p>

                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Why wouldnt we be concerned about the increased use of glyphosate? Certainly you realize there are numerous studies suggesting adverse impact to NTOs at environmentally relevant levels which correspond with agricultural use, right?

                         <p>
                          This is perfectly supported by the studies I posted and you are making false accusations and strawman arguments as usual.  Ill expose you one last time just to show everyone that you are a complete moron.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So we are looking for, adverse impact to NTOs at environmentally relevant levels and everyone can see I clearly supported my claim.  Lets look at my response to you :
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Moreover, it was demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of Roundup can pose a health risk for fish populations.

                          Fishes were exposed to herbicide at a dose of 4 mgl-1 generally used by farmers to control weedsSevere damage, shrinkage and degeneration of pentagonal cellular contour of stratified epithelial cells (SEC) were observed in gill. Shrinkage of SEC resulting in degeneration of microridges was observed in buccopharynx. Slight necrosed and distorted SEC was observed in oesophagus. Severe mucus secretion was observed in stomach. Erosion on the apical surface of mucosal folds and columnar epithelial cells (CEC) and necrosis of CEC was also noticed in stomach.

                          These results indicate that AChE-a neurotoxicity biomarker-in C. decemmaculatus may be affected by exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of glyphosate.

                          The objective of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup to blood and liver cells in the Neotropical fish Corydoras paleatus  (Jenyns 1842) following short term exposure (3, 6, and 9 days) to an environmentally realistic concentration of the herbicide (6.67 ug/L Roundup).We conclude that for the low concentration used in this research, the herbicide shows potential genotoxic effects.

                          I can give you a hundred more without really even trying, but that would just be a huge waste of time on an anti-science flatearther.  If you really want more just go to the NTO section here.

                          Please feel free to recap as you see fit, just in case Ive missed something.

                          As far as I can tell, youre just repeating your previous links.  4 mg/l exposure has absolutely nothing to do with actual glyphosate concentrations in U.S. waterways.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          4 mg/l is 4,000 ug/l. USGS survey data indicates actual glyphosate level in U.S. waterways at less than 10 ug/l.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I asked before, and will ask again:  How does an obscure study exposing aquatic life to glyphosate levels 400 times greater than is found in U.S. waterways in any way useful?

                          Why do you feel the need to change the subject to U.S. waterways when I never mentioned U.S. waterways at any point in my statement?  Oh wait, it is because you need to create a strawman.  LOL!
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          These fish are not present in the U.S. streams where you seem to have got your U.S. water data of less than 10ug/L from, but of course you are too stupid to realize that water data often doesnt include sediment data which can be a great deal higher including over 1 mg/L.  You do realize that fish are exposed to sediment, right?  Oh wait, I forgot you are an idiot.  It doesnt matter anyway because the species I mentioned arent even native to U.S. waters, but you were too stupid to realize that so you referenced stream data from U.S. waterways making yourself look like a complete idiot!  LOL!  You look even stupider by focusing on the 4ppm stat instead of other studies mentioned which used 6.67 ug/L Roundup(which is only 41% glyphosate so that dose is more like less than 3ug/L glyphosate and far lower than your less than 10 ug/L stat)!

                          Yeah. I imagine your investment portfolio largely consists of AstroGlide and Cheetos.

                          what exactly are the criteria you use for determining which science is pseudo or corrupt. You cant say that its because they corroborate industry because thats equivalent to saying because they disagree with me. That would just prove your glaring confirmation bias.

                          Any real scientist would tell you that there are no sides in real science. Science isnt about an us or them, real science builds on itself in an open way to unlock new knowledge. Science accepts new knowledge even when it conflicts with previous assumptions

                          Pseudo-science is agenda driven corporate science whos mission is to pursue the corporate agenda. Junk science as pseudo-science is often rightfully called is focused on a narrow agenda and rejects any real science that exposes that agendas weaknesses.

                          Wrong again Cletus, I am demonstrating relative safety of a technology and citing sources that will allow lurkers to learn in spite of folks such as yourself. Am no longer interested in politics. So, no agenda there. And I am well aware that I am not debating with you. You do not want to learn. Just making sure that you will always have an opponent to counteract your errors and troll accusations.

                          Cletus, Those cases are anecdotal and recovery could well have been to other factors. Especially as I Is actually difficult to eat a diet roundup laden gmos from their diet. Heres the facts. Farmers do not use more than label rates as that is a waste of money. Most g.e. crops go into anima feed or biofuels. There are only a few fruits and veggies that are g.e. on the market. Papayas are the only one that I know of that has a large percentage of the market share. So most of the g.e food you could eat comes from eating so-called junk foods. Might a person get better just by not eating as many corn chips? Also relative safety refers to the fact that g.e. foods are as safe other producing methods.

                  I am no expert, just a regular guy here.I am lucky enough to have a nice house with a big garden where I grow all my family vegetables.   We Freeze and also do canning for winter use.   I am not against Monsanto, Dow or DuPont but what they are doing makes me worried.     We at least know what these three companies are doing, but what is happening in other part of the world? and will that eventually affect us all as well?   While in the USA we can debate, argue, talk, present for and against views, in countries like China, India, Pakistan, and many others this is not the case.    Can the USA alone make a difference the chemically altered food chain?

                    Charles, you most likely dont grow the big Ag crops that Monanto and Dow sell.

                    That would be field corn, soybeans, sorghum and cotton.

                  There are two main GE crops.One is BT toxin which is an unnatural form of a naturally occurring bacteria which is far more toxic than its natural counterpart, this unnatural bacterium has been genetically engineered into the seed, so this toxin is then expressed in every cell of the plant, so then our corn for example becomes a registered pesticide with the EPAyummy.then there are Roundup Ready crops that have been genetically engineered to withstand heavy doses of Roundup without dying, so mothers get to feed their babies Glyphosate ridden breast milk and the rest of us get to process it though our kidneys and out in our urine..Not to mention the active retro virus called the cauliflower mosaic virus that is used to turn the desired trait on and then the antibiotic marker used to ascertain if the desired trait is being expressed antibiotic resistance anyone? There were never any independent, long-term, minimum of 3 mammalian species, preferably multi-generational studies done to deduce toxicology in human beings concerning the consumption of GMOs. its criminal that they were allowed into our food supply.PERIOD!

                          OMG, Just because you have a PhD doesnt mean ANYTHING.  You can get experts to say anything you want, especially if you pay them enough.  LOOK AROUND..  people are getting sicker and sicker.  What we are doing is not working!  Things have to change, and we need to go back to working WITH nature and not trying to get her to bend to our will.  It will never work.  Just because we can do it, doesnt mean we should.

                          Yes, people may be living longer and longer, but they are still sick.  Go stand in line at Walgreens and look at all the prescriptions people have to buy to stay alive.  No one is buying MY BS?  I happen to know quite a few people who think exactly like me, and we all KNOW that you are being paid in your retirement to spread this BS.  So no Arthur, I will never give it a rest, because my job is to spread the truth.

                          They list the REASONS for this and they dont support your argument that Americans arent as healthy, because it is simply looking at why our Life Expectancy isnt as high as other countries.

                          1.Adverse birth outcomes: For decades, the United States has experienced
                          <br/>
                          the highest infant mortality rate of high-income countries and also ranks poorly on other birth outcomes, such as low birth weight. ==&gt; Due primarily to very YOUNG MOTHERS

                         <p>
                          2. Injuries and homicides: Deaths from motor vehicle crashes, nontransportation-related injuries, and violence occur at much higher
                          <br/>
                          rates in the United States than in other countries and are a leading
                          <br/>
                          cause of death in children, adolescents, and young adults. Since the
                          <br/>
                          1950s, U.S. adolescents and young adults have died at higher rates
                          <br/>
                          from traffic accidents and homicide than their counterparts in other
                          <br/>
                          countries.

                         <p>
                          3. Adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections: Since
                          <br/>
                          the 1990s, among high-income countries, U.S. adolescents have
                          <br/>
                          had the highest rate of pregnancies and are more likely to acquire

                         <p>
                          4. HIV and AIDS: The United States has the second highest prevalence
                          <br/>
                          of HIV infection among the 17 peer countries and the highest

                          5. Drug-related mortality: Americans lose more years of life to alcohol
                          <br/>
                          and other drugs than people in peer countries, even when deaths

                          from drunk driving are excluded.

                         <p>
                          6. Obesity and diabetes: For decades, the United States has had the
                          <br/>
                          highest obesity rate among high-income countries. High prevalence
                          <br/>
                          rates for obesity are seen in U.S. children and in every age group
                          <br/>
                          thereafter. From age 20 onward, U.S. adults have among the highest
                          <br/>
                          prevalence rates of diabetes (and high plasma glucose levels)
                          <br/>
                          among peer countries.

                         <p>
                          7. Heart disease: The U.S. death rate from ischemic heart disease is
                          <br/>
                          the second highest among the 17 peer countries. Americans reach
                          <br/>
                          age 50 with a less favorable cardiovascular risk profile than their
                          <br/>
                          peers in Europe, and adults over age 50 are more likely to develop
                          <br/>
                          and die from cardiovascular disease than are older adults in other
                          <br/>
                          high-income countries. ==&gt; Primarily from SMOKING and OBESITY
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          8. Chronic lung disease: Lung disease is more prevalent and associated
                          <br/>
                          with higher mortality in the United States than in the United
                          <br/>
                          Kingdom and other European countries. ==&gt; Primarily from SMOKING and SMOG
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The first half of the above list occurs disproportionately among young
                          <br/>
                          Americans. Deaths that occur before age 50 are responsible for about two thirds of the difference in life expectancy between males in the United States
                          <br/>
                          and peer countries, and about one-third of the difference for females.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In contrast though, the United States has higher survival after age 75 than do
                          <br/>
                          peer countries, and it has higher rates of cancer screening and survival, better

                          If you actually believe that study and agree that people in the US  die sooner and experience higher rates of disease and injury than people in other high-income countries, you still say we are living longer and healthier lives? And those people from the other high-income countries are just living extra long and extra healthier lives in comparison to  the US citizens living longer and healthier lives? But get one point straight, you are acknowledging that study as a fact, right?

                         <p>
                          Then you can compare our life expectancy to say the UK

                         <p>
                          2012	Both = 80.9, Men =79.0, Women = 82.7
                          <br/>
                          So for US vs UK
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          2012	80.9	vs 78.8	= 2.1 years for Both, = 2.6 years for men,  1.5 years for Women

                         <p>
                          From the report, deaths that occur before age 50 are responsible for about two thirds of the difference in life expectancy between males in the United States and peer countries, and about one-third of the difference for females.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So the Actual difference in Life Expectancy, after 50 is ~.86 of a year for men and ~.5 a year for women.
                         </p>
                         <p>

                          Look at these rate increases of  diabetics with Heart Disease,and stroke and then tell me the only reason that people ARE NOT living longer is because of pharmaceutical life support keeping them alive. Please dont say because this is self reported its not credible. If you have to tell me that please explain the motivation of millions of people lying about the state of their health:

                          John, those numbers are NOT adjusted for population size and age of the population, so are meaningless.

                         <p>
                          To start with there are 40 million more of us in 2011 than in 1997, but the oldest are the fastest growing age group thanks to the baby boom years.

                         <p>
                          These diseases are of course going to increase in number as the population expands by that amount and also ages.

                          The older populationpersons 65 years or oldernumbered 40.4 million in 2010 (the most recent year for which data are available). They represented 13.1% of the U.S. population, over one in every eight Americans. The number of older Americans increased by 5.4 million or 15.3% since 2000, compared to an increase of 8.7% for the under-65 population. However, the number of Americans aged 45-64  who will reach 65 over the next two decades  increased by 31% during this period.

These are PhD pseudo-scientists who reject any real science that doesnt support the corrupt GMO pesticide industry agenda. These people have sold their souls and any scientific credibility they may have had before they sold their integrity to the highest bidder for a seat in the slave galley of the GMO pesticide industry.

                      Nope not BS and it is only common sense that a toxin that is produced at the cellular level cannot be washed off does NOT degrade in sunlight as does the naturally occurring BT toxin.so again toxin laden food producing toxin or doused in it is NOT something I want to eat and should be labeled at the very least.

                        True, it cant be washed off, but Bt bacteria and spores, which contain the Bt cry proteins cant be easily washed off either.

                       <p>
                        More to the point, the toxin as you call it, is NOT toxic to humans.

                        They fed it to mice at the rate of 5,000 mg/kg with NO OBSERVABLE EFFECTS.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In MON809, cry1A(b) makes up 1.63, 0.55, and 1.23 g/g of leaf, grain, and whole plant tissue, respectively. So what we eat is the grain, which is but 0.55 g/g.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        There are 28 grams in an ounce, so say you eat a pound of corn, thats 448 grams, or 246 g or 0.246 mg per pound of corn.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Assume you weigh 70 kg and want to keep your ingestion to 1/1000th the level that mice can eat with no ill effects, or just 5 mg/kg (350 mg) then you would have to avoid eating more than 1,400 lbs of corn.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So no, it doesnt require a label, in the least.

                  Like the cigarette companies, Monsanto continues to defend Roundup  (Glyphosate) as safe to use, but accumulating scientific evidence shows  it could be among the most dangerous products on earth.
                  <br/>
                  The  worlds top selling herbicide is now implicated in a series of epidemics of fatal chronic kidney disease thats affecting poor farming regions  across the world, according to research published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
                  <br/>
                  In Sri Lanka, 15% of the population is affected   400,000 patients and  20,000 deaths. Therefore, the president ordered that glyphosate be  banned a couple of weeks ago.
                  <br/>
                  An  investigation carried out by medical specialists and scientists reveals  that kidney disease is mainly caused by Glysophate. President Mahinda  Rajapaksa ordered the immediate removal of Glyphosate from the local  market soon after he heard of the contents of the report, S.M.  Chandrasena, Deputy Minister of Economic Development told reporters. He  said the 25,000 people currently fighting the disease would be assisted  with funds for  medical expenses and clean drinking water.
                  <br/>
                  The paper, Glyphosate, Hard Water and Nephrotoxic Metals: Are They the Culprits Behind the  Epidemic of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology in Sri Lanka?, suggests that a combination of  glyphosate in areas where there are heavy metals in the drinking water can lead to the disease.
                  <br/>
                  Glyphosate acts as a carrier or a vector of these heavy metals to the kidney,  explains Dr. Channa Jayasumana, the studys principal author.
                  <br/>
                  Metals like arsenic and cadmium can be present naturally in the soil or added  by spreading fertilizer. Heavy metals, glyphosate and other herbicides  have been found in urine samples of kidney patients, according to health officials there.
                  <br/>
                  This mysterious form of kidney disease has been  killing tens of thousands of agricultural workers in Central America,  Sri Lanka and India. Although it is completely treatable in wealthier  countries, more people have died from it in El Salvador and Nicaragua  than from diabetes, AIDS and leukemia combined over the last five years, reports Center for Public Integrity.
                  <br/>
                  El Salvador also passed  legislation to ban dozens of agrochemicals including glyphosate last  year, but it has yet to be signed into law.

                  Brazil, Chile Move Against Monsanto
                  <br/>
                  Action against glyphosate is also underway in Brazil, where the  Federal  Public Prosecutor is calling on the Justice Department to ban  it. Other GMO herbicides are also targets: 2,4-D and active ingredients methyl parathion, lactofem, phorate, carbofuran, abamectin, tiram and paraquat, according to GMWatch.
                  <br/>
                  Legal actions have been filed to compel Brazils National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) to reevaluate the toxicity of those active  ingredients. The prosecutor wants the products banned until a final  conclusion is reached.
                  <br/>
                  The previous week, Brazils Federal Appeals Court unanimously ruled to cancel cultivation of Bayers Liberty Link GM Maize.

                          Dow, Bayer, Monsanto, Syngenta being just some of the huge sellers of the big Ag crop seeds (Corn, Soy, Wheat, Cotton) but then just in the US you have Burpee, Territorial, Johnnys.

                          The U.S. Department of Agricultures final tally of the 2014 crop year is showing farmers brought in record corn and soybean crops.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The agency says in reports released Monday that farmers harvested a record 14.2 billion bushels of corn. That is 3 percent more than the 2013 crop, which had set the previous record. The average bushel-per-acre yield is 171, significantly better than the 158 bushels per acre in 2013.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The record crop came even though farmers harvested about 5 percent fewer acres than in 2013. Record yields are estimated in 21 states, including Illinois and Nebraska.

                          Have another toke Arthur.  Monsanto is and always will be a chemical company.  They sell the seeds so they can sell the herbicides and pesticides to go with it.  And do you actually think people actually believe this?  Is that why they have bee voted the most hated company for years?

                          Monsanto organizes its business into dual segments: Seeds and Genomics, and Agricultural Productivity. Today, its seeds and genomics unit (70% of sales) is the companys growth engine. The firms agricultural productivity unit, which serves both farmers and the residential market, makes herbicides under the Roundup, Harness, and other brands for lawn and garden use is but 30% of sales, with a bit over half from sales to farmers.  They ONLY make herbicides, they make no insecticides.

                          They are voted the most hated company by people who dont know anything about them.
                          <br/>
                          Farmers though buy their seed year after year after year.

                    Indian lifespan wasnt a function of lack of crops.  Im sure thats comforting to the families of those who died in the famines.  And 60 million children in India under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition RIGHT NOWso go ahead and thumb your elitist nose at modern ag, yogi.

                  Far from wiping out monarch butterflies, the GMO crop farmers in the upper midwest have been posting photos of hundreds of monarchs gathered on their farm property last September:

                    Monarchs benefited from the way farmers used to grow corn which involved more tilling.
                    <br/>
                    Tilling doesnt kill Milkweed though.
                    <br/>
                    So it and corn got along nicely.
                    <br/>
                    Not doing as well with extensive use of glyphosate, but the Monarch boom because of the tilling is an artifact.
                    <br/>
                    The species is not in danger, at least from activities in North America.
                    <br/>
                    There remains plenty of milkweed, and now people are planting it just for the Monarchs.

                  So many people are opting for organically grown vegetables that I am able to buy them from my local Fresh Market. But I have little doubt the big food corps will find a way to fake them.

                  Thank you EcoWatch, your website attracts the biggest bunch of scared little paid shills of Monsanto and others. But what is odd, why do those with farmer type aliases and their friends feel the need to try to use their Monsanto comment playbook on EcoWatch ? What would benefit these same shills except for money . EcoWatch is  powerful and is feared. Note the names of any further corporate commenters on this article and any future articles that EcoWatch regarding  this issue. They are all connected.

                      Without us there would be no food at McDonalds. Who do you think grows the corn, that the fat cattle eat, and then they are made into McDonalds hamburgers? I doubt that you contribute to that system. You do not seem to know how the food chain works. Think about that the next time you go to McDonalds.

                          I assume you then eat no meat. Because if you do then you probably ate a product that eats the corn and soybeans I help to produce.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Do you eat anything that has ingredients with soybeans or corn? If so you then consumed products that I help bring to your table.

                          Ag Boy, it wouldnt matter if nick was a Vegan who only ate organic produce because the fertilizer used in organic farming comes primarily from the manure of animals that were fed your corn and soy.

                          Dang yall are like leeches and termites.  Get into anything and everything possible to make every single penny possible.  Cant wait for you GMO, herbicide, and round up ready seeds to get shut down and put back into a lab into a small building where only a few scientists study these unknown practices that yall claim to know.

                    How bout instead of being a smug armchair coach you learn to think critically and crack a science book. Everyone who disagrees with you must be a shill right? God forbid you actually have evidence to back up your assertions and actually be able to defend it.

                    Right, there is an association to PD and those who apply herbicides and pesticides.

                    Which is why farmers are switching to GMO crops, since they reduce the amount of Insecticides used and reduce the toxicity of herbicides used.

                    As to herbicides:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This chart summarizes herbicide use on soybeans in 1996, before HT crops were widely adopted, and in 2006, after HT crops were widely adopted.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    For the column headings,
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Use = % of this pesticide compared to the total of all pesticides;
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Rate = pounds of active ingredient applied per acre of soybeans;
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Toxicity = chronic toxicity score (higher is safer);
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Half life = number of days it takes for 1/2 of the herbicide active ingredient to degrade in the soil.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    EIQ (Environmental Impact Quotient, lower is safer)  EIQ is a numerical representation of the risks a pesticide poses for the environment, consumers, and farm workers. (The EIQ for 2,4-D is an average of the EIQs for 5 different formulations of the herbicide.)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    By 2006, the majority of farmers had switched to glyphosate, the least toxic of the herbicides, with it making up 85% of herbicide use. So the total amount of herbicides is trending down and the total environmental impact due to herbicides has also decreased.

                        Susan, you need to compare toxicity of GMO pesticides vs. Conventional Pesticides.
                        <br/>
                        Organophosphate insecticides are so toxic that a teaspoon full could kill you. These are used on conventional crops to kill insects.
                        <br/>
                        Bt proteins are used in GMO crops to kill insects. Bt proteins are over 1,000 times less toxic than organophosphate insecticides.
                        <br/>
                        Also compare herbicides.
                        <br/>
                        Atrazine is 50 times more toxic than glyphosate.
                        <br/>
                        Glyphosate usage would have to increase 50 times to equal the toxicity of atrazine, and it hasnt.

                          The RESISTANCE to Atrazine might be engineered into food crops, but Atrazine was a major herbicide used on Corn before glyphosate resistant corn was developed.  The issue of toxicity is to those APPLYING it. The amount and manner it is applied (to the soil prior to planting) insures the residue levels are far below the MRL at harvest.

                      Pesticide use is increasing because of the expected resistance to the pesticide originally used, but you already knew that Arthur. Go back to studying your mutual funds, probably bought with Monsanto money.

                        No Anne, as the article says, Insecticide sales are surging after YEARS of decline, as American farmers plant MORE corn and a genetic modification designed to protect the crop from pests has STARTED to lose its effectiveness.

                       <p>
                        So surging means from almost NOTHING after YEARS of decline and because we are planting MORE corn.

                        So are you upset that we had 20 years of DECLINING USE of insecticides?

                          Arthur always tells a good story. The trouble is you cant believe a thing he says. He is a pathological liar who would rather lie than tell the truth.

                          Im beginning to believe that there arent 20 or 30 of these disinformation specialists but maybe just a couple of them that have multiple Disqus accounts. Then they use the different accounts to make it appear there are more people that are advocating and approving of these pesticides and GMOs.

                          I think there were a lot of people that just fell for a highly financed propaganda campaign that was lead by the GMA and Monsanto. But personally I hope Monsanto and the GMA dont give in. I think theyre cutting off a leg to save a toe.  Every state these campaigns go to ballot in there are tens of thousands new people learning about what GMOs actually are. Thats why the Organic movement keeps getting bigger and bigger every time an initiative goes to ballot. Its making people wake up to the garbage in their diets. If they had just went ahead and and put a tiny little label that said may contain genetically modified ingredients  in between Aspartame and azodicarbonamide prior to Prop 37 in California, no one would have even noticed.  But now  because of all of these labelling initiatives, everyone is thinking about it. I know, I know, no one believes  there is any issues with GMOs, Right? Well if that were a fact, would you be working so tirelessly spreading the gospel of Monsanto?

                          Indeed, in EVERY election your side starts out with a huge lead in the polls, showing 70 or 80+% in favor of labeling, but by the time the vote comes around, enough people have discounted your blatant lies and voted NO to labeling.

                          But how would all these shills ever earn their keep if Monsanto et al had readily agreed to labeling from the beginning? The poor things would have been jobless. Think of the shills, John, please think of the shills!!

                      Excellent post Arthur! Great demonstration of two things, #1 that none really reads your posts, considering no one even caught this and # 2 two that youre nothing but a disinformation specialist, considering 2 of  those links werent even associated with the Organic Food industry and the one that was came from a Right Wing deregulation advocate! Wholesome Soy products Inc.  that is associated with the Listeria Outbreak and Wonton Foods that is associated with the Salmonella outbreak are NOT Organic growers or retailers, so I guess those two links are arguments FOR organic, not against it. And Mischa Popof? He is crusader against the organic label and member of the Right Wing think tank the Heartland Institute- Popoff is a conservative ideologue, a global warming denier, an ardent critic of hybrid automobiles, and has suggested that the American mortgage crisis that precipitated the financial meltdown was caused by overregulation. Keep up the good work Arthur- more people need to be aware of your disinformation campaign!

                        Arthur and Popoff both work for the same network. They may have different controllers.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The network is centered around George Mason University where Rich H. Fink, VP Koch Industries is on the faculty. Jon Entine is a fellow at GMU and also the disinformation PR propagandist that runs the Genetic Literacy Project which is a well known GMO pesticide industry disinformation site. Entine also has a consulting firm  that has clients from most if not all the GMO pesticide industry companies as well as Monsanto, and the Gates Foundation as well as others, and he writes propaganda pieces and places them in the media. Entines specialty is the hit piece. We have seen many of these hit pieces designed to destroy the careers and reputations of many brave scientists and truth tellers who dared to share any information with the public that doesnt support the corrupt GMO pesticide industry agenda. The rest of the disinformation goons here take their talking points and marching orders from the same corrupt network.

                    Reducing nasty insecticides is a great result of pest resistant GMOs.

                    Note fully 40% of our Corn (about 40 million acres worth, 90% of which is GMO) and 80% of our Soybeans (over 90% GMO) goes to feed our livestock. If there were an ACTUAL issue with this feed, for the last 20 years, you wouldnt need anecdotal reports.

                    I guess that since you can call up a generic glyphosate MSDS, youre some kind of ex-spurt.

                    But since youve been working with chemicals for the last year (according to one of your recent posts), do you find anything concerning about the glyphosate MSDS you linked?

                          Depends on how you are exposed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But lets take worst case, ingestion.

                         <p>
                          In reproductive toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits, no adverse maternal or offspring effects were seen at doses below 175-293 mg/kg of body weight per day.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So lets take the lower number as being safe, or 175 mg/kg of body weight
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Lets reduce that to just 17.5 mg/kg day for an additional safety margin compared to rabbits and rats. Note that the only health effects seen at the next highest test dose (350 mg/kg) were but slightly loose stools.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          If you weigh 80 kg (176 lbs) then you could consume 1,400 mg of it per day and not even expect any slightly loose stools.

                          So they could be potentially harmful at extremely low doses.  They just dont have recognizable evidence such as slightly loose stool, no adverse maternal, or offspring effects.  What abOut acute nerve damage or organ damage based on the GMO trait mixed with organ bacterias

                          Well obviously acute nerve or organ damage would be OBSERVABLE, because observable in these trials involves blood tests and eventually microscopic tissue examination of the organs. So no, no evidence of any harm at the levels tested, and we limit our intake to not even 1/100th that level.

                          well that means you would have to extract blood and tissue to get these microscopic tissue examination.  Why cant we monitor the body as it enters and see what it does exactly?  What GMOs are being used and how do they counteract with our natural enzymes, bacteria, and cells in or body?
