       Bill Dembski and company are having  a
       <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/finnish-peer-reviewed-article-thats-pro-id/" rel="external">
        self-congratulatory session
       </a>
       about a new pro-ID paper published by Finnish researchers Matti Leisola and Ossi Turunen in
       <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d514772515583767/" rel="external">
        <em>
         Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology
        </em>
       </a>
       .  Looking at the paper, you wouldnt know that its a pro-ID paper at all because it contains not one shred of evidence in favor of ID, nor does it even try directly arguing for ID (compare this to the
       <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/08/meyers_hopeless_1.html" rel="external">
        Meyer paper
       </a>
       , which while riddled with errors, at least put forth pro-ID arguments).  On what basis could it possibly be a pro-ID paper?  If it werent for the fact that Matti Leisola is a
       <a href="http://www.genesis.nu/8thecc/" rel="external">
        creationist
       </a>
       , there would be no reason to believe it was intended as such at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, Dembski apparently thinks that its a pro-ID paper on the basis of its content, presumably because he conflates rational design methodology as used in protein engineering with ID.  Of course this is nonsense, and in reality the paper is merely a redundant review of the current state of protein engineering techniques, with
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       of the space dedicated to the very long list of successes enjoyed by evolutionary methods.  There are much better reviews out there, but nevertheless Leisola and Turunen give a decent (if too limited) overview of directed evolution experiments.  Then they proceed to argue that rational design methods will start working better once we have more detailed knowledge of the mechanism by which the primary sequence of a protein determines its structure and function.  This is an obvious and noncontroversial conclusion, so one is still left wondering how this could possibly be spun as pro-ID.  Ill say more about that in a minute, but first let me give a quick overview of the state of protein engineering as it exists today.
      </p>
     </div>
     <a id="more">
     </a>
     <div class="kw_format">
      <p>
       There are generally two ways one can go about trying to engineer a protein.  The first is to use what is commonly called rational design.  As the name implies, this simply means taking what you know about the structure and function of a protein and trying to predict which changes you need to make in order to get a desired result.  The problem with this approach is, first of all,  that you need detailed knowledge of the proteins structure and function.   Not all proteins have had their structures solved, and many of their functions are either poorly characterized or not characterized at all.  Obtaining this knowledge is an expensive and time consuming process.   And secondly, no one really knows what the exact relationship is between sequence, structure, and function.  Even if you know everything there is to know about a proteins current structure and function, it is very difficult to predict whats going to happen when you start changing things around.
      </p>
      <p>
       So protein engineers employ a second technique known as directed evolution.   Again, the name tells you essentially what the technique involves: you apply random mutagenesis to whole or part of your protein, you screen for the properties youre looking for, and you repeat the process as necessary.   In other words, you use the Darwinian mechanism, the very mechanism that ID advocates have spent the last decade fruitlessly arguing is incapable of doing the very things we see it doing in the lab.  And as it turns out, directed evolution methods are generally superior to rational design methods, so much so that a number of successful biotech companies such as
       <a href="http://www.diversa.com/" rel="external">
        Diversa
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.ame.biz/" rel="external">
        Applied Molecular Evolution
       </a>
       use directed evolution as their primary engineering tool.   (Incidentally, creationists who argue that evolution has no practical applications  paging
       <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/03/ok_egnor_its_ti.html" rel="external">
        Michael Egnor!
       </a>
        should sit down and have a talk with the officers of these companies.)  But in spite of the success of directed evolution techniques, theyre not without drawbacks.  You need a means of screening large numbers of mutants quickly (known as
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_throughput_screening" rel="external">
        high-throughput
       </a>
       ) in order to find the rose among thorns.  This means using expensive automated equipment and/or a lot of researchers.  Plus such screens often have to be developed independently for each individual protein, and lots of proteins just arent going to be easy to screen.  So both rational design and directed evolution each have their advantages and disadvantages.  Luckily, researchers are not limited in which approach they use, and when applicable, they will use both directed evolution and rational design approaches together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, now back to the paper.  One of the central deceits of the ID movement is to claim that anytime a human being designs something, she is using the theory of intelligent design.  Sorry, but no.  Researchers who employ rational design techniques do not operate under the premise that natural proteins were designed by some unknown intelligence using unknown methods.  And if for some reason they did, it would be entirely unhelpful.  The paper does not argue directly that rational design methodology somehow supports intelligent design, but given Leisolas creationist sympathies, this might be what he intended.  And this is certainly what Bill Dembski is implying, going so far as to claim that it is pro-ID article without the usual disclaimers  But absent the glaringly illogical attempt to connect protein engineering with ID, there is no support for ID to be found anywhere in the paper.  (In fact, the phrase intelligent design does not even appear in the article  how could it be a pro-ID article without disclaimers if ID never even gets mentioned?)
      </p>
      <p>
       The only claim that might be relevant to the ID/evolution debate is in one small section titled Obstacles in protein engineering in which the authors argue that there is an Overreliance on the Darwinian methodology.  But this argument is made very tepidly, and little if any support is provided for it.  Leisola and Turunen are forced to conceded throughout the paper that Darwinian methods are not only highly successful, but are
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       successful than rational design approaches.  They merely contend that as our knowledge of protein structure and function improves, rational design approaches will also improve.  Well, yeah, thats kind of obvious.  If someday we obtain perfect knowledge of the relationship between protein sequence, structure, and function, then rational design methods will definitely be superior.  How could they not?  If you can make a precise prediction about which mutations will generate which functions, you can skip the messy high-throughput methods and just go straight to the desired result.   Its no secret that evolution is a slow and wasteful process requiring a lot of trial and error.  Thats why life on Earth took billions of years to reach its present state; if the ID people were correct, one would imagine that the goals of the designer would have been reached instantaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime however, directed evolutionary approaches are very powerful, and even rational design approaches are increasingly incorporating evolutionary methods.  (This is one major weakness of the paper  rational design and evolutionary methods are presented as an either/or dichotomy, when in fact rational design approaches, particularly those derived from computational models, make extensive use of evolutionary theory.)  Most importantly, directed evolution refutes one of the central tenets of ID argumentation, which is that the Darwinian mechanism  random mutation plus selection  cannot generate new information, protein functions, or whatever.  We knew this was false long before the ID movement ever began.  Now theyre reduced to arguing that just because directed evolution methods are less than perfect, or that researchers can design stuff directly, that this somehow supports ID.  And of course theres the annoying spectacle of pretending as if an ID advocate getting a paper of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       kind published is some sort of coup.  Dembski claims that perhaps this is a sign of things to come.  Actually weve been seeing it for quite awhile now.

       When I saw it I just thought it was another case of claiming that every biology paper is in fact an ID paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       But oh yeah, rational design methods will be better if we have exhaustive knowledge of protein structure and function, as well as a huge computing ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       What these people forget is that such rational design methods
       <strong>
        wont
       </strong>
       be finding the same solutions, certainly not in many cases, because rational design wont be hamstrung by past evolutionary histories.  Extremely good rational design methods will simply further confirm what we already know, that evolution has worked with limitations that a god-like designer would not, and that the proteins and morphologies that we have reveal exactly those sorts of limitations (and not the kinds of poor design found in Pintos).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose they have to claim triumphs wherever, even when they are pointing out the pro-evolutionary fact that everything from the time it took to evolve to the results of evolution are consistent with undirected evolution, not with rational design.

      <blockquote class="kw_quote">

        On what basis could it possibly be a pro-ID paper?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Im surprised you needed to ask this question.  Probably, youre looking at the paper from the point of view of someone who actually knows what rational design, random techniques, and Darwinian blind search all mean in the context of protein engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But you arent the DIs target audience.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Try and think of this from the perspective of a lay-person whos inherently both sympathetic to ID creationism and unfamiliar with the jargon and concepts of protein engineering.  Such a person is going to go to the Uncommon Descent website and see the following abstract
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Abstract: The extraordinary properties of natural proteins demonstrate that life-like protein engineering is both achievable and valuable. Rapid progress and impressive results have been made towards this goal using rational design and random techniques or a combination of both. However, we still do not have a general theory on how to specify a structure that is suited to a target function nor can we specify a sequence that folds to a target structure. There is also overreliance on the Darwinian blind search to obtain practical results. In the long run, random methods cannot replace insight in constructing life-like proteins. For the near future, however, in enzyme development, we need to rely on a combination of both.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, if you
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       ID creationism to be true and you dont know anything about protein engineering, youre going to think that says: 1) there is rapid progress being made in rational design, 2) Darwinian methods are over-relied upon and dont give practical results, and 3) random methods are being replaced by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       If youre an ID creationist, that all sounds wonderful!  And when Dembski tells you its a pro-ID paper, well that just seals the deal!
      </p>
      <p>
       All that context you explained about what the terminology means and how its applied in this specific field is great for people like me who are genuinely interested in understanding things like this, but its all just white noise to ID creationists who feed on being told what they want to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       To them, this paper looks very much like its bashing random Darwinian methods and trumpeting the virtues of design.

       Now Ive really heard it all. For the first time I come to understand there are evolutionary methods as if to say evolution is methodical and not purely random-based. So if evolution is methodical, who devised the method? The  experimenter? Would such a method select the fittest for survival? With logic such as this is it any wonder you guys are having to spend huge amounts of energy the past few years arguing and insulting us ignoramuses, on the controversy that supposedly doesnt exist, you know, the one that dominates discussion on PT?

       Actually, you have to work your method to deal with the fact that the fittest will survive.  That is, you have to set the parameters so that the design, molecule, etc., will evolve to become fit for certain purposes.

       Unfortunately, the faulty logic is your own, since you confused methods which are designed to mimic natural evolution in the lab or on the computer, with the evolution which occurs in nature.

       Well yeah, that kind of goes without saying.  I took the time to write this in case there are people who 1) arent already committed to Dembskis point of view, and 2) may not know enough about protein engineering to realize that the authors werent talking about what Dembski implies they were talking about.  I imagine there are quite a lot of such people.  Its important for them to know that there is no basis on which to call this a pro-ID paper, other than perhaps the intent of the authors.

       It boils down to the fact evolutionists think they can deceive God by deceiving themselves. One day evolutionist will claim their ersatz process of natural selection is random one day and methodical the next. Its like the bisexuality most of them practice, they do know what its going to be from day day.

       Two things that should stand out to any objective observer: 1) its the evolutionist side who provides all the details, definitions, and background necessary to put the cited paper in proper context (OTOH, Dembski just throws out an abstract and declares Its pro-ID! without anything further), and 2) all ID-creationists are still able to do is falsely claim non-ID creationist papers as their own, rather than generating their own research.

       The creationist link points to the 8
       <sup>
        th
       </sup>
       European Creationist Conference and features talks by Leisola and even the DIs own token YEC (pseudo-YEC?) Paul Nelson. The titles of the talks suggest that it not only promotes creationism, but from the papers about the Flood and the Fall, specifically YEC, or at least a non-progressive OEC (e.g. day-age). But wait. It also promotes ID, which makes it one more thing that undermines the DIs futile attempts to distance itself from classic creationism. Not that their target audience cares of course; the whole ID is not creationism thing is just to get critics to take the bait.
      </p>
      <p>
       When IDers whine that they are shut out from publishing by those oppressive Darwinists, I remind them that all they have to do is drop the design
       <em>
        language
       </em>
       , just as they do for public school lesson plans. The problem, of which chief IDers are completely aware, is that with or without design language, theres nothing in their work that challenges evolution; if anything it even adds further support. They can fool high school students, but not scientists, and they know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the few papers by IDers (or classic creationists) get published, they gush about how ID is legitimized by peer review. But when one notes how pathetically few papers have been published by IDers (or classic creationists), and that none provide a shred of support for ID (or the mutually contradictory creationist accounts), they again whine about being shut out. They know that its one more thing that ID tries to have both ways. But as long as their cheerleaders dont care, why should they?

       I was pretty sure that after Dover, the ID crowd would get the message that they had to publish evidence for ID in reputable, peer-reviewed journals.  I also figured that, since there isnt any such evidence, they would find a way to fake it to their audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they will do is publish papers that are pretty mundane and uninteresting while avoiding ID terminology to get by reviewers, but their papers will have enough code words in them that they can brag to their followers that they are now publishing articles that prove ID.  Their followers will swallow it hook, line, and sinker, and armed with this belief, will step up their political attacks on legislatures and school boards.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we point out that none of their papers argue for ID or that they have started no research programs nor improved the scientific understanding of our universe, they will argue that we have moved the goalposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of their followers know what a significant paper does in the world of research.  It has to be confirmed, cited in many other research papers, and it has to get a trend going that leads to significant advances in our understanding.  I can see other ID/Creationist leaders jumping on the bandwagon to cite and confirm the papers of their co-conspirators, but the only change in science they can hope to generate will be caused by a massive political campaign that declares that ID is now a proven science.

      <p>
       I think we are seeing the beginning of this process.  Its another case of fundamentalists gaming the system to gain the appearance of legitimacy.

       Isnt it common for creationists to parasitize the work of real scientists?  They also like to twist the meaning of scientific work so that it seems to say the opposite of what the original author intended.   (Carl Zimmer needs to add a new chapter to Parasite Rex.)

       You only have to look at the equations to see that natural selection is a completely deterministic process.  Anyone who claims any different is not telling the truth.  Of course there are still elements of chance and drift that are important for the entire process of evolution, but that is not the point.  Can you give any examples of anyone who told you natural selection was random?  If so, why did you believe them?

       nor can we specify a sequence that folds to a target structure
      </p>
      <p>
       Odd statement.  Pulling out a book on Protein Design (called Protein Design), page 5/section 1.1.3, talks about specified sequences that fold into a desired alpha helix (in an aqueous environ).  Beta sheets starting on page 27design of entire protein complexes on page 113.  (Methods in Molecular Biology - 340 - Protein Design: Methods and Applications)
      </p>
      <p>
       In a paper, Biotechnology Advances (vol 23 page 271-281), mesophiles such as us are used as the example of what not to do.  In example we have undesirable beta branched residues (I, T, V) incorporated in helices causing conformational strain, increasing the ease of destabilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protein design shows that we are poorly designed, heck we have to take most of our what we desire to have from thermophilic bacteria.  Amoral processes best explain our poorly placed residues.

       Matti Leisola is a well-known YEC-creationist in Finland. He has translated various anti-evolution books in Finnish including Dembskis The design inference and co-authored with German creationist Siegfried Scherer book Evolution:The critical analysis. He even maintains a website that promotes intelligent design:
       <a href="http://www.intelligentdesign.fi/" rel="nofollow external nofollow">
        http://www.intelligentdesign.fi/
       </a>
       <br/>
       In 2004 he arranged a lecture series at the Helsinki University of Technology called Tackling Ultimate Complexity in which lecturers included Paul Nelson and Richard Sternberg. That year the Finnish skeptic association gave him and to  his laboratory the annual bullshit award for promoting pseudoscience.

        It boils down to the fact evolutionists think they can deceive God by deceiving themselves.

        Now Ive really heard it all. For the first time I come to understand there are evolutionary methods as if to say evolution is methodical and not purely random-based. So if evolution is methodical, who devised the method? The experimenter? Would such a method select the fittest for survival? With logic such as this is it any wonder you guys are having to spend huge amounts of energy the past few years arguing and insulting us ignoramuses, on the controversy that supposedly doesnt exist, you know, the one that dominates discussion on PT?

       I know others have already responded pretty well to this but it always bears repeating. We have evolutionary processes in nature, and we have cases where we take what we know about those processes and put them to use in the lab. Directed Evolution for the purposes of Protein Engineering, Genetic Algorithms, etc. Here we determine what we want the evolutionary pressures and selective constraints to be in order to produce a desired outcome (such as with Directed Evolution) or we set the constraints to allow a for a search towards reasonable solutions (such as Genetic Algorithms). It is much like the basis of Animal Husbandry, where our ancestors observed variation and selection in nature and realized they could breed for specific desired traits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here in this type of experiment and methodology we are emulating what we know about nature but unlike nature we may have a specific goal in mind (Protein Engineering) and se we set the constraints and environment appropriately. Nature of course does not have a pre-set goal.

       Like his Viking ancestors who made their living raping, killing, pillaging, and burning peaceful Christian communities, this Scandinavian evolutionist can not tolerate any dissent from the evolutionary theology of the modern secular state.

       The zeal to which Darwiniacs will persecute dissidents never ceases to amaze me. Even in an area where popular opinion veers toward the evolutionists side; they still hysterically try to stamp out all traces of Christianity.

       Finns were not vikings (although, perhaps some of us were: it may be possible that some people from Finland have joined the Swedish Vikings, when they travelled to Russia). It is also possible that some of Swedish vikings married Finns and thats why some of us could have viking ancestors

       Normally I dont answer trolls, but you made it personal.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, it is highly unlikely I have Viking ancestors even being a Swede by many generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       My lineage is a mix mainly from central west Europe and northern Sweden. The later can mean such ancestors as Same (genetically traced to northern Africa) or Fins (again central Europe, but east).
      </p>
      <p>
       Worse, Vikings were a social, and not ethnic, group. Since records doesnt go that far back it is impossible to tell which were and were not. Vikings were more specifically some of the men of mainly coastal settlements that chose to live by travel, and they were only out as viking (dra i viking) when they pillaged. Most scandinavians were never Vikings at any time, but all were nordmn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the traveling people mostly made their living by trade, especially slaves (which they of course could also got from pillaging and not only by population growth among the thralls).
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, not all of Europe was christian at the time. For example, the Kievan Rus principality was probably founded just by scandinavian traders, and it wasnt christianized until about 200 years after the travels had started to pass the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth, Im not a biologist. That I support science instead of anti-science doesnt make me an expert in evolutionary biology. So please refrain from mislabeling me and my expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth, and you know this because you are only trying to parody and put up easy targets, a secular state is separated from theology of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets see, what remains that you did get right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, yes, modern secular state. That sounds about right.

       So, lett summarize shall we?  So far pumpkinhead has, (anonomously): made claims without evidence; failed to answer questions posed to him; and failed to acknowledge when answers were given to his questions.  Then, when all else fails, he has stooped to racism and descriptions of sexual preference as arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, lets play shall we?  Everyone knows that pumpkinheads are bulbous, orange skined and totally hollow inside.  Oh yea, and they scare small children on holloween and undoubtedly have deviant sexual preferences.

       Until this guy answere questions put to him I suggest we all ignore him

       I actually find this post fascinating. At most, the poster has read the first paragraph, for any further would reveal that the paper is not about evolutionary theory as much as it is about protein engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more curious, Rueland defines directed evolution in a very simple manner: the use of natural selection to target favorable traits. The poster, if he read past the first paragraph, had to actually have read the following sentence:
      </p>
      <p>
       you apply random mutagenesis to whole or part of your protein, you screen for the properties youre looking for, and you repeat the process as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sentence alone is clearly the opposite of ID once you realize that properties the scientists select for is the analogue of a selection pressure. But even more is illuminated:
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, you use the Darwinian mechanism, the very mechanism that ID advocates have spent the last decade fruitlessly arguing is incapable of doing the very things we see it doing in the lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt this poster is troll, since he hasnt accused anyone of alternate sexual preferences. So the unfortunate conclusion is that this poor human being went specifically to a site refuting an ID argument and then not only ignoring the article but making a comment that has the intelligibility of a 9 year old.
      </p>
      <p>
       The eugenics comment further illustrates this. The obvious, clever implication of this statement is that, because ID supposedly is directed evolution, the mechanism of Intelligent Design would be the teleological selection of people or animals depending on teleologically determined wanted traits. In essence, it would be saying that, as opposed to natural selection, artificial selection is occuring, i.e. eugenics.

       You know, if I am somehow unaware of this simple fact, so too are Matti Leisola and Ossi Turunen.  In their paper, directed evolution is used synonymously with Darwinian methods.  Their entire
       <em>
        argument
       </em>
       is to denigrate directed evolution techniques as being inadequate when compared to design techniques (at some point in the future at least). These are things you would know if you had actually bothered to read the paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much simpler their argument would have been if they had just declared
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       methods of protein engineering to be synonymous with ID!  Its too bad Bill Dembski didnt straighten them out on this beforehand, because otherwise they could have saved themselves the effort of writing the paper.  Instead we have the comical situation in which Dembksi claims that this pro-ID article doesnt know that the methods its attacking are really ID methods!

       No, the premise of ID is that evolution either doesnt happen, or that it requires some sort of intervention by an agent outside of nature (and thats being as charitable as possible  we all know that the actual agent in question is G-O-D).  Directed evolution techniques operate under the exact opposite premise.  Namely that mutation and selection  which are natural and materialistic processes that IDists strenuously argue are incapable of doing anything  can by themselves create novel phenotypes.

      <p>
       I guess next well be hearing how wind tunnel experiments prove that intelligent design, and not godless material forces, are what
       <em>

       causes aircraft to lift-off.  I mean, hey, it takes an experimenter to

      <p>
       I am going to do a follow up comment on my Viking comment, since I didnt want to lengthen my original one. The reason is that since Im not an historian or biologist I found the wikipedia notes I dug up in preparation fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, scandinavians may be responsible for the foundation of Russia:
      </p>
      <p>
       From the historiographical point of view, Kievan Rus is considered a predecessor state of three modern East Slavic nations: Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. [] The Rus people (i. e. mobile groups of warriors and traders of Scandinavian origin) probably dominated what is now northwestern Russia since the eighth century. In the early ninth they became loosely organized under the Rus Khaganate, which may be regarded as a predecessor state to the Kievan Rus. According to the Primary Chronicle, the earliest chronicle of Kievan Rus, a Varangian (Viking) named Rurik first established himself in Novgorod, located in modern Russia (he was selected as common ruler by several Slavic and Finno-Ugric tribes) in about 860 before moving south and extending his authority to Kiev.
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus" rel="nofollow external nofollow">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Muuuch more impressive than mere viking tomfoolery IMHO. Anyone can scare the shit out of others, but inadvertently founding empires is not for all to do. And the east traveling nordmn were mainly swedes AFAIK. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, a recent evolutionary result is that the Sami group goes in all probability back to the Berbers of North Africa despite previous hypotheses on Asian origins:
      </p>
      <p>
       The research indicates that 95.6% of Saami mtDNA originated in the Iberia refugia while only 4.4% is of Siberian-Asiatic origin (Tambets 2004). A genetic link has been established between the Sami and the Berbers of North Africa going back 9000 years (Achilli 2005). Sami Y chromosomes indicate that 29.8% originated in the Iberia refugia and 58.2% originated in Eastern Europe (Tambets 2004)
      </p>
      <p>
       The autosomal classic markers shows that the Sami have no close relatives in any population including their closest linguistic relatives but are in general more closely related to Europeans than people of other continents. The closest of the distant relatives are Finnish people, but this is probably due to more recent immigration of Finnish people into the Sami areas, and the assimilation of the Sami population into the mainstream population in todays Finland (Meinila 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sami are no more closely related to the Siberian and Mongol populations than other European populations (Niskanen 2002), in contrast to the historically held view that the Sami are of Siberian-Asian origin. The genetic distances between the Sami and the rest of the world are due to founder effects and genetic drift resulting from their small and isolated population.
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people" rel="nofollow external nofollow">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if I were a creationist I wouldnt know this, because founder effects and genetic drift doesnt exist in their fantasy world. I on the other hand appreciate my possible forefathers (or rather foremothers, see the mtDNA :-) history.

       Eugenics is about breeding phenotypes. Intelligent design is not. In this case, its about breeding proteins. Breeding is in quotes since proteins dont replicate, but must be manufactured.

       So directed evolution is the same as intelligent design but eugenics is not intelligent design because you are breeding phenotypes and not breeding proteins?  Where do phenotypic variants come from?  In both cases you are selecting certain nucleotide sequences, produced by random mutations.  There is absolutely no difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant have it both ways.  Either directed evolution (in the sense of selecting between variants) is ID and therefore eugenics is by definition ID, or the two terms are not synonomous.  Of course they are not the same.  You cant claim credit for all the advancements of science and at the same time blame science for all the evils in the world.  If you did that, you would either be a hypocrite, or Amish.

        Even more curious, Rueland defines directed evolution in a very simple manner: the use of natural selection to target favorable traits. The poster, if he read past the first paragraph, had to actually have read the following sentence:

       On the contrary, when you involve screen[ing] for the properties youre looking for, youve entered the realm of intelligent design, and have exited the realm of Darwinian undirected, unscreened evolution. When you do the selecting yourself, you are not invoking natural selection at all. Once you start target[ing] favorable traits, where favorable is defined by the scientists doing the engineering, you are talking about ID, and are not talking about Darwinian evolution. When you insist that properties the scientists select for is analogous to natural selection, you are admitting that the selection is not natural, and therefore not Darwinian.

        There is also overreliance on the Darwinian blind search to obtain practical results. In the long run, random methods cannot replace insight in constructing life-like proteins. For the near future, however, in enzyme development, we need to rely on a combination of both.

       Its interesting that the Darwinian aspect is
       <em>

       This is a pro-Darwinian blog, so it stands to reason that a pro-Darwinian interpretation will be accepted and a pro-ID interpretation rejected. But your arguments are self-contradicting:

      <p>
       Well, no, it doesnt require intervention by an agent outside of nature at all, unless you consider Man to be outside of nature.  Of course, we do exactly that on a regular basis, when we claim that products of Man are unnatural.  But I digress
      </p>

       Since an outside agent (the scientist) is intervening in this case, it is clearly an example of ID.

       Again, once Man does the selecting, based on Mans criteria of what is favorable, you are no longer in the Darwinian realm. If Man is introducing the random variations in the DNA sequence (rather than letting Time do it), then its still ID. You are still effectively manufacturing proteins, and selecting the ones you want while discarding the rest.

       Thanks Steve.  It seems that C Bass doesnt understand that selecting proteins IS selecting phenotypes.  How does he think they do this, by selecting a particular nucleotide or amino acid sequence?  If they knew what sequence they wanted in the first place they wouldnt have to use random mutations, they could just use site-directed mutagenesis.  What they really do is test the phenotype or function of the protein.  And even if they did select directly on the protein sequence, that is still selecting on phenotype.  It certainly is not selecting on genotype.  It is really hard to agrue with people who do not read the papers and dont know the meaning of the words.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are also correct that artificial selection is still Darwinian.  It doesnt matter whether the selection agent is human or not.  Selection still has predictable consequences and limitations.  Darwin knew all about artificial selection.  He also knew it wasnt the only alternative to natural selection.

       I admit error in using the term phenotype, which is apparently an ambiguous term. From Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        The phenotype of an individual organism is either its total physical appearance and constitution or a specific manifestation of a trait, such as size, eye color, or behavior that varies between individuals.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was using the former definition (total physical appearance and constitution) while you guys were using the latter (a specific manifestation of a trait). I should have simply used the term organism, specifically, human.

       Sorry if I was too harsh regarding terminology.  The term phenotype can de somewhat ambiguous.  By the way, wikipedia is probably not the best source for definitions of technical terms.

       On another note, your willingness to read the paper puts you in another league from most of the antievolution types who post here.  You have indeed demonstrated a desire for open discourse and the true spirit of scientific inquiry.  Thanks also to Steve for helping out.

       I still have to disagree with your characterization of eugenics however.  Selection against individuals often amounts to nothing more than selection against variant forms of single proteins.  For example, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, SCID and many other diseases are caused by simple genetic changes that alter only one protein.  It is true that not allowing certain individuals to breed may not always be for such simple reasons, but then again it often can be.  Most of the time, genotype determines phenotype through intermediate stage of proteins.  And eugenics may be based on single or multiple traits with heritable components.  In any event, the basics of selection are the same, even if the genetic basis of some traits are not well understood.

       Just a brief note to say thanks for the paper. I have read through it once and have skimmed it a number of times. Of course, I am biased, and therefore see design where a committed Darwinian might not see it. I want to spend some time absorbing the paper, making sure my biases arent misleading me, but off hand, it appears that the paper is a survey of different methods ranging from random approaches (this is the part thats inspired by the Darwinian model) through rational design, and the current state of these various methods and approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, its interesting to see that this paper cites an article written by Michael Behe (co-authored by DW Snoke). If that doesnt make this a pro-ID paper, nothing can! :)

       The article states that the average protein is composed of approximately 300 amino acids, and since there are 20 amino acids to choose from, there are, again on average, 20^300 possible sequences, which is a large number. The authors refer to this as the sequence-space (page 2). The article goes on to say that there are islands of functionality in this sequence space, where viable protein structures exist, separated by rather large gaps. In the specific case of -lactamases, which they use as an example, they quantify this distance between functional islands:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        When structural and genetic variation among -lactamases from different sources was analyzed, it was concluded that out of 10^199 possible structures, 10^122 are active (Axe 2004). Thus, only 1 out of 10^77 structures is functional.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since there are islands of functionality within this sequence space, it stands to reason that modifying a proteins amino acid sequence will eventually move it off the island on which it happens to reside, rendering it unviable. Because of this, the authors conclude:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        a fully random search is hardly a way to create novel proteins for biotechnological use. This does not, however, prevent us from utilizing a random search in focused areas.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, the Darwinian blind search is not only subjected to artificial selection on the back end, it is focused onto specific regions of the sequence space on the front end. In their discussion of localized randomization, they list four criteria that must be met for directed evolution to be successful, the second of which applies here:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        The function must also be biologically or evolutionarily feasible. In practice, this means that there exists a mutational pathway to get from here to there through ever-improving variants.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The authors observe that this second criterion confines the search to a functional/structural island (page 3).
      </p>
      <p>
       A truly Darwinian mechanism is blissfully unaware of these islands of functionality, and subsequently is unconcerned with where randomization leads. Given that there is a large chasm between these islands, it stands to reason that the majority of random mutations would be deleterious, and that is what we observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directed evolution, on the other hand, seeks to avoid those chasms of nonviability, and indeed uses the islands of functionality as both a starting point and a boundry of exploration. Therefore, although the process may be
       <em>
        inspired
       </em>
       by the Darwinian model, it is simply unwarranted to claim that it is Darwinian in its own right. Since there is intervention from outside agency directing both the randomizations (confining them to specific segments of the sequence space) and the selections, guiding them to a prespecified target, it is indeed warranted to claim that this is a process of design, one that just so happens to have some admittedly Darwinian components.

       This is a convenient way of presenting it, if promoting a specific point of view is the objective. However it is at least equally as valid to state that, since the reason the engineer is selecting organisms is for the proteins they produce, the individual proteins are indeed the target of the selection process. This is, after all, the point of the endeavor, the production of proteins, not so much the production of bacteria. The bacteria are simply a necessary artifact.

       Eugenics, on the other hand, is indeed focused on the organisms themselves  the organisms and their phenotypes are not merely a necessary artifact of the process, but are indeed the target of the endeavor.

        principle
       </em>
       is an abstraction of the
       <em>
        mechanism
       </em>
       ; a process that relies on Darwinian
       <em>
        principles
       </em>
       is not necessarily a Darwnian process in its own right, as I have already discussed. The authors then go on to observe:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        [T]he transition from one fold to another is very problematic. Even inside a fold family, most transitions are very challenging.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Previous to this, they list a set of three major obstacles they consider to be the most significant:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        1. Lack of a theory for structure design (i.e., specifying a structure that is suited to a target function)
        <br/>
        2. Lack of a general approach for sequence design (i.e., specifying a sequence that folds to a target structure)
        <br/>
        3. Overreliance on the Darwinian methodology
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Given that they are discussing both
       <em>
        designs
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        specifications
       </em>
       , coupled with the
       <em>
        criticism
       </em>
       of an overreliance on the Darwinian methodology, it stands to reason that they are, at some level, recommending a design approach to the overall enterprise. This idea is reinforced in their concluding paragraph (page 6):
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        In spite of the progress, we still do not have a general theory on how a sequence produces a specific structure and how a structure determines a function. Therefore, a blind Darwinian search within a known protein scaffold is often used to modify proteins. Unfortunately, blind searches have hard resource limits whereas insight has not. Therefore, in the long run, blind searches are of limited value in compensating our present ignorance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The authors admit that they have a long way to go, but they definitely seem to think that abandoning (or at the very least, minimizing dependence on) Darwinian methods is the most viable long-term direction to take. The first sentence quoted above strongly suggests a reverse-engineering approach to protein functionality, mapping structure to function, and (hopefully) distilling that knowledge into a generalized theory that can subsequently be used for novel protein design and construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, based on these observations, it seems unwarranted to claim that this paper absolutely cannot be construed as pro-ID.

       Isnt this just the same, tired line of argumentation that we went through months (a year!?) ago with the Genetic Algorithm business and a version of the Traveling Salesman, in which it was conclusively shown that the target of such a process is not contained within the algorithm?

      <p>
       C. Bass:
       <br/>
       The point is this. A fully, no-kidding, all-the-way Darwinian process can occur in a domain chosen by an agent outside of that process. You appear to me to be equivocating on the fact that the Darwinian process that led to the diversity of life on Earth was not so constrained, and had to take place in the wide-open domain we call the universe. Using Darwinian principles in a smaller domain, such as the engineering of a single protein, lacks the grandeur of three-plus billion years of organic evolution perhaps, but it does not fail to be Darwinian just because of the outside constraints imposed on it.

      <p>
       This is just semantics.  I contend that Darwinian evolution creates real designs.  I know that some authors like to call it the appearance of design, but in my opinion this is needlessly misleading.  The point of calling it an appearance of design is to contrast what happens in Darwinian evolution vs. conscious, forward-thinking design.  But directed evolution is definitely not conscious, forward-thinking design, because the experimenter has no way of knowing what the results are going to be ahead of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you insist on claiming that Darwinian evolution creates only the appearance of design, then so too does directed evolution.

      <blockquote class="kw_quote">

        Yes, the mechanism is the same, but that ultimately doesnt matter, because the Darwinian model is defined as being undirected, and having no goal(s). Once you direct the mechanism toward a goal, it no longer fits within the definition of Darwinian. Its really as simple as that.

       I would say it really
       <em>

       matter that the mechanism is the same.  If the mechanism is the same, then anything that one can do can also be accomplished by the other, at least in principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would take exception to the claim that Darwinian evolution cannot be goal-directed.  It is directed to the goal of increasing fitness.  When we say that evolution is not goal-directed, we mean that theres no ultimate end-product that is being striven for throughout the long historical process of natural history.  We dont mean that there arent any short-term goals being accomplished.  Making a protein better match certain fitness criteria is a goal, whether its done by an experimenter or by the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate its clear that the authors of the paper considered directed evolution to be Darwinian.  The ID people cant keep their story straight because Dembski has previously relabeled all evolutionary computation as design so he doesnt have to deal with all that pesky evidence that hes wrong.

      <blockquote class="kw_quote">

        There is a difference between studying natural phenomena in a lab, and applying the fruits of such study to produce a desired, preconceived result, whether it be the fabrication of a novel protein or the improvement of an existing one. Engineering is the application of knowledge, not the accumulation thereof.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And what would that difference be?  Directed evolution experiments are, as often as not, intended to elucidate the features of a proteins structure and function.  They arent just used for engineering purposes, and I cant see any reason why were supposed to think of them as being in a totally different category when they are.

        The article states that the average protein is composed of approximately 300 amino acids, and since there are 20 amino acids to choose from, there are, again on average, 20^300 possible sequences, which is a large number. The authors refer to this as the sequence-space (page 2). The article goes on to say that there are islands of functionality in this sequence space, where viable protein structures exist, separated by rather large gaps.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And in this claim they are wrong.  They cite only one paper (written by an IDist!) in order to back up this claim.  Dozens of other papers show otherwise.  The evidence suggests that all proteins are connected in sequence space by neutral networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides which, I myself as a protein chemist have to ask the question: On what hierarchical level are proteins isolated into islands of functionality?  Individual proteins clearly arent, because they have all sorts of close neighbors in sequence space.  Proteins are arranged in families, sub-families, super-families, etc. on the basis of sequence identity.  Rather than being isolated, they all appear related.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directed evolution experiments demonstrate that you can go from one protein function to another relatively easily.  They also show, though to a lesser degree, that you can go from one protein structure to another.  There is no known barrier from going to one protein to any other thats out there, other than time and lab space of course.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        In their discussion of localized randomization, they list four criteria that must be met for directed evolution to be successful, the second of which applies here:
       </p>
       <p>
        The function must also be biologically or evolutionarily feasible. In practice, this means that there exists a mutational pathway to get from here to there through ever-improving variants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The authors observe that this second criterion confines the search to a functional/structural island (page 3).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And every time a directed evolution experiment produces a new protein with a new function, it proves that the protein is not confined to a structural/functional island.  Or at least it proves that these islands are more like continents, containing hundreds or thousands of possible functions.  And there is every reason to believe that these continents are connected at the edges.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        A truly Darwinian mechanism is blissfully unaware of these islands of functionality, and subsequently is unconcerned with where randomization leads.

      <p>
       Same is true with experimenters in directed evolution experiments.  No one knows where the boundaries of these islands are, or even if they exist.  (Let me point out again that this is an IDist term of art, and protein engineers do not perceive any islands of functionality.)
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Given that there is a large chasm between these islands, it stands to reason that the majority of random mutations would be deleterious, and that is what we observe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It is not relevant that a majority of mutations are deleterious (actually neutral), what matters is that there is a pathway on the fitness landscape between two different functions.  Directed evolution experiments show that these pathways exist, otherwise the experiments wouldnt produce anything.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Directed evolution, on the other hand, seeks to avoid those chasms of nonviability, and indeed uses the islands of functionality as both a starting point and a boundry of exploration. Therefore, although the process may be inspired by the Darwinian model, it is simply unwarranted to claim that it is Darwinian in its own right.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Directed evolution doesnt seek to avoid chasms of nonviability because it doesnt recognize their existence.  It works the same as evolution in the wild:  you mutate something, you apply selection, you repeat.  There is nothing that is being consciously avoided by the experimenter.  If there are barriers that prevent you from getting a new function, then you wont get a new function.

      <p>
       It is not outside intervention that confines the mutations to a specific segment of the sequence space!  It is the fact that you are starting with a given protein sequence and evolving from there.  Evolution is a change to that which already exists, not organisms and sequences popping up out of thin air.  Although at least some proteins would have needed to arise
       <em>
        de novo
       </em>
       , the vast majority of proteins out in nature would have arisen from a related protein that already existed.

       The target is not prespecified!!!!  That is the important distinction between rational design methods and directed evolution methods.  In the former, you pick a target and hope you get the activity you want.  In the latter, you screen for the activity you want and allow the sequence to find a target (via Darwinian evolution).  If you knew what the target was, youd just make it directly.

        Yes, the mechanism is the same, but that ultimately doesnt matter, because the Darwinian model is defined as being undirected, and having no goal(s). Once you direct the mechanism toward a goal, it no longer fits within the definition of Darwinian. Its really as simple as that.

      <p>
       Such a definition of Darwinian not only conflicts with the paper in question, but fails to reflect evolutionary theory in any era from Darwin to today.   Evolutionary biology is perfectly comfortable with selection pressures being produced by design.  Human design, for instance, has influenced the evolution of myriad other species for millions of years.  Bedbugs exist because humans chose to make caves into their living quarters.  A new species of mosquito evolved in the London subways because humans designed and built a transportation system.  And so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that matter, pretty much every Christian/Muslim/Hindu/etc. evolutionary biologist in the world believes that evolution is the product of design.  Hell, Darwin believed that at the time he wrote the
       <em>
        Origin
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The only undirectedness required by a Darwinian evolutionary model is with respect to the mutations.  The selection pressures can come from anywhere or anyone.

        A truly Darwinian mechanism is blissfully unaware of these islands of functionality, and subsequently is unconcerned with where randomization leads. Given that there is a large chasm between these islands, it stands to reason that the majority of random mutations would be deleterious, and that is what we observe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Directed evolution, on the other hand, seeks to avoid those chasms of nonviability, and indeed uses the islands of functionality as both a starting point and a boundry of exploration.

      <p>
       Um, thats exactly what happens in natural Darwinian evolution.  Precisely
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       mutations that take an organism off an island of functionality are deleterious, their carriers do not leave viable offspring, and the population is confined to that island.  And such an island must be the starting point, or the ancestral organism wouldnt have been there in the first pace.

       Directed evolution is Darwinian.

        However it is at least equally as valid to state that, since the reason the engineer is selecting organisms is for the proteins they produce, the individual proteins are indeed the target of the selection process. This is, after all, the point of the endeavor, the production of proteins, not so much the production of bacteria. The bacteria are simply a necessary artifact.

       How does that follow?  Bacteria and humans are both error-prone replicators, so theyre both subject to evolutionary processes.   Theyre also both affected by gravity and killed by fire, for that matter.  That doesnt mean they dont differ in lots of other ways.

        You appear to me to be equivocating on the fact that the Darwinian process that led to the diversity of life on Earth was not so constrained, and had to take place in the wide-open domain we call the universe. Using Darwinian principles in a smaller domain, such as the engineering of a single protein, lacks the grandeur of three-plus billion years of organic evolution perhaps, but it does not fail to be Darwinian just because of the outside constraints imposed on it.

       Your argument is very poor, and amounts to a semantic quibble. Moreover, youre repeating yourself, and failing to add new information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The only guidance is setting the domain within which the Darwinian process will proceed.

       Inside that domain, the process is unguided, and Darwinian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even selective breeding is just a special case of natural selection, not qualitatively different from any other example of co-evolution. Else, isnt bee evolution guided by the flowering-plant lineage? By your argument, everywhere there is even the hint of purpose, Darwinian mechanisms are somehow over-ridden by well, by what? That seems like a good question for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are convinced that any random variation/selection process used for a purpose by an agent is not, and cannot be by definition, a Darwinian process, what adjective should we use to describe such a process?

      <p>
       Yes, but the unguided, or random part is the genetic side, not the selection side.  Lets take an example.  Imagine a population of wolves and a population of deer seperated by mountains they cant climb over.  Now suppose there is a rockslide which creates a pass in the mountains.  The wolves will cross over, chase the deer, and the deer might very well evolve more speed to escape them.  Evolution, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       OK, now change the scenario: instead of a rockslide, the pass was made by humans building a road.  The wolves still cross, and the deer still evolve speed.  Still evolution?  Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the people made the pass on purpose, not for a road, but to see if the deer would evolve speed?  Still evolution?  If not, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if the humans made the pass and then reached in somehow to the deers genetic structure and forced mutations resulting in more speed, THAT would be guided and consequently not evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the randomness in the genetics that is the unguided part, not the selection environment.  The reason is because even if we set the environment, we can never be sure what will occur.  Maybe the deer will get faster, but maybe they will get bigger instead, or able to climb the rocks, or fly, or develop an odor the wolves dont care for, etc.  This is, as others have explained, why when EAs are used, the users dont know what the result is going to be. If they did, they would just implement it directly, rather than going to the trouble of using the EA in the first place.

What you guys refuse to consider is that this random element is still controlled and directed, and the whole process guided to a preconceived objective. This is in clear contrast to the truly Darwinian mechanism of natural selection, which has no preconceived objective, and no guidance or focusing of the random element.

        Such a definition of Darwinian not only conflicts with the paper in question, but fails to reflect evolutionary theory in any era from Darwin to today. Evolutionary biology is perfectly comfortable with selection pressures being produced by design. Human design, for instance, has influenced the evolution of myriad other species for millions of years. Bedbugs exist because humans chose to make caves into their living quarters. A new species of mosquito evolved in the London subways because humans designed and built a transportation system. And so forth.

       I have not equivocated on this at all.  I pointed out that in my view, Darwinian evolution designs things.  The designs are real, there is no point in calling them illusory.

      <p>
       This is utterly and completely wrong.  Directed evolution is not conscious, forward-thinking design.  Rational design techniques are conscious and forward-thinking, but directed evolution techniques are definitely not.  No one consciously designs the result or picks the desired outcome ahead of time in a directed evolution experiment.  If you think otherwise you dont understand what directed evolution is.

      <p>
       No, I specifically said that any process limited to random variation and differential reproduction is Darwinian.  Thats what Darwinian means!   It doesnt matter what causes the differential reproduction (which is always, by definition, non-random).  It is nonsensical to try to draw a distinction between human and non-human causes of altering reproductive success, because 1) there is no mechanistic difference, and 2) one cannot in most cases (or perhaps any) fully disentangle human beings from the larger environment.  A point that has been made by several others already.

      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        What you guys refuse to consider is that this random element is still controlled and directed, and the whole process guided to a preconceived objective.  This is in clear contrast to the truly Darwinian mechanism of natural selection, which has no preconceived objective, and no guidance or focusing of the random element.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, you appear to have no idea what youre talking about.  There is no preconceived objective in a directed evolution experiment.  The experimenter does not know ahead of time what hes going to get, otherwise hed just skip the evolution and go straight to the product.  Moreover, out in nature the random element is most certainly controlled and directed, otherwise you wouldnt get anything other than noise.  Random variation is continually guided, shaped, and directed by selection.  Its the same whether in the lab or the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only actual difference between a directed evolution experiment and evolution in the wild is that the former contains an experimenter setting up the experimental conditions.  If you wish to draw some grand metaphysical distinction based on this alone, then thats your business, but this not a distinction that has any scientific relevance or meaning.  The actual
       <em>
        physical
       </em>
       mechanism is identical in every single way.  As Ive said before, given your reasoning, there are no natural processes that could be studied in the lab, because once an experimenter sets up conditions, its no longer natural.  Youre just playing word games.

        It is nonsensical to try to draw a distinction between human and non-human causes of altering reproductive success, because 1) there is no mechanistic difference, and 2) one cannot in most cases (or perhaps any) fully disentangle human beings from the larger environment. A point that has been made by several others already.

       This point deserves more attention.  Human beings certainly effect the environment, and the evolution of the species around them, merely by their presence, not to mention their actions.  All animals do.  This presents a problem for those of Sr. Bass view.  If our actions have evolutionary effects even though we had no knowledge and certainly no intent of doing so, as is surely true of many species, it means they are drawing distinctions between guided evolution and darwinian evolution based on our
       <strong>
        intent
       </strong>
       .  From my earlier scenario of the deer and wolves seperated by mountains:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Rockslide creates mountain pass, wolves cross, and deer evolve more speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Humans cut the mountain pass for a road, wolves cross, and deer evolve more speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Humans cut the mountain pass with the intent of letting the wolves roam free, wolves cross, and deer evolve more speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Humans cut the mountain pass with the intent of creating faster deer, wolves cross, and deer evolve more speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since he refused to address these, I am forced to conclude based on his posts that C Bass would claim #4 is guided evolution, and #1 is Darwinian evolution.  What I want to know is what he does with #2 and #3, and why.  He seems doomed to draw a line in there based on our intent, even if the actions and results are identical, which makes his thinking very unscientific.  Science is about what is, morality is about what is intended.

       Since we have readily available, at least for temporary use, the terminology of rational design methods, lets use that, for the purposes of this discussion, in any of Dawkinss statements (or those of other campers) to which we might refer, instead of design, which Dawkins, whose popular writings attempt to be easier on the ear rather than especially precise, uses as prosaic shorthand.

       Here you are talking past the point made most recently by Science Avenger and others (the presentation of which you affect to find tiresome) regarding the irrelevance of intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the domain in which the Darwinian process is to occur remains the same, the intent of the experimenter/engineer cannot possibly matter. Granted that in the ordinary workaday world, the uses to which pure research and engineering put evolutionary algorithms and other directed evolution kinds of Darwinian processes is different. But you dont have to stray very far to see how arbitrary any exact demarcation between the two has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens when the pure researcher sees an engineering application, and does a few runs of the experiment to see if it plays out? Or when the engineer with a sideline in research stumbles across something interesting and decides to try a few experimental runs of an algorithm using novel initial conditions, just to see what will happen? Better yet, what of the engineer ten years from now who reads a paper in a journal devoted to reporting research and finds a potential solution to an applied problem? Contrived, I suppose C Bass will have it, but really, none of this stretches the imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kicker here is that these technics actually work. Thats what its all about. Dembski et al cant possibly let on that
       <em>
        actual Darwinian processes
       </em>
       function at any level. Obstinate refusal to engage with this fact, demonstrated here by C Bass, is telling.

       Its talking about experiments.  Experiments that were used in the service of engineering (at least some of them).  Just go read the actual papers that were cited, and youll see that the authors of those papers quite explicitly call what theyre doing experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it seems that weve run into the argument via word-games.  Trying to draw a distinction between two different words does not imply that there are different processes at work.  To draw such a distinction, you must focus on the actual processes themselves, not on the arbitrary labels that get used to describe them.

       No they dont.  You simply dont understand what that quoted passage is referring to.

      <p>
       Oh, and by the way, if the authors words are considered sacrosanct, I think I should point out, yet again, that they explicitly refer to directed evolution techniques as Darwinian.

       How interesting.  Let me take a sentence or two and have a go:
      </p>
      <p>
       A truly Darwinian mechanism is blissfully unaware of these islands of functionality, and subsequently is unconcerned with where randomization leads. Given that there is a large chasm between these islands, it stands to reason that the majority of random mutations would be deleterious, and that is what we observe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, how exactly is a mechanism supposed to be aware?
       <br/>
       Then, you do realise that the issue here is that for a specific purpose, you are correct.  However, for other purposes, i.e. functions with different islands of optimality, the mutation may increase fitness.  The environment provides the screen throught which individuals with different fitness pass, and in an environment with a new antibiotic, the one with the mutation would survive, even although the mutation might badly affect some function of it which means it would not survive without the presence of the antibiotic.

       The point you pretend not to get is that Dawkins hammers illusion into the readers head, then this blog comes along and says whoa! whadayamean illusion? yer confused! pinning the blame on the reader when its the Darwinian camp thats sowing the confusion.  Neat trick, collectively equivocate then blame it on the skeptic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting to see you guys claiming that your spokesman, Dawkins, misleads his readers. So how are we poor creationist fools ever supposed to understand this marvelous theory when one of your leading spokesmen misleads us on such fundamental concepts?

       C Bass wondered as to what the I in ID referred. While it refers to intelligent, it is through conflation of terminology how ID attempts to make its case. Remember that ID is the set theoretic complement of chance and regularity. Nothing about intelligent/intelligence so far. In fact, as I and others have argued, ID is about Ignorance not Intelligence. Which is self evident once you dig a little below the surface.

Unless you are discussing science history, talk of Darwinian evolution makes about as much sense as invoking Wright Brothers aerodynamics in a discussion of flight.

       Its not vague just because it doesnt focus on the irrelevancies you obsess over, any more than painting is vague because it doesnt go into detail on the direction of the brushstrokes.

       Dawkins may be irrelevant in your world, but he is a leading spokesman for promoting neo-Darwinian evolution, and explaining the theory to the masses. Claiming him to be irrelevant is disingenuous, to put it mildly, but it does represent more equivocation from the Darwinian camp. Darwinians refer to Dawkins on a regular basis  I have been told to read
       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        The Selfish Gene
       </span>
       and
       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        The Blind Watchmaker
       </span>
       several times by members of your camp, in their efforts to disabuse me of my ignorance. Well, Ive read them. Now you guys tells me that what he says is misleading and that he is irrelevant.

       Well, the theory is commonly referred to as neo-Darwinian evolution, and the paper in question talks about Darwinian inspired methods, so we have yet another example of equivocation: you guys use Darwins name when convenient, but get upset when I use it for the sake of consistency, and even go so far as to pretend that his name is irrelevant.

        1. The wolves will cross over, chase the deer, and the deer might very well evolve more speed to escape them. Evolution, right?

        2. OK, now change the scenario: instead of a rockslide, the pass was made by humans building a road. The wolves still cross, and the deer still evolve speed. Still evolution? Of course.
       </p>
       <p>
        3. What if the people made the pass on purpose, not for a road, but to see if the deer would evolve speed? Still evolution? If not, why not?

        4. Now if the humans made the pass and then reached in somehow to the deers genetic structure and forced mutations resulting in more speed, THAT would be guided and consequently not evolution.

       Then tell it to actual Darwnians who refer to neo-Darwinian evolution, as the irrelevant Richard Dawkins often does. If aeronautical engineers were found to be referring to neo-Wright Brothers aerodynamics on a consistent basis, then maybe youd have a valid comparison. But they dont. Yet Darwinians do refer to neo-Darwinian evolution.

       Again there appears to be a confusion as to the meaning of design. When Dawkins observes that design is apparent he is referring to the observation that the design can be explained by a natural mechanism. In other words, there is no need to appeal to Design as the explanation. However, natural selection has been shown to meet the requirements for a designer, using Dembskis impeccable (sic) logic.
       <br/>
       So design may be rampant in nature but the designer seems to be quite natural.
       <br/>
       However ID proponents often tend to conflate these meanings of design. Certainly, the fact that intelligent design is formulated as a set theoretic complement to chance and regularity should have given some pause to IDers
      </p>
      <p>
       Let also point out this concession by Dembski as commented upon by Ryan Nichols
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Before I proceed, however, I note that Dembski makes an important concession to his critics. He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency (TDI, 227, my emphasis).

       Your fundamentalism is showing.  Science is about the evidence, not about who says what.  Darwins words are not holy writ.  Neither are Dawkins.  We can appreciate their scientific insights, while still disagreeing with some of what they say because of subsequent discoveries, or a difference of opinion as to the proper usage of terms like design.

       The problem with your scenarios is that they are one-off deals. The experiment is performed
       <em>
        once
       </em>
       , and you bait me to draw a conclusion from a single data point.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since they are doing this to see if   whatever, it appears to this IDiot to be an
       <em>
        experiment
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say the deer evolve speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So another bunch of people build another pass using another population of deer/wolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time, the deer are simply hunted to extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       For being so concerned with science, you guys manage to be rather unscientific when baiting IDiots such as myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       From this IDiots perspective, it would seem that the scientific thing to do would be to repeat the experiment N number of times, and record how many times each possible outcome occurred. Of course, the set up of each experiment must match that of all the others as closely as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the size of N increases, it seems to this knuckle-dragger that the granularity of the outcome(s) would be finer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say, hypothetically, that N = 500, and lets say that the number of times that the speed of the deer increased was 2. Since increased speed seems to be what you are looking for, it would seems that this experiment fails to support the hypothesis that building a pass increases deer speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, an engineer seeking to increase deer speed for some industrial application would probably elect not to use this method.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, on the other hand, N = 500 and the number of times that the deer speed increased was 280, then, for all practical purposes, using the method of building a pass to increase deer speed is a coin-toss, with a roughly 50-50 chance of success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if the number of successes (increases in deer speed) were, say, 473, then an engineer seeking to increase deer speed would look at the 94.6% success rate of the pass-building method, and perhaps choose to use it if he deemed the 94.6% rate high enough by whatever criteria hes using.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that I am trying to separate the experiment phase from the engineering phase of a process. In one case, outcomes are being observed and cataloged. In the other case, the outcome has
       <em>
        already been quantified
       </em>
       at some level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that you guys insist on conflating experiment with engineering, and accusing me of word games.

       Does your ignorance of ID know no bounds? Michael Behe says that he has no reason to not believe that the earth and the universe are the billions of years old that geologists and cosmologists respectively say they are. Behe even has no problem with common descent. And nowhere in Dembskis writings have I run across any claims that the earth is any younger that the geologists claim it to be.

      <p>
       You are obviously confused, unable to distinguish between ID and YEC.

        This is one of the finest examples of intellectual history I have seen in a long while. It is insightful, thoughtful, informative, and highly readable. Rather than simply connecting the dots, so to speak, the author provides a sophisticated and nuanced examination of numerous German thinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who were influenced to one degree or another by Darwinist naturalism and their ideas, subtly drawing both distinctions and similarities and in the process telling a rich and colorful story.Ian Dowbiggin, University of Prince Edward Island and author of A Merciful End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America

       <p>
        Richard Weikarts outstanding book shows in sober and convincing detail how Darwinist thinkers in Germany had developed an amoral attitude to human society by the time of the First World War, in which the supposed good of the race was applied as the sole criterion of public policy and racial hygiene. Without over-simplifying the lines that connected this body of thought to Hitler, he demonstrates with chilling clarity how policies such as infanticide, assisted suicide, marriage prohibitions and much else were being proposed for those considered racially or eugenically inferior by a variety of Darwinist writers and scientists, providing Hitler and the Nazis with a scientific justification for the policies they pursued once they came to power.Richard Evans, University of Cambridge, and author of The Coming of the Third Reich

       its one reason that predators dont typically hunt their prey to extinction.  on the flip side, you could also say its the reason predators are successful in obtaining prey to begin with.

       as to Dawkins:

      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        So what he writes in his books is not science, nor based on science?

      <p>
       is NOT science, is a popularization and explanation OF science.
      </p>
      <p>
       you know, like Carl Sagans Cosmos, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       its not to say Dawkins has not done science (like Sagan), or does not represent the science accurately in his popular books.
      </p>
      <p>
       but peer-reviewed journal articles is where you find the science that Dawkins attempts to explain (even to self-admitted dolts like yourself).  Speaking of which, since you find NO peerreviewed articles testing the theory of ID (in large part because there IS no theory of ID to begin with), it is NOT science.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Dawkins is popular is because he does this for evolutionary biology much the same way that Sagan did for cosmology.
      </p>
      <p>
       his personal opinions on the impact religion has on society at large (like in the God Delusion) have nothing to do with the subjects covered in his popular science books.

       From a theological and scientific perspective there is little difference, Id argue. Both rely on cherry picking, ignorance to make their scientific case. Both sides have made claims which have been shown to be erroneous. Both rely on the Bible to enforce their level of ignorance and reject good science.
      </p>
      <p>
       How am I doing so far? Or what about Dembskis sympathy for YEC versus his dislike of theistic evolutionism?
      </p>
      <p>
       However remember that ID is nothing more than the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance and that the design inference has little to do with agency. Remember that the separate step of agency cannot even exclude natural selection as the designer.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more careful understanding of teleology and Darwinian theory would lead to the inevitable conclusion that design in nature is an inevitable outcome of Darwinian theory. What Darwinian theory has shown is that Design is an unnecessary explanation as it is one based on ignorance and natural mechanisms exist that explain the data much better. Since ID is also not about explanation but a negative approach, it cannot even serve as a foundation for a competing explanation. It cannot even compete with we don;t know as an explanation.

       So now lets take the final logical step that abuses the concept of analogy. Since natural processes are used by scientists to mimick nature and improve human design, it is clear that human design is an extension of nature, not the other way around.
       <br/>
       ID proponents have gotten it all wrong. Design amongst humans is not evidence of design in nature because we observe how humans have found similar solutions to common problems as has nature, but rather the natural design in nature helps humans formulate human designs.
       <br/>
       That humans have to mimick nature tells us a lot about the power of design in nature. Of course, one should not misunderstand the concept of design with the concept of Purpose or Primary Cause.

       In fact, pointing to two different authors use of a word and not realizing that they are using the term differently does make for equivocation. Its the feinted ignorance of how terms are being used which makes ID such a meaningless excercise. No wonder scientists and Christians alike are joining in rejecting ID.

       Yes, minor, in the overall flow of the discussion. Typical that you would use this deliberate inaccuracy as a pathetic excuse to ignore 90% of what I said, giving you your weak justification to ignore my greater line of argument.

       Typical.
      </p>
      <p>
       That 90% you ignored was my attempt at honest discussion. Interesting that you didnt care how simple Science Avengers one-time scenario was. I tried to make it just a bit more realistic by introducing repeated experiment, and cataloging results in terms of percentages and probable expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for some mysterious reason, that was too simple-minded, even though the one-off experiment that preceded it didnt raise any such concerns amongst you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I deliberately put in the extinction part to see whether you would ignore the minor error and focus on the greater point, or if you would ignore the greater point and focus on the minor error.

      <p>
       So many logical errors here. First of all not all pursuits that have been shown to be erroneous have been scientific in nature. Just because ID asserts that X cannot be explained by Y does not make ID scientifically relevant. In fact, nothing much can be concluded from this observation other than that given our present understanding Y cannot explain X. Such a position is however scientifically vacuous since it at best provides no answers as to how to explain Y and at worst stifles scientific investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain why ID is scientifically vacuous. Its really simple: IDs approach to infer design as the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance does not provide it with any foundation to make positive claims as to how a particular system can be explained. Calling it designed is merely a placeholder for our ignorance. Since ID refuses (actually is unable) to provide a competing explanation, it cannot even compete with  the null hypothesis of we just dont know
      </p>
      <p>
       Is ID self correcting? Not really. Then again, it cannot really correct its ignorance other than by admitting new scientific knowledge and thats just counter productive to the ID thesis which relies on anything but scientific knowledge to make its inferences.

       If the supernatural stops existing then indeed, ID which relies on a non-natural explanation seems to stop existing. Just because ID considers intelligence to be non-natural does of course not make its argument any less objectionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does ID reject theistic evolutionists explanations while seeming to be far more open to for instance young earth creationists? Why do IDers insist on interventionism rather than on front loading? Because of their reading of the bible Id propose. What other reasons do you propose?

       mere projection, troll.

      <p>
       heres your first quiz question:
      </p>
      <p>
       In The Blind Watchmaker, why does Dawkins discuss clay in a riverbed?
      </p>
      <p>
       an even more basic question:
      </p>
      <p>
       what does Dawkins mean exactly, when he uses the expression, Blind Watchmaker?       -what original argument is he referring to, and who made it?
       <br/>
       -why does he say the watchmaker is blind?
      </p>
      <p>
       if you read this, one of his most commonly read works, these will be easy questions to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       i already pointed out the Red Queen hypothesis to you, which is covered in his books, and you apparently havent the slightest clue about, but why dont you tell me what other selection hypotheses are discussed by Dawkins in his books?
       <br/>
       -name at least one.

       I think the Dembski quotation re: Logos theology is a good example of rely[ing] on the Bible to  reject good science. Very succinctly: Good science is not such a restatement. ID is. ID wins.

       I dont suppose that if ID had turned out to be a restatement of, say, Zoroastrian cosmogony, that Dembskis camp would be quite so fired up about it, would they?

        Oriental Christianity, with the Byzantine civilization that was inseparable from it, produced in time a considerable transformation in Russia. The first effect of Christianity was to reform society, and draw closer family ties. It condemned polygamy, and forbade equal divisions between the children of a slave and those of the lawful wife. Society resisted this new principle for some time. Saint Vladimir, even after his conversion, divided his possessions equally among the children the Church regarded as natural and those she considered legitimate. In the long run Christianity prevailed, and by the abolition of polygamy the Russian family ceased to be Asiatic, and became European. Christianity prescribed new virtues, and gave the ancient barbaric virtues of hospitality and benevolence a more elevated character.

       Because the professors and historians back up my claims solidly.  Thats where Ive been getting the information  as well as from Holocaust survivors themselves.

       Dont believe me?  Read the huge amount of books, articles and papers theyve been publishing on the subject since 1933.  The Nazis didnt kill Jews, Commies, gays, Gypsies, blacks, Slavs, the mentally retarded and the malformed because of anything Darwinists wrote; they did it because they were flaming racists, and sold their racism as the solution to their countrys problems.  Blaming Darwinists for any of this is both stupid and evil.

        Does your ignorance of ID know no bounds? Michael Behe says that he has no reason to not believe that the earth and the universe are the billions of years old that geologists and cosmologists respectively say they are.

      </p>
      <p>
       Does Behe say this to the creationists who pay his wages?  Behe himself may say this, but ID theory explicitly refuses to take a position the subject, for fear of alienating their YEC supporters.  For the same reason, they also explicitly refuse to engage in ANY speculation about the nature and purposes of their Designer.

       How would you like it if your had to spend upwards of forty grand a year for four years sitting in Christian catechisms written in the most abstruse, boring style imaginable and since you have to take exams, you really do have to pay attention in order to get some magic sheet of paper that allows you to enter a myriad of professions. To add insult to injury, lets suppose these churches providing this service were given ever-increasing amounts of government money because what youre paying them just aint enough. How would you and your fellow Darwiniacs like that?

       No, the important distinction here comes from within engineering; it is the difference between the processes of requirements definition and of design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, the selection pressure and the conditions are the requirements. They are indeed purposefully determined, but determining them is not part of design (at least, not to an engineer.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The design process is the process of determining the components that will comprise a system such that the resulting system meets the defined requirements. Here, the evolutionary process performs the design.

       Hes referring to William Paleys argument from design, intended to provide evidence of Gods existence.

       Dawkins writes that the creative force of organisms complexity, natural selection, is the blind watchmaker, because natural selection does indeed create complex life forms, but is a blind process, having no goals or foreknowledge or grand plan or vision (either literal or metaphorical).

        Let me explain why ID is scientifically vacuous. Its really simple: IDs approach to infer design as the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance does not provide it with any foundation to make positive claims as to how a particular system can be explained.

       The Darwinian model led to the claim that 98% of the human genome was junk. ID predicted that junk DNA would prove to have function, and such has been shown to be the case.

       No, here is where I point out, while sitting camly, that youre not dealing with the issue, youre trying to weasel your way out of it. You said: to claim that ID relies on the Bible is simply absurd, and reveals abject ignorance on your part.
       <br/>
       And I pulled out Dembskis words, which, I guess youre claiming that they shouldnt be construed as a definitive statement of IDeology. I guess next youll tell PvM that Dembskis words arent holy writ by way of weaseling out of your argument with him, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, its nothing but misdirection to keep holding me to things I didnt write, and have no control over, especially when the context is lost. Following Steve Reuland: yes, Science Avenger and I have made different points, each of us choosing to focus on a different set of the many abject failures of your argument. But SA and I do not have fundamental disagreements about what Darwinian processes can accomplish and in what domains they operate. There is where the argument lies, not in your facility with dredging up snippets in a feeble attempt to portray your adversaries as inconsistant or dishonest.

       Nope. I explained that the Dembski quote doesnt show any reliance on the Bible on IDs part, regardless of your protestations to the contrary. If X restates something that Y states, that isnt evidence that X
       <em>
        depends on
       </em>
       Y. They are simply different explanations of phenomena. In one case, its logos theology, in another, information theory.

      <p>
       Two different explanations for the existence of information in the genome, for example.

       Behe and Meyer both state that ID depends on scientific evidence, not holy writ.

        How would you like it if your had to spend upwards of forty grand a year for four years sitting in Christian catechisms written in the most abstruse, boring style imaginable and since you have to take exams, you really do have to pay attention in order to get some magic sheet of paper that allows you to enter a myriad of professions.

       If this is truly a reflection of your experiences at university I am amazed that you managed to find a place so awful. I think it is much more likely that you are just being inventive. I cannot recall any of your posts that has shown the slightest evidence of a university education, most of them consisting of insults and no substance. In fact, based on the amount of invective I see in your posts, the impression I get is that you have a deep fear of educational institutions and educated people. Are you the odd one out in a family of educated people?

      <p>
       Seems that you have somewhat uncritically accepted these claims by the creationists and yet, a little background research mixed with the application of reason and logic and you would have come to realize that the facts are slightly different than portrayed by IC creationists
      </p>
      <p>
       1. It was not the Darwinian model which led to the claim that 98% of the human genome was junk, it was the neutral model which led to such a claim.
       <br/>
       2. Junk DNA was originally used to refer to pseudo genes, which are genes which have lost function due to mutations. Only later was it used, somewhat unfortunately to refer to all DNA that was non-coding for proteins.
       <br/>
       3. However, people already realized that the term was unfortunate as it would lead to confusions that this DNA had no function at all. In fact scientists already realized that regulatory parts of the gene were part of this junk DNA. In addition, scientists knew that there were long stretches of well conserved junk DNA and Darwinian theory suggested that these DNA thus should have some function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we come to the claim that ID predicted function for junk DNA. First of all, history will show that it was creationists who came up with this prediction not ID. In fact, remember that ID is nothing more than the set theoretic complement of chance and regularity. Or in case of junk DNA, it accepted, as did science, that junk DNA remained largely unexplained. Yet, ID suggested that this unexplained DNA somehow was relevant to the ID thesis, which it was not. ID first of all had no logical foundation for making this prediction beyond pointing to our ignorance. In fact, in order to make the claim that junk dna should have function, ID had to make assumptions about the designer, and ID is clear that it is in no position to do so. In fact, it was creationist assumptions about the Designer which led to the prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, lets not be fooled by this ignorant claim that ID somehow predicted junk DNA to have function. Also realize that since we know have found function for some Junk DNA (IDers have contributed little to this), we now know that the evidence of ID is even less since another gap in our knowledge (chance and regularity processes) has been filled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope this clarifies the scientific vacuity of ID in some accessible terms?

       Its worse than that, we already know that humans possess an incredibly sensitive detection filter which over generates false positives and thus makes the design inference likely to be useless.
       <br/>
       Combine this with a predisposition that enforces seeing design and one has a recipe for disaster, theologically speaking as well as scientifically speaking. That disaster is also known by the term intelligent design which is nothing more than what remains when we have eliminated known hypothetical pathways. In fact, as Dembski had to admit, a design detection does mean little for the concept of agency with cannot even exclude natural selection as the agent.
       <br/>
       In other words, ID proponents seem to be unaware of the shakey foundations of their own theory

       Nope, its okay to be motivated by atheism, christianity etc, but the problem is when such faith becomes the foundation for science rather than merely a motivator.

       The reason why IDs thesis is conflated with their motivations is because they claim, erroneously, that they have a scientific theory which can accurately detect design. Through equivocation and conflation, they then confuse design with Design and then Designer.

       On the contrary, Darwin accepted design and explained it in scientific terms. Unlike ID which has remained scientifically without any merits, Darwinian evolution started a revolution in science.

        Nope. On the contrary, thats what you guys do, confuse design with Design and then Designer, in order to make the vacuous claims you do (ID is religion, or is based on religion, ad nauseam)

      <p>
       Actually, the story is a bit more subtle so let me help you here. ID failed to be scientifically relevant, ID is founded in a belief that materialism should be replaced with God (see the Wedge) and that ID can provide a sufficient scientific foundation. Now that ID has failed scientifically, all that remains is the history of ID which points, as the judge in Kitzmiller so carefully pointed out, to a rich Christian tradition. Combine that with the findings that ID is scientifically vacuous and you come to realize why ID is theologically most relevant and most dangerous. Which is why theologians are often quick to reject ID.

       Too bad this thread got derailed by the Evolution = Eugenics idiots.  Eugenics is not descended from evolutionary theory, but has been described in classic literature going back to the days of the Greeks.  Plato mentions eugenic concepts in The Republic and the Spartans, as a city-state, practiced eugenics.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Selective breeding was suggested at least as far back as Plato, who believed human reproduction should be controlled by government. He recorded these ideals in The Republic: The best men must have intercourse with the best women as frequently as possible, and the opposite is true of the very inferior. Plato proposed that the process be concealed from the public via a form of lottery. Other ancient examples include Spartas purported practice of infanticide. However, they would leave all babies outside for a length of time, and the survivors were considered stronger, while many weaker babies perished.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One, of many, many, many historical examples.  And, forget the Greeks if you will, these ideas have been invented in many a culture before Darwin came up with his Theory of Evolution and his (religious) cousin Galton, a Quaker, took it to further expand western ideas in eugenics.  Anyway, thanks for ruining the thread.  Not.

       Darwin was ignorant of many things, but thats different than using the argument from ignorance: this is the flawed approach of ID. Namely, I dont see how a natural process can come up with this design. Therefore, an unnatural process must have done it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nitpick granted: PvM did contradict himself by overloading the term design. I think he meant Combine this with a predisposition that enforces seeing
       <strong>
        teleology
       </strong>
       and one has a recipe for disaster. PvM, correct my putting words in your mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as has been pointed out, design is an overloaded term, sometimes including teleology and sometimes not. The ID crowd overloads the term as well.

       So far your defense seems to be ineffective. Let me ask again. Is this the best ID has to offer? Focus my dear friend, focus. This is your moment to shine. If ID is unable to shine on its own and depends on faith and belief, then perhaps ID is not really that relevant after all.

       Now we are getting somewhere. At least C Bass is not trying to defend the vacuity of ID but believes erroneously that evolution is based on similar ignorance. Lets explore this in some detail. For instance, evolution needs to explain the origin of information in the genome. How does it explain this? Contrary to IDs predictions complex specified information can arise via the processes of variation and selection (Adami, Schneider, Ofria and others).

       Teleology is also an overloaded term, see Mayr and Ayala for instance who argue that teleology is the inevitable outcome of variation and selection for function.

       I am comparing IDs version of design which is the set theoretic complement of chance and regularity with Darwin proposing a positive mechanism of agency, namely natural selection. Of course, like any scientist, Darwin was ignorant of many details but that did not stop him from being scientifically relevant. While many people of his day were still assigning a creative role to one or more unnamed designers, Darwin lifted part of the veil of ignorance with his proposals.
       <br/>
       You may as well ask: How does ID explain X and the answer is simple: ID is not in the business of explaining anythingIt just has defined our ignorance to be design and thats it.

       That humans have been able to put some of the features evolution has uncovered should come as no surprise, to see this however as evidence of design misses the point. ID provides no explanations, no predictions, nothing other than to point out that it looks designed because we do not yet know how it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists have taken a similar position: It is indeed a product of design and the designers are variation, natural selection, drift and many other mechanisms which are variations on the same theme. Remember that IDs design inference is merely the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance or that which remains when we have eliminated known hypotheses. In other words, we dont know. Historically, design has been inferred to explain lightning, volcanoes and you name it Luckily science escaped its ignorance of those days and found natural explanations for these phenomena.

       ID in the mean time had relocate itself to hide in the ever smaller shadows of our ignorance.

       Gee, I wonder why so many of us do that.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that nearly all of the people who call themselves design proponents used to call themselves creationists, and are using the whole intelligent design schtick as an excuse to get their creation-stories taught as science.  Then, too, theres the fact that most of the politicians who are pushing to have intelligent design taught in science classes, have explicitly justified their actions on religious grounds.  Not only that, but we have lots of intelligent design arguments that sound eerily similar to creationist arguments, with nothing changed but the titles (hint: thats where the phrase cdesign proponentsists comes from, which you refuse to admit when its waved in your face).

        How would you like it if your had to spend upwards of forty grand a year for four years sitting in Christian catechisms written in the most abstruse, boring style imaginable and since you have to take exams, you really do have to pay attention in order to get some magic sheet of paper that allows you to enter a myriad of professions.

        If this is truly a reflection of your experiences at university I am amazed that you managed to find a place so awful. I think it is much more likely that you are just being inventive. I cannot recall any of your posts that has shown the slightest evidence of a university education, most of them consisting of insults and no substance. In fact, based on the amount of invective I see in your posts, the impression I get is that you have a deep fear of educational institutions and educated people. Are you the odd one out in a family of educated people?

       C Bass  The middle age warm period was largely restricted to Europe. Not global. As for the current warming:
      </p>
      <p>
       Carbon dioxide is a so-called greenhouse gas. The physics behind this statement has been well understood for over a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       By burning fossil carbon, humans have put and are continuing to put a huge slug of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide content grows yearly, by direct measurements for over 50 years now. By radiocarbon techniques this excess is fossil carbon. Economic data shows humans are consuming fossil fuels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the climate has warmed and will continue to warm. This warmth is entirely due to anthropogenic causes.

      <p>
       Global warming as a result of increasing CO2 has been predicted for a long time (I first heard of it as an agricultural botany student in the 1960s). For it not to be taking place, there must be some major physical process remaining to be discovered.

      <p>
       Very good questions and the answer is a simple no. And I do understand how such arguments may sound like compelling evidence against the anthropogenic global warming but this is based on an overly simplistic view of nature. First of all, there are many components which affect the global temperature. For instance the global warming on Mars seems to be nothing more than summer arriving. However, when one relies on popular science sources for ones information, one may not be familiar as to how science explains these observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realclimate provides us with some
       <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=192" rel="nofollow external nofollow">
        good starting materials
       </a>
       which will allow us to do our homework. Now I am very aware of the few who have argued that solar input variations or solar spots are causing global warming but none of these have withstood closer scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the global warming of the middle ages, I fail to see the relevance. But perhaps you can explain

        The fact that you reply the way you did (they are of course right) tells me all I need to know

        Sure, the earth is getting warmer, but the claim that man is causing it is questionable, at the very least.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On the contrary, the claim that man is causing it has been quite solidly established. Now I understand that global warming deniers and evolution deniers seem to largely overlap. However my interest in debunking ignorance has prepared me well to address both of these issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all we have the observation that the temperature has been increasing
       <br/>
       Second of all we have the observation that humans have caused an increase in the CO2 emissions
       <br/>
       Thirdly we have evidence that these human contributions are essential to accurately model the temperature records
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, we have mechanism, cause and effect, exactly as predicted from theory, models and data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why it is that evolution deniers seem to also be found of global warming denial is beyond me. Is it their belief that controversial ideas must somehow be more correct? Is it a more general tendency to be fooled once, and fooled again? I am not sure. But the trend certainly seems worrisome to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought I would never have the opportunity to expose the scientific vacuity of ID and global warming denial in one single thread. I do thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so.

       Yes, I think C Bass has been a nice gift. Hes leaving all the same logical loose ends as ID, which puts him in a category above Sal in my book. Sal just sort of wraps the loose ends into each other by changing the subjects and getting offended by our straw-men.

        Yes, and if youd been doing something other than the equivalent of puting your fingers in your ears while PvM was addressing your argument, you would know that this important concession means ID cant even eliminate natural selection as the designer

       Whats interesting is that PvM consistently refers to ID as being nothing more than the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance, which kinda suggests the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of natural selection, and now you guys claim that it could be natural selection (i.e. natural selection cannot be eliminated). If thats the case, then PvM is wrong to call it the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it? Does ID include NS or is it the set theoretical compliment of NS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is NS somehow

        Explain how this isnt what SETI is looking for. After all, SETI isnt looking for regularity, otherwise pulsars would fill the bill. They arent looking for chance, for that would be random noise, novae, etc. Since they are looking for neither random noise nor regularity, whats left over? The set theoretic compliment of the two.

         ID doesnt make any inferences with regard to the designer, only with regard to design. By introducing human design, you crossed that line from valid scientific inference based on the data over into speculation on the nature of the designer. Ergo, the rest of your argument is invalid.

        Before I proceed, however, I note that Dembski makes an important concession to his critics. He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency (TDI, 227, my emphasis).

       See how contradictory ID really is when it comes to agency? I quoted Nichols quote from Dembski.
       <br/>
       ID is indeed nothing more than the set theoretic complement of regularity and chance. To infer agency, a second, inductive step, is needed which as Wesley Elsberry and others have shown cannot even exclude natural selection as a designer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Confused? Such is the foundation of ID which makes it scientifically vacuous. Seems C Bass was caught in the nets of IDs ignorance as well.

       Gosh, C Bass, if I didnt know better, Id almost think you sincerely wanted to understand natural selection instead of the straw man foisted off on you by the ID crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dembskis mumbled formulation of the EF does indeed sound kinda like it should exclude natural selection, indeed, because thats all its supposed to do: sound good to the rubes. In fact, its an extremely weak claim, and since he categorically will not consider any attributes, including the I in ID, of any putative designer, he cant exclude natural selection, because it is neither simply chance, nor is it randomness-free regularity, but a process that relies on both these aspects of existence in order to do its design work.

       In other papers, Dembski has shown why Natural Selection, which choses from possible outcomes indeed seems very similar to an intelligent designer. In fact, thats why we call it apparent versus actual Design. Dembskis filter does nothing to differentiate between the two. Nothing at all

        The apparent, but unstated, logic behind the move from design to agency can be given as follows:
       </p>
       <p>
        1. There exists an attribute in common of some subset of objects known to be designed by an intelligent agent.
        <br/>
        2. This attribute is never found in objects known not to be designed by an intelligent agent.
        <br/>
        3. The attribute encapsulates the property of directed contingency or choice.
        <br/>
        4. For all objects, if this attribute is found in an object, then we may conclude that the object was designed by an intelligent agent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an inductive argument. Notice that by the second step, one must eliminate from consideration precisely those biological phenomena which Dembski wishes to categorize. In order to conclude intelligent agency for biological examples, the possibility that intelligent agency is not operative is excluded a priori. One large problem is that directed contingency or choice is not solely an attribute of events due to the intervention of an intelligent agent. The actualization-exclusion-specification triad mentioned above also fits natural selection rather precisely. One might thus conclude that Dembskis argument establishes that natural selection can be recognized as an intelligent agent.

       There are actually a variety of causes of global climate change.  Solar changes (from what I understand - this is farthest from my area of expertise) can alter climate over billions of years.  Tectonic changes can alter climate on timescales of millions to hundreds of millions of years.  Changes in the earths orbit can periodicaly alter climate over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.  Changes in oceanic circulation can alter climate, and even weather, over timescales of years to thousands of years.  All of these have been extensively researched, are well understood in most cases (and incidentally, havent been ascribed to supernatural causes).  We also have a good (not perfect, but good) understanding of the physics of the atmosphere that allows us to know that the earths temperature would be near -30oC as a direct result of greenhouse gases.

       The above paragraph is a distillation of the work of thousands of astronomers, climatologists, geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers and physicists over many years.  It is backed up by decades of accumulated data, has been extensively debated in the literature, and there by and large is concensus that these systems are well enough understood that we can make reliable predictions about our climate.

       There are many causes for long-term climate change.  But you are weaseling about climate change:

       This is typical of people with entrenched beliefs.  You admit that man does contribute, but you say that the contribution does not cause the change.  Then, you say that even if it does, its not the main effect.  Youre trying to have it both ways.

       <br/>
       Do you think that adding another blanket on your bed will make you warmer?
       <br/>
       What about the concept of anthropogenically-caused climate change makes you uncomfortable?  If its possible damage to our economy, then youre simply engaged in wishful thinking.

        1. There exists an attribute in common of some subset of objects known to be designed by an intelligent agent.

        2. This attribute is never found in objects known not to be designed by an intelligent agent.

        3. The attribute encapsulates the property of directed contingency or choice.

        4. For all objects, if this attribute is found in an object, then we may conclude that the object was designed by an intelligent agent.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an inductive argument. Notice that by the second step, one must eliminate from consideration precisely those biological phenomena which Dembski wishes to categorize. In order to conclude intelligent agency for biological examples, the possibility that intelligent agency is not operative is excluded a priori.

       Looking at #2, it occurs to me that Elsberry is reading into it more than is actually there. When he says, Notice that by the second step, one must eliminate from consideration precisely those biological phenomena which Dembski wishes to categorize, he is
       <strong>
        assuming
        <em>
         a priori
        </em>
       </strong>
       that the biological phenomena in question are, in fact, not designed by an intelligent agent. His argument is therefore circular. By assuming up front that the objects of interest are products of Natural Selection, they are eliminated by step #2. If that assumption is not made up front, step #2 fails to eliminate them from consideration. In other words, we do not
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       that the objects in question are not designed by an intelligent agent, so step #2 doesnt eliminate those objects from consideration, as Elsberry claims. Elsberrys claim can only hold true if the objects in question are assumed not to be products of intelligent agency.

       Loathe as I am to reenter the Trollathon, Guyefeax had the fish on the mat and let him up.  Lets just expose the absurdity of the ID position at its roots:

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Guye correctly noted that this should be human design, not just design.  If we observe X being derived from Y 100% of the time, then ALL of the traits of Y are relevant, not just the ones that suit ones agenda.  Thus, since ALL of the observations of design noted in the ID definition were the product of human design, the see-it-in-nature conclusion would be that said feature was designed by humans.  And of course, C Bass refutes this theory nicely by noting that these features predated humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       One does not have the option of positing a non-human designer.  We have no precedant for that in the non-religious world that ID supposedly occupies.  That is crossing that line from valid scientific inference based on the data over into speculation on the nature of the designer, since the data involve only human design.  C Basss objection is completely backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more basically, those things observed in nature do NOT look like human design!  Not at all.  Human design involves radical novelty, and borrowing of succesful items from other areas (Glen Davidson has a nice list, perhaps he will again share).  Think of the transition from 8-track to cassette tape to CD.  Nothing in nature looks like that.  Likewise, nothing in human invention looks like the pandas thumb, a crude adaption of an existing feature, even though a much better feature is available if one simply reaches across categories.  Nature cant do that, thus the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ID is flawed at its core.  Its most fundamental tenets are untenable, and no amount of word games can change that.

       The fact that the consequence of IDs inference, as you stated it is contradicted by the evidence  cannot possibly be Y  means that the inference was wrong. Which is what were saying.

      <p>
       Wherein I (and you) pointed out that this leads to conclusions which are contrary to evidence. Therefore the inference, which I claim is the logical foundation of ID, is wrong. So now you have to provide the actual logical foundation which generated your statement of ID. You said that this is a simple derivation of the principle of uniformity; please state which one youre talking about that

       Balderdash. The increase has been far too much to have come from some previously unknown source. The claims that volcanoes are significant producers is pure myth. How about from the oceans?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that as each ice age ended (because of changes in the earths orbit) the gradual warming released CO2 from the oceans. However, the current increase in CO2 has been clearly shown to come from burning of fossil fuels (e.g. from the changing proportion of 14C in the atmosphere and a comparison of the amount burnt to the amount of extra CO2) and is far too large to have come from the oceans. Besides, the amount in the oceans is currently increasing, which is why they are becoming more acidic. So rule out oceans as a source.

      <p>
       Whats left? Swarms of invisible dry ice meteors?

       Lets face it, you are frantically trying to find ways to justify your refusal to accept two of the most important findings of modern science - evolution and global warming - by giving more and more nonsensical excuses. Why? What is your motive in this? Dont tell me it is in the spirit of open inquiry because it clearly isnt.

      <p>
       BTW: Do you realize that a significant proportion of climatologists consider the recent IPCC report, that you apparently consider a sign of hysteria, is far too cautious?

       We have discovered what looks like piles of elephant shit on the Moon.  Whenever weve seen this particular feature on earth, it has always been a product of elephant anuses, so when we see it on the moon, it is likely also a product of elephant anuses.    However, these piles appear where there are no elephants, so that hypothesis is falsified.  It seems that positing a non-elephant anus would be our only option.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not make any inferences with regard to the posessor of the anus, only with regard to the anus itself.  If we introduced elephant anuses into the analysis, wed cross that line from valid scientific inference based on the data over into speculation on the nature of the anus possessor, which would be invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our theory is science.  It has nothing whatever to do with Anusism, the religion that worships a free-floating, all-powerful, immaterial anus.  Also, anyone who disagrees with us is obviously an a-anusist.

       It seems to me that our skeptical friend C Bass, tends to be selectively skeptical. In fact, ironically, he seems to reject the design inference when it comes to global warming. After all, look at it this way: Global warming is complex and specified and we have no regularity and chance explanation (other than just so stories like -perhaps CO2 increases followed the warming or -solar spots solar spots), thus it seems quite logical to draw a design inference that humans are involved (or perhaps our God is angry with our treatment of the environment?, or perhaps its aliens after all).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, even when realizing how controversies only apply when it suits ID proponents, science has done far more than rely on our ignorance to link global warming to human activities and it is ignorance which causes once again global warming deniers to avoid the obvious conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why? Because of a distrust of science How ironic then to come to realize that it is IDers and global warming deniers who are abusing science.
       <br/>
       Notice that, as is the case with ID, there are no real mechanisms, or explanations beyond suggestions that science may be wrong

       It could be aliens as well. The difference is that if one proposes an alternative, one shows that it explains the data better.

       Show how your scenario explains the observed temperature response better than using the models which incorporate natural and anthropogenic forcings, which match the temperature response quite closely.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, we know that CO2 is being released in sufficiently large quantities to explain the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere, just from anthropogenic sources.

      <p>
       If you want to be a true skeptic then do the hard work that is required from such a position. Relying on some quote mining of popular science and global warming deniers fiction seems hardly worth the term skeptic.

       C Bass seems to have left the building. His arguments would have made DaveScot proud but ignorance is hard to continue if you do not control who gets to post and whose postings get deleted.

       Ignorance can only survive in the shadows and UcD seems to be quite an appropriate place for this.

       I suspect it starts with a dislike of (some of) the conclusions of science. With global warming theory, I expect that most (maybe all) of those who accept that theory also dislike its conclusions (I know
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       dislike those conclusions). Yet the deniers would have us think its supported because people

        |Besides explaining it away, there are two main options for explaining the net increase in information that an assisted search brings to an otherwise blind search. One is that an assisted search is intelligently designed by a purposive agent (cf. engineering). The other is that it is a fortuitous gift bestowed by an environment under the control of stochastic mechanisms (cf. evolutionary biology). I will argue that this latter option is inadequate and that the increase in information captured by I(0|U) is properly viewed as the result of a form of intelligence that cannot be reduced to stochastic mechanisms.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So far so good, Dembski has accepted that there are indeed two explanations for assisted search, one involves an intelligent agent that has purpose in mind, the other an intelligent agent that has function in mind. Now Dembski argues that the latter one is inadequate but thats where the trouble starts. Remember that even if Dembski were to show that the latter is inadequate, the same problem arises when moving from design to agent as outlined by Elsberry.

       <p>
        By intelligence, here, I mean something quite definite, namely, the causal factors that change one probability distribution into another and thus, in the  present discussion, transform a blind search into an assisted search. A logically equivalent, information-theoretic reformulation of this definition takes intelligence as those causal factors that induce a net increase in information as measured by the information measure I. Note that by a stochastic mechanism, here, I mean any causal process governed exclusively by the interplay between chance and necessity and characterized by unbroken deterministic and nondeterministic
        <br/>
        laws.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But it its exactly that what selection does: It changes one probability function into another by transferring information from the environment into the genome. Causal factors and unbroken deterministic and non-deterministic laws are for all practical purposes the same. Both the intelligent designer with purpose in mind and the intelligent designer with function in mind work through the same processes. So either we accept that neither can increase information, or we accept that both can create information. Of course there is the third, unstated message, namely that information has to be supernatural. But the latter one is easily rejected as a meaningless concept. Even though Dembski has suggested some pretty flawed concepts how supernatural information can be transferred (showing a unique unfamiliarity on his part with science and engineering concepts).

       <p>
        This definition of intelligence as the causal factors responsible for changes  in probabilities or, equivalently, for net increases in information is noncircular and, on reflection, should seem unproblematic. If there is a problem, it concerns whether intelligence is reducible to stochastic mechanisms. The neo-Darwinian
        <br/>
        theory of evolution, for instance, purports to account for biological complexity and diversity through an intelligence that is a stochastic mechanism, namely, the joint action of natural selection and random genetic mutations. To be sure, this mechanism operates in nature and is responsible for significant changes in the
        <br/>
        biological world. Nevertheless, is it the case that this mechanism accounts for biological complexity and diversity without remainder? In other words, is the intelligence responsible for biological complexity and diversity entirely reducible to this mechanism?
        <br/>
        In general, to justify the reduction of intelligence to stochastic mechanisms, these mechanisms need to supply a complete, self-consistent account of how changes in probability or net increases in information arise. As we shall see, the mathematics of blind and assisted searches precludes such an account, whether for neo-Darwinian assisted searches or for assisted searches in general
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Assisted searches in general Wow Seems that Dembski has just proven that intelligence cannot increase information either. In fact, thats what the displacement theorem suggests.

      <p>
       Do ID proponents even attempt to comprehend the impact of Dembskis own claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw there is a simple solution to Dembskis conundrum and there is sufficient evidence that evolution indeed contains this solution More on that later. Needless to say, Dembskis attempts once again fail to deliver much but forces him to make more admissions than many IDers seem to be familiar with.

       all that is necessitated is that the designer is supranatural our outside natural explanations. If something cannot be explained by regularity and chance, in other words, there are no explanatory pathways then the clear conclusion is either 1) we dont know 2) super natural.

       Its self evident from the writings of IDists, once they drop their veil a little. The rest is just window dressing to confuse its followers. Such as the fact that most ID proponents seem to be unfamiliar with Dembskis statements such as
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Before I proceed, however, I note that Dembski makes an important concession to his critics. He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency (TDI, 227, my emphasis).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So how come IDers are still confusing the design inference with agency/agent? How is the inference from design inference to agency made? Elsberry explains why this step cannot exclude natural selection.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        , Dembski brushes off a criticism concerning the reliability of his explanatory filter by noting that the objection is the problem of induction, but fails to either solve the problem of induction or retract the claim of reliability. In other places, Dembski fails to take up the arguments of critics, as in Dembskis mischaracterization of a program written by Richard Dawkins. Two out of three of the steps that Dembski says characterize the program are, in fact, Dembskis own invention, appearing nowhere in Dawkinss work. The sad thing is that criticism of precisely this point was made by me in email to Dembski back in October of 2000. It would have been easy for Dembski to fix, but it did not happen.

       You think Dembskis being misrepresented. Why dont you lay out the Explanatory Filter you know, this good version that isnt being fairly presented and explain how it avoids the logical conclusion at which PvM arrives. Its not enough to say the obvious, that Dembski never intended for anyone to look behind the curtain. You have to show that there really is nothing behind the curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, explain how Dembski, with his mumblings about the displacement theorem, doesnt manage to end up showing that stochastic mechanisms cant create new information and intelligence cant either. (Hint: that quotation is just up a bit, in comment #172181)

       This is simply incorrect. Its that cognitive dissonance again, where the letters ID get translated into God in the brain of the ID critic. You even claim that its self evident. Well, if you suffer from cognitive dissonance, I guess it would be.

       Its called Intelligent Design, but you guys insist on thinking of it as Supernatural Design.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, the Wedge Document doesnt help your case. That document is talking about the philosophy of materialism, replacing the materialist philosophy with one that allows non-materialistic explanations to be considered. And no, that does not mean supernatural explanations, unless you would contend that apes and dolphins and other organisms which exhibit the property we call intelligence are supernatural creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a false dichotomy between human-like intelligence and supernatural intelligence. The possibility of merely superior intelligence (such as what SETI might encounter) never seems to be considered, or allowed for consideration.

       Which IDers would those be? It appears that its primarily IDs critics who confuse  the design inference with agency/agent, every time they insist that the designer be supernatural, or every time they insist that ID is a religion.

      <p>
       The real question is why you feel compelled to attach so much import to the explanatory filter to begin with. Perhaps its merely because you see it as a weak link (or weak pillar, if you prefer), but its just a tool, not the end-all-and-be-all of the ID hypothesis. As I see it, its merely an attempt to quantify, or make rigorous, that which we do rather intuitively, namely, recognize deliberate design. As such, I see it as a work in progress, but then, I personally am not hung up on it the way you guys are. I havent read up on it beyond what Dembski wrote in
       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        The Design Revolution
       </span>
        I havent read
       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        The Design Inference
       </span>
       , for example, nor have I read
       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        No Free Lunch
       </span>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But the real problem is not that you are misrepresenting the EF, but that you are twisting Dembksis words before you even
       <em>
        get to
       </em>
       the EF. When Dembski writes stochastic process, for example, PvM twists that into intelligent agent that has function in mind. He then uses that rhetoric to justify the logical conclusion that is based on assuming that conclusion to be true up front. In other words, he engages in circular logic. Sure, he uses scare quotes to give himself an escape hatch, but the implication is clear  natural selection is an intelligent agent, even before the logical path, leading to the conclusion that the intelligent agent can be natural selection, is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       PvM also claims:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p class="kw_author">
        PvM wrote:
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the intelligent designer with purpose in mind and the intelligent designer with function in mind work through the same processes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By now, hes lost the scare quotes, but the implication that natural selection and intelligent agency work through the same processes is simply unwarranted. But its on subtle word games (ironic, no?) and cleverly applied logic which PvMs argument relies. The assertion above is tenable at any level only when we assume up front that natural selection is an intelligent agent, either with or without scare quotes, and
       <em>
        assume
       </em>
       that all intelligent agents work through the same [or at least similar] processes. But then, even
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       assumption is unwarranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neo-Darwinian evolution assumes that natural selection acts on variation,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of which is
       <em>
        random
       </em>
       , and has no goals, not even survival. After all, natural selection can conceivably bring about the extinction of a species (which, as the fossil record clearly indicates, has indeed happened a number of times). Intelligent Design, on the other hand, asserts that
       <em>
        at least some
       </em>
       variation is
       <em>
        planned
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        guided
       </em>
       to a
       <em>
        predetermined
       </em>
       (i.e. specified) outcome. The two concepts couldnt be more different, but you are utterly blind to that difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you can take this opportunity to claim that ID can lead to extinction as well, and you would be correct, but the question then becomes, was extinction the
       <em>
        goal
       </em>
       of the designer, or was it an
       <em>
        accident
       </em>
       ? In the case of natural selection, this question simply has no meaning, as natural selection has no goals, not even survival or fitness, unless you consciously choose to anthropomorphize natural selection to the absurd level where it does have goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       And another point you guys seem reluctant to grasp is that, if Dawkins words and Darwins words are not holy writ, then neither are Dembskis.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the Global Warming debacle is concerned, I will just bide my time. Maybe the scientific consensus managed to get it right, this time, but I lived through the population explosion, DDT, global cooling, AIDS going mainstream, Asian flu, swine flu, bird flu, and managed to survive them all. In hindsight, it seems that some of those Chicken-Little-Sky-Is-Falling end-of-the-world prognostications were politically motivated. So it has nothing to do with not liking what the scientific consensus says, as someone so naively suggested. No, its just that youve cried wolf too damned many times, and youve simply lost credibility.

       No, what I use this observation to note again is that you are positing a non-human designer without any evidence of such.

I find it distasteful to even dignify it with a reply, but, again, your introduction of elephant-like (or human like) is a red herring. You yourself point out that elephants dont appear, so introducing elephants is unwarranted.

      <p>
       I use such stories to illustrate how irrational and downright idiotic your arguments are.  I made my elephant shit on the moon argument using your exact words, merely substituting terms.  That it looks ridiculous to you (and everyone else) does indeed prove my case, because positing design independent of humans
       <strong>
        IS
       </strong>
       just as idiotic as positing an anus creating elephant shit that isnt attached to an elephant.

       The evidence is the nanotechnology exhibited in the cell.

       That is not evidence, for either position. That is the question under consideration (albeit restated in teleologically loaded jargon). Its what were trying to explain in the first place.

       If you can answer my previous question, that would be great. Ill rephrase it: in your statement of ID (the so-called positive case):
      </p>
      <blockquote class="kw_quote">
       <p>
        Whenever weve seen this particular feature, it has always been a product of [Q] design, ergo, when we see it in nature, it is likely also a product of [Q] design.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What qualifiers Q are we allowed to logically put on design? I put the Qs into your statement to remind you that these qualifiers must appear in both the antecedent and the consequent as per ScienceAvengers point. Be careful, Ive laid a trap: if you say there are no qualifiers Q above for design, then design becomes a meaningless term. This means that in general no predictions are possible using design, and in particular there is nothing to distinguish design from any other process like NS+RM.

       OK yah bass, I would like some explanation of this paragraph:
       <br/>
       
       <br/>
       And no, the Wedge Document doesnt help your case. That document is talking about the philosophy of materialism, replacing the materialist philosophy with one that allows non-materialistic explanations to be considered. And no, that does not mean supernatural explanations, unless you would contend that apes and dolphins and other organisms which exhibit the property we call intelligence are supernatural creatures.
       <br/>
       
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, what is this philosophy of materialism that is used in science?  As far as I am aware, it is methodological naturalism.  Where do you get the idea that we use philosophical materialism?
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, what are non-materialistic explanations for something?  Give me examples, now.

       <em>
        Its called Intelligent Design, but you guys insist on thinking of it as Supernatural Design.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two reasons for this conflation, both of which you already know, but cant bear to admit: first, the ID folks themselves claim supernatural agency, to excuse both their refusal to describe a specific mechanism of creation, and their lack of material evidence for such a process of creation; and second, you yourself insist that were wrong to rule out non-materialistic  which is to say
       <em>
        supernatural
       </em>
        explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        And no, the Wedge Document doesnt help your case. That document is talking about the philosophy of materialism, replacing the materialist philosophy with one that allows non-materialistic explanations to be considered. And no, that does not mean supernatural explanations
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wedge Document explicitly calls for replacing materialism with a theistic understanding.  It dont get more supernatural than that.  And even if it didnt, theres no difference between non-materialistic and supernatural.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        There is a false dichotomy between human-like intelligence and supernatural intelligence. The possibility of merely superior intelligence (such as what SETI might encounter) never seems to be considered, or allowed for consideration.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually it HAS been considered, for DECADES  ever heard of a guy named Von Daniken?  and repeatedly ruled out due to lack of evidence.
      </p>

       Youre a lying idiot, fish-boy, flogging a fake theory on an old thread and pretending you cant see whats been obvious to the rest of us for years.

      <p>
       There is no nanotechnology in cells, no rotary motors, and no data storage and replication systems.  Those are analogies to man-made items which help illustrate aspects of these things, but they are not what they are.  The flagellum may have some similar traits to rotary motors, but it is
       <strong>
        NOT
       </strong>
       a rotary motor.
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes the accurate version of your argument not whenever we see design, but rather whenever we see something analogous to design, and there of course it breaks down because there are many undesigned things that appear designed.  Until you guys can take Dembskis explanatory filter, or something similar, and show objectively how it is able to distinguish between the designed and the undesigned (ie actually do some science instead of just talking about it), you have no way out of this hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not faith, but a reasonable deference to the best available explanation to cite natural selection as the source of these items.  Natural selection is demonstrated to exist.  It has also been shown through EAs to be capable of creating very complex solutions to problems that are often unanticipated by the programmers themselves, thereby destroying the claims of front-loading of intelligence, which amounts to just more word games to anyone who understands how the programs work.  That game is over, and was won more dramatically than most of us would have anticipated, in favor of natural selection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faith would be ascribing these events to a prehuman, possibly nonmaterial designer, for which there is exactly zero evidence of either trait.  And that is what ID does, and why it is so unscientific.

       Pardon a poor laymans ignorance, C Bass, but maybe you can clear something up for me about Intelligent Design.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far youve said Design claims things like cellular nanotechnology:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)are not human design
      </p>
      <p>
       2)are not materialistic design, whatever that means
      </p>
      <p>
       3)dont necessarily point to a Designer (though I admit this is Dembskis claim, please let me know if you disagree).
      </p>
      <p>
       4)shouldnt be read as GODDIDIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much for the negatives. What does that leave?
      </p>
      <p>
       What, exactly,
       <em>
        is

       it?

       Thank you.

       I dont know about the problem with links. Why dont you try it with dead urls that we can cut n paste if we need to and see if that works.

       I too await your response with great eagerness.  I make a point of not playing silly games with peoples names.  I grew up with a name begging to be mauled and made fun of, and my schoolmates didnt disappoint, so I know how annoying that can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im much more interested in seeing if you are going to try the front-loaded gambit with the EAs, or its demented cousin, the TE = ID canard.  Ill be somewhat disappointed if you do, given the sheer idiocy of those arguments, and you seem capable of better.  But nonetheless, demolishing poor arguments will always be far more amusing to me than making fun of someones poor choice of parents.

       I think this pretty much rules Pumpkinhead out as a serious commentator on any subject; and possibly nothing more than a junior-high redneck with bad teeth and a stupid-looking automotive-product T-shirt.  What will he do next  call us faggits?

       Right  the fish-boy posts a lot of nonsense, then, when its all been refuted and hes left with a lot of questions he cant answer, he suddenly pretends to wonder whether were worth the time.  In other words, hes not worth our time either.
