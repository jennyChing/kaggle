   If you suffer and forgive those who made you suffer, you are the stronger of the two.

   Many of you worry so much about the evil of others that you have little time to reflect upon your own evil, yet if you were more concerned with your own behaviour, with how you act towards others rather than how others act towards you, how great would be your evolutionary progress. Do not worry what others say and do, that is their burden, let it not become yours
  </p>
  <p>
   Recognize that all people are playing roles in this drama of life. Observe the roles with compassion and understanding, but do not judge the actor. When you go to the theatre and watch a play being acted upon the stage you know that the actors are simply playing roles. Even if some of the actors are playing evil roles, you do not judge or condemn them because they are playing those roles. Indeed, you might even applaud them for playing their roles to perfection It is not for you to judge the way that other people lead their lives. For example, do not think that because a certain person has become very wealthy through extorting his workers and over-charging for his goods that he is an evil man working against God. He is simply a small part of God's plan and he will learn as much from this situation as the people that he is defrauding, as will the person who stands and watches the whole drama from afar. That is the purpose of life.

   The law of free will is simple. Basically, the hyperdimensional 4D STS Powers That Be are not allowed to do anything that would violate your free will unless you give them permission too. They can directly ask your permission, but that would be too easy and obvious, and they would probably have a hard time getting many resounding Yesses!!! should people be directly confronted with an attempt to hurt, maim, violate or kill them. So, they do the bare minimum. They do a lot of indirect beating around the bush tactics, where things arent
   <b>
    <u>
     directly
    </u>
   </b>
   spelled out for you, but; theyre
   <b>
    <u>
     mostly
    </u>
   </b>
   spelled out. Hints, nudges, winks, and plenty of symbolic meanings inserted all around you to show you what the deal is. Problem is, most people are asleep, or have been highly conditioned and programmed to ignore the strange and unusual synchronistic and symbolic phenomenon that surrounds them. So when people fail to see the symbolic warnings and indirect winking and nudging and fail to take pre-emptive action, then they have, unfortunately, just relinquished their free will and given permission to the 4D STS Powers That Be to do their thing.

   Are you the victim of what happens to you, or the one who uses it for learning? Are you receiving your experience as a blessing or as a punishment? That is the question you must constantly ask yourself. (The Christ Mind through Paul Ferrini) -

   Now is the time to awaken from playing victim most of those behaving like sheep do not seem to realize that the wolf is strengthened by sheep behavior. Our insecurity is what will defeat us. Our power comes in finding our boldest, most authentic truth and standing passionately for that in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
   Deep down, none of you are truly sheep. You are ALL lions who believe yourselves to be powerless and thus behave as sheep. Each of you is capable of greatness. Sheep behavior is a relic of your past. Let it drop away and stand as the leader you truly are To do so will take shedding the sheep behavior and standing as a torchbearers. I say this to all of you who are working for positive change - if you don't stand up, you are failing your mission. (Stephen Dinan) -

   We need right and wrong so we can feel special. As a victim you imagine that you have rights; compensation is due. You expect to stand elevated and special in the eyes of others, who will hopefully commiserate and assist you through your pain. (Stuart Wilde from his book God's Gladiators)  -

   Some people just need someone to blame! Thats why they led lives they hate, with people they hate. How wonderful to have someone to blame! How wonderful to live with one's nemesis! You may be miserable, but you
   <u>
    feel forever in the right
   </u>
   . You may be fragmented, but you
   <u>
    feel absolved of all the blame
   </u>
   for it. Take your life in your own hands, and what happens? A terrible thing: no one to blame but yourself.

   I imagine that one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense, once the hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with the pain.

   If someone or something hurts you, it is your ego that hurts you.

    (The Council of Nine - From the book The Only Planet of Choice)

  <p>
   "Serve the other" beings will not infringe on your own free choice. "Serve the self" can and will infringe on your choice in any way that
   <u>
    you
   </u>
   LET them, but they cannot override your free will. If you do not want to deal with them, all you need to do is to assert your free will. Tell them to leave and they must obey. Wherever you carry fear, that is a weak point, a place where you are vulnerable, and they operate best by playing on your fears. This is always the case. If you feel helpless or afraid in some way, they have gained power over you, and gaining power is their whole game. They literally feed off of it. You have observed some of this kind of behavior among certain people on Earth. It is of the same "flavor," no matter where you find it
  </p>
  <p>
   You might be surprised to find out that Oversouls come in two orientations, as well. Both flavors exist because the Creator wanted to experience EVERYTHING, wanted to experience the full range of Its creative potential. It did not want to know Itself only by serving others. It wanted to know Itself in all the ways that were possible. All forms and behaviors still come back to the Creator wanting to explore and know Its full range of potential, nothing more and certainly nothing less.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is so easy to label things: "This is good; this is bad." The Creator just IS. It is neither good nor bad. It is not compassionate, merciful, angry, or punishing. It simply IS. Those attributes (compassion, anger, etc.) are projections upon a field of pure consciousness that is simply experimenting with all the possible ways of expression that are available to It. It is BOTH serving Itself and serving others. It serves others by creating them and allowing them to participate in the experience It is having. It serves Itself by creating others through which It experiences. There is ONLY ONE LIFE being lived. It is the Creator in Its infinite array of forms, or expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
   That is the "absolute" way of looking at it. But you (and we) are also experiencing at the "relative" level of experience. Within that "relative" experience, there APPEARS to be "good" and "bad," "serve the other" and "serve the self" kinds of things and behaviors. They are "good" or "bad" only when compared to something else. That is the "relative" part - as one thing RELATES to (or refers to) something else. There is no way around this, as the Creator likes to play hide-and-seek with Itself, and so it hides in all forms while It seeks Itself. It makes things so much more interesting, as seen from the Creator's perspective, because there is so much more "grist for the mill." There is so much more to work with, and there is so much more variety available than there would be if things only came in one of these two flavors.
  </p>
  <p>
   If there were only "serve the other" beings, things could get a little dull after awhile. If there were only "serve the self" beings, things wouldn't last very long, because the "serve the self" flavor, in serving only itself, is inherently predatory and destructive towards everything else. It operates through competition, not cooperation. You can see the results on your own planet, which has been effectively destroyed by these self-
serving behaviors on the part of so many.(Operation Terra) -

   Men are not against you; they are merely for themselves.
   <a href="http://www.actsofkindness.org/inspiration/quotes.asp" target="_blank">
    (Gene Fowler, 1890-1960 American Journalist Biographer)
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>
   ...understand that you are not a victim. On the contrary, you are an active participant in a soul contract and lesson that you helped set up. Taking responsibility for your part in the contract enables you to release the other person from blame for the role they played to help you learn the lesson you wanted to learn. You understand that just as you are not a victim, nor are they a villain. Devin, my 9D guide, has told me many times that it is much harder to play the role of a villain than it is to play the role of a hero. Releasing someone from blame is different than forgiving them.

   The fear that damage can come to you by the wrong doing of others is a basic misunderstanding of life. Yes, passing disadvantages can come to you; that is true, but even these must have a corresponding element within yourself. Otherwise, you could not even be affected superficially. As far as your spiritual nature is concerned, and this includes the overall Plan of Salvation, nothing can ever happen to you. The personal knowledge and experience of this truth is bound to come to you as you enter upon this path. (Eva Pierrakos) -
