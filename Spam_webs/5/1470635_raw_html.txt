  <meta content="FBI to Expand Domestic Surveillance Powers as Details Emerge of Its Spy Campaign Targeting Activists" property="og:title"/>
  <meta content='Civil liberties advocates are raising alarm over news the FBI is giving agents more leeway to conduct domestic surveillance. According to the New York Times, new guidelines will allow FBI agents to investigate people and organizations "proactively" without firm evidence for suspecting criminal activity. We speak to former FBI agent Mike German, who now works at the American Civil Liberties Union, and Texas activist Scott Crow, who has been the focus of intense FBI surveillance from 2001 until at least 2008. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Crow received 440 pages of heavily redacted documents revealing the FBI had set up a video camera outside his house, traced the license plates of cars parked in front of his home, recorded the arrival and departure of his guests, and observed gatherings that Crow attended at bookstores and cafes. The agency also tracked Crows emails and phone conversations and picked through his trash to identify his bank and mortgage companies. Its been definitely traumatizing at different points, says Crow. But if we dont come out and be open about this, then theyve already won, and the surveillance and the war on terror wins against us. [includes rush transcript]' property="og:description"/>

          agents to investigate people and organizations "proactively" without firm evidence for suspecting criminal activity. We speak to former

          agent Mike German, who now works at the American Civil Liberties Union, and Texas activist Scott Crow, who has been the focus of intense
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          surveillance from 2001 until at least 2008. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Crow received 440 pages of heavily redacted documents revealing the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI

          had set up a video camera outside his house, traced the license plates of cars parked in front of his home, recorded the arrival and departure of his guests, and observed gatherings that Crow attended at bookstores and cafes. The agency also tracked Crows emails and phone conversations and picked through his trash to identify his bank and mortgage companies. Its been definitely traumatizing at different points, says Crow. But if we dont come out and be open about this, then theyve already won, and the surveillance and the war on terror wins against us. [includes rush transcript]

          is giving agents more leeway to conduct domestic surveillance. According to the
          <em>
           New York Times
          </em>
          , new guidelines will allow
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          agents to investigate people and organizations "proactively" without firm evidence for suspecting criminal activity. The new rules will free up agents to infiltrate organizations, search household trash, use surveillance teams, search databases, conduct lie detector tests, even without suspicion of any wrongdoing.
         </p>
         <p>
          The revised guidelines come as the FBIs existing practices have already come under wide scrutiny. Last month, the
          <em>
           New York Times
          </em>
          revealed a number of new revelations against activists targeted by domestic spying. One of those activists is 44-year-old Scott Crow, an Austin, Texas resident, self-proclaimed anarchist. He has just learned he was targeted by the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          from 2001 until at least 2008. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Scott received 440 pages of heavily redacted documents revealing the
          <span class="caps">

          </span>
          had traced the license plates of cars parked in front of his home, recorded the arrival and departure of his guests, observed gatherings that he attended at bookstores and cafes. The agency also tracked his emails and phone conversations, picked through his trash to identify his bank and mortgage companies, visited a gun store where he had sought to purchase a rifle for self-defense. Agents monitored  also asked the Internal Revenue Service to examine his tax returns, and even infiltrated activist groups he associated with. While Crow has been arrested a dozen times in his years of activism, he has never faced a charge more serious than trespassing. He is among a growing number of people and groups finding themselves on the receiving end of government spying.

          Right. You might remember that in 2008 Attorney General Michael Mukasey altered the attorney general guidelines that govern the FBIs investigative authorities, and he created a new category of investigations called "assessments." And these required no factual predicate  in other words, no evidence that anybody had done anything wrong, much less the person who is under investigation. And there are a number of intrusive investigative techniques that were allowed to be used, including physical surveillance, including recruiting and tasking informants, including
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          agents acting in ruse trying to gather information from the subjects of the investigation, conducting interviews, even using grand jury subpoenas to get telephone records.
         </p>
         <p>
          What the new changes to the FBIs internal policy is, to allow
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          agents, even without an assessment being open, to search commercial databases  these are subscription services of data aggregators that collect, you know, a broad swath of information and really have a lot of detailed private information about people  and also state and local law enforcement databases. Again, this is without any suspicion of wrongdoing. Without even opening an investigation, agents can start searching for all this private information.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another increase in their authority is with assessments that they use to determine whether an informant is  whether they can recruit an informant. And one of the things theyre allowed to do is theyre adding trash haul, which means that when you put your garbage out for the garbageman to pick up, its an
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          agent picking it up instead, and they go through all this material. And when I asked why they would want to give agents that authority  again, before you have any evidence of wrongdoing  and they said, "Well, its often helpful to find something derogatory that could be used to pressure the person into becoming an informant." So, you know, this is a technique being used specifically to coerce somebody to cooperate against their neighbors or co-workers.

          General Counsel Valerie Caproni, saying, quote: "Each proposed change has been carefully looked at and considered against the backdrop of the tools our employees need to accomplish their mission, the possible risks associated with use of those tools, and the controls that are in place. Overall, this is fine tuning, not any major change. The FBIs authority to use specific investigative tools is determined through the U.S. Constitution, U.S. statutes, executive orders and the Attorney Generals Guidelines for Domestic

          request for about 30 activists, about 40 organizations and about 10 events going back to the year 2000 in Austin. We sent it to multiple field offices around the country and then  to see what wed get back, to try to build a picture of what kind of surveillance had been going on, if theres other infiltration. And in that, most  about 50 percent of the documents that came back came back with nothing. About 30 percent came back  people came back with a mention, or a group came back with a mention. And then there was two cases, a case with the woman who organized the Showdown in Texas, which was an event in 2003  there was about 400 pages of documents  and then mine was a case where they had years of extensive documentation going on. And that was kind of the impetus of it all. And through that, I was able to find out that, you know, that I had  there had been five informants in my life. Brandon Darby was just the last one, who had run through our communities. But when we did this, we did it across nine states. And I found out I was investigated in nine states for arsons and other criminal acts that I was never charged with.

          Brandon Darby was a person who had been a friend of mine and been on the edge of the activist community within Austin for a number of years. He and I had gone to New Orleans together, and then I ended up co-founding an organization called Common Ground Relief out of that, out of those actions. And he worked at Common Ground for a couple of years and left, and then he ended up setting up  participating in this case with two men at the Republican National Convention, where he possibly entrapped them, but definitely provoked them into doing actions that they would not normally have done, which they ended up going to prison for. And then he came out as an informant, and it turned out he had been investigating a number of us for a number of years.

          Well, let me  let me backtrack for a second. I first found out that I was listed as a domestic terrorist in 2006. The
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          , in the way that they ended up dealing with a lot of law enforcement around the country is they let the local DAs and the local law enforcement officers know in different cities. So in 2006, they let the DA in Baton Rouge know, and he let the lawyers for the Angola 3 know, and the Angola 3 lawyer told me. And that was the first time I ever heard about it, that I was listed as a domestic terrorist and an animal rights extremist.
         </p>
         <p>
          And what it did was it opened up this world of possibilities in this kafkaesque world, where Im not being formally charged with anything, but all of these things are happening. I mean, I could see people sitting out in front of my house for years  I mean, all different kinds of cars. And Im not a paranoid person. I live a very transparent, open glass house. But I could see all these things happening.

          that was issued, a "be on the lookout" report that was issued in 2008, in the Austin Police Department that said I might injure police officers, burn down police cars, or incite riots. And the way I knew about it is because people from the city that I had worked with told me that they saw this poster with my picture on it. Now, again, I couldnt do anything about this. Well, finally, in 2010, I get these documents that list me as a domestic terrorist since 2001, and it starts  the picture starts to become clearer on all of the things that the

          They also used closed-circuit television on a house in Dallas that I lived in, and then in Austin, where they put cameras across  on poles across the streets from my house. The levels that they went to, I think, are unimaginable to most people, because its what you hear about in movies or what people fear the most about it. But pretty much anything that you can think of that they did, except for kicking my door in, happened to me. I was threatened with grand juries, the trash digging, which they did on two occasions on the trash digging, being visited at my work and visited at my home.

And also, not only did they try to implicate me in some crimes in Dallas or say that I had  or suggest that I had some responsibility for those crimes, then they tried to use that pressure to get me to give information on other people.

          That is a very important question. Mike German, youre with the
          <span class="caps">

          </span>
          . There have been a number of raids. These are the obvious  you know, more obvious manifestations of this, raids in Chicago and Minneapolis of activists homes. Can you talk about how wide this surveillance is and what you understand is happening in other parts of the country?

          Sure. I think, like Scott said, we only see the tip of the iceberg. But in 2004, 2005 and 2006, the
          <span class="caps">
           ACLU
          </span>
          issued a number of Freedom of Information Act requests for Joint Terrorism Task Force investigations against a number of political  politically active groups who suspected that they were spied on, the same way Scott did. And we uncovered widespread surveillance of different, you know, peace and justice groups, environmental groups, all kinds of different groups. And that, in turn, started an inspector general investigation that was just released in September of 2010 that showed that the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          was opening these investigations with what they called factually weak predicates, sometimes even speculative predicates. So it wasnt that they thought that the groups were involved in any criminal activity now, but just that it was a possibility in the future they might be. Well, of course, thats true for all of us. We all might be future criminals. And that was the sole criteria that the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          was using to open preliminary inquiries.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now, these are supposed to be predicated investigations where there is some factual basis. And these investigations, unfortunately, the IG only looked at the cases that the
          <span class="caps">
           ACLU
          </span>
          had already uncovered. He didnt look beyond those. But what he found was those investigations remained open for years, with no evidence of wrongdoing, that the victims of these investigations would be put on terrorist watch lists. And, you know, you can imagine, for a political activist, you know, kind of like Scott recounted, when the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          is going around telling local officials that this political activist is a terrorist, that cripples their ability to be effective in their advocacy. And it creates a huge chilling effect that affects not just the people under investigation, but others active on those political issues, and even further, people who want to be active but feel its not worth it to come under that kind of surveillance. So it has a real serious effect on our democracy. And thats really, you know, one of the most dangerous parts about this.

          You know, this meeting that we were brought to about the expansion of the FBIs authority last month was really the first opportunity. We were hoping, because we criticized the 2008 guidelines that were put in place in December of 2008  so, literally just a month before the Obama administration took over  we had criticized those heavily, so we were hoping that what we were going to hear was that our criticism had been heard and that they were going to scale back some of the things they were doing. One of the things that were still working on is an authority the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          has given itself in their internal guidelines that allows them to collect racial and ethnic demographic data and to map racial and ethnic communities and collect racial and ethnic behavioral information, whatever that is. And were trying to use Freedom of Information Act to get at that information, but its difficult.

          I assume that I am, because my documents ended in 2008. They said that was all that there was. And just to clarify, they gave me 500 pages of 1,200 pages. So theres still 700 pages more to get. Were going to sue to try to get the rest of them and try to get the redactions taken away, so we can see what was going on. But my biggest thing is not to  to tell people not to be afraid, because everything that people fear Ive had happen to me, and Im still OK. And I dont mean that in a cavalier way, because its been definitely traumatizing at different points, but if we dont come out and be open about this, then theyve already won, and the surveillance and the "war on terror" wins against us.

          Its very difficult. I mean, one of the things that were just finding out in a California case is that the
          <span class="caps">
           FBI
          </span>
          and the Department of Justice have been interpreting a portion of the Freedom of Information Act to allow them to falsely say they do not have responsive documents when they do. So it makes unclear whether the government is even being upfront about whether they have documents that theyre not giving you. So its very difficult, but were working with the Freedom of Information Act the best we can. Were working through the courts, and were working on Capitol Hill, trying to get our elected representatives to realize how important this is to the American public and to our democracy. If people are afraid to engage in political activism, thats ultimately going to hurt us more than, you know, the waste of resources and other aspects of this that are also untenable.
