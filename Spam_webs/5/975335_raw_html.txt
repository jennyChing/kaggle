        <h3>
         Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
         At the end of 2008, I acquired two HP laptops for friends for whom I installed
         <a href="http://ubuntu.com">
          <em>
           Ubuntu Linux
          </em>
         </a>
         . As usual, the models of interest were not available without the operating system and pre-installed software.
        </p>
        <h3>
         First attempts
        </h3>
        <p>
         Upon reception of the first model, I called HP support for laptops where I was told to call support for HP professional laptops where they asked me to call customer service where they told me to call the sales department, this department then asked me to contact the claims department by e-mail because they could not help me!
        </p>
        <p>
         After numerous e-mails and phone calls with the claims department, I had still not received the amount due in repayment of licenses for software that I did not agree with. Worse, they told me they were not aware that a End User License Agreement (EULA) is displayed when you first start their PCs (if this is not bad faith, I dont know what is) and they asked me to send them a copy of the terms in question:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>

          <br/>
          To: xxx.xx@hp.com
          <br/>
          Subject: Attention Mr. S.
          <br/>
          Date: Friday, 21 November 2008
         </p>
         <p>
          Dear Sir,
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you for your phone call.
         </p>
         <p>
          Here are excerpts from your own license contract
          <br/>
          displayed at startup of each computer running Windows
          <br/>
          you sell:
         </p>
         <p>
          
          <br/>
          [] If you do not accept the terms of the agreement, click the
          <br/>
          button indicating your rejection and do not copy, download or
          <br/>
          use the software in any way. You can
          <br/>
          get the full refund of unused software []
          <br/>
          
         </p>
         <p>
          And here is the extract from the second license (Microsoft Windows)
          <br/>
          which is also displayed at startup:
         </p>
         <p>
          
          <br/>
          [] Using the software, you accept these terms.
          <br/>
          If you do not agree, do not use the software.
          <br/>
          Contact the manufacturer or installer to determine their procedures for return of goods
          <br/>
          to get your money back.
          <br/>
          
         </p>
         <p>
          I am surprised that HP does not know the existence of these
          <br/>
          End User License Agreement (EULA), since these licenses
          <br/>
          are displayed on all your computers.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition, your company has already made several repayments (willingly or
          <br/>
          by force) in the past. You have been condemned last year in Italy
          <br/>
          to pay 2300 euros (140 euros in software)
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
          I also invite you to educate yourself on this issue by visiting: http://www.racketware.info/
         </p>
         <p>
          The software I want to get the refund for includes:
         </p>
         <p>
           Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic OEM
          <br/>
           WinDVD
          <br/>
           Roxio
          <br/>
           Mc Afee (2 months subscription)
          <br/>
           MS Office 2007 ready
         </p>
         <p>
          Note that you can probably getrepaidthese amountsfrom the publishers of such software.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yours sincerely
         </p>

        <p>
         I then decided to start sending regular letters (I sent an invoice for each computer, then, when expired, threats of prosecution). I finally received a
         <a href="http://ernstfamily.ch/jonathan/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/2009-01-08-reponse_hp.pdf">
          written response
         </a>
         (in English even though we had always communicated in French). According to them, their return policy is in line with industry best practices (even though I have pointed out repeatedly that their two biggest competitors had accessed to my previous requests, and that they had recently been
         <a href="http://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/2007/10/29/hp-condamne-a-rembourser-un-microsoft-windows-en-italie/">

          Hello,
         </p>
         <p>
          I acknowledge receipt of your reply in English to my letter
          <br/>
          in French (you obviously have the resources to translate
          <br/>
          the End User License Agreement that you do not respect
          <br/>
          in French, but not enough to communicate with your clients
          <br/>
          in the language in which they write and buy your products).
         </p>
         <p>
          As explained in my previous request for refund (for
          <br/>
          which I am still waiting for the payment), I dont care about your
          <br/>
          arguments.
         </p>
         <p>
          First your refund policy is not in line withbest industry practices as you write because IBM
          <br/>
          and Dell, your two biggest competitors, have refundedsoftware not used in a similar case after my previous
          <br/>
          purchases: http://ernstfamily.ch/jonathan/tag/tax/
         </p>
         <p>
          Second, even if it did, it doesnt matter because theEULA explicitly gives me the right to a refund in the event I do not
          <br/>
          accept the terms of the license. I remind you once again thatyou have recently been convicted in Italy on this subject:

          http://www.zdnet.fr/blogs/2007/10/29/hp-condamne-a-rembourser-un-microsoft-windows-en-italie/
         </p>
         <p>
          You can continue as long as you like to hide behindyour legal department, but this wont prevent me from, if you fail to
          <br/>
          comply with my requests, prosecuting your management asstated in my last letter sent to your headquarters and Mr. P. and B.
         </p>
         <p>
          You will also find attached to this e-mail a draft of the prosecution (in french requisition de poursuite) that I will send, if by the end of this month I dont have any satisfactory answer from you.

         Legal proceedings against HP Switzerland and some members of its management
        </h3>
        <p>
         Hewlett-Packard Switzerland and several members of its management did not respond to my last notice before prosecution sent by registered letter (sent to the address of the company and their personal addresses). Therefore I sent the legal proceedings form to the competent offices.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Finally a response!
        </h3>
        <p>
         In February 2009 (two months after the last notice before prosecution) my debtors received their payment order from the legal proceedings office. Mr B., manager of HP Switzerland finally granted me with an e-mail (this shows how far you have to go to make those companies reply to your letters):

          Sir,
         </p>
         <p>
          Referring to your letter of 17 December 2008 and your payment order (No. xxxxxx) that I received this week, I state my opposition.
         </p>
         <p>
          I respect the fact that you insist on your rights as a principle, which is quite legitimate. However, I did personally never sell or charge any HP product and I condone the fact that you took legal action against me on a private level for a refund of software licenses pre-installed on HP products.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, I can confirm that the accounting department will pay you tomorrow an amount of CHF 600 on your account XX-XXXXXX-X to cover your expenses. Therefore, we urge you to withdraw the prosecution against Mr P. and Mr B.
         </p>
         <p>
          I leave you to your opinions and your principles, as well as your undignified pride to have recovered the license fees charged for our HP products, and for the fees you also racked willingly or by force from other manufacturers such as Dell, Lenovo and IBM to use your own quotations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sincerely yours,

         <p>
          &gt; Sir,
          <br/>
          &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; Referring to your letter of 17 December 2008 and your payment order (No.
          <br/>
          &gt; xxxxxx) that I received this week, I state my opposition.
          <br/>
          &gt;
          <br/>
          &gt; I respect the fact that you insist on principle to your rights, which is
          <br/>
          &gt; quite legitimate. However, I did personally never sold or charged any HP
          <br/>
          &gt; product and I condone the fact that you took legal action against me in
          <br/>
          &gt; private for a refund of software licenses pre-installed on HP products.
          <br/>
          &gt;
         </p>
         <p>
          I regret that my approach has caused you harm, but what iseven more unfortunate is that I had to go this far in order to get back what was due by contract.
         </p>
         <p>
          Furthermore, I find it somewhat inappropriate to play the surprise andindignation when you acknowledge yourself earlier to havebeen informed of my approach by registered letter in December.Perhaps you could have taken the necessary actions to avoidthis situation at that time?
         </p>
         <p>
          As a manager you will certainly ensure that thevarious telephone services from Hewlett Packard in Switzerlandand your companys complaint service are more aware ofyour customers rights so that this situation never happens again. I am also at your disposal if you want to learnmore about the real uphill battle that forced me to take thiskind of actions.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is clear to me that the current policy (ignoring letters,claiming that the licensing contracts do not exist, etc..) of your
          <br/>
          company is intended to discourage customers from exercising theirrights which is unacceptable for a company like yours.
          <br/>
          Therefore, I will not hesitate to assist any interested personto assert their rights as long as a simple and transparent refund process(or, better yet, a purchasing process that does not force thetying) is not implemented by manufacturers of personal computers.
         </p>
         <p>
          &gt; However, I can confirm that the accounting department will pay you
          <br/>
          &gt; tomorrow an amount of CHF 600 on your account XX-XXXXXX-X to cover your
          <br/>
          &gt; expenses. Therefore, we urge you to withdraw the prosecution against Mr
          <br/>
          &gt; P. and Mr B.
          <br/>
          &gt;
         </p>
         <p>
          I took the necessary steps to undo these actions (including the oneagainst your headquarters) and acknowledge receipt of your payment.
         </p>
         <p>
          &gt; I leave you to your opinions and your principles and undignified pride
          <br/>
          &gt; to have recovered the license fees charged for our HP products, and for
          <br/>
          &gt; the fees you also racked willingly or by force with other
          <br/>
          &gt; manufacturers such as Dell, Lenovo and IBM to use your own quotations.
         </p>
         <p>
          These fees are in no way racked to manufacturers as you seem tothink. It is simply a reimbursement proposed by the
          <br/>
          publishers of the software when the accompanying license agreement is not accepted by the end user.
         </p>
         <p>
          Therefore it does not cost anything to the manufacturers that you mention.Of course, if, on your side, you do not want to make the necessary arrangementto be refunded from your vendors, that is your problem.
         </p>
         <p>
          As for my pride, please note that this was solely done because ofprinciples and not to get money. To enforce my rights and not pay20-30% of the price of a computer for software I do not intend to use.Who knows, one day you may allow your customers to choose thesoftware they want pre-installed (opt-in instead of opt-out) on your computersand make this whole process and the inconvenience caused by it to manufacturersand their customers unnecessary.
         </p>
         <p>
          Best regards.

         Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
         This time, I really thought that Hewlett-Packard was going to turn a deaf ear until the court. Nevertheless, as it had already been the case with one of my first experiences on the subject, the threat (in the case of Dell) or the actual stake in pursuits again provoked a reaction and in forced the debtors to pay off to me what was due to me.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is unfortunate to notice how difficult it is to assert ones rights in IT tax removal. I dare to hope that this kind of initiatives as well as those relayed by the project detaxe from swisslinux, the racketiciel.info site  at the French level and racketware.info  at the international level, will allow everyone not to pay pointless expenses of licenses for software of no use (whether they do not wish to use them, or because they already possess them) whatever their choice of equipment. A clear display of the prices of this  inclusive software  as well as their optionality  would be to the advantage of the consumers and the computers makers.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to multiplicate these procedures and to encourage the makers to change their dishonest practices, do not hesitate to let know your procedures (successful or not) against these groups quoted previously as well as to request for coaching.

          Unfortunately there are virtually no such vendors in Switzerland (anyone feel free to correct me if Im wrong). You can find some Lenovo laptops with Opensuse but they are more expensive than their Windows countrepart.
          <br/>
          Then you have the fact that one of those computer needed to cost no more than ~ 450$ which reduces even more the choices you have.

         Well done on sticking to your principles. I have bought many computers, paying the obligatory Microsoft Tax without ever installing windows. Having read you story, I wont give up without a fight on my next purchase. The only way we consumers can get anything through is to vote with our wallets. I hope others will follow your example.

         Oh, and it is sad to see any company chickening out on EULAs covering their own products. Shame on you HP.

         Bravo! It is a shame more people dont read the EULA, but blindly click through itperhaps because they have been conditioned to do so and so do not even think that there may be an alternative. My motto at the moment: Question everything, hold on to what is good.

         IBM != Lenovo.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lenovo bought the IBM trademark to put on their computers. I believe the deal runs out in 2009, so there wont be any IBM branded consumer hardware in future.

         Congratulations and respect for your undertaking! It takes people like you to get the wheel rolling and help the hardware manufacturers to realizes that we the customers have rights and some of us dont want to be forced into paying a tax for something we will never use.

         I also have purchased various computers with MS Windows and other software that was never used as I am a Linux user.  Unfortunately the best hardware pricing and selection is almost always available only for computers which include Windows.  Clearly Microsoft has inappropriate control of the hardware market.  Shame on our spineless governments for not enforcing the anti-competitive rules.  Should I purchase another Windows pre-installed computer I will certainly follow your example and take what ever actions are needed to receive the appropriate refund.  Thanks for sharing your experience on this matter.

         Being a shareholder of HP, Dell, IBM, I was hoping that their management would lend a closer ear to my requests to have Linux preinstalled on their computers. Now, Im not so sure if they even listen to their shareholders.  May CEOs will listen when their bonuses are on the line  The carrot and the stick

         this is only a problem if you want a laptop,
        </p>
        <p>
         if you want a desktop or server then its cheaper &amp; smarter to build your own.
         <br/>
         theres more crap to worry about than the o.s.
         <br/>
         you have no idea about the motherboard, psu or graphics card quality etc when you buy a pre-built machine.

         Lodge a complaint with the appropriate body?  Congratulations BTW, very inspiring.  The solution, the real solution, (it will only happen outside North America first) is simply the EU (or starting with just a single country) mandates that Any computer sold must have the option of being sold without an operating system.  Nowhere should it be tied to any OS, and the process made this onerous.  As a line item, the purchaser must opt in for what OS they want pre-installed.  There is nothing wrong with pre-installed, the problem is mandatory pre-installed.  The biggest and most sucessful marketing scheme Microsoft has accomplished and enforced through tying is the idea that Windows comes free.  Look to MS to spend billions and billions to prevent ANY country from opening their markets to true competition.

         [] HP refunds 520$ for unused software It is unfortunate to notice how difficult it is to assert ones rights in IT tax removal. I dare to hope that this kind of initiatives as well as those relayed by the project detaxe from swisslinux, the racketiciel.info site at the French level and racketware.info at the international level, will allow everyone not to pay pointless expenses of licenses for software of no use (whether they do not wish to use them, or because they already possess them) whatever their choice of equipment. A clear display of the prices of this  inclusive software  as well as their optionality would be to the advantage of the consumers and the computers makers. []

         Wall Mart in the U.S.A. sells computers with Linux  (Ubuntu) systems pre-loaded. I hope this becomes a trend, i hope they start selling bigger, more up-market models, I hope they kick anybodies asss to gain market share on give Joe the Consumer a fair priced, whack at the ball, unfettered by Microsofts illegal and UnAmerican tax by monopoly on computing hobbies in general.

          Nope, the licence agreement is not presented when buying the computer and there is no way to refuse it beforehand. So I didnt agreed to anything.

          Again you are mistaken. If companies like HP were following the law and stopped to forcefully tie their products (computer) with a service (software usage licence), all this could be avoided.

         Hey man, good to hear that people are doing something about this crap. I actually didnt know that you can get refunds for pre-loaded software (i.e. WinDVD and the like) so good to learn something new. I always find it amusing to read the responses of idiots that are opposed to this stuff. I dont understand why they bother, do they not know that this is fighting for their rights as well? Or do they just like being walked all over
        </p>
        <p>
         Again, congrats and thank you for this awesome write up and effort

         Hi,
        </p>
        <p>
         Ive been reading up on a lot of this and Im thinking of also buying a new laptop and getting a refund for Vista. Maybe theyll learn from their mistakes. Im going to call tomorrow and see if they could simply let me buy a new laptop without the OS, this would definitely save time on their part as well.
        </p>

         Im happy to see that someone else has the tenacity to bring an arrogant manufacturer of very poor-quality products to heel.  Especially considering you did it using their own legal documents.

        <p>
         I have never had any HP product that wasnt terrible and would never purchase anything from them in the future.

         Why only one software pre-installed? Why not the free one, Ubuntu! Who gets what kick-backs? Business threats? Who joins in this Corporatist pack to screw Joe the consumer?  How can we break the Down-Town Old boys club, and get computers sold with NO software installed, so we can choose the software we want like in Free Enterprise Fvck Big Business They do it to you, all the time, right up the tender spot, no grease, no warning! The American Way ! Back-Door sales of Microsoft!
