   The Three Need Areas (Derived from FIRO):
   <br/>
   <b>
    Inclusion
   </b>
   (How much you generally include other people in your life and how much attention, contact, and recognition you want from others)
   <br/>
   <b>
    Control
   </b>
   (How much influence and responsibility you need, and how much you want others to lead and establish procedures and policies), and
   <br/>
   <b>
    Affection
   </b>
   ; (How close and warm you are with others and to what extent you want others to show warmth and support to you).

   Summary: The unifying principle
  </p>
  <p>
   All of this shows that the factors of expressive and responsive behavior provide an
   <u>
    underlying framework
   </u>
   for understanding personality. It is the basis of communication. We express to others, and respond to (or want from) them. As we shall see, the E/R matrix becomes a unifying principle that will allow us to make easier comparisons to several other temperament and personality type systems. This framework even helps us right now visually represent the temperaments.

     The hypothesis is that the factors of temperament are the root of personality through neurological elements, rather than the cognitive processes, which themselves are believed to have a neurological basis.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's all about a person's
     <b>
      stimulatability
     </b>
     .
     <br/>
     We can make
     <b>
      1
     </b>
     a need for more stimulation, and
     <b>
      0
     </b>
     a need for less stimulation.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two dimensions of stimulatability.
     <br/>
     How much one is willing to actively move to gain stimuli (e), and how much he wants to passively receive it from others (w).
    </p>
    <p>
     If we divide this into the areas of surface social skills (I), leadership and responsibilities (C), and closer personal relationships (A), we will have a six digit binary code.
    </p>
    <p>
     xxxxxx (x=variable)
    </p>
    <p>
     The values of each digit represent:

    </p>
    <p>
     For the 16 types, we only need the first four digits.

     The way it translates into the type factors:
     <br/>
     eI = extraversion (1)/introversion (0)
     <br/>
     wI = informing (1)/directing (0)
     <br/>
     eC = pragmatic (1)/cooperative (0)

     wC = motive (1)/structure (0)

     This would be basically the same as what we used on the first page: 0="l"[low]; 1="h" [high]

     We could also extend it to the moderate scores, with "M", and for APS, to distinguish between the neighboring Phlegmatic blends, 4=m; 5=M.
     <br/>
     Thus, Phlegmatic-Melancholy-SanguinePhlegmatic, would be MM001M.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking at it this way,
     <b>
      there would be six "switches" in the brain so to speak, determining our personality
     </b>
     ; with the first four determining our cognitive preferences.
     <br/>
     (It would also further explain why the preferred functions-- the first two determining type --must always be Ji/Pe or Pi/Je alternations. Try to pair two e's or i's; or P with P or J with J, and you will get a conflict in one or two digits).

      Cognitive Processes and archetypes

    <p>
     Integration of Beebe and Thomson models (line becomes a circle):
     <br/>
     <img src="beebethomson.gif"/>
     <a name="differentiation">
      <p>
       Based on Beebe's model with input from Lenore Thomson, here is how I now understand a person develops with the functions:
      </p>
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     The ego starts with its preferred comfort zone of the
     <b>
      inner or outer world
     </b>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The ego chooses its
     <b>
      dominant function
     </b>
     , which it receives stimili from in its preferred realm.
     <br/>
     If Thinking (for instance) is chosen as the dominant, and in the internal world, then everything else is rejected by the ego: the external world and the other three functions; Feeling along with both perceiving, which remain undifferentiated. (They are engaged, but not as conscious ego functions, and not really distinguished in orientation, though Jung said they would be associated with the rejected orientation; this case being the outer world).
    </p>
    <p>
     Soon, an auxiliary will be chosen, which will be of the rejected perceiving mode of processing, as well as it being in the rejected outer orientation.
    </p>
    <p>
     These two functions will become apart of
     <b>
      heroic
     </b>
     and
     <b>
      parental
      <i>
       complexes
      </i>
     </b>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So the rejected outer orientation of the [otherwise internal] Thinking then becomes apart of an
     <b>
      oppositional
     </b>
     complex.
     <br/>
     The perception rejected from the internal world by the auxiliary then takes on a
     <b>
      negative parent
     </b>
     role.
    </p>
    <p>
     The opposite function from the dominant, Feeling, will be
     <b>
      inferior
     </b>
     and most rejected, yet in the opposite outer orientation will be what the ego believes will complete it.
     <br/>
     Internally, it will remain the most rejected of all by the ego, and take on the most negative role.
    </p>
    <p>
     A "
     <b>
      child
     </b>
     " complex will take on the opposite process from the auxiliary, and align it with the dominant attitude.
     <br/>
     The aspects of the perception function not internalized by the child remain external, and take on a negative childlike nature.
    </p>
    <p>
     So using Lenore's theory with Beebe's theory seems to fill in some gaps and create a more complete theory!

      The 28 possible tandem combinations
     </b>
     (my extension of this)
    </p>
    <p>
     With brain lateralization, we could also make tandems out of the resulting pairs of alternatives. The dominant and last place (1/8) I think of as the "
     <b>
      superspine
     </b>
     ", and the auxilary and 7th place (2/7) as the "
     <b>
      superarm
     </b>
     ". Since both inferior and oppositional (4/5) are said to be opposite gender, and are in the middle of the list, they can be called the "
     <b>
      contrasexual core
     </b>
     ".
     <br/>
     Even more tandems can be made out of other pairups that might occur. Like under stress, I might make the lateral transformation from Ti to Fi, but maintain my Ne. Hence, I will come off as an NFP (which I believe is part of what was happening in my discovery process when I seemed to possibly be ENFP). So that is the parent working with the demon (2/8), sort of simulating the NFP's hero-parent (1/2) combination. It's like a "block" split between the primary and shadow ranges. The same can hold true for a hero-trickster (1/7) combo (when I'm using logic and facts to try to trap someone in an argument), a child-opposing personality (3/5), and anima-witch (4/6). These I guess I'll call "
     <b>
      superblocks
     </b>
     ". While the ego block will represent the type's "intelligence variant" (last three letters), the other blocks and superblocks will yield the other seven variants. 3/6 (child-witch) would be "
     <b>
      compensatory arm
     </b>
     ", since the witch will step in to protect the child. And then, 1/6,  2/5, 3/8 and 4/7 can be called "
     <b>
      superfaces
     </b>
     " (since they also will share the same attitude). Since there are two pairs of introverted and extraverted, they can be distinguished as "upper" and "lower". The parallel function attitudes of the primary and its shadow (1/4, 2/5, 3/7 and 4/8) are basicaly the original

      How the eight positions are generated from two by mirroring and shadowing
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="mirror.png"/>
     <br/>
     This is the simple prototypical concept, showing the four shadows as direct
     <b>
      reflections
     </b>
     of the four primaries. Hence, the Dom/aux become # 7 and 8, which are also the brain lateral alternatives, the tertiary or Puer becomes the Witch/Senex (and the Senex actually in the original conception of the archetypes was the shadow of the Puer, rather than of the Good Parent as it is in this theory). Anima/animus becomes the Opposing Personality, as ahown by both being contrasexual.
    </p>
    <p>
     This illustration features a number of other symmetries inherent in the system, and I didn't even particularly plan it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     I chose a one-sided arrow, because it could be rotated and reversed and look different in all of the resultant eight positions.
     <br/>
     So the "Hero" happens to look like a "1" (not intended), but then this is good, as it represents the ego, and "looks out for
     <i>
      'Number One'
     </i>
     " as it is put.
     <br/>
     It is pointing upward, and facing forward (left in this case). Upward then represents the ego's orientation (e or i), while forward represents the ego's preferred perspective. The Auxiliary, or Parent is pointing forward but downward. The tertiary and inferior are the reverse of these, and the shadows (reflections) are aligned the same vertially, but rotated horizontally. The OP and Witch Senex are reflected from the backward facing child and inferior, and thus end up facing forward like the dom and aux. (again, left).
     <br/>
     The spines point up and down, while the arms are lying horizontally. (That also was not intended, but just fell into place!)
    </p>
    <p>
     <img src="shadowreflections.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>
     This one reconfigures the concept, showing how basically, type is really shaped by just the
     <u>
      <b>
       two
      </b>
      preferred functions
     </u>
     (and their associated archetypes), and the other six are generated through both
     <b>
      reflection
     </b>
     and
     <b>
      shadowing
     </b>
     . This creates a two way symmetry, where you have reverse images, and a double-reverse image, which then becomes congruent in shape to the original image. This ends up indicating certain similarities, such as the anima/animus and Opposing Personality being the opposite gender, and same side brain alternatives being the same shape.

        Intertype Dynamics

     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     People have said that they like Socionics better because it goes more into intertype dynamics, where MBTI doesn't. But what is Beebe's model but the groundwork for the same dynamics?! That is what attracted me to it in the first place, and still makes me think of it as the most complete.
     <br/>
     Problem is, he does not seem to have any complete listing of all the intertype relations. You find only particular examples in Beebe's articles/interviews or knowledgeable people's discussions. I recently even contacted him, asking which article would contain the most information, and while he pointed to "Understanding Consciousness Through The Theory Of Psychological Types" which contained a lot of useful information about how he put together the model (goes more in depth than "Evolving the Eight Process Model"), it doesn't go into examples for all type relations, and apparently, he has not put together any such project.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I had proposed names for all of the type relations, which do imply what the relations would be like. A few concepts are taken from Socionics, as they seem like good descriptors, and for familiarity sake.
     <br/>
     Then, I eventually find that the Type Logic site has its own names for the intertype relations:
     <a href="http://typelogic.com/pairs.html">
      Relationship Pairs: Definitions
     </a>
     <br/>
     If you click on the type profiles on the site, at the bottom, you will see each Type Relation name, whih is a link to the correspondign type's profile. You can also purchase the software (link at bottom of above linked page).
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are how the relations are determined:

     I would also divide all eight functions into pairs, which all display similar roles. (Socionics does this, calling them "
     <b>
      block
     </b>
     s"; however the order of the last six functions is different from John Beebe's, which I'm using here). Both dominant and auxiliary (lead and supporting) as "preferred", by themselves determine the one-in-sixteen type.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tertiary and inferior develop later, and the tertiary is known as "the eternal child" or "relief", while the inferior remains immature even longer. The way we behave with it is also described as "childish" and immature. So we see a
     <u>
      common thread
     </u>
     with both postions of functions:
     <i>
      immaturity
     </i>
     , "childlike innocense" and "
     <u>
      vulnerability
     </u>
     ").
    </p>
    <p>
     Likewise, the fifth and sixth (in the nearest area of the shadow) are "opposing personality" and "immobilizing" or "critical". The common theme here is
     <u>
      resistance
     </u>
     to something, either present or future. I also call them the "near shadow".
    </p>
    <p>
     The deepest shadow consist of "deceiving" and "destructive". Both share in common a
     <u>
      regretting of actions
     </u>
     taken with the function.
    </p>
    <p>
     So I would name the four resultant pair blocks:
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      1,2: Preferred
     </b>
     (Socionics: "Valued/Strong")
     <br/>
     <b>
      3,4: Vulnerable
     </b>
     (aka "non-preferred"; also looking at "immature"; Socionics: "Valued/Weak")
     <br/>
     <b>
      5,6: Resistant
     </b>
     (or "near shadow"; Socionics: "Subdued/Strong")
     <br/>
     <b>
      7,8: Regrettable
     </b>
     (or "deep shadow"; socionics: "Subdued/Weak")
    </p>
    <p>
     I have found a great parallel between the blocks and the four playing card suits:
    </p>
    <p>
     1/2:
     <font color="#FF0000">
      
     </font>
     diamonds: the ego's most cherished goals
     <br/>
     3/4:
     <font color="#FF0000">
      
     </font>
     hearts: the vulnerable, innocent area
     <br/>
     5/6:  spades (sharp weapon)
     <br/>
     7/8:  clubs (blunt weapon)
     <a name="tandemfunctions">
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     This is useful for grouping together the functions shared in common by either the two-letter function attitude combinations (SP, SJ, NP, NJ, TP, TJ, FP, FJ) or three letter "intelligence types": STP, STJ, NTP, NTJ, SFP, SFJ, NFP, NFJ), for whom either one or both functions will fall into the same block. Keirsey had said that I/E was the least important factor, and even the EAR study supported it. So when speaking of TP's, for instance, we can mention "resistant Te", or "regrettable Fi". When talking about NTP's, they will both have "immature Si".
    </p>
    <p>
     I also decided to give names to the tandems by which process occupies them. Still reconsidering these, since the names are clunky, and did not resonate with people I mentioned them to:
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Se/Ni:
      <b>
       experience + anticipate =
       <big>
        "aspective"
       </big>
      </b>
     </u>
     (
     <i>
      ad
     </i>
     "to",
     <i>
      -spect
     </i>
     "look". Originally considered "
     <b>
      prostatospective
     </b>
     (pro "forward", stat "stand"; but people said it was too complicated, and it was even hard for me to remember on the spot)
     <br/>
     You deal in the now and forward
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Ne/Si:
      <b>
       relive + conceive from =
       <big>
        circumspective
       </big>
      </b>
     </u>
     (to "look
     <i>
      around
     </i>
     ").
     <br/>
     You look around both to the past, and to all the possibilities in the present. Much less about the "here and now". Possibilities are known from past experience, so the two functions naturally work together. In the "spacetime" illustration, above, This pair governs all but the top quadrant.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Te/Fi:
      <b>
       evaluate + organize =
       <big>
        systemic
       </big>
      </b>
     </u>
     (short for "systemiorational", since "systemic" can be confusing because of its commonality)
     <br/>
     This is one of the ones that really got me thinking of this. Like in the political debates. This is obviously a very Te society. Yet Fi seems to be a bit more suited to it. I think of the dominant "organizing" forces, which organize things to be efficient, with themselves as the main beneficiaries, and despite the rest of the economy (and thus are very much into what is important to themselves). Then you will have apparently diametric opposite Fi types (like Joe the Plumber), who look up to them, and oppose government intrusion because it violates their value that a person should keep whatever they "earned". I being stuck in this mess with so many others being passive like that; the term that comes to mind is "The System". To be fair, on the liberal side, others will speak out against this from their Fi and then organize demonstrations or whatever. This is would be basically an attempt at an opposing "system".
     <br/>
     So the common theme of Te/Fi seems to be "system". Te aggressively "leads" in "organizing", and Fi seems more passive, but is nevertheless still supporting the system with its valuing. You evaluate what's important, and then go build on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Fe/Ti:
      <b>
       analyze + relate to =
       <big>
        harmonic
       </big>
      </b>
     </u>
     (short for "harmoniorational")
     <br/>
     Inbetween the directiveness or informativeness of the other J tandem, Ti and Fe aren't as much about systems. Ti analyzes to find underlying principles, and then build theoretical models to solve problems, such as finding common denominators, harmonizing, clarifying, and hoping to find the simplest formula that can explain the universe. 
Fe of course builds interpersonal connections. So it seems different types of "harmony" are the common theme of this pair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, some of these terms may seem ambiguous. You can look at TiFe as building "systems" (theoretical or social), and of course, Fi is connected with "harmony"; but that is inner harmony. You could even stretch it and call Te's "efficiency" a kind of "harmony". But "system" is a better fit for that one. The terms thus tend to lean toward what is extraverted (shown to the outer world) of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprised nobody in MBTI ever named these. Beebe named the tandem positions (spine/arm, which are called "rational" or "irrational" depending on whether they are occupied by J or P functions), but the actual processes occupying them would be useful as well. You can even be more specific and use these new terms with those names.
     <br/>
     In Socionics, however, the perception groups are the "Romance Styles", and the judging groups are apart of the "Reinin Dichotomies":
     <br/>
     Aspective = "Aggressor/Victim"
     <br/>
     Circumspective = "Caregiver/Infantile"
     <br/>
     Harmonic = "Merry"
     <br/>
     Systemic = "Serious"
    </p>
    <p>
     So when I help with looking for the best-fit preferences for many supposed "NiTi" types in discussions, who often weigh between INTP and INFJ, because of high Ti and Ni in cognitive process tests; I can now say that they have an obvious "aspective" preference, since Ni and Se are high, and Ne is low. So INTP is very unlikely, though the person looks like it because of the Ti + abstract focus. I can then suggest another aspective type into the mix, such as ISTP. (In addition to INFJ). ISTP will be Ti dominant, followed by Se. If they think their Ni is high, we can point out that it may actually be tertiary, which is said to often "inflate" itself, and appear preferred.
     <br/>
     When discussing relationship type matches between an NFP and NTP, we can say "you're both 'circumspective' types, so you'll 'perceive things the same way'". In a personality clash, instead of "the real clash is Ne/i-Si/e; not Te/i-Fi/e; I can say the real clash is between a circumspective and aspective perception preference rather than a systemic and harmonic judgment. More to type, but easier to say or even think than all those process codes!
    </p>
    <p>
     Each pair of three letter Intelligence type can be addressed by their tandem pairs (Socionics had already done this identifying "Quadras" using Greek letter names):
