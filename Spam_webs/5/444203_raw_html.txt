        On Adderall, youre in your own little world. All you want to do is work on your epic project, and you dont want anything else to interfere.

        Most slacking off is mentally draining: it just makes you more ADD, less productive, and overall less satisfied with your own ability to accomplish things. But there is another way to slack off that actually gives you energy, strengthens your work ethic, increases your attention span, and still feels just as naughty as normal slacking off. In short: slack off by working on your personal goals on company time.

        Most Adderall takers are at least social smokers, probably because Adderall and Cigarettes can be such a delicious combination. Like Adderall, cigarettes help you lubricate an otherwise less-than-tolerable experience. If you really want to race lightning-speed towards your goals, quitting smoking will help make you uncomfortable enough to keep moving. I was a militant smoker for years and I quit smoking cold-turkey. No Chantix, no patches. Heres how I did it.

        What do you have in common with one of the best tennis players ever to step onto a court? You both used amphetamines. As a crystal meth user, Andre Agassi went twice as far down the rabbit hole as you did with Adderall. And not only did he recover, he came out swinging and turned his entire life around. To this day, he refers to the year when he hit bottom with meth and pulled himself up as the year when his happy new life began.

        Learn about the secret to all relationships: the pursuer/distancer balance. Short version: in most relationships, one person is usually chasing (pursuing) the other, while the other standing still or actively pushing away (distancing). This is a delicate balance. Adderall disrupts it by creating false distancers.

        Check out these two clips from last nights episode of Glee on Fox. In the episode, all of the Glee Club kids are tired and unmotivated. So they visit the school nurse, and she hooks them up with a little blue pill that cranks them all up to 11. Look familiar? The blue pill in the show is over-the-counter pseudoephedrine, but based on the affects shown in this episode it might as well be Adderall.

        A bit of pill-popper humor with a secondary message. This paradoy song was written by Jonathan Coulton in response to a PopSci Magazine article describing how in the future well be able to take a pill to feel however we want. Watch this video and listen to the song. Is that how you want your life to be? What kind of person would such a lifestyle produce? Whats missing?

        When you quit Adderall, you will reclaim your soul and your proper direction. The downside to this is that you must come to terms with the years you lost while running in the wrong direction on Adderall. All that damage you did to yourself trying to bloom early, and you end up blooming late.

       Disclaimer:
      </strong>
      This site is called "Quitting Adderall," not "Don't take Adderall." 
			It is not my intention to go around knocking pill bottles out of people's hands. 
			But if you want to put the bottle down for your own reasons, then this site can help you.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Adderall is appropriate for some people. This website is
      <strong>
       not for everybody.
      </strong>
      I am not a doctor; I'm just some guy who went through the quitting process and am happy that I did. 
			If you are deeply debilitated by severe ADD, 
			you should ignore this entire website.
