       <p>
        Here I am, 4 months later, being all depressed, writing a letter to you. How sad is that? I mean, we never even really DATED. We had like a month long thing, and Im still caught up in you. Sure, we liked each other on and off for about a year, but we never did anything about it. And when we finally did, you left me heart broken. You know, no boy had ever made me cry before. I had my share of boyfriends, but noone of them had ever hurt me. Yet you, the boy I never really dated, had me crying for seven hours.
       </p>
       <p>
        You know, youre not even a good guy. You kind of suck. I honestly have no idea why Im so into you. You are one of the most dysfunctional people I know. You never like one girl at a time. Seriously. Never. Youre a compulsive liar. Youre a jerk. Im pretty sure youre addicted to relationships.
       </p>
       <p>
        And yet, Im still in love with you. I kind of find you perfect. And it kills me whenever I see you with her. It kills me when I have to be all fake and pretend to like her, the girl who sort of stole you from me. It kills me when you talk about her. It kills me when you all of the sudden started acting like we were best friends again.
       </p>
       <p>
        I love you. I miss you. Youre literally all I think about. While youre probably in a movie theater making out with her, Im obsessing over this. I go over everything in my mind, every sweet, cheesy thing you ever texted me, every time I misunderstood you, every time I said something kind of awkward. I keep trying to find something I did wrong, some reason why shes better than me.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the truth is, shes not better than me. Shes a whore. Seriously. Shes fake and annoying and not even all that skinny. Shes a sucky girlfriend to you. Shes a bitch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Im just in way too deep now to ever back out. I cant even imagine liking anyone else, or dating anyone but you. Ever. I just want you to come back. I would forgive you. I have forgiven you. Just come back. Make me okay again. Please.
       </p>

            Hey, sweetie. I know that it feels this way now.and I have been there. I realize that its like you cant breathe, and that if you cant have him, there is no reason for anything. Take my advicelearn to care for yourself. He cant make you complete.only you can do that. This is all choice, what we do in life. There are so many wonderful people out there worth knowinggive yourself the chance. Where your focus goes, you go. Change it one minute at a time to something healthy for youand then if he does return, youll be a whole, happy well person. Invest in you until you love yourselfbecause you cant truly love another until you do.

            Dang, its almost like you got into my head and stole everything that was in there.
            <br/>
            I had the SAME thing happen to me. Literally, the same thing. A guy I never dated, had a thing, and was completely and utterly crushed in the end. Who knows how many girls he had while we had a thing and as soon as he told me he couldnt be with me he was off with another girl almost instantly.
            <br/>
            This happened over a year ago and Ive grown A TON from it  Im sure you will too. I couldnt imagine ever being with anyone else either, but eventually I found someone and have been with him for a year. He fixed me up and was so patient while I got over the guy before him.
            <br/>
            You will get over this and move on some day, if I can do it, I think anyone in the world can.
            <br/>
            Good luck, hun and remember to keep your head up. Your prince charming will come someday and youll sit back and wonder what you ever saw in this guy.
