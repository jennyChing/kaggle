        There is something that would solve all your problems and improve your life.  And it's something that you have been doing most of your life, it's called learning. But in order for learning to be effective, you have to learn the right things at the right time. Everything that you are, and everything that you'll ever be, is directly related to what you know. And your life is also directly effected by
        <a href="whatweknow.html#gap">
         what other people know
        </a>
        . So knowing is extremely important when it comes to improving the quality of life. But the process of knowing is not totally defined. So the goal of this education project is to define the process of knowing, and to define what would be the most valuable knowledge and information that is currently available. And then determine at which time this knowledge would be best learned. This way, anyone who completes this education, will have the highest degree of intelligence that is currently obtainable, as well as the potential, the abilities, and the skills to pursue any career, and to live any quality of life that they wish to have.

        will only be used to assist each student in measuring their personal progress, and their personal performance, and also to determine the level intelligence that they have reached at a particular time. There will be no grades, you either pass or you don't pass. If you pass, then you move on to the next level, if you don't pass, then you keep trying until you reached the next level. And if a person needs extra help or guidance, then the student must seek out and use the resources 
					available. There is no time limits, so you can go as fast as you want, or go as slow as you want.
        <a href="subjects/intelligence.html">
         Intelligence
        </a>
        is not a race. Intelligence is a process. Some will take more time, and some will take less time, but everyone will 
					eventually pass, whether you're
        <a href="subjects/childdevelopment.html#gifted">
         gifted
        </a>
        or not so gifted. Each person will eventually have a greater understanding of themselves and the world around them, and, be able live their life to the fullest potential possible.

        Schools today are just a primer. You don't finish school, because school is just an introduction. 80% of the worlds most important knowledge and information is outside the classroom. So the real learning comes after school. But that's only if you have access to the worlds most valuable knowledge and information, and, 
					that's if you have a firm understanding about what you should be learning, and when you should learning it.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Knowing
        <a href="subjects/lifequotes.html#beyou">
         what to do with your life
        </a>
        comes from learning to 
					understand what life is. Knowing comes from learning. So 
					please, don't keep life waiting, life needs you, for 
					everyone is important.
