     The Ultimate Available Light Fixed Lens Point

   </font>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    <font color="#0000FF">
     The Konica Hexar AF is a wonderful available light candid
camera, yet deceptively simply and deceptively complex.
    </font>
    In some ways
it has no peer, justifying its "cult" camera status as
    <font color="#0000FF">
     the
ideal stealth street camera.
    </font>
    High points include a fast sharp lens
combined with incredibly quiet and fast operation -- quieter and faster in operation than
a Leica M6 !!
    <font color="#0000FF">
    </font>
    While some of the
controls are a pain, the Hexar AF occupies a unique place in cameradom: the most
technologically advanced 35mm camera yet made with a fixed 35/2 or faster lens.
 The original black Hexar and black Hexar Autodate have "stealth"
film advance mode,  probably
    <font color="#0000FF">
     the quietest motorized film
advance of any 35.
    </font>
    <font color="#000000">
     <em>
      On second thought, in silent
mode I can't hear the camera operate -- I have never found a quieter 35mm camera.
     </em>
     It
would be great for film sets or courtrooms.

   <li>
    <strong>
     With its autofocus combined with Aperture or Programmed exposure modes, the
    Hexar AF offers considerably faster operation than any classic manual focus rangefinder,
    including the Leica M series. Active infrared from 2 feet to infinity in 290 steps.

   <li>
    <strong>
     Fixed sharp 7 element 6 group 35/2 Lens to f/22, 46mm filter. This lens is
    reputed to be a near copy of the Leica non-aspheric 35/2 Summicron.

      Many functions with the small "Select" and "MF"

    have an instruction book handy, these effectively secret commands become
     <font color="#0000FF">
      "The Lost Commands of Hexar."
     </font>
     A prime example is
    the ever valuable Silent Mode film advance command. Intuitive controls the Hexar is
    NOT.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Even if you know the controls, the small multi-function "Select" and
    "MF" buttons are difficult to work and often confusing. The Hexar AF would
    be a MUCH better camera if these were replaced by easier to operate dials.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     A strange thing is that the LCD frame counter disappears whenever you depress
    the shutter release slightly: to be replaced by the various camera status readouts.
     I've never seen a camera before where the frame counter can disappear -- it can be
    a bit irritating if you are near the end of the roll.

   <li>
    <strong>
     No battery = dead camera
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     While the Hexar does have manual focus over-ride, in practical terms it is so
    awkward to use it's a waste of time to most photogs

   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Meter cell window on camera front in traditional self timer position.
     Photog's fingers may obscure meter and IR focusing beam if not careful.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Top speed 1/250th, this can be a major disadvantage to some shooters.  You
    can get around this to some extent with a neutral density filter, but you must remember to
    manually reset the film speed, since the meter does not read through the filter.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     I would have preferred a more advanced interchangeable data back fitting all
    Hexars, instead of a fixed databack on only one model.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     No standard PC connection, but can be used with studio flash via hot shoe/PC
    connection adapter, IR transmitter, or slave to on camera flash.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     No cable release of any kind, the only substitute of sorts is the self timer.
    </strong>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     The Hexar's instruction booklet is poorly written, making it difficult to
    understand all the camera's functions. If there is a "worst camera instruction
    book" award, the Hexar AF may get first prize.

        switch to match needle exposure mode with spot metering. If you do have an

     Many Hexar AF functions are completely inaccessible if
you don't know the secret unlabeled commands.

    It's kind of like having a secret
password or secret handshake.  Woe to you if you buy a used Hexar without an
instruction booklet. Come to think of it, considering how poorly it's written, woe
to you if you buy a used Hexar with an instruction booklet. The guys who designed it
must have had fun hiding the functions with no labels on the controls -- "Oh yeah,
well look at this, I can do even better, they won't be able to figure this one out even if
they have the instruction booklet...HA HA HA HA." This section is not
written to cover all the commands, just the hidden ones that I know of. If you don't
know what the "P, A, or M" on the Hexar's top plate most likely mean, take a
photography class.

      "Stealth" silent film advance:
     </font>
     this one
    is a real problem, since it is so important, yet COMPLETELY unlabeled on the controls !!
     1) Turn the camera off 2) Press the "MF" button and hold it down
     3) Turn the camera on to any position 4) Continue holding down the MF button
    until a "L" for Low Sound appears on the left side of the LCD panel
     5) Release MF button and shoot silently in all exposure modes 6)
    Stealth film advance will work on all camera modes, until you turn off the camera,
    which unfortunately resets the camera to normal advance.

      SPOT Metering:
     </font>
     4 Degree Spot metering available
    ONLY when the camera is in the "M" manual exposure mode. You adjust the
    aperture with the large aperture, the shutter speed with the + /- buttons, according to
    the red + - LEDs in the viewfinder.

      Infinity Lock:
     </font>
     If you have used a screw mount
    Leica,
    you know about infinity locks. This allows you to lock the lens focus at infinity to
    quickly take pics. Most everything will be in focus with this 35mm lens at smaller
    apertures. 1) Turn the camera on 2) Press the "MF" button
    until you see a "999" in the LCD window. Your camera is now locked on
    infinity in all exposure modes 3) It will stay locked on infinity until you
     press the "MF" button again to see an "AF" for Autofocus in the
    LCD window or you turn off the camera -- which will reset the Hexar to AF when you
    turn it back on.

     Oddly Konica has never seemed to do all it can to promote
the Hexar AF -- many experienced photogs have never even heard of it, much less seen
one.
    </font>
    Sure, you could special order it from Konica dealers, but
strangely enough I have never seen a new Hexar AF in a camera store --- and I have
seen more than my share of camera stores. As a result any
Hexar AF is not that easy to find, whether new or used.

       Though strictly speaking not a
  rangefinder camera, the Hexar AF is definitely a modern updated version of the fast
  fixed lens rangefinders of the 1970's, such as the Konica S3, Olympus RD and Canon
  G-III QL.

   <strong>
    Please note I have referred to all autofocus Hexar models as
"Hexar AF" to avoid confusion with the newly introduced "Hexar RF"
interchangeable Leica M mount camera. Konica apparently does not use the "Hexar
AF" terminology.
