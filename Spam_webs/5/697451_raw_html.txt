            What is the main difference between the Equi-Ciser and the Hot Walker?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           The most important difference between the Equi-Ciser and the Hot Walker 
					is that the Equi-Ciser allows for unrestrained movement. Unlike the Hot 
					Walker, the horses are moving free between the gates - no more pulling 
					and counter pulling, resulting in less stress on neck, back and legs. 
					This freedom of movement allows exercising in its natural state, including 
					suppling, bending and lengthening of the muscular system, which reduces 
					the potential for serious, damaging injuries. In addition, the Equi-Ciser's 
					variable speed control, including reverse, allows stress-free safe movements 
					in all gaits - walk, trot or canter.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            What standards set the Equi-Ciser apart from other horse exercisers?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           The North American market for horse exercisers is largely unregulated. 
					Therefore, most horse exerciser products have no standards from which 
					to follow. The Equi-Ciser is built to European standards, ensuring the 
					product's quality surpasses the competition's.
          </p>

            How does Equi-Line Mfg ensure safety standards in the equipment they

            How does the Equi-Ciser aid in training horses?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           Using the Equi-Ciser on weanlings, the horses learn to stay calm and 
					confident so that they use their mind without fear, allowing the trainer 
					to slowly acquaint them with tack and other training tools. Therefore, 
					actual riding during training and conditioning can be reduced in adult horses. Consider 
					the saying: "You can't Wreck'm if you don't Ride'm!"
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            How can the Equi-Ciser aid in conditioning horses?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           The consistent use of the Equi-Ciser guarantees a conditioning program 
					that can be tailored to every animal's needs without fear of injuries. 
					Heart rate, respiratory problems and conditioning progress can easily 
					be monitored. In addition, the Equi-Ciser can keep stallions in shape 
					for breeding season. Due to its structural design, the Equi-Ciser makes 
					it possible to exercise more than one stallion at the same time by leaving 
					every second stall empty. Instead of having an empty stall you can also 
					put an experienced gelding in this space. Broodmares using the Equi-Ciser 
					show overall good health and increased physical fitness prior to foaling. 
					Four weeks after the foal is born, exercise is necessary for the mare 
					and the foal. With the exerciser the foal is able to join the mother for 
					a walk (only). A few weeks later a trot can be introduced to the exercise 
					program. After separation from its mother the foal is already familiar 
					with the Equi-Ciser, which will facilitate the foal's future training 
					and conditioning program. Using the Equi-Ciser gives the horse owner 
					excellent opportunity to prepare horses for sale.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Can the Equi-Ciser be used for rehabilitating horses?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Equi-Ciser provides the opportunity of controlled rehabilitation 
					in a range of motion and work intensity, which ensures that the horse 
					receives the best overall care. At the same time, rehabilitation using 
					the Equi-Ciser saves cost through reduced labour expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            How does the Equi-Ciser aid in ponying race horses?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Equi-Ciser's structure ensures correct forward motion with less 
					stress on tendons or the development of the wrong muscle groups experienced 
					during ponying by going sideways. Using the Equi-Ciser for training is 
					also safer, because horses are not getting away from their handlers and 
					are not exposed to loose horses on track. The track is less crowded, therefore 
					less cost for track maintenance. Horses can also be exercised for longer 
					periods, than being exercised generally by the pony rider.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            What other day-to-day uses does the Equi-Ciser have?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Equi-Ciser can be used in the daily training and riding of your 
					horses through the following:
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Warm-up:
           </b>
           The Equi-Ciser offers a calm and efficient warm-up before 
					scheduled training.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Cool-out:
           </b>
           Using the Equi-Ciser reduces traffic in the arena, 
					while increasing Safety. With proper use after heavy training or competition, 
					muscle soreness (cramping) is reduced more rapidly and efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            Lay-ups:
           </b>
           During lay-up time, horses can be kept exercised and 
					in condition.
          </p>
          <p>
           <b>
            How does investment in an Equi-Ciser translate to cost savings for 
					the horse owner?
           </b>
          </p>
          <p>
           Nothing is more important to the physical well being of horses than regular 
					exercise and it becomes even more important when there is a significant 
					sum of money invested in the animal. Regular exercise of a horse is a 
					labour intensive process that can be made much more efficient through 
					the use of the Equi-Ciser, a multi-horse exerciser that allows one person 
					to supervise the exercise of many horses instead of one person exercising 
					one horse. There is a tremendous labour cost savings to the horse owners, 
					being able to warm-up, exercise/train, condition and cool-out multiple 
					horses at the same time. In addition, because of increased safety in the 
					arena and in the barn areas, a possible insurance reduction could be negotiated.
