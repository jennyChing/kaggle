  <p>
   Plans for a new primate research centre have been dropped by Cambridge
University, partly because of the expected cost of protecting it from animal
rights activists, it was reported today.
  </p>
  <p>
   The controversial laboratory has become a focus of the growing battle between
researchers and anti-vivisectionists opposed to the use of monkeys for medical
research.
  </p>
  <p>
   The decision to scrap the development, funded by the University with the
Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council, was made after costs grew from
24 million to more than 32 million, reported BBC Radio 4's Today
programme.
  </p>
  <p>
   The centre was backed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has spoken passionately
about the dangers of allowing scientific research to be impeded by activists.
  </p>
  <p>
   The BBC quoted one university spokesman as saying: "We can't afford to build
and run Fort Knox."
  </p>
  <p>
   Planning permission for the lab was granted by Deputy Prime Minister John
Prescott after a hard- fought battle, but the animal rights groups Animal
Aid and the National Anti-Vivisection Society have launched a High Court
challenge to his decision.

   Viruses and bacteria could be genetically engineered to evade the human immune
system, to create a more effective biological weapon, a leading researcher
into bio-weapons said yesterday.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the past 30 years biotechnology has been revolutionised by molecular biology
and genetic engineering. These techniques, used to control infectious diseases,
can also be used to create more effective biological weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Speaking at the conference on the future of weaponry, Professor Kathryn Nixdorff,
of the University of Darmstadt, said that dangerous micro-organisms had already
been produced inadvertently during attempts to modify vaccines and viruses.
  </p>
  <p>
   Russian researchers had created a strain of anthrax bacilli capable of evading
immune mechanisms: hamsters injected with the engineered strain were not
protected by the usual anthrax vaccine.
  </p>
  <p>
   Australian researchers trying to develop a vaccine to prevent pregnancy in
mice stumbled upon a new and more virulent form of mousepox virus which inhibited
the production of a class of lymphocytes needed to combat the infection.
  </p>
  <p>
   Although humans were not susceptible to infection by mousepox virus there
was concern that the human pox virus could be similarly manipulated to make
it more deadly.
  </p>
  <p>
   There were several ways in which modifying micro-organisms had potential
military use. Bugs could be given a resistance to antibiotics, they could
be made more resistant to the environment and thus longer lasting, and they
could be made more lethal.
  </p>
  <p>
   But she dismissed the suggestion that information gained from the sequencing
of the human genome could be used to create a biological weapon specific
to a particular racial or ethnic group.
  </p>
  <p>
   "At present this seems unlikely for several reasons," she said. "It has been
pointed out in several reports that races do not exist from a genetic
perspective; there is generally more genetic variation within groups than
between groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Indeed, it has been suggested that a re-examination of the race concept
is due."
  </p>
  <p>
   There was concern that the genome sequence information could be misused.
A research team was reported to have built the polio virus from sequence
information publicly available, but this was a relatively simple virus and
the feat could not be readily repeated with more complex ones.

   The Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild, of the Rothschild banking
group, and the Pasteur Institute are wrapping up a $60 million financing
round for biotechnology investments.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fund, BioDiscovery 2, will target both European and Israeli biotechnology
endeavors, Professor Max Herzberg told TheMarker today.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first BioDiscovery fund had invested in three Israeli firms.
  </p>
  <p>
   BioDiscovery Israel, run by Herzberg, is contending for the biotechnology
incubator tender issued by the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade. The
tender is for the management of two biotechnology incubators.
  </p>
  <p>
   Herzberg also chairs the Eager Biogroup incubator in Ashdod, and is a partner
in running the Biotop biotechnology incubator of the Pasteur Institute in
Paris together with Dr Christian Policard.

  <p>
   I spent the better part of last week hanging around with a group of people
who are about to change the way we understand evolution, genetic inheritance,
and cellular functions. The weird thing is, they don't seem to understand
the magnitude of what they're doing. These people are called bioinformaticists,
and they're a mixed bag of biologists, software developers, physicists,
mathematicians, and entrepreneurs who are all working in the nexus between
high tech and molecular biology. I met vast quantities of them at the O'Reilly
Bioinformatics Technology Conference in Tucson, Arizon.
  </p>
  <p>
   So what the hell is bioinformatics? For the most part, people at the conference
agreed that the word describes an emerging field whose practitioners use
computers to compile, analyze, and distribute the vast quantities of data
coming out of labs devoted to creating maps of genomes. The tools of the
trade are giant relational databases, software programs that can compare
long strings of the letters representing nucleic acids, and visualization
programs that represent genomic data using everything from bumps to colors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Viewed from a sensational angle, bioinformaticians are genome hackers, the
people who figure out the many ways in which genes translate their sequences
into proteins and how those proteins create a living being out of microscopic
cells. They're the ones who are discovering how closely related humans are,
on a genomic level, to mice and yeast. And bioinformaticians are even working
on cures for cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
   But to the average bioinformatician, things are far from glamorous. She or
he may be hacking the code of life, as it were, but when you start digging
that deep into the body, what you're dealing with are strings of letters.
You're in algorithm land, a world of abstract data. Confronted with color-coded
graphs and strings of AGTC all day, it's hard to remember that what you're
doing is hacking life itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   One of the conference keynote speeches was delivered by Ewan Birney, whose
renowned work at the European Bioinformatics Institute and contributions
to the open source project Bioperl have made him a veritable poster boy for
the emerging bioinformatics community. Eyes shining, Birney told a packed
audience that "it's all about the data, just getting into the data and playing
around with it." Bioinformaticists are data geeks, plain and simple. They're
not trying to invent plants with feet or humans with fins. They just want
to figure out the best way to comprehend the enormous amount of raw information
contained in genomes.
  </p>
  <p>
   And yet, it's undeniable that these data geeks are producing the knowledge
infrastructure that will allow other people to start engineering brand-new
genomes. You could say that bioinformaticians brought you genetically engineered
crops in the same way that a peacenik named Einstein brought you the atomic
bomb. Einstein never thought his pure research would be put to such heinous
uses, but it was. And so will all that data being produced by bioinformaticians,
who are in general a rather progressive and thoughtful bunch. Hardly the
types to engineer the perfect super-being, if you know what I mean.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps what struck me most about hanging around with the bioinformaticists
at the conference was their ability to talk about the "how" of genome hacking
while rarely asking "why?" So you've discovered the perfect algorithm for
looking at all the proteins produced by a given gene. Or you've used a fantastic
Perl program written by super-genius Lincoln Stein to discover that earthworms
and humans both have a gene that, when mutated, causes them to grow spots.
Who will use that information and why? Nobody at the conference was asking
those questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   I don't mean to say that these data geeks were naive -- hardly. There were
many spirited debates about whether universities should be allowed to sell
their discoveries to industry. Lots of bioinformaticians are rightfully
suspicious when somebody wants to commercialize their work, whether that
person represents a company or a magazine like Science.
  </p>
  <p>
   Despite their thoughtfulness about such issues, however, I rarely heard anyone
worry about what would happen if his or her data were used for ill-advised
or downright destructive purposes that might affect the lives of many species.
Of course, it's difficult to know how to present your data in a way that
ensures it will be used for social good. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth
pondering.
  </p>
  <p>
   What would Einstein have done if he had foreseen the possibility of atomic
bombs? Maybe he would have become a gardener instead of a physicist.

  <p>
   Agence France Presse, 23 January 1999
  </p>
  <p>
   LONDON, Jan 21 (AFP) - Advances in genetic research raise the possibility
of biological weapons, available within 10 years, that would attack one ethnic
group but leave others untouched, according to a report published Thursday.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given the availability of bomb-making instructions and "recipes" on the Internet,
the British Medical Association said, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention
of 1972 needs "urgent" strengthening.
  </p>
  <p>
   While "genetic weapons which target a particular ethnic group are not currently
a practical possibility", the report concludes "it would be complacent to
assume they could never be developed in the future".
  </p>
  <p>
   The report "Biotechnology, weapons and humanity" by the BMA, which represents
all Britain's doctors, predicted their existence within "five or 10 years"
and warned of their attractiveness to terrorists.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Scientific knowledge has been quickly exploited for weapons development
in the past," said Vivienne Nathanson, of the BMA, adding she saw no reason
why this trend would alter with genetics. The report explains that genetic
research into humans leads almost every day to further understanding of the
differences in disparate human groups.
  </p>
  <p>
   Such differences were apparent in blood groups or varying resistence to disease,
such as developed by certain groups in west Africa against malaria.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two key developments were highlighted by the experts. One is the Human Genome
Project which aims to map the entire human genetic blueprint by 2003.
  </p>
  <p>
   The other is gene therapy, a technology still in its infancy, which uses
"vectors" such as harmless viruses to carry corrective DNA into malfunctioning
cells.
  </p>
  <p>
   The BMA warned that theoretically nothing could stop the development of "viral
vectors or micro-organisms" (bacteria, virus, etc) capable of targeting an
enemy group with a particular genetic make-up while sparing their neighbours.
  </p>
  <p>
   "In short, if there are distinguishing DNA sequences between groups, and
if these can be targeted in a way that is known to produce a harmful outcome,
a genetic weapon is possible," said the report. Far from being science fiction,
it cited a report in the strategic military magazine Jane's on worries expressed
by US Defence Secretary William Cohen in June 1997 about "certain types of
pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could eliminate certain
ethnic groups".
  </p>
  <p>
   "The scientific community is very close to being able to manufacture" such
weapons, said Cohen.
  </p>
  <p>
   There have also been sporadic reports of Israeli developing such weapons
to use against Arabs and white South Africans targeting blacks in a similar
fashion.
  </p>
  <p>
   On November 15, Britain's Sunday Times reported Israel was working on an
"ethnic" biological weapon which will hit Arabs and not Jews by distinguishing
between their genetic differences.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quoting Israeli military sources and western intelligence services, the report
said researchers were trying to isolate distinctive "Arab" genes in order
to develop a virus, transmitted by air or water, which would target them
specifically.
  </p>
  <p>
   The programme, based in the top secret Ness Ziona germ warfare laboratory
south of Tel-Aviv, is complicated by the fact that Jews and Arabs are genetically
close, both being of semitic origin, the report said.
  </p>
  <p>
   The BMA did not argue that all genetic research should stop, recognising
its possibilities for saving lives and advancing medical treatment.
  </p>
  <p>
   But the report stressed: "Getting rid of of weapons once they are produced
is very difficult; governments may be reluctant to give up weapons that the
rest of the world finds unacceptable."
  </p>
  <p>
   The BMA said it was particularly anxious to see effective verification procedures
introduced to ensure compliance with the biological weapons ban, and stressed
that vigilance by doctors and scientists was "vital".
  </p>
  <p>
   "We still have the chance to strengthen the ban on these weapons," said

   [Explanatory Note: IPCB staff and Board members frequently receive questions
concerning the prospects of biowarfare based on genetic research on indigenous
communities. This briefing is an attempt to explain the prospects of such
an occurrence by explaining how current research fits into such a possibility.]
  </p>
  <p>
   Concern about biological warfare is not just a paranoid delusion in native
communities across America. Reports of smallpox-infested blankets being
distributed during the Indian wars period of United States history,
and more recent experience of forced sterilization are well-known in many
native communities. Its not such a stretch to think that genetic research
focusing on native people could lead to a new form of biowarfare. And its
not merely paranoia leading people to believe that a government that allowed,
and even sponsored, biological experimentation such as the Tuskeegee experiments
in which African American men were purposely left untreated for syphilis,
would also sponsor similarly unethical research. But just how could genetic
research contribute to biowarfare?
  </p>
  <p>
   Genetically-based biowarfare would be different from the forms of biowarfare
we already know about. Current models of biowarfare involve introducing a
biohazard into a targeted population, and then letting nature take its course
as the biohazard infects the target population (and anyone else who happens
to be infected). The specific biohazard involved could be any of a number
of infectious agents-- diseases such as anthrax are common examples. Generally,
this form of warfare is messy in that it is difficult to limit
exposure to only members of the target population. Anyone exposed may be
infected, rather than just those who were targeted. Generally, this type
of warfare would be ineffective except in cases of terrorism or when the
entire population of a certain location is targeted.
  </p>
  <p>
   If one could more accurately target the victims, however, biowarfare might
be more effective. Genetic differences in people could provide the basis
for precision targeting in biowarfare. Certain steps would be required for
such genetically-targeted biowarfare to be a reality.
  </p>
  <h3>
   What Would it Take for Genetic Biowarfare to be Developed?
  </h3>
  <p>
   First, an understanding of the typical human genome would be
required. This would be necessary in order to ensure the benefit
of basing biowarfare on genetics, namely that only certain people would be
affected, and not others. In order to achieve such precision targeting, you
need to understand the genetics of the people you want to avoid targeting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, an understanding of genetic differences would be required. One would
have to learn about differences between the targeted population and other
populations around them, so that one could eventually take advantage of these
differences in targeting the agent of infection. A well-designed,
genetically-based instrument of biowarfare would only attack or affect people
with a specific genetic trait, and not others. The genetic differences between
the targeted people and the surrounding population would have to be understood
before such targeting could be achieved.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, once the genes of the general population, and differences between
the targeted population and the surrounding population, are understood, it
would be necessary to develop instruments of warfare, such as strains of
infectious agents like viruses and infections, that would only attack or
affect the targeted people. If a virus were to be the instrument of biowarfare,
it would have to be able to distinguish between the genes of the targeted
people and those around them. Specifically, it would have to only have a
harmful effect on the targeted people.
  </p>
  <p>
   If each of these three conditions were met, it would be possible to develop
instruments of biowarfare that discriminately harm only people with a particular
genetic trait. Biowarfare based on genetics would be a real possibility.
But could this ever happen?
  </p>
  <h3>
   Is Any of the Necessary Research Being Conducted?
  </h3>
  <p>
   The first necessary step for genetic biowarfare, understanding the
typical human genetic makeup, is well underway. In June, 2000,
the U.S. government and a corporation, Celera Genomics, jointly announced
that they had virtually completed a map of the typical human
genome.
  </p>
  <p>
   The second step, understanding differences in populations that could be targeted,
is also underway. Once it was clear that the first map of the human genome
would eventually be made, research into the differences in genetic information
between populations was undertaken. Since the announcement of the mapping
of the human genome, increasing attention has been focused on describing
genetic differences between populations. While indigenous populations are
highly sought after for genetic diversity research because of supposed
within-group uniformity, no study conducted to date can distinguish a particular
people from all others based solely upon their genetic differences.
  </p>
  <p>
   The third step is further off, as far as we know. Research on what defines
a bacteria or virus as pathogenic has not reached firm conclusions even for
known disease-causing microbes. For example, what caused the 1918 strain
of influenza to become such a world-wide killer is still a matter of controversy,
and the means by which HIV undermines the immune system is still poorly
understood despite more than a decade of intensive study. On the other hand,
recent research on mouse viruses in Australia has shown that the creation
of super-germs is not as difficult as previously thought. While
it is possible that the technology currently being used in genetic research
could eventually contribute to the development of ethnically-targeted biowarfare
agents, scientists seem far from being able to control the properties of
microbes with such precision at the present time.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Should I Worry?
  </h3>
  <p>
   The fact that research that would support the development of genetic biowarfare
is already substantially underway can be rather unsettling. Further, the
scope of funding for such research and its supporters (including the Departments
of Energy and Defense) do not help ease the mind.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is already extensive research being conducted on the genetic basis
of disease and resistance in humans and other species, such as crops. There
is a long history of such research.. For a good discussion of some of the
relevant issues, see Pat Roy Mooney, The ETC Century: Erosion,
Transformation, and Corporate Concentration in the 21st Century, in
Development Dialogue 1999:1-2, at pages 30-43 (available online at www.rafi.org).
  </p>
  <p>
   The main reassuring aspect of all research that has been done to date is
that all human groups have the same set of genes, and there are no genetic
variants that are exclusively found in one people or ethnic group. Even if
a genetic variant is highly concentrated in a given group there is a certain
probability that someone who is not part of that group, or not aware of common
ancestry with that group, will also have the variant. This means that any
army that wishes to use a biowarfare agent that is targeted to a particular
ethnic group will have to carefully screen its own troops to make sure that
none of them are susceptible. Such screening is not impossible, but it would
be unpractical for an army drawn from an ethnically diverse population.
Alternatively, vaccination against such agents might be possible, but would
never be completely reliable. If such screening or vaccination were undertaken
in the United States, it would have to be done under the strictest secrecy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given the relationship of poor nutrition and sanitation to illness and death
from infectious disease, it must also be recognized that the maintenance
of poverty by the policies of corporations and the governments of rich nations
constitutes a form of biological warfare. In such cases no new agents need
be designedexisting ones such as AIDS, typhoid, and malaria are entirely
sufficient.
  </p>
  <p>
   The best defense against the development of novel genetically-targeted biowarfare
agents are demands that international protocols banning such research be
agreed to by the United States and enforced, and that no secret research
on pathogens and vaccines be permitted to take place here or abroad.
