                is a design and research project created to understand how mobile phone technology is being used by people in emerging markets. In August and September 2008, Adaptive Path sent two design researchers to the Kutch district in western India investigating the impact of mobile phones and mobile infrastructure on people in rural areas. We hope these design concepts, research findings, and design principles will inspire designers and technology manufacturers to create technology that meets the needs of these people. Below is

                </a>
                , identified that many non-literate research participants ignored the screen when using mobile phone. Instead of engaging with the UI on the screen, participants would engage with the physical interface of the phone. They would leverage their spatial memory and gestures by memorizing patterns (i.e., pressing a button three times, remembering the patterns of numbers) or ask for assistance in dialing a number from a family member. These workarounds underscore a key problem with mobile devices in emerging markets: the interface conventions used to guide people through mobile experiences are largely misunderstood by a large portion of the worlds population.

                Our research uncovered even bare bone phones like the revered

                is often a dismal experience for non-literate users. The text driven interface provides little meaningful information to help guide users through the experience, leaving most lost in a labyrinth of menu options. Iconography should prove helpful, but effective iconography is an abstraction of a concept which holds shared meaning. What does an address book mean if your home doesnt have an address and you are unable to recognize alpha-numeric organization? What does an icon of an envelope mean if youve never received a piece of mail? Many mobile phone features are built on models and concepts that people in rural India have never experienced; an abstract icon used to represent these concepts often compounds the problem instead of providing a solution.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most mobile devices sold in rural India contain interfaces that have been optimized for Western users. Every interface is a little world full characteristics and conventions. Mastering that world can make people feel successful and create the opportunity to reap the benefits technology can offer. The research findings inspired me to reflect deeply on the world weve created inside mobile phones to try and understand why that world does not make sense for users in rural India.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Physical Interfaces Speak their Power
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Our research uncovered a technology landscape dominated by trucks, jeeps, motorcycles, scales in the marketplace, calculators, televisions, DVDs, radios, and cameras. Physical interface elements like dials, exaggerated buttons and information gauges  elements that speak their power  were common to all these objects. Unlike mobile devices that have a subtle physical interfaces, strong physical interfaces often provide an intuitive sense of mechanical processes. Knobs and scroll wheels on a radio feel intuitive because theres a clear correlation between the input mechanism and the mechanics of tuning a radio. The gesture of turning a radio dial as well as the visual and audio feedback reinforce the interaction. Interfaces such as these that draw analogies from the mechanical world while orchestrating physical interfaces with gesture, sound and sight give literate and non-literate users an intuitive sense of how an object works.
               </p>
               <p>
                Additionally, most technology used in rural India separate controls from information. Users view the content of a DVD through a television screen, but control key aspects of the experience like volume, forward, and reverse through physical buttons on the television or DVD player. Gas and temperature gauges in a truck are separate from the ignition or steering wheel. Software on computers and mobile devices often conflate controls and information; single buttons and input mechanisms can invoke multiple features. This practice increases functionality, but can be the cause of profound usability problems for non-literate users.

                <strong>
                 Make phones look hack-able
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                There is a strong culture of reselling, re-purposing, cobbling, and repair throughout India and this is especially true in rural villages. It is common to see trucks and motorcycles in this region of the world filled beyond capacity. While vehicles are amongst the most prized possessions, people in rural India are willing to test the capacity because they know vehicles can be repaired. Trucks and motorcycles have built in affordances like a hood that easily opens or parts that are visible and easy to manipulate that reinforce the expectation and practice of repair.
               </p>
               <p>
                An objects rules of engagement are strongly influenced by aesthetics. Unlike the the visible working parts of a motorcycle or the visible bolts on the dashboard of a jeep used in rural India, the physical design of most mobile devices do not reflect the notion of repair or hack-ability. Mechanisms for popping the hood on mobile phones are subtle and most devices express a sleek and streamlined aesthetic that make them feel precious, discouraging experimentation and play. These seemingly subtle design choices have a powerful effect on usage. Creating phones that have a hackable aesthetic will build on and reinforce the existing mobile repair culture that is prevalent throughout India.

               <p>
                Our research uncovered the vast majority of the phones features are untouched by non-literate users. There is little obvious prioritization given to the phones bloated feature set, creating complexity and confusion. Sound is an important part of Indian culture, yet volume settings are hidden, and the speaker and microphone are minimized. Our research participants cited the following features and functionality as the most important for their phone:

                </a>
                became the conceptual wrapper for the mobile device we envisioned. Steampunk enthusiasts create work that reflects the design and craftsmanship of the Victorian era. Similar to the exaggerated physical interface elements found on objects modded by Steampunk enthusiasts and artists, we designed a mobile device that celebrated physical interface elements like knobs that turn, scroll wheels, and exaggerated buttons.
               </p>
               <p>
                Removing the aesthetic of preciousness was a key design goal for this phone. Most modern pieces of technology like computers, phones, and televisions convey a sleek aesthetic that does not invite tinkering and exploration. Steampunk aesthetics applied to modern objects like computers and electric guitars triggers a different emotional response. Similar to the exposed inner workings of a motorcycle, works of art created to reflect the Steampunk genre possess a look of craftsmanship and cobbling. Its an aesthetic that invites the touch of the human hand and it encourages engagement and foster curiosity and play.
               </p>
               <p>
                Taking cues from Steampunks hack-able aesthetic, we made the phone look like an object that can be opened and tinkered with by exaggerating seams and making the mechanisms to open the device obvious. Our research uncovered that vibrant sound is an important part of Indian culture and most phones designed for western markets minimize the microphone and speakers. We chose to emphasize these elements by giving them a larger portion of the phones physical real estate and borrowed aesthetics from stereo speakers to reinforce their importance. Gauges are commonly used to convey quantitative information on cars and motorcycles in rural India. We echoed these familiar interface elements to communicate battery level and airtime minutes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Finally, we drastically reduced the feature set of the phone, allowing us to assign each function a single button. We borrowed stop and start buttons from stereos and placed them on the side of the device. Taking cues from a radio dial, our Steampunk phone contains a scroll wheel  creating a strong and intuitive relationship between the physical interface element, the gesture, and the UI inside the screen.
               </p>
               <p>
                Mobile devices are one of the most accessible pieces of technology in the world today and the benefits of communication technology for people throughout the world is limitless. Empathic design is not about forcing conventions and models on users that feel foreign, its about empowering users with technology that feels appropriate and familiar. Designers and user experience professionals have a responsibility to avoid viewing illiteracy as a deficiency, but as an important design consideration for a large portion of the world. Will this device concept meet the needs of non-literate users in rural India? The devil is in the details of iteration and implementation and the inherent nature of R&amp;D projects makes it nearly impossible to predict success. However, we hope this concept opens up an opportunity for conversation and dialogue about this important issue.

                    Wonder if there are opportunities to do more around taking and storing photos on a phone. So that people can use/take photos of the every day objects they use and then use the phone as a way to help them communicate that to other people in their communities?

                    so that it is possible to use the phone even without being able to read the screen. My idea was completely software based, without changing the form factor. That way you can buy any phone, load the app at startup, and voila the phone becomes friendly to clueless people. But I agree for real simplicity, you may have to change the outer shell too.

                    I completely agree with the suggestion of a different user friendly phone for rural India. I have personally experienced how hampered people feel when they want to use the mobile phone but just do not know how to handle the device. why rural areas, even aged people who are reluctant to use any new technology can benefit a lot if the mobile- that can be life support system for them, becomes a easy to use and understand device.

                    Alani and team have surely hit on useful insights on english unliterate users of rural India. The concept of using a physical dial-gauge style design is indeed interesting. However, I do wish more concepts from the initial exploration stage were shared here, rather than the final or single ideal solution. For example, it is possible that additional research may reveal users are quite comfortable with what is an intuitive set of bars to show signal strength or battery. There is this curious feature in the concept referred to as Airtime. If it is the same thing as Talk time available (locally referred to as currency) is a great idea. However, I believe it require user to SMS the provider to receive a balance (in Rupees), which doesnt necessarily translate linearly into minutes of talktime, as it is a function of a variety of rates for SMSing, calls, roaming, etc. I believe, if this feature can indeed be implemented, i.e. automated, then a currency balance might be more useful. Finally, I do think physical buttons that are software configurable (linked to user profile) as if the phone were a universal remote, might be a better idea than hard-wired buttons. After all, these people are smart and are only constrained in terms of language and user manuals. The chances are that such software instruction based setup could be done at the point of purchase or anyone as a one time exercise. Overall, a great direction to explore and do hope Nokias of the world are also reading this research.

                    A lot of folks who live in Western first world countries also use products according the patterns youve just ascribed to Indians. My question is, whats the value of filing these research efforts and design requirements under Western India, a physical place, instead of designing it for all the people that embody the use patterns you documented?

                   <p>
                    There are some obvious ones (e.g. its cost-effective to divide marketing efforts along geographical lines, it costs more to provide multiple internationalizations in one product), but Im interested to know if there are more.

                    I know few things about rural mobile needs, and I really do not appreciate your design solutions. I agree to the fact that people in rural areas have problems when it comes to literacy, but i guess the bigger problem is the affordability of the phone itself.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If they can not afford a phone which has very basic features, how can they afford something which has a camera.

                   <p>
                    You are talking about a technology which read a code and converts it to photos and a contact number, which involves money in developing all this, instead give them something that they can afford and address the very key issue of COMMUNICATION.

                    Summary of my comment: People have to go through a learning curve in order to interact with advancements in technology. It is expected and normal.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    First, I like the style behind the piece and the topic it has covered. But, as much as I like the concept of making technology more user-friendly, and while I dont want to be seen as a snob or as someone looking down upon rural populace in India (Most of us city dwellers have rural origins and have migrated to the cities anyway), I would say that there are some concepts which need to be learnt and adjusted to. You mean to say many of these people havent seen an envelope to be able to understand the iconography behind an envelope symbolizing Mail/SMS on the mobile. What I am saying is that people once they get used to the idea of western iconography go through a (often delightful) learning experience and they immediately begin to associate an envelope symbol appearing on the mobile interface/UI to that of SMS/email on mobile. I see a drawing in this piece showing a mobile with traditional dials for measuring battery power left etc. Why make the mobile more of an electro-mechanical device? It is more of an electronic instrument and its UI should reflect its intended design philosophy. I just coincidentally read this article here 
                    <a href="http://orderedlist.com/our-writing/blog/articles/stop-being-an-idiot/" rel="nofollow">
                     http://orderedlist.com/our-writing/blog/articles/stop-being-an-idiot/
                    </a>
                    which addresses the topic of designing for the lowest common denominator or assuming users are stupid. After this I read this piece and I found fundamentally they strike the same chord  I think you should read this link which I have given here.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I can see one of the flaws in my own argument  that, technology needs to adapt to the needs and usage of the existing people, not the other way around, but we are talking about designing for a lowest common denominator factor here  I am looking at history and evolution about the age of arrival of machinery here  TVs, DVD players, music systems were designed their own characteristic iconography/functional symbolisms and people had to learn them in order to operate them. Going a little way back, car dashboards and controls were not made to look like instruments that a farmer would use and interface with, daily, when we evolved from an agrarian society towards a knowledge oriented one. In short, conclusively, I am saying that, learning new interface concepts, symbolisms, iconography, are but an inexorable way of evolution in this knowledge economy. Rural populace should not expect electronics, information and communication designers to change their user interfaces into steampunk concepts.
