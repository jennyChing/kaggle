      <p class="intro">
       The above-excerpted exciting story of a double healing of terminal cancer using a simple approach - stepping up the cancer patients oxygenation through a simplified form of ozone therapy combined with juicing - shows the importance of including information on the purported general and cancer healing power of oxygen (O2), ozone (O3) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at Healing Cancer Naturally. As this story (featured in full further down) implies, ozone is likely not a silver bullet and may not necessarily heal your body when relied upon as a stand-alone treatment. Generally speaking, implementing a complete holistic health program may always be the wisest choice (and you will find many pointers to that effect on this site).
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
       Interestingly (and likely not coincidentally), another healing approach for cancer and degenerative disease, the inexpensive DIY
       <a href="./index-budwig.html">

       </a>
       (which boasts a high success rate and which, in combination with energetic and spiritual approaches such as

       , is a natural/holistic modality recommended by Healing Cancer Naturally, see
       <a href="./cancer-healing-greatest-hits.html">

       ) also centers upon increasing the oxygen available at the cellular level. It needs to be pointed out that the two approaches may not be compatible, (see

       while showing good successes when applied by themselves (details forthcoming such as an anecdotal report of two persons dying from cancer who underwent a certain type of ozone treatment combined with antioxidants).

       I ... have a wife who HAD cancer. ... My wife had 16 tumors throughout her body, in her intestines, liver, and breast. All the doctors said there was nothing they could do and that she had 6-12 months. My wife found a new experimental
       <a href=" ./alternative-cancer-treatment-2.html">
        chemo treatment
       </a>
       that "had a 80% cure rate". She did the chemo for 9 months and it was killing her. The doctor said her system was starting to shut down. I had been looking at alternative treatments from various sources and doing research on my own and found ozone. We didn't want to try it because of what the EPA and everyone else said about it, but since her system was starting to shut down, what did we have to lose? We drank ozonated water and breathed it while we slept every night, also did juicing and she continued with the chemo. Within 3 months she was cancer free.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if that isn't enough, a year and a half later when she went in for her check up to see if the cancer was still gone, they said she had two more tumors. One on the bile duct and one in her intestines again. The doctor told her they couldn't give her any more chemo and there was NOTHING they could do this time. We had slacked off on the ozone for several months so we decided to flood our bodies again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess what? Within 6 months the tumors were gone again. This time all we did was the ozonated water, breathing ozone and juicing. The doctor couldn't believe it and sent the tests out to 4 other doctors and they all said there was no cancer. He said they should hire me. By the way my wife is the only one out of 54 who is still alive from the group that was given that chemo. Like they say I think they play with the numbers a little. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I have cured athletes foot, a rash or something like that on my head, and removed age spots with ozone. (I don't go to doctors). I believe I have at least cured an enlarged prostate (verified by doctors before I quit going to them) but probably prostate cancer with ozone and apricot seeds. (Thanks for the apricot seeds tip, Ralph Moss!) My dad died from prostate cancer and I had the same symptoms.

       Friends, pay attention to the following: If you are deceived into believing that there is no cure for AIDS or cancer and are suffering from or have loved ones who are suffering from these dreaded diseases, the following may be of extreme help in reducing or even arresting suffering. Check out the following extracts. These are not, I repeat NOT, from any unrecognized sources or journals but from highly-respected individuals and institutions! The Government with the FDA, AMA and even the press, is being negligent of the welfare of our fellow human beings. Do not fall prey to their negligence and the lack of recognition of their own data! Rise up from the doldrums of apathy and unbelief! Our ignorance and lack of heed to the laws of Mother Nature and our personal insensitivity has caused these problems. Demand utilization now of these scientifically, time-tested, safe, non-toxic, harmless and lifesaving compounds. Demand this from your Government officials, health and welfare and welfare institutions, doctors, colleges of research and the press, now. Check out the extracts below.

       The following dictation is from BLOOD, the Journal of the American Society of Hematology, Vol. 78, No.7, October 1, 1991: "Inactivation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 by Ozone in Vitro" By Keith H. Wells, Joseph Latino, Jerrie Gavalchin, and Bernard J. Polesz. "A device was designed to deliver a constant source of given concentration of ozone fluids containing Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). Ozone was found to inactivate HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Greater than 11 log inactivation was achieved within 2 hours at a concentration of 1,200 ppm ozone. Similar concentrations of ozone had minimal effect on factor VIII activity in both plasma and immunoaffinity-purified preparations of factor VIII treated for the same time period. The data indicate that the antiviral effects of ozone include viral particle disruption, reverse transcriptase inactivation, and/or a perturbation of the ability of the virus to bind to its receptor on target cells. Ozone treatment offers promise as a means to inactivate human retroviruses in human body fluids and blood product preparations." Copyright 1991 by the American Society of Hematology.

       The following dictation is from the respected scientific journal SCIENCE, Vol. 209, August 22, 1980: "Ozone Selectively Inhibits Growth of Human Cancer Cells" Abstract: "The growth of human cancer cells from lung, breast, and uterine tumors was selectively inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by ozone at 0.3 to 0.8 part per million of ozone in ambient air during 8 days of culture. Human lung diploid fibro-blasts serve as non-cancerous control cells. The presence of ozone at 0.3 to 0.5 part per million inhibited cancer cells' growth 40 and 60 percent, respectively. The non-cancerous lung cells were unaffected at these levels. Exposure to ozone at 0.8 part per million inhibited cancer cells' growth more than 90 percent and control cell growth less than 50 percent. Evidently, the mechanisms for defense against ozone damage are impaired in human cancer cells."

       The cause and prevention of cancer
      </h2>
      <p class="info">
       by Dr. Saul Pressman
      </p>
      <p>
       We now understand the chemical mechanisms of respiration and fermentation at the cellular level. And due to the work of Dr. Otto Warburg, since 1926 we have known that when a cell is deprived of oxygen, down to about 40% of normal, its respiration is irreversibly damaged. This damage causes the cell to begin to ferment sugar anaerobically producing carbon monoxide and lactic acid, and only 1/6 of the energy of normal cellular aerobic oxidation. The cell loses its governor on growth and begins to grow wildly - - what we call cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This oxygen deficiency, or hypoxia, can be caused by many factors. Some poison may reach the cell and prevent oxygen uptake, or the excretory duct of a gland may become plugged up, as in breast cancer being cause by lymph gland plugging. But the end result is the same. As soon as the oxygen level to the cell is reduced, if the cell does not die, cancer will result. Frequent small doses of respiratory poisons are therefore more dangerous than a single large dose, where there is the chance that the cells will be killed rather than become cancerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       All carcinogens impair cellular respiration. The word carcinogen is an empty word. The continual search for more carcinogenic substances is an utter waste of time and money, because this obscures the true cause of cancer, which is the oxygen starvation of the cell. It also prevents the treatment of cancer, because of misunderstanding the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       To destroy cancer, what is required is the introduction of massive amounts of oxygen at the cellular level. This can be done by ingesting magnesium peroxide or introducing ozone. These two treatments have been in use for over 75 years, with excellent success. They must be taken in sufficient quantities to flood the cells with oxygen, killing the cells which are now operating anaerobically.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have recently seen people using ozone with rectal insufflation who have had mixed results. This is due to the bowel being compacted over the years with fecal material trapped in the folds. In these cases, the ozone is merely reacting with this old material, some of which may have been held there for ten or twenty years, and providing no benefit to the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       This points out the necessity for undergoing a thorough cleansing of the large intestine by a qualified colon therapist before beginning rectal insufflation. Also, it is necessary to take the ozone in as many different ways as possible, in order that the cells become flooded with oxygen. It is not sufficient to take just a small amount to kill an active cancer. For breast cancer, direct injection into the tumor is possible. For liver cancer, injection into the portal vein, as developed by Dr. William Turska, is necessary. For other cancers, injection in the arm is usually employed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another effect we have observed is that there is a cycle of activity to the effectiveness of ozone. As near as we can tell, the cycle is linked to the phases of the moon. The moon governs the tides of the earth and the emotions of mankind. Since the emotions are directly linked to the immune system, the healing process would seem to be influenced by our faithful heavenly partner. Ozone also has the ability to prevent cancer. If sufficient oxygen is provided to the cells so that they never drop below 40%, they will stay healthy, barring any chemical or radiation poisoning. It is as simple, and as difficult, as that. Many people today are using ozone generators to keep their cellular oxygen levels high, to prevent disease. Ozone may be taken into the body in many ways. You can drink ozonated water, introduce it into the ear, or you can step into a body suit after a hot shower and allow ozone to come in through the skin. Ozone can be taken with rectal or vaginal insufflation. People often ask whether they will have to continue to take ozone for the rest of their life. We say that if you want to eliminate toxins from your body every day and prevent your cells from being deprived of oxygen and thus turning anaerobic, then taking ozone daily is a small price to pay. As previously said, when a cell is not receiving enough oxygen, it begins to ferment sugar and produce lactic acid. This lactic acid accumulates in the tissues and causes many problems. To remove it, it is necessary to do deep muscle massage, with ozonated olive oil, perhaps followed by ozone with a body suit or in the Saunette. This will oxidize the lactic acid and allow it to be eliminated from the body. We hear a great deal about cholesterol and clogging of the arteries, and there are any number of diets aimed at reducing the intake of dietary cholesterol. However, cholesterol is produced by the body as a natural lubricant, and new research shows that dietary cholesterol intake is not directly related to cholesterol levels. The problem is apparently caused by chlorine reacting with the cholesterol and causing it to coagulate on the walls of the arteries, forming plaque. The sources of chlorine are many, but the major ones are the drinking water supply and the salt in food. We have been told to lower our intake of sodium, but chlorine seems to be a worse culprit, especially in atherosclerosis, heart disease and high blood pressure. When ozone is ingested over time, it scours out the arteries by oxidizing the plaque, cleaning the system so blood can flow properly. Ozone also reduces the clumping of red blood cells, enabling them to pick up oxygen in the lungs, and increasing their flexibility, which is crucial to microcirculation through the fine capillaries.

      <p>
       Oxygen is the most vital element required for human life and it is the key to good health. We can survive without water for a week and go without food for a month, but we can only live a few minutes without oxygen. Oxygen is the life-giving, life-sustaining element. All body activities require oxygen. Through oxidation, the body generates heat and energy from its fuel, and disposes of wastes and microbes. Our bodies are two-thirds water. Of that water, ten per cent is blood and ninety per cent is lymph. Since the water in our bodies is itself 8/9 oxygen by weight, we are therefore composed of over 50% oxygen. The best way to optimize health is to oxygenate every cell in our body. The more oxygen we have in our system, the more energy we produce, and the more efficiently we can eliminate wastes. Good health is dependent on the production, maintenance and flow of energy, which is produced by the oxidation of sugar. Oxidation is central to metabolism, circulation, respiration, digestion, assimilation and elimination. Oxygen purifies the blood, keeping it free of cellular waste buildup. Sufficient oxygen allows the body to rebuild itself and maintain the immune system. Healthy cells require sugar, amino acids, minerals, hormones, enzymes and oxygen.
      </p>
      <h3>
       The Cause of Cancer
      </h3>
      <p>
       The link between insufficient oxygen and disease has been firmly established. Insufficient oxygen can result in anything from mild fatigue to life-threatening disease. Dr. Otto Warburg was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1931 and again in 1944 for discovering the cause of cancer. He said, "Cancer has only one prime cause. The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of normal oxygen respiration of body cells by an anaerobic (oxygen-less) cell respiration." Once the level of oxygen available to a cell drops below 60% of normal, the cell is forced to switch to an inferior method of energy production -- fermentation. The cell can never be returned to the proper oxidation system, and loses its governor on replication. It begins to reproduce copies of itself wildly, a condition we call cancer. Dr. Warburg pointed out that any substance that deprived a cell of oxygen was a carcinogen, if the cell was not killed outright. He stated in 1966 that it was useless to search out new carcinogens, because the result of each one was the same, cellular deprivation of oxygen. He further stated that the incessant search for new carcinogens was counter-productive because it obscured the prime cause, lack of oxygen, and prevented appropriate treatment.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Confirmation of Dr. Warburg's Work
      </h3>
      <p>
       The National Cancer Institute endorsed Dr. Warburg's findings in 1952. This research was continued by Dr. Harry Goldbatt, who published his findings in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in 1953. His research confirmed that lack of oxygen plays the major role in causing cells to become cancerous. Dr. Albert Wahl said, "Disease is due to a deficiency in the oxidation process of the body, leading to an accumulation of toxins. These toxins are ordinarily burned in normal oxidation." Dr. Wendell Hendricks of the Hendricks Research Foundation wrote: " Cancer is a condition within the body where the oxidation has become so depleted that the body cells have degenerated beyond control. The body is so overloaded with toxins that it sets up a tumor mass to harbor these poisons and remove them from general activity within the body." Dr. Hendricks further states, "The true cause of allergy is a lowered oxidation process within the body, causing the body to be sensitive to substances entering. Only when the oxidative mechanism is restored to a higher state of efficiency can the sensitivity be eliminated." Dr. Stephen Levine stated, "Hypoxia, or the lack of oxygen in the tissues, is the fundamental cause of all degenerative diseases."
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Norman McVea said, "When the body has sufficient oxygen, it is able to properly eliminate toxic wastes from the system. Natural immunity is enhanced when the system is not burdened with a heavy buildup of toxins."
      </p>
      <p>
       In the August 22, 1980 edition of the scientific journal "SCIENCE," Vol. 209, there was a report written by Dr. Michael Carpendale entitled: "Ozone Selectivity Inhibits Growth of Human Cancer Cells." It stated, in part, " The growth of human cancer cells from lung, breast and uterine cancers was selectively inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by ozone at 0.3 to .8 parts per million of ozone in ambient air during eight days of culture. Human lung diploid fibro-blasts served as non-cancerous control cells. The presence of ozone at 0.3 to 0.5 parts per million inhibited cancer cell growth at 40 and 60% respectively. The non-cancerous lung cells were unaffected at these levels. Exposure to ozone at 0.8 parts per million inhibited cancer cell growth more than 90% and control cell growth less than 50%. Evidently the mechanisms for defense against ozone damage are impaired in human cancer cells."
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence from these doctors' research is conclusive. Oxygen plays the primary role in health and well-being. It is important to note that fear, worry and depression all interfere with free breathing and thus reduce oxygen uptake.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Achieving Superoxygenation
      </h3>
      <p>
       How can we ensure that our bodies are sufficiently oxygenated to eliminate toxins and prevent or cure disease? Scientific studies have proven repeatedly that medical ozone, properly introduced into the body in repeated applications, removes accumulated toxins and inactivates viruses, bacteria, fungi, yeast, protozoa and carcinomas in disease cells. All harmful bacteria and viruses are anaerobic and cannot thrive in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.
      </p>
      <h3>
       What is Ozone?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Chemically, ozone is oxygen with an extra molecule added. Electrically, ozone is oxygen with a higher energy level. It is unstable and highly reactive.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a cycle of oxygen just as there is a cycle of water. Oxygen is released in photosynthesis by land plants and ocean phytoplankton (mostly diatoms), and rises up in the atmosphere about 25-30 miles, where it is energized by a part of the ultraviolet spectrum of energy from the sun, producing ozone. Ozone is heavier than air and begins to descend. It immediately attaches itself to airborne particles if it contacts them, oxidizing them, cleaning the air. If it encounters water vapour, it can attach itself to it, forming hydrogen peroxide. Rain and snow both contain hydrogen peroxide naturally. That is why plants grow better from rain water than from irrigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       At ground level, ozone attaches itself to all pollutants, oxidizing them and cleaning the air. It has been incorrectly blamed for smog. Ozone is present in smog only transiently at around 25 parts per hundred million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carbon monoxide is present in smog at about 3000 parts per hundred million, and hydrocarbons at about 100 parts per hundred million. Smog is produced by the photoelectric effect of the sun's rays acting on carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere, which are the end products when hydrocarbons are burned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ozone cannot be produced in the internal combustion engine because the hydrocarbon fuel quenches the spark gap. The ozone that exists in the atmosphere is produced by nature and it is attracted to pollutants because of opposite charge -- it attempts to oxidize them and clean the air. The problem is one of too little ozone to complete the job, not too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ozone is also created near the ground by lightning. The fresh smell in the air after a thunderstorm is ozone. The amount of ozone created in an average thunderstorm is about three times the safe limit according to US EPA regulations.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Hydrogen Peroxide
      </h3>
      <p>
       Hydrogen peroxide, the partner to ozone, is more properly called oxygen water, since it is water with an extra oxygen molecule. It is found in rain and snow; the water at Lourdes; in fresh fruit and vegetables; and in colostrum, the first milk that a mother produces, where it provides a defense against infection until the baby's own immune system develops and is able to produce its own hydrogen peroxide. In the body's immune defense, hydrogen peroxide is released by T-cells to destroy invading bacteria, viruses and fungi. Blood platelets release hydrogen peroxide on encountering particulates in blood. Hydrogen peroxide is formed in the body by microbodies called peroxisomes, which combine water with oxygen, if sufficient oxygen is available. The importance of a high level of oxygenation is obvious. In the large intestine, acidophilus lactobacillus produces hydrogen peroxide which keeps the ever-present candida yeast from multiplying out of control. When candida spreads out of the intestine, it escapes the natural control system and can gain a foothold in the organs of the body, causing what is called chronic fatigue syndrome and allergic hypersensitivity. Bathing in hydrogen peroxide is the best way to get it into the body, and is inexpensive. The recommended rate is 8 oz. of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide in a tub of unchlorinated water, soaking 30 minutes. Up to 3% hydrogen peroxide can be made by bubbling ozone through cold water for a period of time. The medical uses of hydrogen peroxide were pioneered in this century by Dr. Edward Carl Rosenow who did research and treatment at the Mayo Clinic for 60 years, and who wrote many papers on the medical uses of hydrogen peroxide. Used together, ozone and hydrogen peroxide offer the world a bright and healthy future in the coming century.

      <h3>
       Diseased Cells
      </h3>
      <p>
       What distinguishes diseased cells from healthy ones? All cells derive their energy from glucose, but healthy cells burn glucose in oxygen by oxidation, while unhealthy cells ferment glucose anaerobically, producing large amounts of lactic acid. Fermentation produces only 1/6 the energy of oxidation, so cancer cells are perpetually starving for energy, and consequently have huge appetites for sugar. This wasteful metabolism becomes self-sustaining and dominant unless the oxygen level is sharply increased. Healthy cells which have sufficient oxygen and nutrients manufacture an enzyme coating around them that protects them for invasion. These enzymes are catalase, reductase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. So long as a cell maintains this enzyme coating around itself, it is safe from invasion by viruses, and ozone cannot harm it. Oxygen-starved cells are unable to produce enough enzymes to fortify their cell wall and are thus more vulnerable to invasion by the always-present viruses. Disease microbes have no enzyme coating. When ozone is introduced into the area, it attacks microbes without a coating and diseased cells with deficient cell wall enzymes. It oxidizes them, allowing them to be cleared from the body.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Free Radicals
      </h3>
      <p>
       Free radicals are atoms with unpaired electrons, a natural occurence in biochemical reactions. There could be no chemical reactions and thus no life without free radicals. The properties of free radicals vary widely. Some are toxic to all living cells, others only to the most vulnerable cells. Singlet oxygen is highly reactive beneficial free radical that acts as a scavenger of other harmful free radicals. The oxygen combines with them to render them harmless, thereby protecting cells from damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so-called anti-oxidant enzymes are gaining in popularity as nutritional supplements due to vigorous promotion. They are not anti-oxidant at all, but rather free radical scavengers and enzyme enhancers. They have been shown to help protect marginally healthy cells from general free radical damage. Superoxide dismutase in particular has helped reduce a variety of disorders; normally it is among the body's most plentiful enzymes. In any case, it does not address the cause of the problem: oxygen starvation at the cellular level, which causes the cells to be too weak to make the enzyme coatings that protect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the psychological consequences of convincing people that oxygen is detrimental to health when it is the most important requirement for life have not been addressed in any way. The limbic system, or midbrain, controls both the emotions and the immune system. We must never engender fear with inaccurate statements regarding health, as is so often done by the media with their periodic waves of 'carcinogen panic.' As Dr. Warburg stated clearly in 196, this approach is detrimental to public health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repeated treatments with ozone are required because viruses and bacteria seem to be more susceptible at different stages of their growth cycle. Ozone lasts in the body for only a very short period of time, oxidizing toxins, before turning back into oxygen, so it must be reintroduced repeatedly over a period of weeks or months. Medical ozone is completely safe and non-toxic to humans when generated by proper non-contaminating equipment and administered with proper protocols. It has been shown to be completely safe even when a dosage many times greater than the proposed human dosage is administered.

       Oxidation: the key to cancer and degenerative disease
      </h2>

      </p>
      <p>
       "Even for cancer, there is only one prime cause. Summarized in a few words, the prime cause of cancer is the replacement of the respiration of oxygen on normal body cells by a fermentation of sugar." -
       <a href="./warburgcancer-cause-prevention.html">
        Dr. Otto Warburg
       </a>
       , the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, in 1931 and again in 1944.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oxidation - What does the word oxidation mean? Of late, much has been spoken of ozone, oxygen, oxidation, oxidative therapies and aerobics. What do these have in common? What are the mysterious properties that result in such phenomenal healing assistance to the body?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oxidation is defined as the ability of oxygen to combine with other substances forming water and gases. In the body, the process of oxidation occurs repeatedly. Without this process taking place, life would cease very, very quickly. We take oxygen, through our respiratory exchanges, and dispose of body effete, also referred to as 'toxins.' Our blood has the function of picking up oxygen from the lungs, transporting it, and disposing of toxins. This, in combination with several other metabolic functions, is oxidation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oxygen, the most crucial element to our health and lives, is vastly being depleted: Pollution, whether internal or environmental, is the robber. Often today we hear of the 'toxic free radicals' and the free radical theory of disease causation. Yet, without free radicals the body ceases to exist. Oxygen and ozone break down to unpaired, freely bonding electron sub-units able to combine with other free radicals. These new compounds can then be excreted. The common belief today is "Free radicals are bad, nasty, harmful to the human body." Do not be fooled! Free radicals are necessary to the functioning and nutrition of the human organism. It is the excessive proliferation of free radicals that are unnecessary to metabolic function and nutrition that are often harmful to the human organism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we now discussing free radicals? Because free radicals are either a boon or a bane to the state of health and homeostasis. Without the free radical oxygen, also known as O1 or nascent oxygen, 'nasty, destructive' free radicals cannot be efficiently eliminated by the body. The nascent free radical oxygen seeks out and combines with toxic free radicals. These destructive free radicals have accumulated due to the absence of healthy 'free radical' oxygen. This absence has hindered the whole oxidative cycle of our aerobic bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ingestion of ozone and magnesium peroxide raise the level of oxygen in the body, and contribute to improved health through improved oxidation.
