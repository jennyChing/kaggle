  The Islamic world extends from the Middle East through much of Africa,
and east to Indonesia, and Western China. Clearly there are many ethnic flavors
to Islamic culture and style. However, there are also many common elements which are
shared by all muslim societies, in spite of doctrinal and ethnic differences.
  <p>

    Islam
   </a>
   was founded in the seventh century by Mohammed. The Arabian desert, in
what today is known as the country of Saudi Arabia, was the point of origin for
this faith. Prior to the advent of Mohammed, it was inhabited by a variety of
tribal peoples who worshipped a variety of local gods, represented by idols and
other sacred objects. Mohammed's message emphasized in the place of variety, a
unity of belief. He preached that there was but one god, and that he was not to
be represented by any image. His teachings stressed the spiritual order and
coherence of god's plan, and the duty of all believers to submit themselves to
the will of God. His teachings were founded on the teachings of Judaism and
Christianity. However, he preached that he was the last and greatest prophet.
The
   <a href="http://i-cias.com/e.o/koran.htm">
    Koran
   </a>
   is believed to be the direct word of God, spoken directly to
Mohammed.

  <p>

   </a>
   The Koran and the accompanying commentaries that have accumulated over the years 
  are considered to be the guide to all aspects of life for the believer. The 
  sacred law, or sheria, is still considered the law of the land in some muslim 
  countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   The fundamental teachings of Islam are as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    The absolute unity of God. This is in the face of the apparent chaos of the
world around us; the true unity and order of the universe is deemed knowable
only to God.
   </li>
   <li>
    Submission to his will. Since the order and meaning of life is only known
to God, there is no  path to truth and salvation except to submit to that
greater wisdom.
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   For all muslims, a set of holy duties are laid out:
  </p>
  <menu>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Faith
    </strong>
    The acceptance of the basic tenet that there is but one God, 
and Mohammed is the last and greatest of the prophets, through whom the will of God was expressed in the revelation of the Koran.
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Prayer
    </strong>
    -- all are enjoined to pray five times each day, facing toward
the Moslem holy city of Mecca.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Almsgiving
    </strong>
    -- Those who can do so are enjoined to give to the poor, and
also perform public works. The building of mosques, schools, fountains and
shelters (kervansarai) for travellers are common examples of such public
works.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Fasting
    </strong>
    -- During the ninth month of the muslim year
 (
    <a href="http://www.factmonster.com/spot/ramadan1.html">
     Ramadan
    </a>
    ) all
muslims are expected to fast from sunrise to sunset.
    <p>
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <strong>
     Pilgrimage
    </strong>
    -- Once during one's lifetime, if possible, the believer is
expected to make the pilgrimage to the holy  sites at Mecca and Medina.

  The first characteristic of Islamic art is a limitation set by Islamic law (Hadith): Images 
of living beings, human or animal, are forbidden. This is because of the emphasis 
on the unity and singularity of God, and the prohibition against idol worship. 
As a result, most Islamic art is non-representational. There are, however, important 
exceptions to this. Although public art and religious art is almost always 
non-representational, 
there is a tradition of
  <a href="http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~history/pers-II.html">
   figurative image painting in books
  </a>
  and on other personal 
objects for domestic use that probably is a continuation of pre-Islamic artistic 
styles. Persian ceramics, textiles, and other domestic objects sometimes depict 
human figures, animals, and birds. The best known examples of figurative images 
are the beautifully detailed miniature paintings seen in books. These usually 
illustrate histories, folktales, and occasionally even religious texts.
  <p>
   <a href="sclrs.gif">
    <img align="right" height="144" src="sclrstn.gif" width="97"/>
   </a>
   Since most Islamic art is non-representational, much attention has been given 
  to the development of sophisticated systems of organizing and assigning meaning 
  to the principles and elements that go into decorative design. Islamic scholars, 
  in any case, were always preoccupied with the measuring 
  and patterning of the world and the sky above it; astronomy, geometry, 
  and the tools of navigation and surveying, as well as the sciences of anatomy 
  and medicine were all religious exercises, an attempt to demonstrate the underlying 
  order of creation. Therefore even the geometry of pattern and the colors of 
  the spectrum take on great mystical significance.

   </a>
   There were several ways in which the mystical metaphor of geometry and number 
  could be applied to pattern. First, there was the matter of proportion, and 
  the division of space. The square, the equilateral triangle, and the circle 
  were considered to be perfect forms that could be combined in infinite ways 
  to create complex designs. This approach was applied to both surface design 
  and the design of architectural forms. The maze-like patterns seen in carved 
  wooden panels and the arrangement 
  of tiles demonstrate such patterning. These links to

   Patterns developed from differing systems might also be laid over one another
to create intricate designs; the concept expressed is that the apparent chaos
of the world disguises an order that can be revealed by "peeling back" layers
of ordered meaning. This kind of design can be seen in painted ceramics, or
certain
   <a href=" http://mathforum.org/geometry/rugs/gallery/">
    intricate carpet patterns
   </a>
   . Different styles of pattern may also be combined in architectural decoration, as in this entry way in the

  </p>
  <p>
   Pattern may also be asymmetrical. The repeat of the pattern which seems to be
needed to satisfy the western sense of balance may be thought of as being
completed in another, spiritual dimension; another way of expressing the idea
that only God can grasp the totality of the order underlying the universe, and
reminding the viewer that apparent disorder is only a result of the limitations
of human understanding.

   Colors are subject to complex systems of symbolism. A simple four color system, 
  for example, equates colors with the four traditional elements: Red= fire; yellow= 
  air; green= water; blue= earth. Additional levels of meaning are associated 
  with seasons, directions, and other abstract concepts. In a series of Persian 
  miniature paintings, a hero, Bahram Gur, is shown in a series of pavilions, 
  each of a different color; in each case the colors suggest states of mind, qualities 
  of virtue, and auguries for the outcome of the courtships in progress.

   In addition to the abstractions of geometry and color, there are certain images 
  that are intrinsic to Islamic beliefs, and are often used in Islamic art. One 
  of these is the idea that paradise is a garden, filled with fragrant flowers 
  and fruit, and flowing fountains. It should not be surprising that in this desert 
  religion water and gardens are part of the concept of heaven
   <a haref=" http://venture.cob.ohio-state.edu:1111/khalid/images/lamp1.jpg">
    . 
  Flowers and foliage
   </a>
   are a common motif in Islamic art, as are images associated 
  with water-- streams, fountains, and water pitchers often appear in carpet designs, 
  as well as other objects.

   </a>
   The prayer niche which indicates the direction of Mecca in the mosque is itself 
  a visual symbol- a gateway to paradise, to be contemplated in prayer. The prayer 
  niche is represented on prayer carpets, and the niche form also appears on other 
  objects as well.

    Calligraphy
   </a>
   has become a highly developed art. Since the Koran is written in Arabic, the 
  Arabic script is itself held in veneration, and calligraphy is a common decorative 
  element. Many styles of calligraphy have been developed, and motifs that resemble 
  writing are also commonly used.

   Islamic design has been influential in European art and design since the
Crusades, in the Middle Ages. In the later nineteenth century Islamic motifs
and oriental carpets became popular, and inspired the decorative design of
William Morris and other figures in the English Arts and Crafts movement.
Islamic motifs also appeared in the fashion world of late Art Nouveau and early
Art Deco fashion, inspired by the "Orientalist" designs of Leon Bakst and the
Ballet Russe. The Ballet Russe came to Paris in the years preceding World War
I, and influenced French fashion designers such as
