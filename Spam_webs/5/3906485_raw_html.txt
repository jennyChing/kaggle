         A dirt path leads to a cemetery, covered with fallen branches and hung with cobwebs; a strange fog closes in while bats screech overhead; the howls of a black cat echo through the night as the sun sets on the Haunted Mitten. With Halloween approaching, Michiganders are searching for places to scare themselves silly, so here is our list of the ten most activeparanormalplaces in the state.

          1. The Traverse City State Hospital
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Constructed in 1885 and closed over 100 years later, the Traverse City State Hospital is perhaps the most eerie place in Grand Traverse County. Originally an asylum for the mentally unstable, during its active yearsthe hospital also housed those afflicted with tuberculosis, typhoid, diphtheria, and polio. Although theGothic-style buildings have undergone renovations since 2000, a visit to the grounds conjures up the ominous and oppressive feelings of its past. Underground tunnels and caged balconies add to the spooky visual stimuli and, located on the trails behind the buildings, there is said to be a portal to Hell under The Hippy Tree. As well as documented paranormal investigations, the State Hospital has several books dedicated to its disturbing history.

          2. Old City Orphanage in Marquette
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Formerly known as the Holy Cross Orphanage, the Old City Orphanage stands against the Marquette hills as a menacing reminder of the citys past. Built in 1915 and abandoned in the mid-sixties, the Catholic orphanage remains a location of lengthy narrative and legend. According to occupants of the orphanage, the nuns were known to physically and mentally abuse the children and were fierce in their punishments. One account recalls a little girl playing outside during a blizzard and subsequently catching pneumonia. She died several days later. As a testament to her foolishness and a warning to the other children, the nuns put her body on display for all to view. The crying of children is said to be heard if passing the building on a quiet night.

          3. Henderson Castle in Kalamazoo
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Over a century old and supposedly host to a legion of ghosts, Kalamazoos Henderson Castle is now a bed and breakfast that caters to the living and the dead. The ghosts of the homes original owners Frank and Mary Henderson, as well as those of a Spanish-American War veteran, a little girl, and a dog interact regularly with paranormal teams and guests alike. The apparently amiable spirits have favorite forms of communication, speaking through unplugged radios, tapping unsuspecting visitors on the shoulder, and sometimes appearing in full form, wearing period clothing.

          4. The Masonic Temple in Detroit
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Built in 1912 by a wealthy gentleman named George D. Mason, the Detroit Masonic Temple has over 1,000 rooms, and several secret staircases, concealed passages, and hidden compartments in the floors. Mr. Mason went slightly overboard when financing the construction of the building, and eventually went bankrupt, whereupon his wife left him. Overwhelmingly depressed about his financial and personal circumstances, Mason jumped to his death from the roof of the temple. Security guards claim to see his ghost to this day, ascending the steps to the roof. The temple, abundant with cold spots,inexplicableshadows, and slamming doors, is known to intimidate visitors with the eerie feeling of being watched

         <strong>
          5. Felt Mansion in Saugatuck
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Felt Mansion, located on the Mittens west coast between Holland and Saugatuck, has worn several masks since its construction in 1928. The mansion was originally a gift to inventor Dorr Felts beloved wife Agnes, who died shortly after the Felt family moved in. After they left the home, it was transformed into a seminary, and then a policeand drug enforcement agency office. It is presently being restored to its former glory. Homes with such rich history rarely remain quiet: many believe that the spirit of Agnes Felt wanders the house she was never able to enjoy in life. A shadowy figure waltzes around the ballroom frightening the mansions tourists, while heavy doors open and close of their own accord. There are even accounts of Agnes reprimanding guests whom she has deemed to be too offensive or crude in her presence.

          6. Michigan Bell Telephone Co. in Grand Rapids
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Shrouded in legend, the Michigan Bell Telephone Company stands on the grounds of what was once a lavish mansion in downtown Grand Rapids. Current employees often experience ghostly encounters due to the grisly history of this particular plot of land. It is said the Randall couple purchased the Judd-White House from its previous owners and hadnt lived there for long before tragedy struck. Warren Randall, a railroad brakeman, lost his leg while on the job and had it replaced with a wooden prosthetic. This led to feelings of insecurity on Warrens part, and he soon accused his wife Virginia of having an affair. Their marriage was no longer happy and arguments were often overheard from the street. After noticing a pungent odor emanating from the mansion, workers in the building next door contacted officials to investigate. The two were found dead in the house; Warren had allegedly beaten Virginia to death with his wooden leg before slitting his own throat. The ghosts of the couple argue to this day as witnessed by employees of the company, with some saying that the Randalls are responsible for eerie prank phone calls traced back to the building after hours.

          7. River Raisin National Battlefield Park in Monroe
         </strong>
         <br/>
         The largest and bloodiest encounters fought on Michigan soil, the Battles of River Raisin (also known as the Battles of Frenchtown) were devastating upsets for the United States during the War of 1812. After several days of combat and an eventual surrender to the British, Americans soldiers were lead away by their captors. The maimed soldiers were abandoned, and would later be massacred by Native Americans in a surprise attack. In this deadliest battle of the War of 1812, over half of the total of 1,000 American soldiers lost in the War were killed. Paranormal teams have held investigations at what is now known as the
         <a href="http://www.nps.gov/rira/index.htm" target="_blank">
          River Raisin National Battlefield Park
         </a>
         and have utilized the

          Singapore Theory
         </a>
         which employs the use of time-oriented objects, music, and other triggers to encourage the appearance of ghosts. Figures in doorways, windows, and on the field have been photographed, and supposed sounds of war and cries of agony recorded.

          8. The Paulding Light
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Paulding, Michigan, is a small town in the Upper Peninsula known for a mysterious light display that occurs along a stretch of Highway 45. Although numerous paranormal investigators and even the Ripleys Believe It or Not team have examined the area, no explanations for the phenomenon have ever been found. Locals say the small spherical lights of white, red, and green are the ghosts of a railroad worker who died while trying to switch the tracks, or of a Native American man dancing along the power lines.

          9. Pere Cheney
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Located near Grayling, Pere Cheney was once a bustling nineteenth century sawmill village. Diseases like diphtheria and cholera ravaged the town and the population dwindled to double-digits before the town was eventually abandoned some time after 1912, when the Post Office closed. Legend has it that nothing but a strange moss grows in the village, and the cemetery, one of the very few remaining landmarks, may even hold the bones of a witch. Many visitors hear voices and witness orbs and, perhaps most frighteningly of all, there are reports of sightseers finding hand-prints on cars from children who died in the area.

          10. Mackinac Island
         </strong>
         <br/>
         Thought to be the most haunted place in the Awesome Mitten, Mackinac Island has tours devoted to its most ghost-ridden locales. From the Grand Hotel (built upon the first military posts cemetery) to Fort Mackinac (explored by SyFy Channels
         <em>
          Ghost Hunters
         </em>
         ) to Mission Point (haunted by the ghost of young man who shot himself after a heartbreak), Mackinac Island is a paranormal investigators dream destination. The occasionally bloody history and relative isolation of the island lends to its spooky atmosphere of this time of year.

             Sorry, Claire. RE: the Traverse City State Hospital, the Victorian-Italianate buildings are not haunted, and most people would say the history of the place is not disturbing. The books are certainly not about that. However, some of the patients were disturbed, as are many of the ghost-hunting visitors to the site.

                 People have various responses to being around old abandoned buildings. Buildings made for people take on a different look when the are dark and lifeless. Its not about the buildings but about our respective psychologies.

                   People that dont actually see ghosts or feel their presence often criticize those of us who do. You shouldnt be so judgmental Norm, but do consider yourself very lucky- because there are bad spirits around us, and when they see a person as susceptible they will use that to their own advantage.   Perhaps though, you should stay away from places that are suspected to be haunted, those who dont know how to handle spirits and other things often times fall victim to what they cant even see.

               I disagree as well. Ive done plenty of investigating at the Traverse City State Hospital and left with a lot of evidence to prove otherwise including pictures, videos, and the experience itself.

                 Being someone that works in mental health I have been there and many other locations around Michigan, and I found Traverse City State Hospital grounds are no where near as disturbing as Caro Center grounds, or Mount Pleasant Hospital.

                   My daughter and her friend were at the Traverse City State Hospital  a lot of paranormal activity.  Everyone may expect a lot, some, or no paranormal activity.  Being open-minded and objective can be an appropriate foundation.  No one should be critical of any particular situation, just because you did not experience anything strange.

                     Well said, Claudia. I think any place that has had people in a sorry state of mind body or spirit has the potential to leave an imprint. Also, you can go somewhere and feel good vibes too! That is also energy.

               I lived near the state hospital, toured the tunnels with my psychology and sang Christmas carols with my Girl Scout troop.  There is nothing creepy about this place at all.  The buildings are beautiful and Stella Tratoria is an excellent restaurant in I think,l bldg 50.  The barns are wonders of arcitecture as seen from the inside.  Go see for yourself!

             My husband and son had two very eerie paranormal experiences at the Chippewa Hotel on the Island a few years ago  both involving the elevator from ground to our third floor room. But I researched and found nothing else reported at that hotel, so we didnt mention it. Probably should have, because I also read that the ones taken seriously are original experiences, not those based on rumors

             Fort Wayne in Detroit is more haunted than any of these places.  There is also a +900yr old indian burial mound there.

             No mention of the Old Presque Isle Lighthouse? Despite no longer having electricity, the light still shines every evening and is said to be the ghost of a previous caretaker (the light that shines doesnt match any other light in the area, making the possibility of reflection pretty slim). I believe it was also investigated by Ghost Hunters a couple years back and after darkening the entire town, the light still shone and no explanation was found.

               I wondered why the Presque Isle Light was not mentioned too, Brandon.  I used to live on the east side of the state and drove up there one weekend and saw the ghost light for myself.  Its eerie, but hauntingly beautiful at the same time.

               I also wondered why old Presque Isle wasnt mentioned. Several yrs ago (I wana say January of 99) a friend &amp; I visited for photography opportunities. We had a tough time trudging thru all the snow but we walked out &amp; around the the keepers house &amp; light tower to the shore. Looking back toward the landscape, we took several photos of both buildings. We both swear to this day that we saw a figure in the middle window of the tower. Well that was enuff to wrap it up for these 2 scared chicks. There were no other foot prints around but ours, and of course we followed our own prints back out to our vehicle. Later when we developed our photos. some smoke can be seen spiraling from the keepers house in most of our pix. Talk about things that make ya wonder!!!!

             I worked on the 6th floor at St. John Hospital (Detroit) several years ago.  It was well-known that the floor was haunted.  Patients would see a little girl running around their room at night and often laughing.  This was reported to us by patients more than once, and by patients who were completely clear-minded, not drugged up.  It turns out the floor was once a Pediatric surgical unit years ago.  Also I personally saw lights in patient rooms turn on and off by themselves, with no one around.  Never would have believed that stuff before, but now I know better.

               I work at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing and there are reports of a little boy in blue with a bouncy ball that still occupies the hospital as well. The hospital is still active and running but patients complain of a little boy bouncing a ball and will tell the staff to tell him to stop. The nurses even know of him. Come to find out he has passed away in the pediatric unit of the hospital and I guess just have never left the hospital.

             I wouldnt put much stock in what this site says. On sure number 4 it days mr mason payed for the construction, and lept to his death from the building. The records indicate the free masons paid for it and george was 92 when he died. Kind of hard to imagine a 92 yr old jumping of a building to kill him self!

             The Bruce Mansion in Brown City, MI is one of the most haunted places I have been to. I have had multiple paranormal experiences and have captured several Class A EVPs. This place is amazing and is just what you picture when you think haunted house. They just started offering public ghost hunts there

               Ive investigated the location rather extensively. Just 2 of us (not a group of people).  Not one piece of valid evidence was collected during our time there. What we did discover is that sound travels like crazy from floor to floor and some floors are uneven, which can affect the senses. Im not saying its not active but, from my experience, its activity is exaggerated. I will admit it does *look* haunted. In fact, The Victorian styling is a perfect stereotype of what a haunted house should look like. Certainly a good look for marketing the place as haunted!

             Its amazing that Ive been to all of these cities but never did explore the haunted places. Just never did look it up. Interesting places.I wish I had taken the time to explore more.

               Ive been in the orphanage as well. We brought a camera and it kept going out on me. Fully charged. We heard lots of strange noises too. Very scarey in there.

               Seven Gables is a joke and that legend has been around from longer than anyone in my family can remember.  Ive been out there several times and have never experienced, witnessed, or heard anything.  Several friends have went multiple times and came back with the same conclusion.

             Ok, the Detroit Masonic Temple information is wrong, George D. Mason didnt kill himself. I am a tour guide at the temple and a member of the Temple historians, and a brother Mason. This story has been circulating around for sometime now and it is untrue. I welcome anyone who would like a tour of the temple to contact the Mosonic Temple Office and set up a time, tours are free, you can hear the real story of the temple. as for the ghosts I have spent many late nights at the temple while it is eree, I myself have not seen anything.

               I was a security guard there in he 80s and stood on the stage that the set for King on I was on it. I was the only person in the area, but when I looked out into the house I saw what looked like people in the house looking back at me,  I have seen the hidden stair cases and the compartments in the floor. I have heard that intruders died in an empty pool on the higher floors. I am haunted by the time a friend of mine and I shouted repeatedly in one of the elevators that it stopped on the 2nd floor. It did.

             Health Source Saginaw, Saginaw,MI.  I worked there for over 20yrs. The land has history that goes back over 100 yrs; County Poor Farm, Potters Field Cemetery. Indian Burials,TB Hospital, Psychiatric Wards, Nursing Home. At least 11 bodies were moved to St.Andrews Cemetery, about 1910. Several more bodies were discovered when the new solarium was built about 1990. The original hospital was built at the turn of the last century and has recently been replaced with new buildings. Unexplained activity plagued the old building, with numerous reports of noises. apparitions and objects moving by themselves. Similar activity has been reported by patients ans staff in the new buildings.  Management discourages any talk of paranormal activity, and chastises anyone who speaks out. I am sure numerous people would speak out if anonymity could be assured.

             The Old Saint Johns home at Lafayette and Leonard in Grand Rapids Michigan (now owned by Hope Network). The building standing now once was an orphanage built upon the remains of an even older orphanage. Having worked in the building more than 10 years I have heard and seem several strange events including Basketballs mysteriously getting played with by unseen children late at night in the Gym, Billiard balls rolling around in the game room when doing late night security checks and you find no one in that half of the building.
             <br/>
             Rumor has it several suicides and other mysterious deaths happened while it was an orphanage.

               Funny you mention this.. One night after I left the movies near by, I received a call at 11ish at night. I called the number back and it was that place. I felt extremely spooked because I before this have never knew of this place and just left from watching a movie about a haunted ophanage. I dont know anyone that would have ever called me from there. Left me spooked. Until know didnt know it was even haunted

             Ya Im not surprised in the slightest that the number one spot goes to a old and abandoned hospital,  and Im a little surprised that there was no haunted hotel.  But have no fear, for everyone that is looking for an adrenaline rush should check out

             and see if you could spend a night in one of these haunted hotels.  Because I tried and I sadly was not able to even make it to midnight.

               I stayed at the Wayne County Family shelter, which is/was in the building to the right of the old power plant. I heard it was the place that housed the criminally insane and in the basement, was where the slaughterhouse was. Some of the people that were there during the time I was there said they have seen things move. One of my friends said they saw their keys, that were hanging on a hook, swinging and noone was near them; another of my friends told me that she felt someone lying next to her on her bed, and there was noone there. While some have experienced paranormal stuff, I NEVER experienced anything.

               The old State Hospital is now Grand Traverse Commons, a complex of businesses, restaurants, offices and living units in the repurposed hospital buildings  very hipster. The Mercado, the main retail area, is in Building 50, which I guess is supposed to be one of the more haunted areas on the campusIm pretty skeptical of such stuff, but when my partner and I visited there she (who had far less knowledge of the propertys history) felt such a sense of negativity that she had to physically remove herself from the building, and I myself felt a sense ofI dont know, but it creeped me out, albeit to a lesser extent. (In all fairness, part of this may have had to do with the ground-floor atmosphere, and the exhibits throughout the building describing the hospitals history  kind of incongruous with the chi-chi retail stores, but I think the developers are trying to honor the history of the place.) This isnt to discourage anyone from visiting there; quite the contrary. I love the repurposed buildings (and we didnt have the same heebie-jeebies at other on-campus businesses), and the Commons also has regular weekend events like farmers markets that are fun for tourists as well as people in the neighborhood.

               I stayed there with a paranormal group about a year or 2 ago. Heard the children on the first small landing, shared a room with my friend &amp; heard someone getting sick &amp; throwing up in our bathroom (it was NOT my friend, she was in bed). My friend in the room connected to ours heard the man throwing up &amp; getting sick too. Also heard a dog barking and growling. I want to go back!! I had sensed that a girl maybe in early 20s that had been murdered  by being pushed off the roof. I later found out someone committed suicide by jumping off the roof and was about the age of the girl.

               Holly Hotel is very haunted!  Day &amp; night. Stuff disappears, apparitions seen &amp; felt.  It has been written about many, many times in different newspapers throughout Michigan.  It is on the southeast corner of the historic Battle Alley, downtown Holly.  The downtown area burned down around 1875.  All buildings were stick built.  That is why you now see  buildings built of bricks there because of the fires. Many people lost everything, my Great Grandfather had large investments in Holly downtown.  Just dont ask the historical librarian, she swears there was no fire then.   I found info in a large book on the history of Oakland Co., Michigan.

               There may be some actual orbs in these pictures but it is hard to tell because of all of the dust particles. I have been to a few cemeteries and taken pictures with tons of these orbs too until I turned the flash light on my camera on and saw all of the dust particles that were floating in front of my camera. Im not an expert so Im not sure about the 2nd and 3rd but the first pic that is definitely dust!

               I have been to pere cheney several times. The place is sadly destroyed now. I have seen several other pictures with orbs and you can hear things and at night its very scary. I have seen orbs myself in the back of the cemetery. When you drive up to it you gets chills like the place is just haunted. I feel like Im being watched out there. Its way deep in the woods two track driving surely worth a visit day or night

                 I think that its just sad how people just vandalized the place. Its a cemetery have respect. While we were there we picked up a bunch of beer bottles and trash to at least try to keep it clean. Wish everyone did that.

               Your third picture appears to have a ghostly figure resembling that of a face appearing just above the ground. Real interesting and a bit spooky as well.

               How cool , we were just at Pere Cheney and stayed over night. There were so many people coming in and out up until 2 am .  We stayed up until about 4 am went to sleep. The only thing we heard were coyotes and I didnt get any creepy pictures or hand prints on my car. Kind of bummed actually. ]

             The Northville tunnelsare a network of tunnels that run under an old insane asylum in the city..I personally havent been there yet but I have a ton of friends that have and I heard it is extremely haunted. There is still access to the tunnels but be careful because I believe it is a no trespassing area!

             Mercy Pavillion Hostpital in Battle Creek was said to be haunted by an old man and a little girl with a ball. Some friends and I went in at night a few times. Other than signs of vandalism (i.e. chairs stuck in walls, light fixtures broken), we only experienced some mild EVPs and sounds. The building has since been demolished and only an empty lot remains.

             the abandoned asylum in Kalamazoo, Michigan. it is very creepy, and is published in a few books. many sightings have been reported about a mid aged women who sits and swings on the one swing that isnt taken over with trees as well as an overwhelming presence that surrounds the place. there are asbestos signs all over, but some people will still break into it, and ive heard of other sightings that have happened inside. a couple friends and I are going on a trail walk, and visiting the old building today actually.

             Several years ago a friend and I stopped off in Marshall Michigan to see all the antique stores.  One place we went into was a building that had a mezzanine at the back of it on the south side of the Main Street.  The antiques were great and the prices were too.  We split up for a bit and I went down to the basement of the building which had a lot of architectural antiques in it.  Everything was fine until I went into a small back room adjacent to the main basement.  There was such an overwhelming sense of evil in that space that I backed out of the room and went up the stairs and out onto the sidewalk.  It was here I encountered my friend who was smoking a cigarette and when she saw me, she said, you went down to that room in the basement didnt you. She could tell by my face that I was horrified and i said, lets get the the hell out of here. This area in Michigan was part of the Underground Railroad and also the building had been somehow associated with Blackstone the Magician.

               Fact or Faked Paranormal files tried to recreate the light using emergency vehicles (cop car, fire truck) and saw nothing..so either the school was wrong or the tv show liedI believe both are possibilities.  And how much traffic is on that road on a given night..enough to keep the light going same intensity for a long period of time?

Another little boy named Kenny that cries as he tells you they sent him here to stay!

             I call BS on the orphanage. I live close to it, and theres no noises. Theres no proof that the nuns were cruel, it just plays into a stereotype. These same accounts keep getting perpetuated on website after website without any citation. Im not even religious, so I dont have a horse in that race. Ive personally met several people who lived there as children and they said the nuns were good to them. What a disservice to the people who dedicated their lives to helping orphans to slander them for entertainment. Shame on you.

             I saw this story on a friends Facebook page. I figure rather than make him look stupid, Id go directly to the source. The rest of this is probably BS too, but makes for good campfire stories in the authoritative-information-lacking demon-haunted world.

               LOL Though I wish you werent. You ARE wrong my friend. My family stems from a deep history of The Holy Cross Orphanage, as my Grandma and Great Uncles and Great Aunt all attended there in the late 1930s and 40s. I can assure you The stories my Grandma told me about that place WERE TERRIBLE!!!! So get off your little Catholic/Nun Defensive High and realize that while there may be many who just talk due to their own opinions, stereotypes and beliefs THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THEM! My Dads Uncle (My Great Uncle) committed Suicide because nothing they gave him to treat his PTSD would work! So Thanks!

             The former womans library on Huron St. in Ypsilanti, Denton Rd. in Canton, MI the bridge that used to be there scariest place I have ever been in my life was there, on the bridge, 2am. I was told a busload of children went off the bridge and many children were killed. You could hear what sounded like crying; and a nearby tree in the middle of a field rumored to be a gathering place of demon worshipers and animal sacrifices. Parking there and I witnessed many shadow-like figures emerge from the semi-distant tree line.

             i use to volunteer at the Broadway Theatre in Mount Pleasant, MI. People did not like to go upstairs in the balcony alone because they felt they were being followed. I would run the lights upstairs but i never felt anything. A cast member was on the stage took a picture looking up toward the stage, there was a big heavyset man sitting there, something in the costume shop and a hat with floating skeleton head. I will never forget the skeleton head! I would investigate it if I was into ghost stories.

             A friend when she was younger use to live in the house across from me (I did not know her till we were teens, her mom and her moved out by then). She said they would be visited by a little girl, a boy and scary older woman. The woman would scare them and she almost fell down the stairway, her brother and his friend were playing and the glass for no reason exploded. They had family move into the one room and things would move etc. I didnt believe her but I ask my mother about and she said the family who lived there lived there for a year and moved out because they saw things. So it is true! There was secret passages, etc. Twenty years ago the house was bought by a couple who rebuilt it, after the renovation, the paranormal stopped! People should check out Mount Pleasant MI. There are elementary plots in Evart, MI that glow but that has to do with the minerals in the stones.

             Also, in Mount Pleasant, MI there is State Hospital of some form, there are old abandon buildings around the area. I have never been in the buildings but people have felt things touching them and felt bad presence. They ask people not to visit the buildings because escape mental patients have been found in the buidlings hiding out. The criminally insane in the State Hospital have bit a guys finger off and ate it, it their own poop. My friend is RN there.

             At Central MIchigan University in Mount Pleasant, MI
             <br/>
             Legend has it that a young woman was killed in Warriner Hall many years ago after her head was crushed by an elevator.
            </p>
            <p>
             The legends claim the girls ghost haunts Warriner Hall and in one of the windows, lights can be seen flickering and her silhouette can be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is this just an urban legend?
            </p>
            <p>
             According to a June 2, 1937, edition of Central State Life (the predecessor of Central Michigan Life), Theresa Elizabeth Schumacher, a 19-year-old cafeteria worker from Nottawa Township, was killed May 29 after her head was trapped within a small window in a door leading to an elevator shaft. She died from strangulation.

             It remains unclear as to why her head was in the door. There were no witnesses to the incident.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cindy Smith worked as a custodian in Warriner Hall throughout the 90s and said she has encountered the ghost many times.
            </p>
            <p>
             She said the elevator would open and close by itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was one time, I was in the elevator and the door flew open, she said. The ghost came on and went down to the basement with me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Smith said she saw the ghost flash across the stage in Plachta Auditorium and her vacuum would occasionally turn on and off by itself.
            </p>

             Smith eventually got used to the ghost and would even be friendly with her.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would ask if she wanted to help me clean and would give it a rag to help, she said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is it real?
            </p>
            <p>
             Keith Voeks, assistant director of University Events, had a similar experience while with director Bob Ebner.
            </p>
            <p>
             One night in 1982, they were taking down a show set on the stage of Warriner Halls Plachta Auditorium.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was late at night and they were by themselves. The doors had already been locked. Then, out of nowhere, a shadow-like apparition ran across the stage.
            </p>
            <p>
             We saw a shadow move across the stage and we were out of there in no less than 30 seconds, Voeks said.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said in the 1980s, the stage had a fire curtain, which worked as a wall that would come down over the stage and protect the audience from a fire if one broke out.
            </p>
            <p>
             Voeks said the fire curtain would malfunction by falling and crushing things.
            </p>
            <p>
             We would constantly find broken chairs and music stands, he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             One night, Voeks said he saw the fire curtain right on top of the piano.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the piano remained unharmed with only a layer of dust on the surface from the speed of the fire curtain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Theresa was playing with us, Voeks said. At the very least the piano lid would have been broken.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keeping an eye out
            </p>
            <p>
             Voeks said he has received many reports of seeing lights from the sixth set of windows on Warriner Hall.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that cannot be possible, he said. The sixth set of lights is an empty space of only about five feet between the fifth floor and the roof.
            </p>
            <p>
             No lights were ever installed.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said it is not beyond the realm of possibility that Theresas spirit could revisit the place of her death.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do believe Theresa is a spirit that keeps an eye on Warriner, Voeks said.

             The report above on the Masonic Temple is absurd.  1st, the date of the building is off by over 10 years.  Second George D. Mason DESIGNED the building.  He did not fund it.  It was funded by Masons in a Masonic Fundraiser to REPLACE the previous Detroit Temple.  George Mason died of NATURAL CAUSES in 1948 at the age of 92.  He suffered NO FINANCIAL LOSS from the building of the Temple.  The above is either ill researched or an out and out lie to draw attention.

               I can also tell you that no security guard has ever witnessed his ghost ascending the stairs that lead to the roof, as there are not stairs going up to the roof in the Masonic Temple.

             There is a place in Hancock, MI. Across the bridge from Houghton and now home to art and nursing majors part of Finlandia University portage hospital is by far the most active area that ive encountered in Michigan alone. The original site was built in 1896 and later moved to the larger more known hospital in the 60s or 70s. There have been dozens of reports along with personal encounters that I have experienced. More specifically Portage was originally known as St. Marys Hospital set up by Bishop John Vertin. The hospital was home to a series of mentally impaired and insane among much more.

             The Syfy Ghosthunters did *not* find evidence of the young man who allegedly killed himself. They indicated there was activity at Mission Point but specifically tried contacting the soul of the boy and came up with nothing. Jason Hawes makes it clear at the end of the show, when he presents their findings to the property manager.

             Clive &amp; Dots Anchor Inn in Houghton Lake is surely more haunted then half these places listed. Lots of evidence. Overwhelming EVPs. Full body apparitions, shadow figures, poltergeist activity, disembodied voices, laughter, whispering, footsteps. Doors opening/closing. Faucets on/off. The list goes on &amp; on. Century old hotel, restaurant &amp; lounge. Former logging land. Former indian area. Former gangster hangout. Former brothel. Lots of history &amp; stories!!

             One of the most haunted places in Michigan isnt on this list, its Clive and Dots Anchor Inn in Houghton Lake Mi.  The Anchor Inn was featured in Spirits Rising, the most recent Haunted Travels of Michigan books.  I have personally had many, many experiences here and so does anyone who visits.  The Anchor Inn sits right on a vortex and is a crossing point for two lay lines..

             The Anchor Inn in Houghton Lake, Michigan has a lot of activity there. The team I am part of was there and our equipment got a lot of readings. It is worth checking out if you are up north.

             O.C.C  Cooley lake road, Commerce.  Once a TB hospital. Theres still a morgue down stairs.  A lot of students have heard their name called throughout the halls and esp near the stairway going down stairs.  Beds were buried out in the property , years ago.  Some say that bones were also found during renovation of the old building.

             I was very surprised to not find Nunica cemetery on this list. They have some serious paranormal activity going on in that cemetery. If you search Nunica cemetery haunted on google mlive has a great article all about it. I pass Nunica every time on my way home from college, and I always get the most eerie feeling not even stopping my car.

             This lady needs to get her facts straight. The building pictured as the GR Bell Telephone building is the At&amp;t building in Detroit. And as for the Masonic Temple, that place was built in 1922 and George D Mason was the buildings architect, the Detroit Freemasons were the builder. And Mason died Decades later because he is also credited with being the architect of the Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian Church in Bloomfield Hills and that wasnt started until 1951.

             The old elks lodge of ludington michigan (now known as the sandcastles childrens museum) is possibly haunted by the former club leaders. While my parents were club members and frequent visitors, many paranormal things have happened to them, the members, and even me and my siblings such as; prank phone calls to a non-working line, ominous shadows without objects to cast them, rearranged tables and liquor bottles, and in my own experience, the basement door handles rattling with no one on the other side.

             A couple places on CMUs campus:
             <br/>
             1. In Warriner Hall, theres a ghost of someone who was killed in an elevator shaft many decades ago.
             <br/>
             2. A student apparently died in one of the residence halls  and her ghost stuck around that hall for many years. The day the hall was demolished, her window was open. Her ghost is still sometimes felt around campus.
             <br/>
             3. Near Powers Hall theres a garden in the shape of a piano. Thats believed by some to be the burial site of a student who enjoyed playing the piano. Sometimes, if you listen closely in that area, you can still hear her playing.

             A few years back a friend and I were at the Masonic Temple in Detroit.  At the time we would set up linens, tables and seating for weddings for extra cash.  The wedding we were to set up was located in a room that was relatively easy to get to from a back entrance, but being blessed with less-than-stellar senses of direction my friend and I wound up locked in a dark and deserted ballroom.  While searching for a way out we went through a door we thought we heard voices behind, because surely there were people in there that could direct us out!  Nope. I figured it was just a trick of the acoustics in the ballroom and wed gone through the wrong door.  Unfortunately, the door locked behind us (again!) and we spent the next hour going through rooms and hallways we had no business being in, all the while hearing what sounded like whispers and feeling like we were being watched.  We finally made it to the area we were supposed to be in, set up for the wedding and hauled buns out of there!  Suicide at the Masonic Temple or not, its a very beautiful and spooky place!

             Hands down, the most haunted area of Michigan is just north of Battle Creek in Bedford. A little boy in a red coat has been seen for generations. Hes not really scary, its as if he is lost and wanders the area looking for something or someone. Hes been seen for years and years and as recently as this spring. Always the same, the stories never change which seem to add validity to the sightings. I wont describe my experience..lets just say I too believe.

             I have lived here in Michigan all my life! I was born in traverse city and moved away when I was 6 but every year I go there cause I have family there. I will tell you, you do get feelings at the old asylum I have been around that place so many times every year I go and see it. Ive loved it since I was little. My great grandparents (grandmas parents) worked their and so did her younger sister. My great grandfather (grandpas side) was at the asylum due to his depression. I was born at the medical hospital next to the northern Michigan insane asylum and my day care was next to it so I know the grounds very well. Ive been in that building quite a few times I know it is haunted no doubt about that. Well some time this summer I shall return their for senior pictures it is a beautiful place. Every time I got there I always got to take like a bunch of pictures just to see if I can get any unusual things on my camera. Also at times I feel very uncomfortable and I just want to walk away from the spot I dont feel comfortable at so yeah it is haunted for sure. Gotta love haunted Michigan!

             Ive been to Northville Paychiatric Hospital in Northville, MI many times and it is totally spooky! Especially the system of tunnels that run beneath the property. Everything from the abandoned patient rooms to the morgue, its definitely one of the most haunted places in Michagan. I was very surprised to not see it on this list!

             Wow thats so awesome to know I was raised in Monroe and I have personally experienced alot of activity there not only by the old battlefields but in apartment complexes and homes and the old steel castings building that has been torn down and duplexes built there,  and the old Paper mill that has now been torn down but was only about a half a block away from the museum for the battle of 1812. I never thought it would have been documented as one of the 10 most haunted places in Michigan although from my experiences I do understand why.  Its nice to know Im not just crazy lol.

             A few years ago I went to a wedding at the Felt Mansion.  The Reception was downstairs but we were free to wander most of the home.  I fell in love with that home!  There were definitely strong feelings for me there, mostly good.  My husband and I went up to the ballroom which is on the 3rd floor and we were the only ones in there.  There are floor to ceiling windows in there with benches that you can stand on and just look out the windows at the grounds.  I felt very at peace in that room and didnt want to leave it.  There was also a narrow stairway going from the ballroom up to a widows peak, but we couldnt access it.  I really wanted to go up there.  I guess Agnes felt we were ok because we didnt get reprimanded by her ghost, only good vibes were felt there.  However, down the hallway were the childrens rooms and I got goosebumps down there.

             Very neat place and would recommend visiting there!

             Ghost Hunters did not investigate Fort Mackinac, the state wont let investigations take place there. However, they did investigate Mission Point.

             I had walked into a business in the town of Pitsford mi several years ago to make a delivery. The owner asked if she could help me. I told her the building was haunted by an older gentleman ( mind u I had never been here before) she asked how I knew all these things he would do.an employee stopped in her tracks as she heard me talking with her jaw dropped. Yeah I hit the nail on the head !

             I have heard so many people in our small community talk about the Nunica Cemetary in Nunica, Michigan. I live in Coopersville which is a small town next to Nunica, but I have lived in Nunica from 2008 to 2009. Unfortunetly I have not yet went to see for myself, but after hearing so many people tell stories then finding that it was also mentioned in a book of haunted places in Michigan, I am compelled to put it on my must do list.

             My dad took me to the traverse city hospital (#1) a long time ago. As an 11 year old, I wanted to ask him why there were people staring out the windows if its abandoned. I didnt though! Looking forward to checking out some of the other ones on this list.

             Adrian College. I went to school there my freshman year and heard that one of the dorms in the freshman quad was haunted by a little boy. At night he could be heard bouncing a ball in the hallways. Another haunted part of the college is Downs Hall. One night, between 1am and 2am, I was walking to a friends apartment across campus and i felt someone looking at me. When I looked up, I saw a woman in white looking out from the top floor of downs hall and when I looked back up I saw that she was gone. When I saw my friend outside I asked him about it and he told me that a woman died there and she could be seen in the window, he also told me that sometimes you could hear the stairs on the side of the building shaking because somebody else was killed there. I only saw her once since I avoided walking by there at night.
