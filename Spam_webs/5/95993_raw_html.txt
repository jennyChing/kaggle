           I liked their early stuff better. Its easy to feel suspicious of this sentiment, so often leveled at musicians, filmmakers, novelists and doughnut shop owners alike, considering the increasing speed with which the digitally empowered masses seem to move from unexpected delight towards vague dissatisfaction these days.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="6d2d" name="6d2d">
           Yet, in the case of Alan Ball, its hard not to agree: How did the creator of
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            Six Feet Under
           </em>
           , one of the most original, thoughtful, understated dramas on television, go on to create
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            True Blood
           </em>
           , one of the flashiest, emptiest, most repetitive dramas ever to haunt the small screen? While
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            Six Feet Under
           </em>
           came to a (moving and unforgettable) close after five seasons,
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            True Blood
           </em>
           is like a vampire version of Fonzie, jumping the shark every single week without any sign of stopping. On Monday, HBO announced that
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            True Blood
           </em>
           was renewed for its seventh season, which takes the show through 2014. And if ratings hold up, Vampire Fonzie might never die.
          </p>
          <p class="graf--p" id="8c15" name="8c15">
           Does Alan Ball recognize the monster hes created? Apparently not. 
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            True Blood
           </em>
           has been, and will continue to be, a highlight of not only my career but my life, Ball said when he departed the show at the end of its fifth season. Balls flair for the dramatic should come as no surprise, considering how he milked maximum drama from a less-than-promising concept about a funeral home
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            and
           </em>
           squeezed a hit show out of a pulpy gaggle of vampire books whose literary merits are roughly on par with
           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            Fifty

           <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">
            Shades

           . Still, could these two shows be any different? Because every single thing thats good about

            Six Feet Under
           </em>
           is bad about

When Claire Fisher got a new boyfriend, we worried about her. When Sookie gets a new boyfriend, we shrug and assume hes about to eat the flesh off her face. Whats wrong with that?

Jason cuts ties with Sookie then forgets all about it in the next episode; Sams girlfriend dies and he shakes it off and makes eyes at a pretty activist a few hours later.

While Six Feet Under came to a (moving and unforgettable) close after five seasons, True Blood is like a vampire version of Fonzie, jumping the shark every single week without any sign of stopping.

Watching True Blood is like attending a town meeting packed with paranoiac individuals if, you know, those meetings usually end in gory violence. And even when characters on True Blood have huge differences of opinion, theyre typically forgotten by the next episode. No amount of swearing or yelling makes a difference. Jason cuts ties with Sookie then forgets all about it in the next episode; Sams girlfriend dies and he shakes it off and makes eyes at a pretty activist a few hours later.

By thrusting the Fishers into a weekly existential crisis, we learned more about them. The theme of the show  that we can only truly live once weve learned to accept our eventual deaths  dovetailed beautifully with the shows central gimmick. True Bloods gimmick  that vampires are a drowntrodden minority  not only upstages the plot, the characters, and the larger series arc, but it never feels quite right. Unlike, say, the peaceful aliens in the Apartheid allegory District 9, vampires actually murder people. Often.

Mostly these were juicy twists to otherwise solid, realistic storylines, and each twist was often the extreme outcome of a character making reckless choices.

On True Blood, death is meaningless.
