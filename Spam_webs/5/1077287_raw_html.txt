            Data security is a top concern not only for enterprises and small business, but for everyday consumers as well. With widespread data breaches exposing everything from customer login credentials to credit card information to personal health records, consumers must be savvy about data security and take steps to protect their own information. Fortunately, there are many ways individuals and families can take extra precautions to ensure their personal data is safe and secure from hackers and malicious criminals. While few security measures can guarantee that no data security breaches will affect you, implementing multiple layers of personal data security protections substantially reduces the likelihood that your data will be compromised. Educating yourself on what to do should your identity be stolen or your personal data exposed will help you take the proper steps to minimize damage after the fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            To that end, we've compiled a list of 101 informative quotes on data security, ranging from quotes about the state of modern data security to useful tips on protecting your family's personal information, how to teach your children proper data security measures and keep them safe online, identifying hoaxes and scams, and more. The following 101 data security quotes are categorized for simple perusing and are not listed in any particular order of importance.

            1. "If there are other people using your computer, you may be worried that someone else may accidentally access, modify, and/or delete your files. Most operating systems (including Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X, and Linux) give you the option of creating a different user account for each user, and you can set the amount of access and privileges for each account. You may also choose to have separate accounts for your work and personal purposes. While this approach will not completely isolate each area, it does offer some additional protection. However, it will not protect your computer against vulnerabilities that give an attacker administrative privileges. Ideally, you will have separate computers for work and personal use; this will offer a different type of protection." -

Running your computer as an administrator (or as a Power User in Windows) leaves your computer vulnerable to security risks and exploits. Simply visiting an unfamiliar Internet site with these high-privilege accounts can cause extreme damage to your computer, such as reformatting your hard drive, deleting all your files, and creating a new user account with administrative access." -

This ability to share files can be used to infect your computer with a virus or look at the files on your computer if you dont pay close attention. So, unless you really need this ability, make sure you turn off file-sharing. Check your operating system and your other program help files to learn how to disable file sharing. Dont share access to your computer with strangers!" -

We are in a digital age and a lot of our data is stored digitally  bank records, photos, letters, music. A recent NCSA/Symantec study showed that over 68% of Americans store more than 25% of their photos digitally, for example. There are any number of ways data can be lost. Accidental deletion is common. Device failure happens. Natural events, such as electrical or wind storms, fires, or floods can eradicate data. Cyber events such as viruses, spyware or other cyber attacks can remove data, as well." -

Fair enough, but it's the same as if you asked, 'How not to get my house burned down?' and the answer would be, 'Do not have a house.'

So if you have a choice you should opt for keeping your crucial information away from virtual world or use appropriate solutions." -

The simplest of programs, such as free online email accounts, have multi-layered security, too.

"Mobile computing devices can store large amounts of data, are highly portable and are frequently unprotected: They are easy to steal or lose, and unless precautions are taken, an unauthorized person can gain access to the information stored on them or accessed through them. Even if not stolen or lost, intruders can sometimes gain all the access they need if the device is left alone and unprotected, if data is 'sniffed out of the air' during wireless communications, or if malware is installed. The results can include crippled devices, personal data loss, disclosure of non-public University data, and disciplinary actions for the device owner." -

I knew this was bogus immediately. We sent out a voicemail quickly warning all employees not to fall for opening attachments that offer to install any kind of software. That was March, 1999. Every 18 months or so, someone tries this hoax again by crafting and sending out a phony email complete with a Microsoft look-alike logo, spoofed return address, links, etc., and some text assuring you that this is all the real thing.

The principle behind social engineering and scams in general is that people are the weak link in security  that it can be easier to trick people than to hack into computing systems by force. Social engineers exploit peoples natural tendency to want to trust and be helpful. They also take advantage of our tendency to act quickly when faced with a crisis." -

It integrates with your web browser and automatically enters your username and password for you when you are logging in to a website. A good password manager will also generate secure passwords for you when you register with a new site or change a password. The password manager protects its contents by using a special master password. Needless to say, it is critical to choose a very strong master password. Some password managers allow you to add multi-factor authentication in addition to your master password to give you an extra layer of security. There are plenty of good password managers to choose from (far too many to mention here) and many of them are free. I often recommend

So, for example, 'Steelers?Win!Cowboys?Lose!' or 'Volt!Amp!Tesla!Edison?' won't be cracked by any common password cracker program but you'll be able to recall such phrases much more easily than say 'ufc#1310.'
Safe passwords don't have to be memory twisters. They just have to be hard for computers to work out, and phrases make great passwords." -

One cloud service that is being offered is a revolutionary storage method for your data. From music files to pictures to sensitive documents, the cloud invisibly backs up your files and folders  and alleviates the potentially endless and costly search for extra storage space. An alternative to buying an external hard drive or deleting old files to make room for new ones, cloud storage is convenient and cost-effective. It works by storing your files on a server out in the internet somewhere rather than on your local hard drive...  This allows  you to back up, sync, and access your data across multiple devices as long as they have internet capability." -

As realistic and frightening as this may sound, before forwarding it to everyone in your address book, take a little time to verify its authenticity. To me, the most annoying aspect of these emails is not so much their falsehood (though that's bad enough) as that they're forwarded repeatedly by completely nave folks. With a little information, however, you can overcome this navet." -
