    I started Shadowness when I was 20, after dropping out of college and accepting my first job as a graphic designer. Back then, the site served as my personal portfolio, but also had some tutorials about the techniques that I learned along the way. Eventually, it was so popular that I decided to create a community out of it. That was the birth of Shadowness. Little did I know that it would be my first little startup. I had no experience running a business and eventually it would fail. But my passion for art persisted and I kept releasing new versions of the site with each passing year as a side project. I learned a great deal about designing a community driven site and with a motivated team of volunteers, we created a tight-knit community that showcased some of the best graphic design works the world had ever seen. We barely survived but we loved every minute. In our best year, we served over 50,000 artists.

    Today, I haven't updated the site in 2 years. My main job requires too much of my time. I can't provide the same level of focus and passion that our community rightly deserves. Deep down I secretly wished that I would find again an opportunity where I could refocus my efforts on rebuilding and improving the site. But I waited too long and the cracks are already showing. So with a heavy heart, I decided to close the site so that our community, moderators and staff can move on instead of waiting for something great to happen, or worse let the frustrations build up as pressing issues are left unsolved. I hope that you keep fond memories of Shadowness. And I hope that with all the things that you've learned here, you'll take that knowledge with you and keep creating great works of art.
