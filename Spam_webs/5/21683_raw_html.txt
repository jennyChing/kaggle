       This is an article I came across months ago. We are not sure of the author. However weve checked the authenticity of this with our followers in Bangkok and Cambodia. Surprisingly this seems to be true and their request is only to offer beggars with food and water and not money. Any hlp you can do in terms of their needs are just fine. But make sure you do not hand over big bills that will keep the begging industry going. You should be wise enough to know whom to help and how to help. Make your decision based on the situation and knowing it well enough.

       Near the metro station sits a woman of uncertain age. Womens hair is confused and dirty, her head bowed in grief.
      </p>
      <p>
       The woman sits on the dirty floor and next to her lies a bag. In that bag people throw money. On the hands of a woman, asleep, is a two year old baby. Hes in a dirty hat and dirty clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Madonna with baby  numerous passers-by will donate money. The people of our kind- we always feel sorry for less fortunate. We are ready to give unfortunate people the last shirt, the last penny out of your pocket and never think another issue. Helping, seems like. Good job done
      </p>
      <p>
       I walked past a beggar for a month. Did not give any money, as I knew that this is a gang operated scam and money collected by the beggar will be given to whoever controls beggars in the area. Those people own numerous luxury properties and cars. Oh and beggar also gets something, of course  A bottle of vodka in the evening and a dner kebab. A month later, walking past the beggars, as shock, it suddenly hit me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im staying at a busy crossing, stared at the baby, dressed as always- dirty track suit. I realized that it seemed wrong, finding a child in a dirty underground station from morning to evening. The baby slept. Never sobbed or screamed, always asleep, burying his face in the knee of a woman who was his MUM.

             You are criminalizing the poor. You make huge assumptions in the article. Who would choose to beg for money for a living? I am not saying I support pan handling. I am just saying that there is a common and pervasive hateful idea that poor people are having the time of their lives and living the high life. If there was less poverty, more social programs and education, do you think anyone would just choose to beg? I think if you were a journalist with gumption you would spend a week homeless, instead of yelling at panhandlers. On a visit to Krakow, I gave a very young gypsy girl beggar (maybe 5) an apple. She was so grateful and happy to get that apple. I also find it disconcerting that you think the child is being drugged. Maybe it is a doll? Who cares? I find it especially troublesome too that this is on the Buddhist Broadcasting Network.

               Rocky. You are the one who is making assumptions. Have you ever been to Thailand or Cambodia? Have you consider doing research or working with NGOs regarding to this type of business? There are many cases where children are kidnapped and put into similar positions. Some will cut their hands off just to get us to give mire money. It is a lucrative business in Thailand particularly. Ive been there and visited many NGOs regarding to the issue. You have no idea what you are talking about.

                 I am having a hard time understanding  are you saying they cut off childrens hands, or beggars are cutting off their own hands? The woman beggar is a victim. This article is poorly written, offers no remedies, and truly victimizes women and poor. It is not a crime to beg for money. Buddha was a beggar. Where are these kingpins or mansions and limos? Wouldnt it be a better article if the journalist found these bosses or maybe was kind to a beggar and got a little bit of her story? Why are there no stories on the lack of social programs, CPS, womens shelters. No lets shout at a beggar and make a story about it. Shame on Buddhist Broadcasting Network for such a short sided article.

                   Actually, the majority of the beggars in third world countries are used by gangs as an income source especially kids. The gang members make the kids beg for money which they collect at the end of day. Common in India , Thailand  not sure in other countries but Im sure it occurs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In Brazil slums child beggars usually hang out together and swarm a mark  and pickpocket or mug the victim as a group.

                  <p>
                   Many of the poor are usually forced or seduced by drugs and alcohol. And in regards to social programs they dont work.

                     Yes, you are right. Its a gangs who organized by Cambodian using the Cambodian Child Beggars in Bangkok Thailand. All Thais are know and has given the beggars monthly estimated ($500,000). They are not Thais and Thais working better jobs just like other countries in Europe, France which having a lot of problem from Gypsy. Check this link:

                   I am sorry. I am a bit offended by you saying shame on this while you dont actually know the reality. I have been to Thailand and worked with several Non government organizations regarding to these issues. They, as in the gangsters, would kidnappend young children and cut off their hands to get sympathy from people like you and me. They are usually around areas that have a lot of tourists. It is their way of making money. I am not referring because Ibe been there. What the author wrote is very accurate of the situation. I am just letting you know that this is a problem in Thailand and if you have not been there then you would not know. You have compassion but lack the wisdom.

                     I can testify that this very exact situation happens in Latin American countries. I live in Ecuador, and is well-known that beggars are promoted by drug and prostitution gangs. Particularly, here, mothers send their kids to the streets to beg during the day, and by the night they take all the money and buy drugs or any cheap hallucinogenic substances. The author of this article got the facts right.

                     Poor people search for (sometimes nasty -) ways to also survive and gain security. Thats the nasty side of the free market economy. Thats what needs to be changed. So if we really want to help the unfortunate people then thats the only civilized way to organize a community.

                   Im currently living in France and I see this problem every day. In fact, there is a large gypsy camp close to where I live. The government has offered assistance but they refuse it because they prefer to live a life of begging and stealing. Its easier than assimilating into society and committing to a real job. Every time I walk past a beggar, he/she is always holding a sleeping baby, puppy, kitten etc. If you want to see where their money is going, I suggest you google gypsy mansions. When I was living in Shanghai, I saw a boy, not more than 6 yrs. old, with long scars across both eyes, begging in the metro. It was obvious that he was blinded intentionallyBefore, I may have doubted these kinds of stories but Ive seen enough with my own eyes to know that the world we live in isnt all that pretty.

                   Well, Id think it was about the children more than the adults. You know, if you ask 100 people a day for 1$-thats $100 for very little effort- you are foolish to think it isnt done and people dont choose to do it. Many victims to being poor, on drugs, alcohol, will do many things-many are as prostitutes to a pimp-many people today have no qualms or shame in doing a variety of things. The writer is making others aware of the situation, he alone cant fix it. But, I suppose one who believes in a ancient fat man-who was JUST a man- and worships a stone statue of him doesnt have a grip on reality!

                   Yes I have seen this with my own eyes on a trip to Vietnam. I saw a man who had no eyeballs and no forearms. I am sure that he was purposely mutilated because it isnt plausible how he lost his arms and entire eyeballs. He was dragged along by a little girl who was begging for money. I saw her later take the money and give it to some man with whom she hopped onto a motorbike and rode away with. My dad told me that the motorist probably owned that girl and armless, eye-less man. It is extremely tragic and horrid.

                   Rocky, I personally have been to both Thailand and Cambodia (Thailand being the largest human trafficking country in the world) and YES this is a HUGE money maker for criminals. I myself (with a group of mine) intervened and actually bought a beggar whos legs and arms had been cut off. At 4 years old he was sold into slavery for what was equivalent to 2 American dollars. His family couldnt afford to support him so they sold him into human trafficking. How can you sit around and deny the evils in this world? Maybe you need to travel outside of your comfortable living situation to wake up to the realities of the world. Dont ever assume that the comfortable life we live is even CLOSE to what others live like abroad. Ignorance fuels human trafficking

                   Obviously Rocky havent been outside the US to see such network going on. They are well trained overseas and they are situated in areas where tourists are at to get money. In Vietnam, they would steal or buy babies at the border of Cambodia to use as tool to extract sympathy from overseas tourist.

                     I think I can understand your point of view but I gotta say that unfortunately what this article says is true. I can guarantee you that the point of this article is right, since I am 100% Thai and have been living in Thailand for 21 years now. I see this everyday. It is something that all the local people know but yet the government still have not focused on solving this issue enough.

                   Rocky, you live in too beautiful of a world and youre lucky in that sense. But you are completely blind to the horrible things that are happening everywhere else.
                   <br/>
                   I am Thai. I live in Thailand. There ARE in fact criminal organizations that do these things. They kidnap children and use them as beggars. They mutilate them and amputate them for more sympathy.
                   <br/>
                   In certain areas of Bangkok (the capital of Thailand. I hope you know that.) there would be these burn victims with the exact same type of injuries (face and hands completely mutilated) begging for money. Coincidence? No. Ive seen three burn victims so far in the area of Ladprao, Bangkok. They switch beggars for certain days. And Ive seen these same guys begging at different parts of the city as well (Siam,Bangkok). And when theyre done begging I see them getting picked up by a shady group of people.
                   <br/>
                   There are many issues of kidnapping here as well. A couple of years ago a family lost their kid and they found her, sleeping of course, on the lap of some beggar lady.
                   <br/>
                   This is a real issue here Rocky. Its criminal and has nothing to do with the Buddhist society here. The beggars and criminal gangs are the ones taking advantage of the Buddhist culture because we DO like to make merit.
                   <br/>
                   And youre wondering why not talk to the bosses? Because theyre mostly in the mafia. And since Thailand is a highly corrupted society, they pay off the police and are essentially invincible. No one can mess with them.
                   <br/>
                   Again, you seem to live in a beautiful  and perfect world. Thats great. But open your eyes to how corrupted and horrible people can actually be. Please do some reasearch on these things.

                   What the author is saying that if you give money you are perpetuating the business. Dont give money. I will add that if you give American dollars in a place like Cambodia the exchange rate is 4000 to 1. that means that 1000 real is equal to a quarter in our money. The average salary in Cambodia is less than $10 per week. Youre making their slave master rich and they dont get anything for it..

                   It is a crime to beg in Mississippi, USA. Panhandling is a crime. There are way too many options for the poor (here), therefore it is a crime. [welfare, womens shelters, free food programs, homeless shelters, etc.] Being homeless here is actually a crime.
                   <br/>
                   I do not know about other countries, but I understood the article. And it did give remedies.And, if there was a child involved, there should be protection for that child. Again, I am only familiar with my culture where the child would be taken into protective custody by the state and the person holding the child (parent or not) would be arrested for child endangerment.
                   <br/>
                   Also, a new reporter did do a story about this type of scam. He stood on a busy street corner in South Mississippi and begged for money in ragged clothing. He made more money in 1 hour than an entire weeks worth of wages at his job. In New Orleans, Louisiana (I dont believe panhandling is illegal there) an attorney quit his practice because he learned that he could make more money begging, in less time, than to have to do actual work.

                     Being homeless is not a crime, that is a ridiculous, idiotic thing to say. Panhandling is a crime, yes, but panhandling is actively seeking money from people while standing on city/public property, not the state of being where you have no home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The article did not give remedies, it was trying to shed light on a specific instance in a country most Westerners would not have known about, your belief that a form of CPS should be available shows that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Also, the concept of a mafia or prostitution ring like structure forcing people to beg all day, then taking most, if not all of the money from them, still leaving that person in poverty is EXACTLY like the scam of American beggars having lots of money and just being lazy asses who dont want to work. I can really see the correlation.

                   The bad men who handle the racket are the ones who cut their hands off. Im sorry but the article is clearly written by someone whom english is not their first language, &amp; I had zero problems understanding what he was saying. That is because I traveled &amp; if you really did travel, this article shouldnt be so hard to understand. Also, if the woman is part of the crime, how is she the victim? Those women are not nice people they are con artists duh. He stated that he tried to speak to her normally but that she told him to f off. Im just finding it so hard to believe that someone can point their finger at someone who made them aware of what is common knowledge to others &amp; shame him. Shame on you for not being aware in the first place, since you dont want to be told!!

                   Rocky, I am Thai and just happened to see this article and I would say that this kind of thing is actually possible. No matter how you think the world is peaceful, it is only to some extent or some people. Im not saying that you are wrong. Maybe the boss was really kind to the woman but doing this kind of thing or drug the child is still not the right way to cure poverty or solve this issue. I assure you theres this kind of thing in reality even though we have many kind of womens shelters or other organizations, thing is the beggar might not want to go  they dont have the knowledge whats the best thing to do. Also  Buddha is not a beggar. He never beg for food or money or anything. If people offer, he accepts but if no one offer, he just wouldnt have anything and he would not say a thing about it. Please study more about Buddhism if you really like it. PS- No offend here, just clarifying.

                   Actually, this article speaks truth, and you can see it in NYC as well. I have met people with luxury vehicles that spend all day begging on the subways. although they will pretend to be grateful when you give them food. They will throw it away when nobody is looking. Others will literally spit in your face if you give them food.

                   My roommate use to do it cause he couldnt get hired due to his criminal record and could make anywhere from 100 to 700 in a day which is high above minimum wage so if u really think all beggars are begging cause they have no food.. then youre wrong

                   Excuse me??? Im white and Ive lived in Asia my entire life. How dare you discriminate against me because my eyes dont look like yours. Yes that Rocky guy is ignorant and stupid, but its not because of his race. He doesnt understand because hes never been there to SEE what goes on. Some people are simply ignorant. One could argue that youre also ignorant due to the way you apply blanket statements about people with a certain skin color and eye shape. Shame on you.

                     Your comment here, How dare you discriminate against me because my eyes dont look like yours. Also shame on you for insinuating the fact that Asians have smaller eyes, a rather well- known racist comment about Asian features. Though it may be true, the Guest above did not mention this in his ignorant comment.

                     Sakura doesnt say anything about Asian eyes being smaller, Sakura simply pointed out that theyre different shapedwhich they are. Stop projecting your negative ideas and inferiorities on to others.

                 Thanks for making people aware of this. It is also similar in south Asia. Well networked, well connected and well planned business unfortunately. There are genuine beggars too.Just that its difficult to separate them.

               If that is your reply to the article, than you completely misunderstood it. The women holding the children are often there against their will as well. The people having a time of their lives are the ones profiting from the collections. I see these people on the subway all the time, and it is ALWAYS a different child. I have seen this in other countries as well.

               Dear Rocky. You are asking who would beg for a living. Well we know lot of them. In fact we know few Beggar business networks in India, Thailand and in Sri Lanka. There are cons who lead this business. We are well aware on the subject.
               <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://www.bbncommunity.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>
               . Besides, do not get mistaken. We are talking about a very specific issue. An issue of child use to beg.And you were very right on offering an apple to that girl which is exactly what we are encouraging. Please understand our intentions before assuming.

               Yes, there are criminal gangs that run beggars, run people trafficking networks, force women into prostitution and take away their passports till a fictitious debt is paid off, exploit children for monetary gain. You need to open your eyes and remove yourself from your insular world. You havent got a damn clue, that much is obvious by your comments.

               He didnt criminalize the poor. Read the article once more. Then once again. Hes saying theres an horror behind this particular kind of begging, and hes criminalizing who runs the racket. You have no idea what there can be behind a hat on the floor. This is just one of the techniques, methods. To let you draw a curve Ill tell you about the one where they literally kick a dog under your car so that when you stop because, if the dog is lucky you just killed him, you get off your car and they have all the time to surround you, rob you and go away with your car. On the other hand, generalizing would be silly, but being aware is, indeed, important.

               The poor are victims being used by cons. We are not criminalizing them, they are being used to make others rich and being abused. Cant you read or did you choose to skip reading? If you have ever traveled or knew someone personally that is in this trade you would know.

               Nobody is criminalising the poor. If thats what you understood from the article, you didnt read it carefully We have the same problem in our country  those poor beggers are controlled by foreign (its better for them to be foreign bacause of the laws  so our police
               <br/>
               cannot arrest them for this kind of crime, they can only deport them) mafia, which takes the money from them, it is the same situation (at least we dont have mothers with sleeping children). Mafia is the one who is criminalizing them and by giving them money you only support this kind of exploitation. That is the point. If you give them food and they keep it, that is what can help them. Good for you and good for them.
               <br/>
               Also they dont choose to beg for the money, they are poor and they have no other option. But the point is, you dont give the money to the poor people you give it to rich people who exploit the poor. Still fine with it?
               <br/>
               And about the child ok, maybe it is a doll, but what if he is drugged. Isnt that worse? How can you ask who cares?!?

             Heres a possible solution that someone posted on FB about helping the homeless.  Instead of giving money, offer small care packages.  A woman on the streets might need XYZ items for herself (this could include non perishable food items) and a baby will need XYZ items
             <br/>
             ( this may include diapers.)  This will allow you to give without feeling like youve scammed.  If the beggar is genuinely in need, they will be grateful.  If not, they will toss it and someone else will find it and benefit.  Once you give, you arent responsible for how the gift was used.  You are only responsible for the intentions of your act.  Just a thought.

               Thanks DeDe. We should not stop helping homeless and beggars. We should continue. help them. But wisely and consciously.

                 define wisely, if you give today, tomorrow they will come back and they will expect another BBN Team. or maybe if this kind of a business for a syndicate. if they cannot get any amount from their slave beggar they will surely stop the business.

                   helping means getting them off the situation they are in. Government authorities should be the authorized agent in these cases. Syndicates who operates this must be the targeted enemy here, not the victims like that mother. The mother is also a victim of poverty and was forced to do things like this. This is bigger than a mere beggar in the street.

               If one has to go out of their way to buy gifts that the beggar MIGHT need, I say why not just give them the money then? Only they would know what they really need right?
               <br/>
               If you dont feel comfortable giving the money to the beggar, maybe feeling like the beggar is going to use the money for drugs, then whats the point? To feel better about yourself in helping the poor? If you really want to feel good about helping the poor do some volunteering. I can tell you there are many orphanage children that would love some attention, Im sure there is much help needed there. The point of this article is to get people off the street begging; with beggars come all day sitting and waiting for some money then once obtain enough, they might use some of it for McDonalds or drugs. Neither of these options are practical. I mean they practically stand/sit on the same corner for hours. I know, I live in LA and see the same people on the streets at the same place. What Im trying to do is place some insight and think around then norm in Im just helping, because your not. if you really want to help stop passing money out. Yes there is going to be a major withdrawal but eventually they will work for their money and resulting in the economy circle to grow and move along more freely. Even if it is under the table money.

                     Really good question.l think that is what the main matter is.
                     <br/>
                     I read this article and found that most of what the author said is correct and perceived a good concept for what he saw but l had only heard of the caretakers giving them sleeping pills and had not heard of Vodka or Heroin.
                     <br/>
                     l dont really think the author has seen the whole picture of the country he was staying in, at this time it was Thailand.
                     <br/>
                     Rural areas are packed with beggars, even more so than in the cities. Its part of the culture of that particular country. We in the West tend to look down on beggars, but l find that locals respect beggars, and are generous and kind to them, Its as though they are thankful for not being in that position, in this short time on earth.
                     <br/>
                     This culture has rubbed off into the bigger cities where you get syndicates forcing families, mainly, to work for gambling debts. Losingt their money because they were alcoholics, seams to be one factor involved. Gambling in SE Asia is also a part of the cultureits called LUCK.
                     <br/>
                     What about the kid? No one cares about the kids. Not really real humans and totally defenseless. Who cares? Not beggars but even worse, a poor bugger.
                     <br/>
                     Maybe there would be less of this going on if they could take the child into custody, where it can get healthy and an education,for its future? Or would this just encourage poor young mothers, to go this path, so that it becomes more of a problem?
                     <br/>
                     Until someone can change their culture, and to give some money and be thankful to not be in that position, judge not so much whats behind it, is part of humanity.  We maybe have to except the way it is and understand it and learn their way before coming up with solutions instead of criticism.
                     <br/>
                     They dont have social security to talk of so we will never be able to judge on such a moral high ground, as we have never been in their position. They are fighting for their lives, literally, mafia run or otherwise.

                     I appreciate the insight you give regarding different cultures and how they may respond to beggars. Its true that the we in the West tend to look down on beggars, but I really like that you pointed out that the locals respect beggarsas they are thankful for not being in that position in this short time on earth. Beautifully-said. There is a large homeless population where I live out here in the Bay Area. While it can be tempting to attribute this issue to simple causes, as with so many hot-button topics, it is much more complex . A lot of people just try to survive the best they can without knowing there is help out there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I recently worked at a non-profit that gave me 2-1-1 cards to hand out. This phone number connects callers (in the U.S.) to local information about health (mental and physical) and human services available in their community. Even when I dont have these cards with me, I have told several people about the number. Its a neutral, confidential way to possibly get help/information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Where I live (Oakland, California), I get hit-up for money or food from the store almost every time I go out. It can be irritating to deal with as Im trying to get into a store without having to deal with twinges of guilt that I just want to get in, and get out without being bothered with the oft-used Can I ask you a question?, or a long, extremely personal story about a persons life. However, I am often reminded by another persons example in how they treat these people that I can still be courteous when I decline. One quote that runs through my head sometimes is: You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him. (I had to look up who said it; its Johann Wolfgang von Goethe).

                 On my first trip to the Philippines, me and my wife stayed in Manila for a week. There were children begging everywhere, my wife said dont give them anything. One day I was tired of seeing poor children begging so I gave one of the kids a little money and children came from everywhere and wouldnt leave me alone. My wife said something to them in Tagalog and they left us alone. I dont know if its always a scam, but it was hard not to give when I had so much (the exchange rate at that time was 42 peso to the dollar.)

                   Your wife was right James, to this date some of the major cities in the Philippines has city ordinance against beggars. Am humbly suggest that better give to charities next time. You did great that time. Best regards and God Bless you and your family.

                   At one point we had a policy where beggars are to be forcibly brought to shelters. Not only are they a road hazard, but as weve seen in the story, theres unscrupulous forces behind them.

               I was walking on the street  with my wife the other day when suddenly this woman with a child in her hands appeared. Of-course she was begging for her child. My wife felt sad and rushed to a near by shop to buy milk for the baby. I felt really content with what my wife did. The land where i come from, we have huge problems with begging. It gets really hard to judge, whether someone is really in need or  its a racket. I was not too surprise with the fact, when another passerby told us that the beggar threw the milk in the nearby dustbin, the much needed food for the child. Not even a single word of mine intends to say that we shouldnt have a helping hand for them. What i really mean is that if we actually want to help them out, we should better arrange something for these people, so that they can sustain themselves in future. Meanwhile tracking down these Begging-rings and bringing those behind this to justice should be a priority. Giving money would make them more dependent on us, giving opportunities would make them self dependent. Just an opinion.

               I agree. Our secondary school is awesome, every year, we have a interhouse knitting competition. The house with the most squares of knitting wins the competition. All of the squares are knitted together into 46 blankets and sent off to Cambodia, and we distribute these blankets to the poor. In Hong Kong, we have many refugees that have came here because of war and other things. Refugees in HK are not allowed to work. The lucky ones live on less than 600 HKD(currently 77.32 US dollars) welfare money a month. That might seem a lot, but remember the HK government dont let them go to normal shops like us, they have to go to these special shops in which everything is overpriced. Every Christmas, we collect food, clothes, toys and hotel toiletries(unused ones) from everyone. Food is put into many different baskets, toys are sold (*cough* given away for free*cough*) and clothes and put onto racks sorted by colour and gender. The shops are our classrooms, changing rooms are offices. Each year, we rent bouncy castles  for the children to play. In our Christmas party in 2013, over 282 refugees came to our party. That included children, pre-teens, teenagers and adults. I could go on and on with this post, but Ill just end it with this:

             In Southern California (and Im sure its happening in other parts of the country too) you see people at the freeway off ramps panhandling, often holding various signs (will work for food, down and out please help, need money to feed my kids, etc). and 99.99% of it is a scam. These folks make @ 200-300 per shift per day (tax free) and at the end of their shift another person comes in to replace them. If you look around the off ramps you may even see where they stashed their sign at the end of their shift. Wanting to help those downtrodden is fine but there are other ways to do it instead of just handing over your cash. Look at missions from local churches that help the needy. I saw a guy the other day holding a sign that said Will work for food. and when I told him I needed my lawn mowed and would give him a meal and 10 bux when he was done he told me Just give me the 10 bux and Ill buy my own food. when I asked him about work he said he couldnt do it because he was disabled. I gave him a piece of paper with the name and address of a local church that has a food bank to help people and he flipped me off.

             Often theres a beggar in front of my building in Vienna, Austria begging for money without shoes during winter. I admire his ability to withstand the cold without shaking, but theres no way he doesnt have access to shoes or at least socks in such a wealthy city.

             You cant expect people to take this article seriously with so many grammar errors and zero references to any outside sources or experts who support the ideas put forward. Although i guess you already said at the beginning that this is an article I came across months ago. We are not sure of the author. My fault for wasting my time in reading it.

               It is real, whether you believe it or not. I lived in Thailand and my missionary group actually took in and bought out an enslaved beggar whos arms and legs have been cut off. If you actually did your own research you would know this was true. It doesnt take a genius, only someone who is willing to question the extent of their cushioned life

               Your missing the point. Have you ever traveled outside of your own country? I doubt it, because if you had you would know this problem is real. Just like pornography fuels sex slavery, giving money to overseas beggars fuels human trafficking. I lived in Thailand and Cambodia and know this first hand. Like they stated in the article, you can help people just dont give them money. Giving money is gratification for the person giving it, but only fuels the slavery the person begging for it. Give them care packages and things they need. When you give them money your just giving it to the person enslaving the beggar

             I am from a third world country, Guatemala. Here at every stop light youll find yourself surrounded by beggars. I once met this person whos neighbor was a beggar, he earned around $100 a day, sometimes less but most of the time more than that. This beggar did not have any problem what so ever, he was young, and not too bad looking, he never went to school, but he uses a wheelchair and covers himself up in dirty clothes. WAY TO MAKE MONEY HUH? this is sad. I would suggest you only give money to those who you can clearly see they have a problem or anything. But do not give money to children, for they are being watched by gangs who will hit, rape or kill them if they do not get a certain amount of money. SO SAD! :'(

               I am from Guatemala and I, too, have experienced this. Our country has reached a point where we have stopped giving money to small children and elders due to the fact that we know that that money will end up in some gangs. Theres other ways to help, like giving out food and clothes instead of money.

             I believe we all are intelligent enough to assume when a beagger is a real one or not.  In top of that this article refers to those how are using children to get benneffit from it. I find really unpleasant when beaggers are acompain for children, dont matter if they asleep or awake, it is just not right.

                 I have to agree. You missed the point. Hostility is not a virtue any more than personal attacks. If grammar is more important to you then you have a social problem as well.

                   Don was not speaking of grammar, he was clearly speaking of word choice. I speak English as a first language and I often hear English speakers make generalizations, such as that Everyone does this, when really its a small percent. In this occasion, Don was saying that simply because someone does not speak English as a first language does NOT mean that they are foreign. YOU are foreign to them. I hope this makes sense.

                 This is an article I came across months ago. We are not sure of the author. However weve checked the authenticity of this with our followers in Bangkok and Cambodia. Chances are, the person who wrote this was in Bangkok or Cambodia, which dont have English as their main language.

                   yes, but that doesnt make them foreign. Theres a difference between foreigners and english not being your native language, thats what im trying to say.
                   <br/>
                   Calling someone foreign whos living in his/her own country where he/she was born and raised is a very, very weird thing to do.

                     obviously don is an american, you can usually tell by the self centered, self absorbed, arrogance in which anything not american is wrong and therefore not worthy of their attention.  They must therefore pick on anything that may not be up to their standard, which is funny since americans are some of the dumbest people in the world.  The point of the story is that in some countries, bad things happen and people write about them,  since the person that wrote this article is most likely foreign, because he/she most likely lives in a country other than that of the reader, is what makes this person foreign.  you, don, are foreign to most of the people that responded to your idiocy, because you live in a different country than those people that commented on your moronic post.  if you want to give the world a lesson about geography or language or even grammar for that matter, perhaps you, should take a second, and learn something about the topic you want to express to others, keeping in mind that in todays age, most people reading your post do not share your country of origin, or language or lack there of.

                     Your attack on a country as a whole because you do not agree with an individual proves that you are no better than he, sir.  I have met Americans who were very good people, and some who were not.  The same is so for the Irish, German, Italians, French, Brazilians, Japanese, Australians and people from all countries I have visited.  Disagree with an individuals behaviour without insulting an entire people.

                     I didnt really read your post because its way too long, but Im Dutch actually. And I even agree with the point King Aldo was trying to make, I just dont like the way he worded it. Especially his use of the word foreign

                     Your just bullsh*ting.go teach your grammar to someone else, not on the f*cking web. The point of this article is to understand the connotative meanings in it, not to f*cking judge on the grammar of the article OR the grammar of the people commenting on the article. Your just being a dick right NOW.

                     Wow, the amount of irony is incredibly hilarious. People whom have stated and claimed that Don has missed the point of this article have actually missed the point he was trying to make and mind you, he is correct. Yes people, you dont sound self-righteous, self-centered, idiotic when you judge Don for simply pointing out a better selection of a specific word in a comment. I pity your mindless bigotry. It is a shame.

                     alright, now I did.
                     <br/>
                     Let me explain real quick. Youre using the word foreign wrong, and it makes you sound a little silly.
                     <br/>
                     Foreign:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     1.  Located away from ones native country: on business in a foreign city.
                     <br/>
                     If the author lives in his or her own country, its weird to call the author foreign. Because theyre not in america.
                     <br/>
                     If you imply the author is a foreigner for not having English as a native language, its almost like youre trying to say everyone on the internet thats not English or American, is a foreigner by default.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Something I disagree with by the way, and you probably do too.

                     It shows how stupid you all are. Worried about grammar and he said she said!  The only problem I see is a baby being loaded up on drugs and being killed and nothing is being done. Who cares about the rest! Rest in peace sweet angles!

                     Really just because I am American I think I am better than you? I agree with the fact that foreign was the wrong word, however I am American and I find it completely illiterate that you would classify all Americans into one group like that!! Your lack of tact, and your idiocy shows with the 10 words you wrote! Racism at its finest right there!!

                     Woooowwowwow. If you are not a troll you are incredibly ignorant. Obviously Bill is an Ignoramus, you can usually tell by the self centered, self absorbed, arrogance in which anything not ignorant is wrong and therefore not worthy of their attention. They must therefore pick on anything that may not be up to their standard, which is funny since Ignoramus are some of the dumbest people in the world.

                     If you want to go after an individual fine, but please dont lump all Americans into the dumbest people in the world. Some of us are quite intelligent, well traveled and respectful of other cultures, languages and points of view.

                     bill, the funniest thing about your comment is that youre saying exactly what Don is trying to say. However, Don said it in a much nicer manner than you. The irony is that you have no idea what Don was saying and you took issue with it.

               Im speaking 4 languages, from which 2 fluent and the other 2 less fluent. All of that took me years of practicing and countless hours of studying. I get corrected and judged all the time because i dare to make mistakes.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you judge people because they are not fluent in their 2nd, 3rd or even 4th language, you fail to see that that person is taking the effort to communicate in YOUR own language, which you probably dont even control 100% yourself, if you would mind all the rules.
              </p>
              <p>
               And with effort i mean: studying and practicing for many years, because you are simply to lazy to learn Dutch, German or Russian.

                 I think a message is more important than grammar.  If someone doesnt have perfect grammar, I dont think they should just not show their message to the world.  No need to be hostile to someone with bad grammar skills.  All it represents is that the person wasnt properly educated on English grammar.  This doesnt give someone a reason to be mean.  Thats just a problem with how people interact on the internet-they lack humanity in their arguments and enjoy starting fights.

                   Correcting someone on grammar does not always coincide with being hostile towards them. Though, comments online on someones grammar use is mostly pointless, unless you are directly communicating with a specific person.

                   With grammar mistakes set aside, Im more concerned with the lack of sources, the assumptions and the obvious racist hints in this article. Id much rather call it a chronicle if anything. With the information provided it is impossible to determine how trustworthy the story is.
                   <br/>
                   The writer is clearly biased when it comes to the portaying of both beggars and people from Romania. Even if parts of this is true, I cannot avoid thinking its greatly exaggerated due to the way its presented.

             Common sense is really uncommon.. You already know the thought of this article and yet you still focus on grammar errors and lapses? Unbelievable human beings Lets be thankful that we do not need to beg just to eat and survive. For me, the thought of this article is to be more cautious when helping someone. Not all beggars are Professional  SHARE YOUR LOVE IT IS FREE

             It is sad story from my country but it is true. If some of those children are lucky enough to grow a little more like 5 years old they will be managed to do some works like cleaning car glasses and selling flowers at the traffic light,  when the cars are stopped by the traffic light, those children will approach to the drivers to sell some flowers (its your choice to buy or ignore them) some children approach to clean car glasses and sometimes the drivers dont even notice and never want them to do it but those children already did their job then the driver has to pay them with some money and if the driver refused to pay, they might harm the car, scratching for example. If those children are lucky enough to grow to be teenagers they will have early experience with sex and become a prostitute, robbers, drug dealers, and causing more problems to society, some of them got STD or get pregnant at very young age (if they are girls) and if they are lucky enough to give birth, their child will be used of a beggar child at this point a fool chain begins again. Unfortunately, there are many cities in our world have this kind of business and it runs by Evil. Not only in Bangkok but also in Cambodia, India, LA, London, Tokyo and other big cities  but the Evil, they just adjust  the business model to be more suitable with its location, depending on cultures and whatsoever that can made them get more money. It is terrible and beyond our control to stop this terrible things, its big issue of social problems. What we can do is to control our selves not to support Evil business, dont give money to a beggar, dont buy prostitute, dont do drugs, dont corrupt and dont work for Evil. Be a good person and do good things.

             P.S. I dont think the woman and a child in that picture have been taken picture in a metro station of Bangkok because these three following reasons 1. the background of the picture doesnt look like any building or construction of the Metro station which is very new and more modern than in the picture. 2.Every Metro station in Bangkok has guards and very secure, they do not allow a beggar nearby the station 3. Bangkok is too hot at Day time even in Winter, wearing dress like in the picture is unusual in Bangkok, most of Beggars or homeless people I have seen in Bangkok wear Summer appearance or shirtless. Good story anyway!

             I lay hands on them in power and glory and pray and God releases all the demons off them and sets them free, they are also healed of many things, i pray their sins are forgiven and the blood of Jesus washes them clean and gives them a new life (as Christ intended) . If they look to God they will stay free..but it is their choice.

             Be smart with your money. There are organizations that actually do help legit homeless people.
             <br/>
             In New York a beggar can make an average of 13$ an hour from just sitting near the subways. Thats way more than what I make and I work hard. Why give up sitting and doing nothing if they can make that decent amount of money per hour? If you do wish to be kind, offer them food. The truly homeless will accept it with gratitude. Until then keep your change and use it to donate to homeless shelters, etc.

             I appreciate the investigative nature of why the child was always sleeping, and the intention of wanting to find some answers. However, I agree that this woman probably had many reasons of her own to be in this situation  god knows what would happen to her if she had really told you the truth right there in the tube station  who can say whether her bosses were watching? Yelling and shouting at her in public will not help to find a solution to this situation, maybe she would have faced severe punishment by drawing so much attention to herself. I really urge that situations of this nature be handled with a thoroughly thought out plan, the right resources and support in place, to help this lady and others like her. This rash decision to expose her in public might have caused more harm to her and the child.

                   True. Same here. I saw a guy in line at Wendys who didnt have quite enough change for a meal. Another guy in life quickly bought the meal for him, size large. I would have bought too, but this guy just reacted faster with the wallet lol.

                   On the other hand, I was once outside among several food trucks deciding on lunch. A woman approached and asked if she could get some money for food. I said, which truck would you like to order from and Ill happily buy you a meal! She then said, no, i need the money to go buy food from another place. Then she started pointing at the underside of her forearm? I didnt understand that nor did I understand why you would ask for food in front of food trucks, but they not be good enough. Shes just workin the crowd.

                   Had yet another guy at a gas station ask for just a lil gas money to get to the next town. My husband gave him a few bucks. A week or so later, my husband was at the same station filling up again. The same man approached him with the same story. My husband said, you asked me this last week and I gave you money. How are you still trying to get to the next town by now? The mans face completely changed to a oh man, i got caught!, and he took off without a word.

             Im from Thailand, a place where beggars with their children can typically be seen on the roadside. I recently thought about the problem before I read this article and came up with the following conclusion, the emphasis of the question being constructed on how to help the children. The first method is to donate money to organizations that deal with the support for these children directly. Although this method is efficient in that people who are directly involved will know how to allocate our funding to proper use, there is always the ambiguity of how and to whom did the funding go to, furthermore some of our funding will be diverted into keeping the organization alive. The second method is to give the child food or clothing. This helps the child directly and prevents the organization in the background from receiving any benefits. The problem with these solutions are that none of them actually solve the problem. This means that we have find a way of putting an end to the organizations, which is almost impossible because most police receive bribes from these gangs, in which return the favor by giving them protection. So strictly speaking if we want to put an end to these gangs then we need a clean police force. With all respect I do speak of all police officers being corrupt, but I say out of personal judgement that the majority of police are corrupt. In conclusion, the methods described are but a temporary approach to the problem, and do not help solve the problem. Help given in the form of money is in fact supporting the culprits behind the whole scenario. I would be glad to hear of other opinions and hope that in some way I have made a clarification of the issue at hand.

             Everyone is correct and incorrect depending on where you are talking about (country/region) and which panhandler. Some do it because they have to, probably poverty stricken regions, possibly sold into that type of lifestyle. Here in Alaska (why anyone would choose Alaska to be homeless in is beyond me) there are plenty of panhandlers that beg because it pays. They even come out in frigid (30 and 40 below) more often than during milder temps because they make more when people feel worse about them standing out there.  My son once pointed out that the panhandler had better winter gear than we do, which he was correct about. One guy wouldnt even get off the crate he was sitting on to come around to my side of the car for the food gift card I was holding out to him. I couldnt reach the other side of the truck to roll down the window, but it was too much work to come get it (no he wasnt unable to walk ). Another two guys tried to sell the lunches that my coworker bought for them across the street from where he gave it to them. Here in Fairbanks we have plenty of avenues for help, soup kitchens, rescue mission (that requires sobriety to use), and many other helpful agencies, but that wont buy what they want.  In some cases, they arent really even homeless, they just make good (tax free) money doing it.  So, you are all right and wrong. You can only base your opinions on your own experiences, or like some you can believe everything you read.  But even if this was a story, never doubt that fact is often worse than fiction.

             Dear author, Im happy to help you with copywriting, if needed. I think your story makes a very good point, and unfortunately a lot of elitists miss that point because theyre stuck on your grammar. From my experience living abroad in many different countries, Ive seen the same thing. Yes, the children are on heroin, or other drugs. Definitely. Theyre unconscious for hours. This is not normal, and by giving anything to these beggars you are harming the child, and continuing the human trafficking trade.

             Intellectuals understand the point of the issue beyond mere grammar errors. English language is native for some &amp; foreign for others. One would claim his a native but other would see him as foreign. Its all about which point of view your standing at.

             I suggest that the govt would pass a bill for the welfare of this babies/children whom parents cannot provide their needs. If they have to beg why not the govt take this kids and find foster parents able to support and provide quality of life for this children. Put this women on livelihood projects where illegal syndicates wont be able to abuse them. Pass the bill not to allow street beggars, at least police personnel has something to do.

             Those arent Romanians, theyre rroma people.. You should have highlighted the rroma and not Romanian Citizen because youre painting a bad image of one of the most oppressed and cleansed races in the history of the world. Dacians deserve better reputations than were given.

             Stop judging each other about bulshit,  reading this article can get u in a emotional state that can influence  someones opinion and the things u say.  Coping mechanisms differ
             <br/>
             To the point though; I met a girl in india that had a experience with beggars. Two kids begged her to buy milk powder for them,  (needles to say that it is to difficult to say no to that) so they showed her where to buy it. She payed 20$ for it ( a fortune in india) and afterwards the kids exchanged the powder for money. What I want to say is that people that drug babies,  cut childrens hands off, blind them or do other evil things to make more money do exist,  I have seen the with my own eyes. So watch what u give because u r supporting the sick assholes that control this poor little kids.

             In Nice (France), there was a lady with a child sitting in front of our apartment the time we were staying there. We saw her several times a day. It was the first time i saw a normal acting child with a beggar. It was always playing with toys and lauthingand trying to run away. It was nice to see it. But sadly it was the first and last time till now.

             who cares about grammar. the person who posted an article that they dont know where it came from  is obviously not concerned with facts. there are manipulative people. but it is outrageous to put out a rhetorical piece trying to feed peoples fears around the situation of beggars. Is it not the last straw of what you would consider to do? Sit on the street and ask for money? NO ONE wants to sit on the street. No one WANTS to ask for what they dont have. Maybe if you have always had everything, you can not understand that.  If that person is that low in their life that they feel that this is the only way they can make a living, can you not show some compassion?

             Dear author of the article.
             <br/>
             Please, sell everything you have, put aside your fancy laptop, iphone and all the gadget, and buy the new home for that unhappy family and save the pure child.
             <br/>
             I am sick of you.
             <br/>
             I am sick of such blogging.
             <br/>
             Having it not been for our ultimate greed to have more of everything, such women would not be EVER pushed to do so horrible things to save their dear lives.
             <br/>
             I really wonder what would do you, dear author, if you would be in her place..perhaps you would invent tricks more elaborate in their horror.

             This fucking article tells you that theres literally women out there on the streets, using drugged babys to gain sympathy, yet ALL OF YOU FUCKING IDIOTS DO IS COMPLAIN ABOUT SOME DAMN GRAMMAR. NOT EVEN PEOPLE BORN WITH ENGLISH AS THEIR MOTHERTONGUE CAN PERFECTLY SPEAK, WRITE, READ OR EVEN FULLY COMPREHEND IT.

             Jai lu plusieurs fois cet article et ny ai trouv aucune faute de vocabulaire, de syntaxe ou de grammaire. Je suis parfaitement bilingue franais-anglais, je parle de faon correcte espagnol, italien et portugais, je me fais bien comprendre en allemand, en grec et en turc. Je ne comprend pas pourquoi les seules critiques sur cet article portent sur une orthographe hasardeuse. Le fonds de larticle est la dnonciation de pratiques maffieuses : utiliser des mendiantes et des enfants drogus, alcooliss, ou mme morts pour attirer des aumnes qui enrichissent les maffias de lex Europe de lEst.

             I read this topic several times and found no vocabulary, syntaxis or grammary fault. I am perfectly bilingual in french and english, rather fluent in spanish italian and portuguese, and can make my point in german, greek or turkish. I cant understand why the only critics on this topic are about some presumed hasardous orthographics. The basis of this topic is about bringing to light maffious practicies : using beggars and drugged, drunk or even dead babies to gather alms and enrich the ex-East Europa maffias.

             I read this article long time ago, it was in Russian  language, i really wanted to translate it and post for all my friends, but didnt want to get stupid comments about my English( its my 3rd language). Ppl, dont judge the person who translated, we need to think and talk about the big problems in our world ( human traffic, kidnapping, drugs,). Those beggars r everywhere in big cities and towns always in public places with poor babies and toddlers (who have no idea what is going on around them, and r forced to do it just for food and theirs lives), very often those kids were kidnapped. They dress boys like girls and girls like boys, so it will be harder to recognize kids. Just be more careful when u help someone like that on the street, your money dont go to them anyways!

             why is most everyone talking about the grammer? imma native newyorker and didnt even notice one grammer issue! =D

            <p>
             anyways, the point is DO NOT GIVE BEGGARS MONEY. their is a reason they keep asking for money everyday all day long, yet remain beggars. because either they are spending it on alcohol/drugs, or they are being pimped out to collect money for a scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             i know it is much easier to give money, but what a genuine beggar needs is just a bottle of water, a scoop of rice, some bread or fruit, clothes. anything but money!
            </p>
            <p>
             best help is to notify a local outreach/shelter of the location and description of the beggar. ask them their full name and age and town they were born in. if they dont want to share this info (which you then provide an outreach program with) then they are a scam. if they cannot relay this info, then they really need assistance asap, not money.
            </p>

             although that might be true in some few highly pathological cases please remember that not all beggars are careless scammers saving for alcohol libations using their children as tools for better income. on the picture we see a Rom woman, also remember that not all Roms are crooks. you cant look at certain cultures, nations, or even specific persons from a perspective of a rich, western point of view, especially not from a perspective of Denmark. i sometimes feel that these kind of articles do more harm then good. we are shown just a part of a whole picture and that makes us more suspicious and insensible for others needs. it also makes a good excuse for our conscience. if these things, like the one described in the article, happen and certain people abuse others and/or our system, remember that it is a problem of this very system and from this very system it sprouts.

             for a while there, but not latly,  seen a lady on the corner up the street from me with a sign saying she has kids and needs help she stands there all day, but yet where are her kids? if she can find someone to watch them all day why not get a job? begging is more profitable, no taxes too,  what she is doing is perfectly legal, but dont try to sell anything for money on the corner you will probably get arrested for trying to make a honest living. people just need to stop feeding the beast of exploiting peoples compassion and understanding so it will die.

             Thats it? The conclusion is think twice before handing money and let the business die on its own? Why isnt anyone taking action? This is a crime and should be punishable by law.

             This is so fucking racist and I dont trust the story to be true one bit. The beggar is being portrayed as totally unhuman, and then we are presented a friend with olive-eyes and romanian background, which is (of course) not honest and with no sympathy for the supposedly druged children. This story is constructed, racist shit!

               it is not like you can save the child once they are drugged,dumbassif drugs can kill adults(which happens with time),a child can be instantly killed

             This is ridiculous all the comments are about grammar and the word foreign, did you even read the article. I for one wont be handing out money to beggars (not that i do anyway) for a long time now i only ever give them sandwiches, hot drinks etc. That way i know what the money was spent on giving money nowadays is a really lazy form of charity!

             Hello,
            </p>
            <p>
             I wont single out sentences that are hard to believe for me. Trust me, they are a few and they seem to come out of nowhere in the article.
            </p>
            <p>
             First to come to mind : if a baby awakes every couple of hours he needs to be fed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Adults on hunger strike dont have much strengh left after a couple of weeks so its reasonable that for a baby, consequences would be almost immediate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thus instead of gathering evidences from friends and we know how it goes opinions, wondering if you might involve the Police, it should be most appropriate to think a moment, give a call to the local social services/Croix Rouge/etc. and get THEM to find out bout the babys health.and whether or not they are in shock. .

             I am completely and utterly horrified and saddened. it is disturbing that this kind of organized crime is so widespread through various countries and that it happens mostly at the hands of those, who are innocent  children, people who have ended as victims of organized crimes and also the locals and tourist that in good faith give money. It is terrifying that there are people in this world that have as little regard for human life as those behind organized crimes like this. I hope that this article is shared again and again and will help people realize that donating isnt necessarily the best way to help these people on the streets.

             Did you see this woman on the Penn Station subway next to 1/2/3 entrance?? Because I swear Ive seen this same scenario, and now that youve mentioned itthe baby really never has made a peep. Despite the crazy crowds, noises, smells etc etc

             Im going to start paying more attention. Also English is a bastardized language and you wrote your message in a perfectly understandable way. Fuck cares about grammar when this isnt some English Lit. magazine. (I have the ability to write pretty perfect English but for the life of me I cant see why I should when it only limits my ability to convey my message in a personalized way)

             In my early 20s I went on a surfing trip to Bali.  This is when I was first exposed to this whole new level of beggars.  I am a Canadian citizen and have been privileged enough to travel extensively in Asia, Mexico, and Canada.  I have seen all sorts of beggars, you have the drunks who sit almost unconscious barely soliciting donations, then there are the beggars with an act or gimmick like a funny sign a musical instrument a voice a gymnastic routine or something of that sort.  In Canada you have highly sophisticated beggars who identify tourists and try to offer directions or explain something to the tourist as they look around with that lost look on their face.  There are aggressive beggars that use fear to solicit your change and then there are kind heart ones that play on your emotions.  In San Francisco I remember hearing about a mother who had her child sit in a special wheel chair all day in Union Square pretending to be a paraplegic without health insurance.  In Bali I was shocked when I left the club at 3 or 4 am to see children no older that 7 or 8 trying to sell cheap little necklaces to the hordes of western tourists stumbling out of the discos that have notorious reputations for violence and of course bombings.  I heard all about the rental children while in Bali and I did even notice a woman with a different child from one day to the next in Kuta Beach.  I had never heard of the heroin addicted baby but nothing surprises me anymore.  While to us westerners with our illusions of safety and superiority this comes as a shock but who do we have to blame?  The economic inequity on the planet is because of our over consumption.  I am guilty as anyone, I fly upwards of a dozen times a year, I just bought a brand new 2014 Dodge Ram 1500, I am addicted to drugs, material things and fossil fuels.  While I find the idea of children being used as disposable props to generate revenue morally repugnant I know that humans will use whatever they have at their disposal to make life more bearable, to feed their addictions whether that be to drugs, fossil fuels, designer jeans or handbags or simply power.   Morals are not universal they are a product of the culture, times, and environment in which they exist.  I will give an example.  I lived in Mexico for over 3 years, and many ex-pats from Canada and the USA lived in the small town I called home.  People get appalled at the way the locals treat their animals and especial the Californian animal lovers get disgusted by the way parents give puppies and kitten to their children and the animals invariably end up on the street without a home and malnourished.  the reason is this, these people have nothing else to give their children, they cannot afford an XBOX or even a surf board or a lego set for their kids.  So when a puppy is found and it is taken away from its mother far too young and the small child is playing with it and the North American Scum (me and you) looks on in disgust at the Mexicans and how inhumane it is and how animal cruelty is occurring right before our eyes just remember that people always just do the best they can with what is available to them.  Before we judge people who are drugging infants and begging for money maybe we should look at ourselves and what our part is in the bigger picture because as I sit here typing on my Apple MacBook Pro in my designer jeans getting ready to go to sleep so I can get on an airplane tomorrow and fly 3500km in a few hours I know that I am just as guilty as anyone else for the way the world is today.

             I am brazilian, and lately Ive seeing less and less begars in the streets. Why? Many reasons. A lot of government aid but mostly because we dont care anymore. Its sad, and maybe will sound a little bit cruel but its true. Once we get used to beggars and you see them every single day it becomes a part of the landscape. So, brazilians in general will not give money to beggars. In the other hand they figured out that is better to get money using violence.
             <br/>
             I believe that in areas like Thailand these things still occurs because there a lot of tourists and are they who still sustain this market. I dont believe that the majority of the people giving the money are natives, once they already know what its happening. Thats why I think this article is important, because most tourists living in first world countries are not used to poverty around them all the time and their first and natural thought is to help.

             Many years ago I was coming back from a fruit market with my father and 3 kids approached us. They should have 6,7 years old, and they asked for some money because they were very hungry and didnt have anything to eat. My father gave to them a bag full of fruits, and they got very upset. They cursed us, and left. I think this example showcases the whole picture.

               Hi Fernanda,
               <br/>
               I think you are right about tourists feeling like they are helping.  This happens a lot in the US, too.  In my hometown my father would offer to buy the homeless people food and they would refuse, they only wanted money (probably for drugs or alcohol).  It is very sad.  I actually live in Rio de Janeiro right now and havent seen very many beggars in my neighborhood.  One time a man in the grocery store asked if I could buy his bread and turkey slices for him.  I bought it for him and felt good knowing that I didnt just hand him 10 reais to go toward something illegal.

             This is horrible. Instead of arguing over the internet you guys should do something to prevent this. This is far worst than child abuse.

             I understood the message behind the article Im Portuguese but live in the UKI have studied some interpreting and translation and know how difficult it can be The admirable thing is you have continued to learn and you did not let your difficulties get in the way of writing an article. Well done for trying and for carrying on learning several other languages. The world needs more hardworking people like you and less of the finger pointing judgemental ones in the comments below. Thanks!

             this is so, so sad. We lived abroad and saw so many of these precious sleeping children, filthy and in the arms of distraught seeming parents. My heart aches at the thought of how my ignorance failed them

             you that are discussing about the grammar or the words used you all need to get laid. this article was about finishing a bad business, that is giving drugs and alcohol to kids, sometimes kids that are abducted. You guys are worried about the grammar in the text. really?! Anyone cached the real message in here? stop arguing about stupid differences and open your eyes.This happens everywhere in all countries.

             I do believe they do it with the dogs, too. Sometimes you see beggars with dogs and the dogs are always asleep, positioned perfectly. I heard they drug up the animals as well.

             Ive never seen those mothers with sleeping children in their hands in my country, but there are many children who beg for money. One time, a beggar child approached me so I gave him my food but he refused to accept the food. He even stated he doesnt need food but money.
             <br/>
             There was also a man pretending to have broken leg and begging for money. My coworker gave him money. When the beggar thought no one can see him anymore, he walked without any problems.

             The writers ESL is better then my French or Spanish.  To critique politely a writers grammar or spelling is one thing.  It is important to remember how difficult it is to write or speak in a second language.   One of the most important things I learned in French and Spanish classes was how to be patient with those who are ESL.

             I have no doubt that these children are drugged and that the beggar is under someones control. Most outstanding in my experience was a woman and sleeping child on the church steps at the Trevi Fountain in Italy where there was a crowd of hundreds and the noise to go with it.

             I have seen this happening on the streets of NYC, yep this stuff is highly organized as they drop people dropping off in vans in some neighborhoods just to beg for money one look at the mother I could tell something was up. Something about these people are just broken, I think they stop caring a long time ago and are some how they are trapped in a life in which they are helpless to leave. But I never came to tuition the people involve would do this to infants, its a cycle that will never stop because those kids will grow up probably doing the same thing (its brain washing a child from birth to beg). I think the people who are begging on the streets lack their own volition (I can see it in there eyes) and some of them are being forced into a lifestyle not there own, probably by drugs or some method of force involve. I can almost imagine some of these mothers infants  are being held hostage.

             See if you would all put as much effort into helping to do something about this as you do about correcting each other on grammar, whether being American is a race or not, whether calling someone foreign is wierd or not  or just generally missing the point  maybe, JUST MAYBE something might change. Something might be done. One child might be saved. Get a grip and go and do something worthwhile.
