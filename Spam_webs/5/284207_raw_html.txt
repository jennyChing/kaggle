   This is the article which had been scheduled to appear in the
  Washington Post. After having cleared the legal department for all possible
  questions of inaccurate statements, the article was scheduled for 
  publication when just as the presses were set to roll, Washington Post Managing
  Editor Bob Kaiser (Like George Bush, a member of the infamous "Skull
  &amp; Bones" Fraternity), killed the article without explanation. According
  to the sidebar which appeared with the Penthouse Magazine version
  of this story, Bob Kaiser refused to even meet with Sally Denton and 
  Roger Morris, hiding in his office while his secretary made excuses.

   THE CRIMES OF MENA
  </h1>
  <h3>
   By Sally Denton and Roger Morris
  </h3>
  <hr/>
  Barry Seal - gunrunner, drug trafficker, and covert C.I.A. operative 
extraordinaire - is hardly a familiar name in American politics. But nine 
years after he was murdered in a hail of bullets by Medellin cartel hit 
men outside a Salvation Army shelter in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he has 
come back to haunt the reputations of three American presidents.
  <p>
   Seal's legacy includes more than 2,000 newly discovered documents that 
  now verify and quantify much of what previously had been only suspicion, 
  conjecture, and legend. The documents confirm that from 1981 to his 
  brutal death in 1986, Barry Seal carried on one of the most lucrative, 
  extensive, and brazen operations in the history of the international drug 
  trade, and that he did it with the evident complicity, if not collusion, 
  of elements of the United States government, apparently with the 
  acquiescence of Ronald Reagan's administration, impunity from any 
  subsequent exposure by George Bush's administration, and under the 
  usually acute political nose of then Arkansas governor Bill Clinton.
  </p>
  <p>
   The newly unearthed papers show the real Seal as far more impressive and
  well-connected than the character played by Dennis Hopper in a 
  made-for-TV movie some years ago, loosely based on the smuggler's life. 
  The film portrayed the pudgy pilot as a hapless victim, caught in a cross 
  fire between bungling but benign government agencies and Latin drug 
  lords. The truth sprinkled through the documents is a richer - and 
  altogether more sinister - matter of national and individual corruption. 
  It is a tale of massive, socially devastating crime, of what seems to have
  been an official cover-up to match, and, not least, of the strange 
  reluctance of so-called mainstream American journalism to come to grips with
  the phenomenon and its ominous implications - even when the documentary 
  evidence had appeared.
  </p>
  <p>
   The trail winds back to another slightly bruited but obscure name - a small
  place in western Arkansas called Mena.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of the many stories emerging from the Arkansas of the 1980s that was crucible
  to the Clinton presidency, none has been more elusive than the charges
  surrounding Mena. Nestled in the dense pine and hardwood forests of the
  Oachita Mountains, some 160 miles west of Little Rock, once thought a
  refuge for nineteenth-century border outlaws and even a hotbed of
  Depression-era anarchists, the tiny town has been the locale for persistent
  reports of drug smuggling, gunrunning, and money laundering tracing to the
  early eighties, when Seal based his aircraft at Mena's Intermountain Regional
  Airport.
  </p>
  <p>
   From first accounts circulating locally in Arkansas, the story surfaced 
  nationally as early as 1989 in a *Penthouse* article called "Snowbound," 
  written by the investigative reporter John Cummings, and in a Jack 
  Anderson column, but was never advanced at the time by other media. Few 
  reporters covering Clinton in the 1992 campaign missed hearing at least 
  something about Mena. But it was obviously a serious and demanding 
  subject - the specter of vast drug smuggling with C.l.A. involvement - 
  and none of the major media pursued it seriously During 1992, the story 
  was kept alive by Sarah McClendon, *The Nation*, and *The Village Voice*.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, after Clinton became president, Mena began to reappear. Over the past
  year, CBS News and *The Wall Street Journal* have reported the original,
  unquieted charges surrounding Mena, including the shadow of some C.l.A. (or
  "national security") involvement in the gun and drug traffic, and the 
  apparent failure of then governor Clinton to pursue evidence of such 
  international crime so close to home.
  </p>
  <p>
   "Seal was smuggling drugs and kept his planes at Mena," *The Wall Street 
  Journal* reported in 1994. "He also acted as an agent for the D.E.A. In 
  one of these missions, he flew the plane that produced photographs of 
  Sandinistas loading drugs in Nicaragua. He was killed by a drug gang 
  [Medellin cartel hit men] in Baton Rouge. The cargo plane he flew was the 
  same one later flown by Eugene Hasenfus when he was shot down over 
  Nicaragua with a load of contra supplies.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a mix of wild rumor and random fact, Mena has also been a topic of 
  ubiquitous anti-Clinton diatribes circulated by right-wing extremists - 
  an irony in that the Mena operation was the apparent brainchild of the two 
  previous and Republican administrations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Still, most of the larger American media have continued to ignore, if not
  ridicule, the Mena accusations. Finding no conspiracy in the Oachitas 
  last July, a *Washington Post* reporter typically scoffed at the "alleged 
  dark deeds," contrasting Mena with an image as "Clandestination, Arkansas 
  ... Cloak and Dagger Capital of America." Noting that *The New York Times*
  had "mentioned Mena primarily as the headquarters of the American Rock Garden 
  Society," the *Columbia Journalism Review* in a recent issue dismissed 
  "the conspiracy theories" as of "dubious relevance."
  </p>
  <p>
   A former Little Rock businessman, Terry Reed, has coauthored with John
  Cummings a highly controversial book, Compromised: Clinton, Bush, and the
  C.lA., which describes a number of covert activities around Mena, including
  a C.l.A. operation to train pilots and troops for the Nicaraguan Contras, and
  the collusion of local officials. Both the book and its authors were 
  greeted with derision.
  </p>
  <p>
   Now, however, a new mass of documentary evidence has come to light 
  regarding just such "dark deeds" - previously private and secret records 
  that substantiate as never before some of the worst and most portentous 
  suspicions about what went on at Mena, Arkansas, a decade ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given the scope and implications of the Mena story, it may be easy to 
  understand the media's initial skepticism and reluctance. But it was 
  never so easy to dismiss the testimony arid suspicions of some of those
  close to the matter: Internal Revenue Service Agent Bill Duncan, Arkansas
  State Police investigator Russell Welch, Arkansas Attorney General J. 
  Winston Bryant, Congressman Bill Alexander, and various other local
  law-enforcement officials and citizens.
  </p>
  <p>
   All of these people were convinced by the late eighties that there existed
  what Bryant termed "credible evidence" of the most serious criminal activity
  involving Mena between 1981 and 1986. They also believed that the crimes 
  were committed with the acquiescence, if not the complicity, of elements 
  of the U.S. government. But they couldn't seem to get the national media 
  to pay attention.
  </p>
  <p>
   During the 1992 campaign, outside advisers and aides urged former California
  governor Jerry Brown to raise the Mena issue against Clinton - at least
  to ask why the Arkansas governor had not done more about such serious 
  international crime so close to home. But Brown, too, backed away from 
  the subject. I'll raise it if the major media break it first," he told 
  aides. "The media will do it, Governor," one of them replied in 
  frustration, "if only you'll raise it."
  </p>
  <p>
   Mena's obscure airport was thought by the l.R.S., the F.B.I., U.S. Customs,
  and the Arkansas State Police to be a base for Adler Berriman "Barry" 
  Seal, a self-confessed, convicted smuggler whose operations had been 
  linked to the intelligence community. Duncan and Welch both spent years 
  building cases against Seal and others for drug smuggling and money laundering 
  around Mena, only to see their own law-enforcement careers damaged in the 
  process.
  </p>
  <p>
   What evidence they gathered, they have said in testimony and other public
  statements, was not sufficiently pursued by the then U.S. attorney for 
  the region, J. Michael Fitzhugh, or by the l.R.S., Arkansas State Police, 
  and other agencies. Duncan, testifying before the joint investigation by 
  the Arkansas state attorney general's office and the United States 
  Congress in June 1991, said that 29 federal indictments drafted in a 
  Mena-based money-laundering scheme had gone unexplored. Fitzhugh, 
  responding at the time to Duncan's charges, said, "This office has not slowed
  up any investigation ... [and] has never been under any pressure in any
  investigation."
  </p>
  <p>
   By 1992, to Duncan's and Welch's mounting dismay, several other official
  inquiries into the alleged Mena connection were similarly ineffectual or 
  were stifled altogether, furthering their suspicions of government 
  collusion and cover-up. In his testimony before Congress, Duncan said the 
  l.R.S. "withdrew support for the operations" and further directed him to 
  "withhold information from Congress and perjure myself."
  </p>
  <p>
   Duncan later testified that he had never before experienced "anything
  remotely akin to this type of interference.... Alarms were going off," he 
  continued, "and as soon as Mr. Fitzhugh got involved, he was more 
  aggressive in not allowing the subpoenas and in interfering in the 
  investigative process."
  </p>
  <p>
   State policeman Russell Welch felt he was "probably the most knowledgeable
  person" regarding the activities at Mena, yet he was not initially 
  subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Welch testified later that 
  the only reason he was ultimately subpoenaed at all was because one of 
  the grand jurors was from Mena and "told the others that if they wanted 
  to know something about the Mena airport, they ought to ask that guy 
  [Welch] out there in the hall."
  </p>
  <p>
   State Attorney General Bryant, in a 1991 letter to the office of Lawrence
  Walsh, the independent counsel in the Iran-Contra investigation, wondered 
  "why no one was prosecuted in Arkansas despite a mountain of evidence 
  that Seal was using Arkansas as his principle staging area during the 
  years 1982 through 1985."
  </p>
  <p>
   What actually went on in the woods of western Arkansas? The question is still
  relevant for what it may reveal about certain government operations during
  the time that Reagan and Bush were in the White House and Clinton was 
  governor of Arkansas.
  </p>
  <p>
   In a mass of startling new documentation - the more than 2,000 papers 
  gathered by the authors from private and law-enforcement sources in a 
  year-long nationwide search - answers are found and serious questions are 
  posed.
  </p>
  <p>
   These newly unearthed documents - the veritable private papers of Barry
  Seal - substantiate at least part of what went on at Mena.
  </p>
  <p>
   What might be called the Seal archive dates back to 1981, when Seal began his
  operations at the Intermountain Regional Airport in Mena. The archive, 
  all of it now in our possession, continues beyond February 1986, when 
  Seal was murdered by Colombian assassins after he had testified in 
  federal court in Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami for the U.S. 
  government against leaders of the Medellin drug cartel.
  </p>
  <p>
   The papers include such seemingly innocuous material as Seal's bank and
  telephone records; negotiable instruments, promissory notes, and invoices;
  personal correspondence address and appointment books; bills of sale for 
  aircraft and boats; aircraft registration, and modification work orders.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the archive also contains personal diaries; handwritten 
  to-do lists and other private notes; secretly tape-recorded 
  conversations; and cryptographic keys and legends for codes used in the 
  Seal operation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, there are extensive official records: federal investigative and 
  surveillance reports, accounting assessments by the l.R.S. and the 
  D.E.A., and court proceedings not previously reported in the 
  press - testimony as well as confidential pre-sentencing memoranda in 
  federal narcotics-trafficking trials in Florida and Nevada - numerous 
  depositions, and other sworn statements.
  </p>
  <p>
   The archive paints a vivid portrait not only of a major criminal conspiracy
  around Mena, but also of the unmistakable shadow of government complicity.
  Among the new revelations:
  </p>
  <p>
   Mena, from 1981 to 1985, was indeed one of the centers for international
  smuggling traffic. According to official l.R.S. and D.E.A. calculations, 
  sworn court testimony, and other corroborative records, the traffic 
  amounted to thousands of kilos of cocaine and heroin and literally hundreds of 
  millions of dollars in drug profits. According to a 1986 letter from the 
  Louisiana attorney general to then U.S. attorney general Edwin Meese, 
  Seal "smuggled between $3 billion and $5 billion of drugs into the U.S."
  </p>
  <p>
   Seal himself spent considerable sums to land, base, maintain, and specially
  equip or refit his aircraft for smuggling. According to personal and business
  records, he had extensive associations at Mena and in Little Rock, and 
  was in nearly constant telephone contact with Mena when he was not there 
  himself. Phone records indicate Seal made repeated calls to Mena the day 
  before his murder. This was long after Seal, according to his own 
  testimony, was working as an $800,000-a-year informant for the federal 
  government.
  </p>
  <p>
   A former member of the Army Special Forces, Seal had ties to the Central
  Intelligence Agency dating to the early 1970s. He had confided to 
  relatives and others, according to their sworn statements, that he was a 
  C.l.A. operative before and during the period when he established his 
  operations at Mena. In one statement to Louisiana State Police, a Seal 
  relative said, "Barry was into gunrunning and drug smuggling in Central 
  and South America ... and he had done some time in El Salvadore [sic]." 
  Another then added, "lt was true, but at the time Barry was working for 
  the C.l.A."
  </p>
  <p>
   In a posthumous jeopardy-assessment case against Seal - also documented 
  in the archive - the l.R.S. determined that money earned by Seal between 
  1984 and 1986 was not illegal because of his "C.l.A.-D.E.A. employment." 
  The only public official acknowledgment of Seal's relationship to the 
  C.l.A. has been in court and congressional testimony, and in various 
  published accounts describing the C.l.A.'s installation of cameras in 
  Seal's C-123K transport plane, used in a highly celebrated 1984 sting 
  operation against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
  </p>
  <p>
   Robert Joura, the assistant special agent in charge of the D.E.A.'s Houston
  office and the agent who coordinated Seal's undercover work, told *The 
  Washington Post* last year that Seal was enlisted by the C.l.A. for one 
  sensitive mission - providing photographic evidence that the Sandinistas 
  were letting cocaine from Colombia move through Nicaragua. A spokesman 
  for then Senate candidate Oliver North told *The Post* that North had 
  been kept aware of Seal's work through "intelligence sources."
  </p>
  <p>
   Federal Aviation Administration registration records contained in the archive
  confirm that aircraft identified by federal and state narcotics agents as 
  in the Seal smuggling operation were previously owned by Air America, 
  Inc., widely reported to have been a C.l.A. proprietary company. Emile 
  Camp, one of Seal's pilots and a witness to some of his most significant 
  dealings, was killed on a mountainside near Mena in 1985 in the 
  unexplained crash of one of those planes that had once belonged to Air 
  America.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to still other Seal records, at least some of the aircraft in 
  his smuggling fleet, which included a Lear jet, helicopters, and former 
  U.S. military transports, were also outfitted with avionics and other 
  equipment by yet another company in turn linked to Air America.
  </p>
  <p>
   Among the aircraft flown in and out of Mena was Seal's C-123K cargo plane,
  christened Fat Lady. The records show that Fat Lady, serial number 54-0679,
  was sold by Seal months before his death. According to other files, the
  plane soon found its way to a phantom company of what became known in the
  Iran-Contra scandal as "the Enterprise," the C.l.A.-related secret entity 
  managed by Oliver North and others to smuggle illegal weapons to the 
  Nicaraguan Contra rebels. According to former D.E.A. agent Celerino 
  Castillo and others, the aircraft was allegedly involved in a return 
  traffic in cocaine, profits from which were then used to finance more 
  clandestine gunrunning.
  </p>
  <p>
   F.A.A. records show that in October 1986, the same Fat Lady was shot down
  over Nicaragua with a load of arms destined for the Contras. Documents found
  on board the aircraft and seized by the Sandinistas included logs linking the
  plane with Area 51 - the nation's top-secret nuclear-weapons facility at the
  Nevada Test Site. The doomed aircraft was co-piloted by Wallace Blaine 
  "Buzz" Sawyer, a native of western Arkansas, who died in the crash. The 
  admissions of the surviving crew member, Eugene Hasenfus, began a public 
  unraveling of the Iran-Contra episode.
  </p>
  <p>
   An Arkansas gun manufacturer testified in 1993 in federal court in 
  Fayetteville that the C.l.A. contracted with him to build 250 automatic 
  pistols for the Mena operation. William Holmes testified that he had been 
  introduced to Seal in Mena by a C.l.A. operative, and that he then sold 
  weapons to Seal. Even though he was given a Department of Defense 
  purchase order for guns fitted with silencers, Holmes testified that he 
  was never paid the $140,000 the government owed him. "After the Hasenfus 
  plane was shot down," Holmes said, "you couldn't find a soul around Mena."
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, there was still more evidence that Seal's massive smuggling
  operation based in Arkansas had been part of a C.l.A. operation, and that the
  crimes were continuing well after Seal's murder. In 1991 sworn testimony 
  to both Congressman Alexander and Attorney General Bryant, state police 
  investigator Welch recorded that in 1987 he had documented "new activity 
  at the [Mena] airport with the appearance of ... an Australian business 
  [a company linked with the C.l.A.], and C-130s had appeared...."
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time, according to Welch, two F.B.I. agents officially 
  informed him that the C.l.A. "had something going on at the Mena Airport 
  involving Southern Air Transport [another company linked with the 
  C.l.A.] ... and they didn't want us [the Arkansas State Police] to screw 
  it up like we had the last one."
  </p>
  <p>
   The hundreds of millions in profits generated by the Seal trafficking via 
  Mena and other outposts resulted in extraordinary banking and business 
  practices in apparent efforts to launder or disperse the vast amounts of 
  illicit money in Arkansas and elsewhere. Seal's financial records show 
  from the early eighties, for example, instances of daily deposits of 
  $50,000 or more, and extensive use of an offshore foreign bank in the 
  Caribbean, as well as financial institutions in Arkansas and Florida.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to l.R.S. criminal investigator Duncan, secretaries at the Mena
  Airport told him that when Seal flew into Mena, I'there would be stacks 
  of cash to be taken to the bank and laundered." One secretary told him 
  that she was ordered to obtain numerous cashier's checks, each in an 
  amount just under $10,000, at various banks in Mena and surrounding 
  communities, to avoid filing the federal Currency Transaction Reports 
  required for all bank transactions that exceed that limit.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bank tellers testified before a federal grand jury that in November 1982, a
  Mena airport employee carried a suitcase containing more than $70,000 
  into a bank. "The bank officer went down the teller lines handing out the 
  stacks of $1,000 bills and got the cashier's checks."
  </p>
  <p>
   Law-enforcement sources confirmed that hundreds of thousands of dollars
  were laundered from 1981 to 1983 just in a few small banks near Mena, and
  that millions more from Seal's operation were laundered elsewhere in Arkansas
  and the nation.
  </p>
  <p>
   Spanish-language documents in Seal's possession at the time of his murder 
  also indicate that he had accounts throughout Central America and was 
  planning to set up his own bank in the Caribbean.
  </p>
  <p>
   Additionally, Seal's files suggest a grandiose scheme for building an
  empire. Papers in his office at the time of his death include references to
  dozens of companiesQall of which had names that began with Royale. Among
  them: Royale Sports, Royale Television Network, Royale Liquors, Royale
  Casino, S.A., Royale Pharmaceuticals, Royale Arabians, Royale Seafood,
  Royale Security, Royale Resorts ... and on and on.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seal was scarcely alone in his extensive smuggling operation based in 
  Mena from 1981 to 1986, commonly described in both federal and state 
  law-enforcement files as one of the largest drug-trafficking operations 
  in the United States at the time, if not in the history of the drug 
  trade. Documents show Seal confiding on one occasion that he was "only 
  the transport," pointing to an extensive network of narcotics 
  distribution and finance in Arkansas and other states. After drugs were 
  smuggled across the border, the duffel bags of cocaine would be retrieved 
  by helicopters and dropped onto flatbed trucks destined for various 
  American cities.
  </p>
  <p>
   In recognition of Seal's significance in the drug trade, government 
  prosecutors made him their chief witness in various cases, including a 
  1985 Miami trial in absentia of Medellln drug lords; in another 1985 
  trial of what federal officials regarded as the largest narcotics-trafficking
  case to date in Las Vegas; and in still a third prosecution of corrupt 
  officials in the Turks and Caicos Islands. At the same time, court records
  and other documents reveal a studied indifference by government 
  prosecutors to Seal's earlier and ongoing operations at Mena.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the end, the Seal documents are vindication for dedicated officials in
  Arkansas like agents Duncan and Welch and local citizens' groups like the 
  Arkansas Committee, whose own evidence and charges take on new gravity - 
  and also for *The Nation*, *The Village Voice*, the Association of 
  National Security Alumni, the venerable Washington journalists Sarah 
  McClendon and Jack Anderson, Arkansas. reporters Rodney Bowers and Mara 
  Leveritt, and others who kept an all-too-authentic story alive amid wider 
  indifference.
  </p>
  <p>
   But now the larger implications of the newly exposed evidence seem as 
  disturbing as the criminal enormity it silhouettes. Like his modern 
  freebooter's life, Seal's documents leave the political and legal 
  landscape littered with stark questions.
  </p>
  <p>
   What, for example, happened to some nine different official 
  investigations into Mena after 1987, from allegedly compromised federal 
  grand juries to congressional inquiries suppressed by the National 
  Security Council in 1988 under Ronald Reagan to still later Justice 
  Department inaction under George Bush?
  </p>
  <p>
   Officials repeatedly invoked national security to quash most of the 
  investigations. Court documents do show clearly that the C.l.A. and the 
  D.E.A. employed Seal during 1984 and 1985 for the Reagan administration's 
  celebrated sting attempt to implicate the Nicaraguan Sandinista regime in 
  cocaine trafficking.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to a December 1988 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report, 
  "cases were dropped. The apparent reason was that the prosecution might 
  have revealed national-security information, even though all of the 
  crimes which were the focus of the investigation occurred before Seal 
  became a federal informant."
  </p>
  <p>
   Tax records show that, having assessed Seal posthumously for some $86 
  million in back taxes on his earnings from Mena and elsewhere between 
  1981 and 1983, even the l.R.S. forgave the taxes on hundreds of millions in
  known drug and gun profits over the ensuing two-year period when Seal was
  officially admitted to be employed by the government.
  </p>
  <p>
   To follow the l.R.S. Iogic, what of the years, crimes, and profits at 
  Mena in the early eighties, before Barry Seal became an acknowledged 
  federal operative, as well as the subsequently reported drug-trafficking 
  activities at Mena even after his murder - crimes far removed from his 
  admitted cooperation as government informant and witness?
  </p>
  <p>
   "Joe [name deleted] works for Seal and cannot be touched because Seal
  works for the C.l.A.," a Customs official said in an Arkansas 
  investigation into drug trafficking during the early eighties. "A C.l.A. 
  or D.E.A. operation is taking place at the Mena airport," an F.B.I. telex
  advised the Arkansas State Police in August 1987, 18 months after Seal's
  murder. Welch later testified that a Customs agent told him, "Look, we've been 
  told not to touch anything that has Barry Seal's name on it, just to let 
  it go."
  </p>
  <p>
   *The London Sunday Telegraph* recently reported new evidence, including a 
  secret code number, that Seal was also working as an operative of the 
  Defense Intelligence Agency during the period of the gunrunning and drug
  smuggling.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps most telling is what is so visibly missing from the voluminous files.
  In thousands of pages reflecting a man of meticulous organization and plan-
  ning, Barry Seal seems to have felt singularly and utterly secure - if not
  somehow invulnerable - at least in the ceaseless air transport and delivery
  into the United States of tons of cocaine for more than five years. In a 
  1986 letter to the D.E.A., the commander and deputy commander of 
  narcotics for the Louisiana State Police say that Seal "was being given 
  apparent free rein to import drugs in conjunction with D.E.A. 
  investigations with so little restraint and control on his actions as to 
  allow him the opportunity to import drugs for himself should he have been 
  so disposed."
  </p>
  <p>
   Seal's personal videotapes, in the authors' possession, show one scene in
  which he used U.S. Army paratroop equipment, as well as militarylike 
  precision, in his drug-transporting operation. Then, in the middle of the 
  afternoon after a number of dry runs, one of his airplanes dropped a load 
  of several duffel bags attached to a parachute. Within seconds, the cargo 
  sitting on the remote grass landing strip was retrieved by Seal and 
  loaded onto a helicopter that had followed the low-flying aircraft. 
  "This is the first daylight cocaine drop in the history of the state of 
  Louisiana," Seal narrates on the tape. If the duffel bags seen in the 
  smuggler's home movies were filled with cocaine - as Seal himself states 
  on tape - that single load would have been worth hundreds of millions of 
  dollars.
  </p>
  <p>
   Perhaps the videos were not of an actual cocaine drop, but merely the 
  drug trafficker's training video for his smuggling organization, or even 
  a test maneuver. Regardless, the films show a remarkable, fearless 
  invincibility. Barry Seal was not expecting apprehension.
  </p>
  <p>
   His most personal papers show him all but unconcerned about the very
  flights and drops that would indeed have been protected or "fixed," 
  according to law-enforcement sources, by the collusion of U.S. intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
   In an interview with agent Duncan, Seal brazenly "admitted that he had 
  been a drug smuggler."
  </p>
  <p>
   If the Seal documents show anything, an attentive reader might conclude, 
  it is that ominous implication of some official sanction. Over the entire 
  episode looms the unmistakable shape of government collaboration in vast 
  drug trafficking and gunrunning, and in a decade-long cover-up of 
  criminality.
  </p>
  <p>
   Government investigators apparently had no doubt about the magnitude of 
  those crimes. According to Customs sources, Seal's operations at Mena and 
  other bases were involved in the export of guns to Bolivia, Argentina, 
  Peru, and Brazil, as well as to the Contras, and the importation of 
  cocaine from Colombia to be sold in New York, Chicago, Detroit, St. 
  Louis, and other cities, as well as in Arkansas itself.
  </p>
  <p>
   Duncan and his colleagues knew that Seal's modus operandi included 
  dumping most of the drugs in other southern states, so that what Arkansas 
  agents witnessed in Mena was but a tiny fragment of an operation 
  staggering in its magnitude. Yet none of the putative inquiries seems to 
  have made a serious effort to gather even a fraction of the available 
  Seal documents now assembled and studied by the authors.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, of course, there are somber questions about then governor Clinton's
  own role vis-a-vis the crimes of Mena.
  </p>
  <p>
   Clinton has acknowledged learning officially about Mena only in April 1988,
  though a state police investigation had been in progress for several 
  years. As the state's chief executive, Clinton often claimed to be fully 
  abreast of such inquiries. In his one public statement on the matter as 
  governor, in September 1991 he spoke of that investigation finding 
  "linkages to the federal government," and "all kinds of questions about 
  whether he [Seal] had any links to the C.l.A.... and if that backed into 
  the Iran-Contra deal."
  </p>
  <p>
   But then Clinton did not offer further support for any inquiry, "despite the
  fact," as Bill Plante and Michael Singer of CBS News have written, "that a
  Republican administration was apparently sponsoring a Contra-aid operation
  in his state and protecting a smuggling ring that flew tons of cocaine 
  through Arkansas."
  </p>
  <p>
   As recently as March 1995, Arkansas state trooper Larry Patterson testified
  under oath, according to *The London Sunday Telegraph*, that he and other
  officers "discussed repeatedly in Clinton's presence" the "large quantities
  of drugs being flown into the Mena airport, large quantities of money, large
  quantities of guns," indicating that Clinton may have known much more
  about Seal's activities than he has admitted.
  </p>
  <p>
   Moreover, what of the hundreds of millions generated by Seal's Mena 
  contraband? The Seal records reveal his dealings with at least one major 
  Little Rock bank. How much drug money from him or his associates made its 
  way into criminal laundering in Arkansas's notoriously freewheeling 
  financial institutions and bond houses, some of which are reportedly 
  under investigation by the Whitewater special prosecutor for just such 
  large, unaccountable infusions of cash and unexplained transactions?
  </p>
  <p>
   "The state offers an enticing climate for traffickers," I.R.S. agents had 
  concluded by the end of the eighties, documenting a "major increase" in the
  amount of large cash and bank transactions in Arkansas after 1985, 
  despite a struggling local economy.
  </p>
  <p>
   Meanwhile, prominent backers of Clinton's over the same years - including 
  bond broker and convicted drug dealer Dan Lasater and chicken tycoon Don 
  Tyson - have themselves been subjects of extensive investigative and 
  surveillance files by the D.E.A. or the F.B.I. similar to those relating 
  to Seal, including allegations of illegal drug activity that Tyson has 
  recently acknowledged publicly and denounced as "totally false." "This 
  may be the first president in history with such close buddies who have 
  NADDIS numbers," says one concerned law-enforcement official, referring 
  to the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Intelligence System numbers assigned 
  those under protracted investigation for possible drug crimes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Seal documents are still more proof that for Clinton, the Arkansas of
  the eighties and the company he kept there will not soon disappear as a 
  political or even constitutional liability.
  </p>
  <p>
   "I've always felt we never got the whole story there," Clinton said in 1991.
  </p>
  <p>
   Indeed. But as president of the United States, he need no longer wonder - 
  and neither should the nation. On the basis of the Seal documents (copies 
  of which are being given to the Whitewater special prosecutor in any 
  case), the president should ask immediately for a full report on the 
  matter from the C.l.A., the D.E.A., the F.B.I., the Justice Department, 
  and other relevant agencies of his own administration - including the 
  long-buried evidence gathered by l.R.S. agent Duncan and Arkansas state 
  police investigator Welch. President Clinton should also offer full 
  executive-branch cooperation with a reopened congressional inquiry, and 
  expose the subject fully for what it says of both the American past and 
  future.
  </p>
  <p>
   Seal saw himself as a patriot to the end. He had dictated his own epitaph
  for his grave in Baton Rouge: "A rebel adventurer the likes of whom in 
  previous days made America great." In a sense his documents may now 
  render that claim less ironic than it seems.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tons of drugs that Seal and his associates brought into the country,
  officials agree, affected tens of thousands of lives at the least, and 
  exacted an incalculable toll on American society. And for the three 
  presidents, the enduring questions of political scandal are once again 
  apt: What did they know about Mena? When did they know it? Why didn't 
  they do anything to stop it?
  </p>
  <p>
   The crimes of Mena were real. That much is now documented beyond doubt. 
  The only remaining issues are how far they extended, and who was responsible.

   THE LONDON SUNDAY TELEGRAPH
29 JANUARY 1995
ARKANSAS DRUG EXPOSE MISSES THE
POST
BY AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD IN
WASHINGTON

IT MIGHT almost be called The Greatest Story Never
Told. The article was typeset and scheduled to run in
today"s edition of The Washington Post.
It had the enthusiastic backing of the editors and staff
of the Sunday Outlook section, where it was to appear
after eleven weeks of soul-searching and debate.
Lawyers had gone through the text line by line.
Supporting documents had been examined with
meticulous care. The artwork and illustrations had been
completed. The contract with the authors had been
signed.  Leonard Downie, the executive editor of the
newspaper, had given his final assent.
But on Thursday morning the piece was cancelled. It
had been delayed before - so often, in fact, that its
non-appearance was becoming the talk of Washington -
but this time the authors were convinced that the story
was doomed and would never make it into the pages of
what is arguably the world"s most powerful political
newspaper. They have withdrawn it in disgust, accusing
the Post of a cover-up of the biggest scandal in
American history.
In stark contrast, the managing editor, Robert Kaiser,
left a message on my answering machine saying that
there was really nothing to "this non-existent story".
In a subsequent conversation, he dismissed the article
as a reprise of rumours and allegations. "I am confident
that it doesn"t have any great new revelations," he said.
Others are less confident. A copy of the article passed
to The Sunday Telegraph - not, it should be stressed,
by its authors - appears to be absolutely explosive.
Based on an archive of more than 2,000 documents, it
says that western Arkansas was a centre of international
drug smuggling in the early 1980s - perhaps even the
headquarters of the biggest drug trafficking operation in
history. It asks whether hundreds of millions of dollars
in profits made their way "into criminal laundering in
Arkansas"s notoriously free-wheeling financial
institutions and bond houses".
The activities were mixed up with a U.S. intelligence
operation at the Mena airport in Arkansas that was
smuggling weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras.
Bill Clinton is not specifically accused of involvement,
but he was Governor of Arkansas at the time. The piece
also notes that some of his prominent backers had been
the subject of extensive investigation by the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the FBI, and had been
assigned files in NADDIS - the Narcotics &amp; Dangerous
Drugs Intelligence System.
The article makes clear that the alleged scandal is not
confined to the activities of the Arkansas political
machine and Mr. Clinton. It embraces the highest levels
of the federal government over several years. "For three
Presidents of both parties - Messrs. Reagan, Bush and
Clinton - the old enduring questions of political scandal
are once again apt," the article concludes. "What did
they know about Mena?  When did they know it? Why
didn"t they do anything to stop it?"
It is clear that The Washington Post took the article
extremely seriously. It was to be run at full length -
roughly 4,000 words, taking up several pages in an
almost unprecedented spread across the Sunday
Outlook section.
The authors, Dr. Roger Morris and Sally Denton, were
told that they were being offered the highest fee ever
paid for a contributiontotlook. They are veteran
investigators with established reputations.  Morris
worked for the National Security Council staff at the
White House during the Johnson and Nixon
Administrations. He has taught at Harvard and has
written a series of acclaimed books on foreign policy.
Denton is the former head of news agency UPI"s
special investigative unit, and is the author of the
Bluegrass Conspiracy, which exposed the involvement
of Kentucky political and law enforcement figures in an
international arms and drug smuggling ring.
Their research is concentrated on the activities of Barry
Seal, a legendary smuggler who operated from a
company called Rich Mountain Aviation in the
Ouachita Mountains west of Little Rock.
They have his bank and telephone records, invoices,
appointment books, handwritten notes, personal diaries
and secretly-recorded conversations, as well as
extensive police records and surveillance reports.
Among other allegations they make are:
 - Seal was using his fleet of aircraft to export weapons
to Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil in addition to the
Nicaraguan Contras.
 - The planes were carrying cocaine back up to
Arkansas on the return journey for sale in New
York, Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis and other cities.
 - Seal had ties to the CIA and felt that he could
smuggle with impunity.
-  Nine separate attempts to investigate Mena, by
both state and federal authorities, were stymied.
"Over the entire episode looms the unmistakable
dark shape of U.S. government complicity in vast
drug trafficking and gun-running," the article says.

The broad picture is not new to readers of The Sunday
Telegraph [DSO - thanks to the heroic efforts of the
author of this article], which published a story making
some of the same points on October 9th last year. [DSO
- headlined "Smugglers Linked to Contra Arms Deals",
that article, also by Evans-Pritchard, is partially
displayed with caption with the present article]. The
Wall Street Journal has also done original reporting on
the subject.
