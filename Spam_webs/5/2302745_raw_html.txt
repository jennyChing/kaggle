                 This is funny. If anything, your response can be deemed acting like a Brown Shirt. In Nazi Germany, they roamed the streets and beat people up who did not agree with their view.

                 The gentleman asked to be arrested. The police officer was trying to just remove him from the meeting for disturbing it. If he had left peacefully, he would not have been arrested.

                     From what Ive gathered, he refused to stop speaking, interrupted the meeting, refused to allow other parents the right to speak their own thoughts on the matter, and then refused to leave when asked, politely, multiple times, by a police officer. He then blatantly said he would not leave and would have to be arrested.

                 The police officer let him know that he would have to leave, due to speaking out of turn, and not stopping after being asked numerous times.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He said he was not going to leave, that he was going to have to arrest him. Leaving the officer with no choice. He could have been civil and left because he was not following the rules of a civil society.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Basically asking to be arrested.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If everyone was to speak out of turn and talk over each other, it would be a shouting match, not a school board meeting. How would you accomplish anything in an environment like that?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just because someone has something to say, does not give them the right do this. There are procedures in meetings like this, so no one domineers the conversation and everyone gets to say their opinions and thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It was not his turn. Plain and simple

                   Weve looked into home school for our kids. In the Commonwealth of Virginia it costs ~$1000 a year per kid to teach them at home. Doesnt sound like much, but when youve lost over $10 an hour because of being laid off from one job and your wife cant find a job for the health care Bachelors Degree she has, now were feeding 6 people a night on $15 an hour and trying to decide which bill is going to be put off until the next paycheck so that we can have something other than ramen noodles and hot dogs for dinner (never mind not having anything for lunch at work), tell me how Im a coward because I cant afford to home school my kids! Its blanket statements like yours that really pisses me off when jack holes like you dont know shite about others situations. Oh, before you say anything, I make too much money according to Social Services to qualify for food assistance.

                       Wife just looked into it about 2 weeks ago due the the 15 year old having major issues with her English teacher and  her (daughters) cutting because of school. Weve managed to get her help for the cutting and most of her emotional issues, but now that my Tricare has run out and I cant afford insurance for the family, I use the VA, we may not be able to get her meds. So in a couple of weeks, when her meds run out, were going to be going through even rougher times. I appreciate the information about A.C.E and look into it, but Im not hopeful since Im not a minority or a liberal. According to our current government, Im the part of the group of the worst of the worst, a middle-age, white, conservative, Christian, military veteran male. So all I am to them is another tick mark on their list of those who need to be eliminated and my kids get shafted.

                       Yepour current government has no respect for the underemployed every-day conservative working man/woman who busts his/her rear to scrape out just enough to get by on these days and who eeks out just enough to disqualify his family for the benefits that freeloaders who wont work have no problem getting.  You could always try changing your name to SanchezIm sure they would bend over backwards to help you out.  Thank you for your service to our nation.  You may be just another tick mark on their list, but you will always be a hero to me, sir. and I am sure I am not the only one.  There are organizations out there that help Veterans in need. Heres a link to a listhopefully, you can connect with an organization that can and will help:

                     Gene Vickery  Have you looked into allinonehomeschool.com ?  Its the site for Easy Peasy All-in-One Homeschool &amp; it is freeyou dont necessarily need to buy curriculum to homeschool.  Also, there is the options of unschooling  just some things to consider.  I dont live in Virginia, so Im not familiar with the laws regarding homeschooling.  Hopeful things work out better for you guys in the end &amp; this just ends up being a bump in the roadpraying for your daughter.

                       I didnt have a problem withmy job or pay until 2006 when the Dems took over Congress and the bottom completely dropped out since 2012. It doesnt help that the Dem controlled Senate wont even allow the near 40 bills concerning the economy that was passed by and sent over from the Republican lead House. Try this on for size..VOTE OUT ALL INCUMBENTS REGARDLESS OF PARTY!!!!

                 I want to thank everyone who gave kind words and encouragement. As for the two shite stains that cried about me whining, theyre not worth the old John Wayne style crap paper to respond to. I hope for all that our country can turn around and recover properly from this liberal economic boon.

High school is ~$7000 per year, per student.  depending on the courses the student takes unless you live in specific counties,  then its free. Wouldnt you know it? I dont live in any of yhose counti2.

                   As much as I hate to disagree with you the Constitution only covers freedom of speech towards our government. As much as that school board wants to act like its own government freedom of speech does not apply.

                 Define Disruptive The Parent didnt make any threats nor did he use any kind of physical violence. He was using the first amendment to voice his opinion. Hell, I didnt hear any offensive language. Hitler wouldve been proud of that school board. I know what youre saying, but there is no Devils Advocate stand in my opinion. That guy is going to win a lawsuit with a decent attorney. BTW, I am a retired Cop of 20 years and I find the Officers demeanor as a Bully

                 That is highly likely.  Ive been to board meetings that could have gotten out of control due to tough issues.  This guy, in my opinion, was disrupting the talking time of others but he definitely did not deserve to be arrested.  He could have been simply ejected.

                   Hes a tax payer concerned about the school giving his kid a totally inappropriate required reading assignmentwhat right do they have to eject this man?? They work for Himhe, along with the others, and thousands more pay their salaries!  Its time these school board folks are reminded where their paycheck comes from!!   And the cops as well for that matter.  This man was in no-way out of control.  The U.S. Constitution states people have a right to peaceable assembly to PROTEST in order to get their grievances heard. Thats why this man was there, obviously.  He had a Right to be heard, NOT silencedand THEN arrested, for cryin out loud!  Wake-UP people!!

                     So if I go up to a cop and ask to be arrested, he or she will just do it? Sorry hun, no cop on Earth is going to waste their precious free coffee and doughnut time on that craziness. Thats a lot of paperwork! Besides, he didnt ask. You are confusing his vocal disbelief with a request.

                 Was the punishment for violating that rule being arrested? What concerns me is that 1) No one else seemed to be concerned about this book  at least not in the 2 minutes of video and 2) No one stood up and agreed with the man but rather they all sat there like frightened sheep. While it makes me glad that my daughter has graduated high school it concerns me that once she has children of her own itll be even worse.

                 From what I gather, when he was asked to leave, the policeman was simply going to escort him out.  When he refused to leave, I believe that is what led to him being arrested. Thats my take.

               I agree.  The group should have beaten the tar out of this nazi.  With every passing day, we are seeing the police state goons impede on our rights.  Our founding fathers went to war with Britain for much less than what is happening today.  Wake up, people!  The time to act is now!

               I would have punched that communist black booted thug cop in the head and gave him a real reason to try and handcuff me. This is disturbing in so many ways everyone on that school board should be thrown off the board. This country is becoming so fd up I dont think there will ever be a way to save it.

                 I would never allow my future children to attend a school that teaches things the way that they do, only allows each parent a freakin 2-minute rule in which to voice their opinion, and has no care about the parents opinions whatsoever. Terrible customer service skills, and no empathy for others.

               The other people just sitting there and not objecting to him being arrested are just as to blame for this happening as the police officer.  And they should vote the school board out on their behinds.

                     Abridging the freedom of speech means shortening it. The two-minute rule goes against the Constitution does it not? Abridging defined in the dictionary is:

                    <p>
                     shorten (a book, movie, speech, or other text) without losing the sense.

                       So let me see if I get this right I come to your church &amp; before your minister says anything I demand he answer MY questions &amp; then I proceed to take over the service for an hour long rant. IF I am stopped then well this is a violation of my First Amendment rights. Is that what your saying?

                 As stupid as it was to be arrested for violating a 2 minute rule, had anyone escalated the incident, it could have turned out much worse.  Sad day when concerned parents cant voice their opinion about their childrens education, without being arrested.

                   Yes it could have turned out worse.  But this was bad enough.  Any time there is an unjust act, then personal liberty is threatened.  I doubt very much any charges against this man will ever be prosecuted, that is unless there has never been anyone else who spoke more than two minutes, without objection, at this school boards meetings.  And I doubt that would be the case.  Freedom of speech is threatened whenever it is unnecessarily limited, and I would certainly call this unnecessary.

                     I guess they wanted to voice their 2 minutes of concern, and get what ever reasoning the district had for having that book on their reading list.  I dont think the whole board meeting was about the book.  There were probably other issues being discussed at the meeting.

                       It certainly shouldnt have been.  I know I wouldnt want my children being forced to read about rough sex between two immature teenagers.  There was a book they tried to introduce in the school system here something about Cuba which had a very graphic sex scene that the teacher was wanting to be read out loud in class.  Thankfully, several parents got together and said, Were not paying you people to teach our children about pornography!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The reason he was the ONLY one to have this issue is that most other parents dont even CARE what their kids are learning or doing in school, this parent actually paid attention!

                       The body language with the closed eyelids says it all.  This petty bureaucrat is frightened that she might have to exercise some personal judgment, might have to break a rule, might have to explain herself to someone, so she hides behind rigidly controlled emotions and procedure, and she closes her eyes to the opinions of the people she would otherwise have to look in the eye.  Shes a coward.  They all are.  I hope the school board is removed en mass at the earliest opportunity.

                 This is what America became to be: a country of lazy souls. Even kids would think if they chose their mother ot a hamburger in McDonalds. Think about it. It is not just Obama, Bush, Clinton, or whoever. IT IS FASCISM. A sheriff from AZ offered kids in his proclamations hung in schools MONEY for to call police on their illegal FRIENDS (and families). It was about Mexicans, so.? If you sell a friend for money, would you some day sell yourself???? Germany 1933. Remember it, the World.

                 Americans have been conditioned to Obey without question.  Fortunately many know B.S. when they see it, (even though it appears no one here has the courage to address it).  This officer is violating this mans rights by acting under the color of law and should be investigated.

                 I totally agree with you Corey. Crap like this really pisses me off. This man was upset and rightfully so, he was not shouting, or hurting anybody. He was mad that his daughter was reading this material offered by the school system. She was fourteen and the book given for the students to read was inappropriate. What the heck is with a two minute time limit anyway? Stupid. I would have talked over two minutes and whoever was in charge of the meeting could have handled it better by maybe asking what is it that upsets you the most Mr. Baer?, or how do you feel that we can correct the situation at hand? I would give people the opportunity to voice their opinions whether they agreed or disagreed. Dont we have the right to speak?? Is that not listed in the Constitution. That arrest was completely unnecessary!!! I respect officers who support the Constitution. That mans rights were violated. If I were him I would fight against that in court. Heck I would even go to court to support him. The images below sum up how I feel about this situation.

                 Those other people wanted their turn to speak to the board this asshat wouldnt allow it. He wanted the ENTIRE meeting to be about HIS issue. They let him have his say They even allowed him some extra time but that like all other self important conservatives wanted to monopolize the boards time. Me I would have simply put a bullet in his head &amp; been done with it.

                   The entire meeting WAS about his issue.  It was about children being assigned to read pornographic, age inappropriate material without the parents being notified or given an opt out.  Im still the parent when it comes to my child.  The school board is an elected body.  Their responsibility is to listen to their employers.  The boards 2 minute rule is unconstitutional.  It violates free speech in a government meeting.  If they would acknowledge and address his concerns he wouldnt have to go on and on.  But when they ignore his concerns and try to sweep them under the rug he has to speak up.

                       So what youre really saying here is that youre preoccupied with kinky sex, you didnt grow up with a father to teach you any manners, and your single mother never taught you how to cook, as she was too busy flagging down men in cars on the street corner.  No wonder you have nothing intelligent to say.

               Seriously, this mans rights were violated the moment that police officer grabbed his hand and slapped the cuffs on him, regardless of the content and talking out of turn. Do we arrest children that dont raise their hand in school before talking? The man didnt threaten anyone, didnt harm anyone, didnt defame anyone, so what was his crime? Thought Police?
              </p>
              <p>
               I would like to see the actual law on the books in that town and county that say talking out of turn at a school meeting is punishable by law, this is not disorderly conduct.

                       Stop, just please stop. Stop trying to justify the police state. 1) He wasnt disorderly. He was objecting to the book that this school board shoved down the students throats without any sort of input from the parents. 2) He wasnt trespassing. It was a meeting open to the parents/guardians of the students of that school and in fact may have been open to the general public.

                       2. STATE DEPENDENT, the moment you are asked to leave by the owners/landlords/legal custodians of the property, and you refuse, that is trespassing and it is an arrestable offense.

                       He was not silenced for protesting the book, he wasnt kicked out for protesting the book, and he wasnt arrested for protesting the book. Others there voiced the same opinion, but they did so while following the rules.

                       I believe my comment was intended for someone else. But I do think whether or not he was following The Rules or had good manners, when we let people get arrested for voicing their opinion against the government, we are all in trouble.

                       He wasnt arrested for voicing his opinion. Plenty of other parents at that meeting voiced the same exact opinion, including the woman who started talking during/after his removal they werent arrested.

                   Do you even know what bigoted means? Or marsupial for that matter? Do you carry your young in a pouch or something? Before you debate with us Primates, I suggest you do a little learning.

                     I fail to see what an internet user name has to do with this article, but then since you cant see the obvious bigotry of someone named Police State automatically faulting the cop in this instance when it was obviously the moron father responsible for his own arrest, well I dont think youre smart enough to take part in the discussion.

                 It IS disorderly conduct.  But, I agree with you otherwise.  The law on disorderly conduct needs to be refined, and only the courts can do that.

                     Well, yes.  The law itself can only be changed by the legislature, but defining the scope of the letter of the law is the role of the courts.  Whether this is disorderly depends upon an interpretation of the statute, which is usually interpreted too broadly by the courts.

                   Sorry but that wasnt even close to disorderly. The man has a right to express himself and he has a right to be noisy about it as long as he doesnt totally disrupt the meeting which he did not.

                     I agree with you in principal, but the definition of disorderly conduct is, in effect, to disrupt the lawful activities of anyone else.  Thus, to go over the 2 minutes and take that time away from someone else and to ignore repeated warnings to quit talking out of turn is easily disorderly conduct.  That you can be arrested for disorderly conduct under these specific circumstances is rather outrageous, but not illegal.

                     He may have had the right to speak but what about all the others there at the meeting who had business with the board?Interesting how folks like you think only people like yourself have special rights &amp; privileges not afforded anyone else.  What about THEIR right to speak?

                   Was he being abusive in his words-was he harming anyone-NO he was speaking out of turn-so tomorrow when I have a student in my classroom interrupt me or talk without raising their hand I should have a cop come and arrest them

                   this is COMMUNISM at its finest right there-oppress our rights as citizens because the government is always right. Bill1893 how would you like disorderly conduct redefined- so that anyone who expresses their first amendment rights be put in jail-your just as guilty as the people in the video!!!!

                     Abusive and harming arent necessary to being disorderly.  If you disrupt an assembly of other people, that is disorderly conduct.  If you keep talking out of turn when asked to stop, that is disorderly conduct.  I agree with your sentiment that it wasnt a serious infraction of any kind, but it was still illegal.  That he was arrested was, to me, an abuse of discretion.

                       I agree with you in principle.  After all, an unconstitutional law is no law at all.  Unfortunately, the courts have upheld disorderly conduct statutes so long as they say what this New Hampshire statute says, such that there is, in effect, a uniform version nowadays.

                     Actually if your student refuses to stop talking when you tell them to, and then refuses to leave the room when you tell them to, I wouldnt put it past you to call the cops/security since theyre the only ones that would be able to put their hands on the student without some sort of liability.

                     And if you didnt, you would be an irresponsible teacher sacrificing your teaching time and the education of the rest of your students all for one trouble maker.

                 N.H. Stat. title 62, Section 644:2 Disorderly Conduct.  A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if:
                 <br/>
                 
                 <br/>
                 He purposely causes a breach of the peace, public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creates a risk thereof, by:
                 <br/>
                 
                 <br/>
                 (b) Disrupting the orderly conduct of business in any public or governmental facility; or
                 <br/>
                 (c) Disrupting any lawful assembly or meeting of persons without lawful authority.

                 <br/>
                 Disorderly conduct is a misdemeanor [thus permitting arrest if it takes place in the presence of a peace officer] if the offense continues after a request by any person to desist; otherwise, it is a violation [thus permitting a ticket].

                     You can clearly hear the chair asking him repeatedly to quit talking, pleading with him to quit talking, and he keeps going and going.  Look, I agree with him completely.  Unfortunately, not only was his conduct disorderly, it was textbook disorderly.

                   Okay then by that standard, I as a civilian if I were there at that meeting could have performed a citizens arrest on that cop for disturbing the peace and violating that mans rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The law system goes both ways. As a citizen of the United States, if I see a police officer breaking the law or infringing on the rights of an innocent person, I have the right to perform a citizens arrest. I think if people werent so afraid of the police officers, there wouldnt be as much of an abuse of power.

                     A peace officer is generally privileged from having committed a crime in the course of effecting an arrest unless the arrest itself is illegal (either in its lacking probable cause or warrant or in its presenting a stand-alone felony).  Further, in most jurisdictions, you can only effect a citizens arrest of a peace officer for committing a felony in your presence (and good luck with that even then).  The arrest was legal because Mr. Baer was clearly engaging in disorderly conduct.  And, to the extent the cop was himself disorderly, it was both privileged and, at worst, a misdemeanor that you could, at most, report to his chief and internal affairs the next day.  Any attempt to citizens arrest him would itself be several crimes, and would likely result in your being hurt and prosecuted.

                 Does the constitution limit how much time we have to speak? no it does not. It says that we have freedom of speech.

                 Abridging the freedom of speech means shortening it. The two-minute rule goes against the Constitution does it not? Abridging defined in the dictionary is:

                 If a kid would not shut up &amp; was disruptive in class his butt would be sent to the principals office  They allowed him to have his say they gave him a solution &amp; how to appropriately deal with the issue. He chose to not shut up &amp; had the cop NOT removed him he would have continued disrupting the meeting. Clearly we need to put you folks in prison &amp; release all these non violent offenders.

                 You dont vote police into office. And in a local school board election, it is really impossible to determine someones views on things, there is no information available on nearly any of them.

               More and more are doing home school because of this stuff.  I keep reading about things that are being pushed that have no business in a school assignment, reading materials, videos and professors/teachers saying and doing things that are not ok or restricting speech rights.

               The man should use this video as he runs for school board in the next election.  He would win in a landslide.  If hed gone limp when he was touched by the officer it would have been even better.  As far as I know there is no requirement to participate in your own arrest.

                     I think that they were over baring with this situation. I think that the cop should have told him to go home after he was in the hall way I think the Cop make his point up until then The man can always come back to another meeting later.. But for the cop to put hand cuffs on him..and arrest him. This was over doing it!!! I think the cop made his point after grabbing the arm. It ok law officer are trained how to control the body of a person that is out of controlThe officer did his part in handling the situation.  And I think the dad had a pointbut was flinging insults about his daughters I really dont think that this was a proper way for the man to handle the situation about flinging insults to the speaker that had nothing to do with his daughters.. Is not a proper way handle any problems The man need to exercise a little more tact in what he was explaning and he was out of turn so it was harder to express what he was feeling. I think if he approached it more tactfully he could have made his view points more obvious and the party could have help him to work on it. But being out of control dose no one any good. I think the cop was a bit hard on him But like I said,,,The cop could have pointed to the door in the hall and said,, Go home!!! Now!!!  That would have been acceptable. If he then attacked the cop..I think that would not have been acceptable then the cop should have arrested him then!! But he didnt resiste arrest..he did resist the cop when he told him to come on..  He should have got up and left peacefully instead of making the cop remove him. Im sorry but the Judge will look at this video and declare by written law as to what the judge has to follow will declare the police officer in the right. As unfair as that may seem!! The jude sill has to comply with the law as written.. Because in a seance he resisted arrest when he refused to leave the room peacefully  He had  the opportunity not to be a butt.!!! I know he was not feeling good about the situation but that didnt give him the right to brake the law. Even though the officer was a bits over bearing. The courts will not recongnize it. Im sorry .

                 Interesting you bring up the topic of gun rights. If you read the book in question, its about a school shooting where multiple students and a teacher die.

               The worst part is that the idiot parents just sat there.  Do they support the forced reading of this book?  I wouldnt live in that part of the country for any amount of money.  This school board needs voted out, the school needs to have a suit brought against it and the cop needs to be fired.

               How sick is this, not only what happened to this father but worse what is being taught in a public school. Geez (by that principles standards)  if I was only 21 years old again Id see if the LIBERAL principle had a daughter that wanted some rough sex and *** all over his rug after I ****ed her silly. Someone please forward my message to him, does he have a wife, maybe Id **** her next since they are a family of liberal whores. Who voted these people in to these jobs? As I say do unto others as they are doing to you and yours.

                     Haha Ive read the excerpts which was sufficient. Would you want YOUR teenage daughter to have to read this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Relax, Matt murmured, and then he sank his teeth into her shoulder. He pinned her hands over her head and ground his hips against hers. She could feel his erection, hot against her stomach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       She couldnt remember ever feeling so heavy, as if her heart were beating between her legs. She clawed at Matts back to bring him closer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Yeah, he groaned, and her pushed her thighs apart. And then suddenly Matt was inside her, pumping so hard that she scooted backward on the carpet, burning the backs of her legs.  (H)e clamped his hand over her mouth and drove harder and harder until Josie felt him come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Semen, sticky and hot, pooled on the carpet beneath her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I dont. And I have serious concerns for a school system that not only is forcing teens to read this but uses the cops to silence any opposition to it.

               In the early 90s, the public was warned of these new learning tools and were voted in anyhow by now grandparents of these children, leaving parents like these the only choice to get arrested to try and be heard. I did my part. I got a baby sitter for my 4 kids and went to school and city council meetings to vote against the new accepted books. Honestly, do you think the police officer feels the same way or just doing his job?

               How sad people can get away with this crap! I would take my kids out of the school and either home school them or enroll them in another school. The I would consult with an attorney! Too bad the entire group didnt stand up as one to support the gentleman, who was only trying to protect his child.

               Homeschool or start your own schools. Youll find lots of willing parents to participate. People need to stop believing that the only way to get an education is to sit behind a desk all day, listen to an expert and spit back facts. Let your kids enjoy being kids. Along with some direction, they will blossom and surpass any kid in school.

               My  hat is off to this responsible parent.  If more parents had a clue as to what their children are doing, we would not have all these problems with our youth. Peer pressure, violent TV shows, etc. that influences our youth has got to stop.  Quit sensationalizing  all of this crap. Shame on that board and that Policeman for arresting that man when all he was doing was being a responsible parent, and using his first Amendment right.  What a stupid school board to even allow such a book to be read. The longer I get to know people the more I love Dogs more.

                 Under our system, even violating the 2 minute rule for one second is disorderly conduct.  Any lawsuit against the cop would be summarily dismissed under the doctrine of qualified immunity.  That a man can be silenced and ultimately humiliated under that system is an indictment of that system.  Adding the specific facts of this case makes it all the more outrageous.  That cop should have exercised a little more discretion.  The fact that he didnt and will not be held accountable for it is another indictment of the system.

               Apparently the school board knew was was going to happen or is it just normal to have officers of the law present at these meeting in that area.  What a crock!!  As a parent that man had every right to speak his mind and if that book was that graphic then I would have had a problem with that too if my teenage child was involved.  I totally would have knocked that cop on his butt then dealt with the courts later.  That office was wrong in even touching that man because he did nothing wrong and I am sure that all charges were dropped as soon as this hit the media.  Fire the whole damn school board on that one.  The school board was wrong just plain and simple.

                 Dont give the goon the dignity of the term officer.  The guy being arrested was himself an officer, of the court.  The goon was a goon.  He didnt want to look weak or incompetent in front of his employers, so he made a poor decision that the courts will uphold in spite of the afront to liberty.  Its all rather shameful.

Was he not a parent of a student of that school board? What was the crime that caused the police to remove him from the meeting, handcuff him and take him into custody? False arrest! Harassment. Defamation of character. I would sue the Board for making false charges, first amendment violations and the police for false arrest THEN I would vote the morons out of office.

               Most of you are right, he should be able to voice his opinion to the school board. They are wrong for not letting him exercise his rights. However, he broke the law when he refused to leave. If you listen closely, the officer tells him, they asked you to leave. He refused. Therefore the officer didnt violate his rights, he made an arrest based on what Texas refers to as Criminal Trespass.

                   It had nothing to do with them not liking what he had to say. It was because he was speaking out of turn. You cannot simply talk over someone and not expect to be called on it.

               The other story indicates that the man arrested is an attorney.  Those of you knocking him for not having any balls need to realize that he did exactly what he should do to win his case in court.  That win will be much more beneficial to us all than taking a swing at a cop who like it or not is just doing his job.

               He did interrupt another man while he was speaking.  And then was it his turn? Sounds like they were giving anyone who wanted to speak two minutes.  Perhaps he should have raised his hand and waited his turn.  But he interrupted someone and then kept arguing. I can see why they asked him to leave.

               The cop and the city official encouraging him to arrest that man should both lose their jobs. The mans rights were violated. They cant even claim disorderly conduct because that is not even close from the video. This was simply an abuse of power and position.

               What a bunch of cowards, just sitting there and not even defending this father for speaking his mind when all of you were there for the same reason. You shamed yourselves by doing nothing at all.

               I cant believe that no one else agreed with him. I would have been a lot louder than that guy !! Didnt they expect that parents were going to be upset ?? So whats the point of having a school board meeting if you cant state how you feel.

                       W Dawes (who I was replying to) said enough evidence to prove the book should not be in a school. Is that not banning the book?

                       Yes in my opinion it is ok for a school to assign this book. I have read the book, was confronted and moved by its passages of bullying, and feel students can learn a lot discussing the many themes of this book.

                       Originally the parent was not asking to ban the book, he wanted a parent opt out letter for the students, like other controversial books.  Funny, when it is Controversial for you lefties, there is this push for censorship.  But when it is Controversial for the right, those people are labeled as uneducated by the left, just like you have been doing, Chris johnson.  So yes you are a Socialist Troll.  Really hard for you to try and cover your tracks by telling everyone you are a moderate because you are not.

               This is why  when the time does come  90 % of We the People will do as told  and I hope and pray that when I am in such a place and it happens while I am present  I am asking God at this moment to Please make Me that 10 % of the Ones that will take that stand and that will as well be carted off like a raping murdering criminal of a thug  All because of His concerns and rightly so about the words and some graphics in a middle school text-book , Why would the others just sit there and not say a damn word !  Yes reinforcements would of been called in  But at least You made that stand  This is where the True Fighting American Patriots will stand out  For they will be the only Ones that do Stand-UP !  wtf  America today  barryville tomorrow  Yes You have a choice  at least on this day of 05/06/2014 We still have Our Rights and as long as We stand Up for said Rights then at least We will always have that chance of keeping those Rights  But just as soon as We stop demanding Our God given Rights through Our United States Constitution  and Our Beloved  Bill of Rights  That is the day that We will lose said and All of the Rights of being an American Citizen  The Greatest Place on this living Earth !  But We are going to have to fight for these Rights or lose these Rights  and for this cop to have done what he did , just showed the world the size of his man-hood and he was making it up with the pushing around of an unarmed citizen , this cop looked to be as un-knowledgeable about this Mans Rights as if the cop had a boot up his butt  I am beside My-Self here after watching what these People ( American Citizens ) allowed to happen right before there eyes and NOT ONE of them said any-damn-word in favor of this American Citizen being pulled out of His seat in a manner that a murdering criminal would be yanked up and taken away

               When a police officer takes illegal action and breaks the law himself, he no longer holds the authority that his badge represents.  He has lost all rights to his position as a law enforcement officer and the public should take his place and escort HIM to the jail to be charged with his crimes.

               This also happens at township and borough meetings. Dont dare ask a question of anyone on a Board which requires an answer that may show them in a bad light. For instance a township manager allowing a neighborhood to be built in the 80s knowing that at the area they could not get a good water perk. Then 20 yr later sitting on the board of supervisors in one township under one name and also on another township board using a different name. Directly asking questions to the person involved got me escorted out 2xs.

               I think in these left wing districts if a conservative plans on speaking he should hire about 12 bodyguards and then stand up to the union police officers who are mindless to say the least. Being led out by the hand would not have happened unless he wanted to drag me.

               Im not sure he should have been arrested but there was a process for expressing your thoughts  he didnt follow it. He was rude and was looking to evelate the situation  so removong him from the room was appropriate

                 Wow. Seriously? Looking at this from Australia I could tell you that if it happened here most of the people in the room (including those who disagreed with the guy arrested), would have disarmed the officer, put him under citizens arrest and he would have eventually appeared in court charged with false arrest. Rudeness and elevating a situationare not criminal, nor even civil offenses. If you think this is a reasonable act, in any country in the world, I think you should consider emigrating to North Korea.

                   Looking from Australia, no such thing would have happened here. The concept of a citizens arrest is almost unheard of. More likely anyone doing so would have been charged with obstructing police. (Remember Occupy Melbourne?)

                     Judging from your other comments Chris, you are from a chardonnay-sipping, latte-slurping, black-skivvy wearing, lefty-apologist, sheepish-minded part of Australia that is totally foreign to me. I can assure that in my part of Australia it would have happened exactly as I have stated.

                       Actually Im a supporter of free speech, have attended rallies where Police have arrested peaceful protesters, and I have stood up for the rights of others.
                       <br/>
                       If you think you wouldnt be charged for obstructing police then I doubt you know our legal system well. Do you think the police would allow one of their own to be arrested by citizens? Ha! Not a chance.

                   What would happen to you if you tried to disarm a police officer? You end up in a life-or-death struggle for the firearm. My money is on the cop in that situation. I would hate to be the guy who has to go tell your family that you were stupid enough to think you could just grab a police officers gun off him and ended up dead for your stupidity. Elevating the situation is what happens when you go for the cops gun. Bang! Youre dead.

               This is so disturbing! So we have no right to object to the fact that the school board wants our children to read porn for school assignments.  The phrase This countrys going to hell in a hand basket is an apt description!

               Why are the other people just sitting there, they shouldve stood up and rally around this parent. Dont they know that is their freedom that is in jeopardy, every one of those school board members should be kicked out for allowing this to happen. Do we understand what this school is trying to do, they are teaching our children its okay to let a guy rough you up during sex. Come on people call it like it is. This is un real what is being taught in our schools. Speak up all of you, together you can change this system. They are changing the history books in America, stand up and say something to your congressmen, senators. Let your voice be herd.

                 Maybe they all just thought this parent was being a dick disrupting a meeting because he didnt like the book. Its fine he didnt like the book, he had his two minutes, and was now causing a disruption.
                 <br/>
                 Do I think he should have been arrested? No. Asked to leave? By all means. If someone is asked to leave and refuses to do so, are they then trespassing? Possibly.

                   Chris, does the concept of condemned by their own words ring a bell to you here? 9 days ago on a different site on a totally different subject, you wrote:

                  <p>
                   Ah yes. Punish a person for exercising their freedom of speech.
                   <br/>
                   So much for disagreeing with someone but supporting their right to say it.
                   <br/>
                   Personally it may not have been the best place or the best way to say what he said, but its important to be said none the less.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Does he have the right to impede on others having their say? I also support their right to free speech.

                     If he wanted to stage a protest, by all means, but he would also have to risk the consequences of possible arrest.

                     Actions are not free of consequence. The right to free speech is limited if you then seek to limit the right of others, which arguably he does by interrupting others. Comprende?

                       No, just more self-justification from the left, stringing a few words together to make something that sounds like  an argument, even if it totally contradicts your principled  position of less than a fortnight ago. What incredible gall form a Socialist, the people who introduced hate speech legislation, regularly attack free speech by labelling those who oppose them as haters, deniers and  homophobes. You are the thought police straight out of 1984. You only defend free speech if

                       Schools are only allowed to have certain number of books, so the ones that were no bought are banned books all of a sudden?  No there are other books that can be in the school.  I said this one does not need to be there.

                       As for attacking people with those labels?  Well Chris, you let your socialism out of the bag once again.  Only the left prejudges people with those labels from outside a court trial, and that is defamation of character.  You are not the judge of who is what.  Political Correctness= without freedom.

                       I just want you to know that I appreciate your posts. They are to the point and making your opinion known. No where in your conversation are you calling people names or making derogatory statements about others. You keep a discussion as a discussion, not an attempt to distract it with rude comments.
                      </p>
                      <p>

                       Why not just stick to the topic and discuss your point. By making comments like this, the conversation is not strengthened, but weakened. How about we all stick to the points that we support and stop name calling?

                   No such thing as trespassing in a public forum. If the parents are invited, (as is evidenced in the video) then its a public meeting.  I know from my own school district that the school board members often  get drunk on their own power thinking that they Always know whats best and forget why they are there and WHO it is they are supposed to be representing to begin with. Our board president is a total Dick, has no ability to see any unintended consequences of his and the boards actions, and I cant wait to get him out.

                 Do we understand what this school is trying to do, they are teaching our
                 <br/>
                 children its okay to let a guy rough you up during sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can only surmise that you have not read the book Nineteen Minutes. There is a scene of forced sex  aka rape. Rape happens and should not be erased from literature. However the scene certainly does not convey that rough sex is ok.
                 <br/>
                 The book as a whole deals with a school shooting where a number of students and a teacher dies, including the perpetrator of the rape. That the parent was more concerned by rough sex than the violence of a school shooting says something, dont you think?

               I wonder how many have actually read the book?
               <br/>
               The rough sex described was forced sex. Rape.
              </p>
              <p>
               Its disturbing to read, but rape happens and should not be erased from our literature.
              </p>
              <p>
               More confounding is that this parents objected to the rough sex, when the book is about a school shooting where multiple students died. As a parent Id want my children to read the book for all of its graphic scenes and gain an understanding of why some children may feel bullied or marginalised.

                 Well, bully for you, ChrisIm seriously concerned for your kids, if you have any.  I dont call that good literature in the least, and my son had better never bring home a book like that while hes in high-school or some egg-head will be arresting me as well for my never-ending harassment of the teacher, the principal, the Superintendent AND the school board, about it, if necessary.  I dont want the trashy details cemented in my sons mind.  I read books in high-school in which some scenes are still vivid in my mind, unfortunately., and that was 40 years ago!   I wouldve been much better off without that vivid crap stuck in my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I once complained to an unwavering teacher about a book and movie my sons book club was reading and going to see AFTER I went to see it myself (which I always do) and asked her to intervene and insist they choose a different book/movieshe refused, saying it was their club, thus, their choice.   I called the principal and told him the scenes in graphic detail and asked him, having heard from a parent with first-hand knowledge, if he would take his son to go see it.  I told him the parents of the middle-schoolers were trusting the adult in the room (the sponsoring teacher, who also drove the kids to the movies) to monitor their choices, not to rubber-stamp them. I then demanded that he and/or the teacher or BOTH go see the movie beforehand and then decide. He must have done just that because he called me the following Monday and told me he insisted the teacher refuse to take the kids to see the movie and then he sent home a letter to the parents telling them to be sure to monitor what their kids were reading and that the book was in no way a reading assignment in any class, but an unwise choice made by the after-school book club. My son was a 7th grader at that time. Bottom line is that parents can and DO and Should make a difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That said, Teens are impressionable and tend to remember scenes in books and in movies and not, necessarily, the point that the teacher or even the author might hope they get from it.   The voiced objection to this book should be no different that my walking out of a movie theater with my son/daughter to keep him/her from seeing something horrible that I know will stick with him/her in a bad way for years to come, and asking for my money back (which theyve always given me).

               So,Id like to see what law the arrest was made in response to? probably the cop out disturbing the peace or tresspassing,which is total Bullshit,who is the school board to decide who gets to speak and how long? He should sue them and settle out of court for their jobs and a rule change.

                 The school board conducts the meeting, so therefore they are allowed to set the rules as long as no laws are violated, and there were none that were violated.

                 Theres nothing wrong with being a loud obnoxious asshole for the right reasons  and this was a damned good reason. I sure as hell would not have wanted that book forced on my teenage daughter. What concerns me is that the police were there in a PTA meeting to begin with. Is that the new normal now? Are we living in a police state?

                   What do you think all those people sitting around him were there for ?  In your world they should have started a riot and burned down the school right ? Sometimes I wonder what kind of people write comments.

                     Sometimes I wonder what kind of people write comments as well. Of course you exaggerate. Starting a riot and burn down the school? Really? Because I said there is nothing wrong with being a loud obnoxious asshole for the right reasons? Way to connect the dots to the wrong conclusion. In my world a PTA meeting would not require the presence of the police and the school board would have enough sense to not force that book on teens without even notifying the parents so they have the opportunity to have their objections heard BEFORE the book was introduced. So I take it you are okay with living in a police state where you are told what to do, what to say, what to read, what to think, what can be done with your body. Im not.

              <p>
               The right thing is left the kids read in the internet and everybody
               <br/>
               pretends that kids dont know that sex exist and they all are childrens
               <br/>
               from Disney movies.
              </p>
              <p>
               The childrens learn that lie, manipulate and hide what they do is okay, and the parents are awesome for not educate the kids.
              </p>
              <p>
               Until the day they appear pregnant and stoned, and the parents ask
               <br/>
               were things went wrong since they dont make they work as parents
               <br/>
               educating and giving instructions.

               Everyone has a right to complain at meetings like these, thats what they are for. However this man was telling another parent that his views were absurd. If he conducted himself in a civilized manner, and waited for the school board to acknowledge him, as per the rules of most of these public assemblies, then he would have been able to express his opinion just like everyone else. When he started violating the rules of the assembly, the school board asked him to leave, he refused, saying to the officer youre going to have to arrest me. William Baer is at fault here.

                     Everyone here is missing the reason the man was arrested, it was because he became unruly in a public space. The organizers of the assembly asked him to leave, and he continued to DISTURB THE PEACE, until an officer kindly asked him to leave to which he responded you will have to arrest me.

                       If everyone was to speak out of turn and talk over each other, it would be a shouting match, not a school board meeting. How would you accomplish anything in an environment like that?

                      <p>
                       Just because someone has something to say, does not give them the right do this. There are procedures in meetings like this, so no one domineers the conversation and everyone gets to say their opinions and thoughts.

               He had a right to voice his opinion IN AN ORDERLY AND RESPECTFUL MANNER.  The way he just broke in and started speaking before 1) the other parent got finished and 2) being called upon, was not only rude but disrespectful to all the other parents patiently waiting their turn to be called upon. What makes this guy so important that he doesnt need to follow the rules of the meeting or society?  He wasnt arrested for his opinion. He was arrested because of his misconduct in the meeting

                 Which is not a reason to be arrested. Someone else posed the question of why cops were at a PTA meeting to begin with. Is that the new norm? Crazy, crazy stuff man. We are turning into a police state.

               Welcome to the new U.S.A. Free Speech, yah right, that died a long time ago when people like all the ones sitting on their butts did nothing. That is the problem in this country, nobody stands up to oppression anymore until it effects them directly and even then 90% or more will just go along with it just to stay out of jail. R.I.P.

               free speech, beliefs, morals, parents, just a few things people forget when it comes to our society. He had every right to disagree and let the board know how he felt, the boards of today seem to think because they have a seat they are always right. Who is responsible for raising the children parents not the schools so personal things should be taught by the parents, however not everyone has responsible parents either. There has to be a medium where they can agree and do whats best for the children, forget the egos and be adults.

               The School Board wants a forgiveness pass because they forgot to send out notifications and opt out letters to parents..should the same not be granted to a father wanting to speak about his upset.  This man never should have been arrestedthe Board was disorderly in its conduct and no one has arrested them yet!!

               This is a promotional video for Home School.  Government has NO place in educating our youth.  We as a people need to force them out through our non-compliance.  Expecting government to just do the right thing is naive and foolish.

               Really?! This isnt Russia! We have the RIGHT to object to questionable curriculum and books that our children are exposed to. The Constitution and Bill of Rights explains this. The police officer violated this mans rights! Plain and simple!

               I think the police officer had every right to ask the man to leave. Initially it appears in the video that the officer was not going to touch him at all, at least not until the man decided to just be defiant and continue to press his position. Once the officer decided to actually touch the man, then the officer may have been required at that point to go all the way with the arrest and handcuffing, by following protocols for his department. Actually handcuffing is generally the rule for both officer safety and control of the subject under investigation or arrest. Probably, the most the most that this man can be charged with is disorderly conduct. No big deal really. Certainly inconvenient. This man had every right to protest what the school had done and the fact that his attempt to voice his concerns were being muted. The school should have made sure that they properly notified all parents before moving forward with this lesson plan.

               This is actually ridiculous.  Its called free speech!  He voiced his opinion  on a very important subject, I might add  and was arrested for it and they slapped a disorderly conduct label on it to justify their actions. Disgusting and appalling.

               Wait. WHAT????? Are you KIDDING ME right now????? Unbelievable! We absolutely have the right to voice our views, especially at a school board meeting. I saw NO REASON for the police to even be there. It would have been ridiculous just to make the dad leave, but to arrest him for stating his concern over a nasty book being assigned to children to read for school? (A 2 minute rule in that instance was bazaarhow would you even get your point across in 2 minutes)

               It doesnt matter if you agree with him or not, you should support his right to speak.  Everyday our rights are chipped away and we let it happen.  He should sue the police officer (personally), the police department, the board members and the entire school district!

               The other people all held to the two minute rule.  Im sure the school knew that no one was happy with this book.  Should they have just let him ramble on when so many others wanted to talk?  He could have left with the policeman.  He chose to be arrested.

                   1st amendment free speech.  Dont you think the cop was exceeding his authority just a tad over something as ridiculous as that.  Do some research on that school board and you will find their meeting rules to be onerous in the school boards favor.  The only way you get to talk is if you are talking about things that are good for the board members and not the children.

                 Its because of that scene with Lots daughters. But I suppose you APPROVE of indoctrinating children with graphic stories of incest and human sacrifice, dont you?

                   There is a lot more to that passage than you realize. The hostel men told Lot to bring the men He was harboring outside so they could know them. The word know implies intimacy in the Hebrew Scriptures. Lot offered up his daughters because he knew they were not interested in women. He also was under obligation to protect anyone in his house due to the threshold covenant, and by refusing to bring out the men from his house he caused the hostel men to focus their anger on himself. Lot actually performed a selfless act which is why he was found righteous and was spared the judgment that fell on Sedom and Gomorrah.

                       I understand your position on the Bible, however its not founded on anything concrete. The Torah, prophets and the writings (erroneously called the Old Testament) was written in pictograph Hebrew and unlike our alphabet, each letter of Hebrew has its own meaning and numerical value. Thus, a lot is lost in  our english translations. Does that mean we have to learn Hebrew to understand Scripture? No, it doesnt. there are plenty of reference materials available and ministries that actually teach the Torah (the first 5 books of the Bible).

                       is a good site that teaches Torah portions. youtube channels TIM BEEKER and 119 MINISTRIES are really good as well. You can either read an english translation at face value and mock something you know nothing about or you can swallow your pride and seek the Creator. Shalom to you.

               What is wrong is they have people so wrapped around this idea that the state, and the government has so much control that they would only be arrested for speaking up.  What people need to realize is we put them in office and we can take them out of office.  My child will never read a book that contains that type of material!  He will have all charges dropped.  Start taking a standor you will soon see the start of a Zombie Movement!

               How things have changed. In my days in high school, we had many, many books banned due to sexual content. Now, only 15 years later, they are forcing kids to read that stuff? Whats next? 50 Shades of Grey? Those schoolboard members and that pig who arrested that man for exercising his 1st Amendment Rights  need to be relieved of their jobs.

               Arrest a parent for speaking up? Really? Whatever happened to freedom of speech? The New Hampshire school board is just another example of what is wrong with the public school system. I hope this parent sues the Board, which is ultimately responsible for the content of learning materials. Selecting a book which is inappropriate for an education in what soft porn!

               Seriously folks? He dared the officer to arrest him. He got exactly what he wanted. Why cant we have civil disagreements anymore? Everything turns into a who can yell louder contest. He could have very easily waited his turn and made his point but no. His point is more valid because he said it louder? If everyone behaved like this guy nothing would ever get done. I am not saying he was right or wrong. I only disagree with how he handled himself. It was obviously an emotional subject but that doesnt excuse his behavior.

               I love how all these idiots are up in arms about a sex scene in a book. Yet nobody is concerned about the violence and killing that are in any number of books that are read in school. Same goes for movies. People would rather see someone get their head blown off than GOD FORBID!!! ..a female breast! So f@Cking stupid!

               im sorry but some stupid 2 min speaking rule does not trump the constitutional right of freedom of speech, the officer shld know this right and and kept his hands to himself instead of interfering with a parents right to speak his mind and protect his child,  this really pisses me off!!!

               The daughter should file a complaint for sexual harassment under the school districts own policies and procedures.  Whoever decided to hand this book out to 14 year olds without parental consent is probably guilty of a number of crimes under the state penal code.

               I guess it goes without saying that nobody in the entire town ever read the Bible, or else theyd all be in jail for exposing their children to all those stories of rape, incest, war, brutality, human sacrifice, and public torture and execution.

               Maybe someone could have simply forward a motion to allow him more time to speak?  And if it was agreed upon, he could keep going, isnt that how a board meeting works?  I agree, he did not need to be arrested, now tax payers have to pay for his room and board, and his unnecessary case will add more stress to an already over-worked court system.

               Its the human condition, dont get involved, go along with whatever it is, then bitch about it laterlook at plane hijacks, how many aboard would risk life and limb to stop some scumbag from killing them?  Bravery, heroism is a rare breed, you have to put value on such things and do the right thingI agree with Robert S. Sheeple!  In college in a Sociology course, the example of a NY woman being murdered in public, stabbed to death and no one tried to stop itnow we have the asshats who believe their texts and tweets are far more important than their environment

               Well I can see his concern, however there is a way to discuss this issue.  Meetings with the staff at the school, conference with the instructor, or a more rational way read the book!!!!!!  We have to cease over reacting to literature.  There was the same hue and cry about Harry Potter, The French Lieutenants Woman and that horrible tome: Lady Chatterleys Lover all which I read in school.  I do sympathize with parents as they for the most part did not get exposed to controversial books.  Reading expands the mind and conscience, and that is the point.  I believe that as a parent our job is NOT to raise hell but steward our children with teachable moments.  Had this father done this an incident would have been avoided.

                 he wasnt allowed to discuss the issue. nor was the Board dealing fairly with the parents. this is a BS power play, typical of the Educational system shoving pornographic materials down our kids throats. this is also why the Board of Education fights so hard against vouchers. they know that parents would pull their kids from these cesspools of public education in a heartbeat and move to private schools, and then they couldnt be indoctrinated with the Democratic messaging. Let the government take care of you.

               The school district has some serious issues when it comes to their reading list!  I cannot imagine allowing such a book in the hands of children
              </p>
              <p>
               The father totally mishandled this entire thing.  He had a very valid concern.  The book was extremely inappropriate but by not following the rules and challenging the police officer he made it about his behavior and not about the inappropriateness of the book.  A missed opportunity for his daughter as well.  She could have seen her father standing up for something that sincerely needed correcting.  Instead she saw her father inappropriately speaking out of turn and then when called down for it; challenged the police officer.
               <br/>
               Per , the man literally asked for it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gilfords acting Police Chief, Lt. James Leach, said he had no choice but to make the arrest. There were repeated attempts to ask him to stop, Lt. Leach said. I asked him to leave. He refused. He said, arrest me or Im not going toso I did.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, I suspect that there was a high probability that, if the police did not take him away, he would have gone right back inside &amp; continued with his disruptive behavior.

               Judging by the comments here, its obvious that most of the readers of this site have a gross misunderstanding of Freedom of Speech. You are more than welcome to voice your opinions, but you are not allowed to interrupt or talk over people in a public meeting, nor are you, using the most famous example, allowed to shout, Fire!, in a crowded theater unless theres actually a fire. There are limits, which have been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States.

               1.

               shorten (a book, movie, speech, or other text) without losing the sense.

               Arresting him was ridiculous, of course.  But what if everyone there thought it was their right to speak as long as they wanted?  With every Right comes a Responsibility.

                 Really? he spoke for what 30 seconds before they shut him up with a cop. Cant wait until you want to exercise your constitutional rights, and realize that you and the rest of your liberal D-bag friends sold them off long ago.

                   You callin me a liberal?  Thats cold.  Seriously, you are right.  Unless the video was edited, the dad did not get his 2 minutes.  In 2 minutes, he could have made a well-planned speech outlining his concerns and requesting the board to address the issue so this doesnt happen again. It wouldnt have solved the problem, but it would have been a good start.  Yelling, shouting, interrupting doesnt get anything done.  (Its why I hate Face the Nation-type discussion shows.  Cant understand what anyone is saying.)  Instead of police, I guess the school board could have just let the dad talk and yell until the audience got tired of him and shut him down themselves.
