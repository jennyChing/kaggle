      Although Milan Kundera's quote is one of my favourites of the entire site, I've already written about why I like it. So I'm choosing Gary Kowalski's as my favourite of these quotes about dogs and friendship.
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">
      "My dog does have his failings, of course. He's afraid of firecrackers and hides in the clothes closet whenever we run the vacuum cleaner, but, unlike me he's not afraid of what other people think of him or anxious about his public image."
     </p>
     <p style="text-align: left;">
      Relish was also afraid of the vacuum cleaner, and didn't like lightning, but I do know that
      <strong>
       she was not concerned with what people thought of her, or with her public image
      </strong>
      . That's just one of the things I loved, and still love, about her.
