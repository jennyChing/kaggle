          Currently we have a few members spread out among a number of different games.  There is a handful in ArcheAge still(but the Sinister tag has been retired in the game), some have gone back to check out the newest updates to The Elder Scrolls Online, and a decent number have decided to give FFXIV: A Realm Reborn a go.  You can also find many of us playing steam games together. It's slim pickings for MMOs options these days. As seems to be a common trend every few years, we are currently waiting on The Next Big Thing. While we wait we are at least enjoying the games we have chosen.
         </p>
         <p>
          So, if you want to play with or against us you can find us in the above mentioned games.  The servers or factions are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           <strong style="background-color: initial;">

          <li>
           <strong style="background-color: initial;">

           : Fairie - SiNister

          See you in game!

           ArcheAge Naval Combat Expansion - April 28th (Dread Prophecies)
          </h3>
          <p>
           The open seas of Auroria are about to get crazy! Daily objectives will drive traffic across the contested waters. Entire fleets offully customizableships will vie for control of the Sea of Graves, Kraken, Freedrich, and more. The new shipcustomizationwill include:

            Armaments
           </strong>
           ,

           <strong style="background-color: initial;">

           </strong>
           (and more!). Some of these components will be able to be regraded, but even the strongest of components will come at a price to your vessel. These higher quality components, while improving its intended performance, will burden your ship with extra weight. As a result, your ship that might pack a huge punch will be slower than usual. All of these components will have their own durability, so damage can be focused on a specific one to help give your crew the tactical advantage! New naval battle focused character builds will be needed!

           We are still going strong in ArcheAge with no signs of letting up. We went into launch with a plan, and so far things are going according to that plan rather well. With hard work put in by the whole guild we managed to claim 90% of "Sinister Island" during the the first day land grab with the remaining properties gradually coming into our control over time(just a tiny bit of strong arming!). All farms on the island that we want built have now been built, and this past weekend we got our 1000 gilda mansion down/fully built.

           We managed to get one of the first, if not the first, Merchant Ship on the server, followed closely by a Fish-Find Longliner(fishing has been a pretty big hit apparently!) and several Lutesong Junks.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are all now getting geared up and prepared for the coming Auroria patch, mixed with some pirating here and there. Of course to do pirating you need ships right?

           There has been hype about Archeage for many years, and it is finally almost ready for a NA release. The official release date isn't set in stone, but it is expected to be entering open beta within a month or so. SiN plans to hit this game with our usual gusto, so new and old players are invited to stop by the forums and hook up in the latest closed beta events/open beta!

           As the title says, Sinister will be playing ESO on the side of the Daggerfall Covenant. It's been a while since a game has come out that actually seems polished and ready for prime time. Over the past 6 months or so the game has shaped up quite nicely as the developers have been very receptive to feedback from the players. I admittedly haven't played the game a ton, but the bit that I have it looks like it could easily provide a few months of fun at the very least. The class/progression system + the diversity it allows, and the significance of crafting throughout the whole game are both very strong points for the game.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those of you that have been out of action for a while should probably dust off your keyboards and
           <a href="http://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en/preorder" target="_blank">
            pre-order
           </a>
           for the early access + ability to play any race on any alliance. I think this will be one you don't want to miss!
          </p>
          <p>
           The 5-day early access launch is on Sunday, March 30th @ 7am EST. With it being a single mega-server for NA if you want your normal name you better get up early!

           Got the new site up and running. Hopefully it stays up and running! Have a look around. A quick list of things on the todo list:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Get more history written and added to that section.
           </li>
           <li>
            Get logo/whatever for top section(that's why that big blank area is there!).
           </li>
           <li>
            Work on layout of the streams section more.
           </li>
           <li>
            Adjust some text coloring on the forums as required.
