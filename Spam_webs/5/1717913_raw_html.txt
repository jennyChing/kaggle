      A spectro&lt;-&gt;synthesizer!
     </b>
     A sound spectrogram is a plot of the 
amount of energy at various frequencies over time. Speech sounds, especially 
vowels, have distinctive signatures (patterns of bands at certain frequencies). 
Vowels, for example, are identifiable by two or three bands of energy (called 
"formants") at certain intervals, or in the case of diphthongs, movement of the 
bands over time. The standard assumption is that a spectrogram is derived from a 
speech sound by a kind of filtering and analysis, and could not be used to 
regenerate the sound on which it was based.
    </p>
    <p>
     Peter Meijer of Philips Research has made a Java applet that takes a 
grayscale .gif and assigned tones to each pixel--the higher on the y-axis the 
higher the pitch, the darker (or lighter, depending on how you set it) the 
louder and thus resynthesized the spectrogram. His sonifier will also take an 
audio input (in RIFF .wav format) and make a gif plot of it, so it is both a

      Rsynth-2.0
     </a>
     , though also free, is a full-fledged speech synthesizer based on the vocal 
tract modeling of Dennis Klatt. Nick Ing-Simmons has put many options on the 
command line, introduced some lexical stress (as a pitch boost), and set up 
options for either an American English lexicon or a British one (each is about 9 
meg when made up as .db files). Rsynth is the Unix counterpart to the moribund 
Monologue for Windows. It too is a text-to-talk speech synthesizer and, equipped 
with one of the lexicons (or both!) it does well from AA to zucchinis. A nice 
feature is that it can display its "phonemic" mapping ("transcription") of text. 
It "says" either text entered on the command line or from a file redirected to 
it. Thanks to a classic piece of interactive programming by Axel Belinfonte at 
the University of Twente, you can sample
     <a href="http://wwwtios.cs.utwente.nl/say/">
      rsynth
     </a>
     and enter text which it will 
convert to speech and send back to you (press Enter to send your text before 
moving the cursor out of the entry box).

A painless registration is required.  Don't miss Anjali, "who" provides a great way to trainyour ear to an Indian accent.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Diphones 
and PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap and Add) make a very natural sounding 
synth. Most of the phone company voices indicated here are of this kind (one 
supposes&mdash;the matter is cloaked in trade secrecy). This method  is not considered dto be superseded by the HTS (Hidden Markov Model) statistical parametric approach.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="14" alt="[bullet]" src="PhonResources_files/ceriball.gif" width="14"&gt; 
Thierry Dutoit has persuaded several people to open up these existing 
diphone-analyzed data bases for scholarly investigation (not TTS) via &lt;a href="http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html"&gt;MBROLA &lt;/a&gt;.
Good working software for (among others, Linux) can be found there
along with a data base for French, Dutch, English,Estonian, German, and
Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, and 20 other languages, many with more
than one voice, along with an invitation to join the project. His book
is now available from Kluwer: &lt;i&gt;Introduction 
to Text-to Speech Synthesis. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p-->
    <p>
     <img alt="[bullet]" height="14" src="PhonResources_files/ceriball.gif" width="14"/>
     Since MBROLA can impose an intonational contour, it can sing as well as speak.  Not to be missed on Hamilton's site are the various German, Brazilian, French, Dutch, and Swedish voices singing the Doremi song from The Sound of Music and "I'm Popeye the Sailor Man."  CSLI has more advanced singing.

     <img align="left" alt="[bullet]" height="14" src="PhonResources_files/ceriball.gif" width="14"/>
     MBROLA does not take text as an input, and hence is not a complete TTS.
Rather it takes a ".pho" input file with the text already analysed into
individual phonemes and with information added on length of segment and
pitch. To be part of a TTS, MBROLA needs a front end that will take
text and turn it into pho type representation. The Euler project uses
different modules for different languages [French only, at present] and
produces such a representation which it feeds to MBROLA.

invites a number of applications, not the least of which is to hook up

the en1 database which is the MBROLA-massaged version of the one

MBROLA and installed as a voice in Festival, even the default voice. A

      Toolkit
     </a>
     (minimum 31M) which gets Windows users into the speech synthesis and
recognition game along with faces. It includes a modified version of
Festival 1.4.2 working as a TTS with CLSU's own diphone voices; other
voices can be downloaded (at upwards of 8M per voice). In addition to
the excellent waveform analysis tools, they include several "faces" and
head+torsos which lip sync to what one of the "voices" is saying.
Moreover, it provides software to engage these talking heads in
dialogues you script. That is, it includes some speech recognition. All
wrapped up in TclTk, it is definitely worth a look, though a beta; all
this 3D simulation needs graphics acceleration (of the GL variety) and
the package will not install cleanly without it. Lip sync at 3 fps is
definitely underwhelming. Development seems to have stopped in 2004.

Speech Recognition is gaining some credibility as PCs acquire greater computing 
muscle and error rates diminish. There are many single word/command programs, 
though the big bucks are obviously in continuous speech recognition. Most of 
these commander programs are one-word sound-shape pattern matchers and have to 
be trained for each person who uses them. The demo version of in-cubed (for 
Windows)gives you 20 command slots to experiment with. It is available from &lt;a href="http://www.commandcorp.com/cci/demos.html"&gt;Command Corporation &lt;/a&gt;and as

probabilistically against words in a lexicon. The commercial products ViaVoice

     Henry Rogers and Michael Stairs at University of Toronto have developed
     <a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/%7Erogers/phthong.html">
      phthong
     </a>
     which 
teaches, tests, and corrects the phonetic alphabet; actually, it has two forms, 
one which teaches the "American" modifications to the IPA and the other which 
teaches IPA by the book.

      Sammy
     </a>
     , an 
interactive sagittal section drawing that changes the position of articulators 
in the mouth as you select different features; it also gives the phonetic symbol 
for the sound.
