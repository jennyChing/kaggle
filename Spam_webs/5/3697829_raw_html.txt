       Many millions of people in the contemporary world have a compass that is perpetually "stuck on South". They are always unhappy and discontented. They endure chronic
       <a href="http://www.opioids.com/">
        pain
       </a>
       and/or
       <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/">
        depression
       </a>
       . Some victims of severe
       <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/lhanhed.htm">
        anhedonia
       </a>
       can't even imagine what it's like to be happy. A minor blessing is that not all of their days are  quite as terrible as others. So in one sense, their emotional compass can point North as well as South:  a
       <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/hypermotivation.html">
        motivational system
       </a>
       of sorts still functions. But the whole of their lives is spent in an Antarctic wasteland of misery and

        despair
       </a>
       .
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        At the other extreme, a small minority of people are blessed with a compass that seems perpetually "stuck on North". In pathological cases, they may be
        <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/high.htm">
         manic
        </a>
        . But sometimes they are in varying degrees just "
        <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/happiness/hyperthymia.html">
         hyperthymic
        </a>
        " i.e. the hedonic set-point around which their lives oscillate is unusually high compared to the Darwinian norm. Hyperthymic well-being is chronic; yet it's not
        <i>
         uniform
        </i>
        . Thus some days of hyperthymic life are even more wonderful than others; pursuing  their favourite activities makes hyperthymics even happier than otherwise. So again, the hyperthymic emotional compass is bidirectional: its scale is different, but it works.  The relevant contrast here lies in the way hyperthymics are animated by information-signalling gradients of well-being,  whereas

        spectacles. Their central information-processing system is systematically biased. Conversely, hyperthymics  see the rest of us as unreasonably pessimistic. Chronic depressives, on the other hand, may view euthymic and hyperthymic people alike as deluded. Indeed victims of melancholic depression may feel the world itself is hateful and meaningless.  For evolutionary reasons (

         reproductive revolution
        </a>
        of designer babies is imminent. Thanks to  genomic medicine, tomorrows parents will be able to choose the genetic make-up and personality of their  offspring. Critically, parents-to-be will be able to select the emotional dial-settings of their progeny rather than play genetic roulette. In deciding what kind of children to create, tomorrow's parents will (presumably) rarely opt for dysfunctional, depressive and malaise-ridden kids. Quite aside from the

         ethical

       <p>
        The collective outcome of these individual parental genetic choices will be far-reaching.  In the new era of advanced biotechnology and reproductive medicine, a combination of designer drugs, autosomal gene therapies and germline interventions may give rise to a civilisation inhabiting a state-space located  further "north"  emotionally than present-day humans can  imagine or coherently describe. Gradients of heritable, lifelong  bliss may
        <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/object31.htm">
         eventually
        </a>
        become ubiquitous. The worst post-human lows may be far richer than the most sublime of today's peak experiences. Less intuitively, our superwell descendants may be constitutionally
        <a href="http://www.nootropics.com/">
         smarter
        </a>
        as well as happier than unenriched humans. Aided by synthetic enhancement technologies, fine-textured gradients of intense emotional well-being can play an information-signalling role at least as versatile and sophisticated as  gradients of emotional ill-being or pain-sensations today. Simplistically, it may be said that posterity will be "permanently happy". However, this expression can  be a bit misleading. Post-humans are unlikely to be either "blissed out"

        <i>

        well-being at all. This is because both the nasty and simply mediocre side of life could in principle be

        whose attainment makes a compass eventually superfluous is mere conjecture. So too is the nature of life's interim motivational architecture over the next few

        Post-human, post-Darwinian mental health late in the third millennium is likely to be far richer than its impoverished 21st century precursor. Indeed by the standards of our enlightened successors, perhaps malaise-ridden emotional primitives like us will be reckoned in the grip of a toxic affective psychosis. So if, fancifully, your guardian angel offers you a
        <a href="http://www.mdma.net/">

        ,  in some sense, to say no.  Alas the nature of affective psychosis precludes full insight into the condition. Thus one may hesitate to swallow the

        with the nihilistic despair of major depression. In future, a heritably blissful mindset should prove genetically adaptive

        Yet can an information-processing system that runs on gradients of  lifelong bliss really sustain critical insight? In principle, at least, yes. The functional analogues of
        <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/depressive-realism.htm">
         depressive realism
        </a>
        can be sustained without the nasty textures of low mood.  One snappy formulation sometimes used to define "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" target="_blank">
         information
        </a>
        " is "a difference that makes a difference". On this basis, what's important in the context of the information-theoretic paradigm  is not our absolute position on the pleasure-pain axis, but our differential sensitivity to emotionally-tagged variations in fitness-relevant stimuli.  For the foreseeable future,  an emotional compass
        <i>
         will
        </i>
        be needed to guide the psychologically superwell in everyday post-Darwinian Heaven, no less than in contemporary Darwinian
        <a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/resource/index.html">
         purgatory
        </a>
        . The binary coding scheme of a pleasure-pain axis is supremely economical for this navigational purpose. The difference in store for us is that shortly  we'll be in a position to tame its cruelties by truncating the axis at the nasty end and vastly extending its reach at the other. An improved
        <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/hypermotivation.html">
         motivation
        </a>
        system is not just technically feasible. Its hypothetical contours will be kinder to the end-user. Our navigational capabilities  may be vastly improved too.

        Perhaps a fictional analogy isn't amiss here. To complement a notional permanent happiness pill, consider the offer of a pill that induces permanent hilarity. The latter pill isn't (quite) so fantastical as it sounds. In 1998, neuroscientists at the University of California medical school discovered what may be called a "
        <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/intracran/humourcentre.html">
         humour centre
        </a>
        " in the brain, despite unfortunate echoes of
        <a href="http://www.phrenology.com/index.html">
         phrenology
        </a>
        .  The neural basis of
        <a href="http://www.sensualism.com/humour/index.html">
         humour
        </a>
        apparently lies in a tiny region in the left supplementary motor area. If electrically stimulated, then the subject not merely laughs, but finds
        <i>
         everything
        </i>
        irresistibly funny -  just as the
        <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/wirehead.html">
         wirehead
        </a>
        from science fiction finds everything indiscriminately pleasurable. In principle, once the neurological signature of pure humour is identified, then its molecular substrates could be amplified beyond anything natural selection has engineered to date. The amplification might come via pills, neuroelectrodes or genetic modification. Fancifully, one could even imagine a re-engineered civilisation whose inhabitants, by their very nature, found everything hilariously funny. Now intuitively, people who find everything  funny are incapable of critical discernment. They are promiscuously  amused by slapstick farce and terrible puns no less than by sublime literary wit. So if one values one's sophisticated sense of humour, then one might not be tempted by the offer of a pill that would leave one  amused
        <i>
         indiscriminately
        </i>
        - just as one might run fast and run far from the offer of a pill that left one indiscriminately happy. For one wants to act and respond  to a changing environment
        <i>
         appropriately
        </i>
        -  in some admittedly ill-defined sense of "appropriate". But
        <i>
         if
        </i>
        an advanced, humour-valuing  society ever wanted to make life perennially amusing, and yet its members also sought to preserve critical discernment and the quest for ever richer sources of humour, then there is nothing to stop them retaining an information-signalling role of hilarity-
        <i>
         gradients
        </i>
        by simply recalibrating the neurological default-settings of their humour scale. Thus there might arise a post-human civilisation whose gravest concerns were subjectively more hilarious than our funniest moments of comedy.

        Of course, the above example  is grotesque. It's not going to happen, even if it's a neurologically feasible option for test subjects in an experimental laboratory. Certainly, to generalise the possibility of biological humour-enhancement to a whole society is pure science fantasy - to the best of our knowledge, at any rate. Compared to the
        <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/object34.htm">
         urgency
        </a>
        of getting rid of
        <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/object35.htm">
         suffering
        </a>
        , abolishing humourlessness isn't even on our moral radar.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet one shouldn't underestimate the versatility of a biologically well-designed compass. Today, sentient life on Earth runs an informational economy of mind driven by gradients of discontent. Tomorrow, we'll have the option of an informational economy of mind run on gradients of
        <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/object33.htm">
         well-being

        .

       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        So is it wrong to swallow the pill?
