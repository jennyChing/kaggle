              Five years ago, we embarked on a mission to find American companies that truly believe in work-life balance. We sought out successful businesses that allow people to pursue ambitious careers but also spend time with their families, give back to their communities, and fulfill their passion for adventure. And we found them. Lots of them. In 2008, we celebrated 30 in the first list of
              <em>
               Outside
              </em>
              s Best Places to Work. By 2010, so many quality companies applied that we were compelled to name 50. This year our research partner, Best Companies Group, was adamant: there were 100 amazing applicants that deserved recognition. And we agreed.

              On paper its just another desk job:  spreadsheets, data entry, phone calls with clients. But it sure doesnt  feel that way. Employees shout weekend plans over the cubicle walls as  dogs roam the office. An always stocked bar fuels Friday-afternoon  Ping-Pong sessions in the lounge. Effectiveness and success count,  says general manager Rick Guthke. But schedules can fluctuate, and  folks take advantage of slower seasons.

Before and after classes,  Seeley teachers bike or cross-country ski on the groomed trails that  surround the school and help run the Adventure Club, a program that  takes kids biking, hiking, skiing, and fishing. Staff also participate  in community-building projects like the Blackfoot Challenge, which  promotes outdoor education in the Blackfoot River watershed.

              Work attire is casual and based on whether the days activity is a presentation to a watershed committee, or a field excursion wading rivers and taking scientific measurements. During the short, Pacific Northwest summer field season, the field days are typically long and office days are few and far between. Flex hours are generally redeemed during the winter months when winter activities rule. Employees are encouraged to break up the day with a trip to the gym, mountain bike ride, or a few ski runs on a powder day.

              Its a typical office, meaning plenty of time in front of the computer, but its also a small office with many long-term employees, meaning familial, often jovial working relationships. Long hours serving clients are offset by extremely flexible hours during the slower times of the month; its not uncommon for employees to schedule haircuts, doctors appointments, or workout in the onsite gym during business hours.

Employees work hard, but they also self-manage their schedule, taking breaks to go hiking or run the dog and coming in late if theres fresh powder on the mountain. Fridays often include jam sessions, where the team rallies around a few drinks to come up with new ideas. You can also catch the staff performing renditions of Bob Marley and the Grateful Dead during late hours in their vent room, a studio with a full drum kit, amps, and guitars.
