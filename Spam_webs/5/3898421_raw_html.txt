          An old drinking buddy of mine overdosed on heroin recently. He moved out to the Pacific Northwest to skate or die, and wound up doing both, joining

          who go out that way every day. I hadnt seen or thought about him in years, but by coincidence, I was in town when he passed. A mutual friend told me there would be a memorial at a local skate park. I stopped by to pay my respects.

          I found a bundle of droopy balloons hovering over beer can tabs, a condom wrapper, and a melted candle. Mourners had written dedications all over the squeaky balloon skins. One was signed in Runes. It read (with no corrections):
         </p>
         <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
          <em>
           They will except
          </em>
          <br/>
          <em>
           you in the Hall of Valla
          </em>
          <br/>
          <em>
           you died during battle
          </em>
          <br/>
          <em>
           I shal try to avenge you!
          </em>
         </p>
         <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
          
         </p>
         <p>
          I can only assume that by Hall of Valla, this grammatically challenged Viking meant Valhalla: the otherworldly Nordic kingdom reserved for warriors who die fighting. As my sadness subsided, the irony hit me like a dwarf wielding a war-hammer. No misspelled romanticism could change the fact that the deceasedlike so many other people in my lifehad died on the battlefield of the soul, where he surrendered to his own weakness.

          Addiction is not a disease; its a symptom of a faltering will. Waning willpower stems from a lack of purpose and self-discipline. Pop psychiatrists say otherwise, but to blame an individuals choice on faulty genes or warped neural pathways is to say the car drove itself off the bridge. Some vehicles are easier to steer than others, but responsibility is on the one behind the wheel.

          Incidentally, it was an addict who taught me how to drive. At fourteen I was chauffeuring my best friends mother into housing projects to score arm-dope. She wound up living with Hep C for nearly two decades, only to die from sepsis last year. Her funeral had me in tears, mostly for her son, who lives as a prisoner to methadone. The key is within his grasp, but he refuses to unlock the cell door his mother slammed in his face.

          So goes the mythos of the American underbelly. Lou Reed fizzles out to great fanfare. Reporters find Philip Seymour Hoffman buried under seventy bags of heroin. Musicians celebrate Kurt Cobains induction into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame after the 20th Anniversary of his smacked out suicide. Segue into depressing statistics.

          For three generations now, millions of our would-be warriors have waged war upon themselves. Strong young men lay down their lives to destroy God and country rather than defend them. Their sense of honor has decayed to the point that even love of family isnt worth persevering for. Its as though theyve been taught to see themselves as the enemy.

          Ive been close to so many drug-users, there is an archetypal addict nodding out against my hippocampus. Every now and then this Jungian junkie wakes up to ask me for a favor. Again and again, Ive carried my drug-addled comrades up the steep incline, only to watch them lay down and roll back to the bottom. Its like being stabbed with a thousand dirty needles and having all the sympathy sucked out of me.

              Whether or not you believe its a disease or not its more than just a battle of willpower, although thats part of. These people along with ones addicted to alcohol or any other drug are suffering from a sickness of the mind, body, and soul. They are still humans with dreams and ambitions and emotions and fears and family and friends and children. So instead of demonizing them or kicking them while they are down or throwing them in jail for possesion like that will help, we need to help them and get away from this terrible stigma society has placed on addiction.

                I think there should be a stigma. Otherwise why not just be a pathetic fuck living on welfare and taking the bus into town everyday to get your methadone fix? You think there should be more of that then there already is?

                  i clearly meant change the stigma not that there should not be one at all. Most of the societal problems are from thr drug being illegal in the first place. In other countries they actually give out dose regulated and test heroin and clean needles to addicts for free. It eliminates crime from it becasue they arnt stealing or robbing to get their fix and it eliminates the possible transmission of diseases because they get clean needles. Also I said increase education on it. Makingit legal doesnt mean anyone with common sense and proper knowledge on the effects of it are going to run out in masses and start shooting up. PROHIBITION DOES NOT WORK AND DOES NOT KEEP PEOPLE FROM DOING SOMETHING.

                    I dont think that. I am just saying I think its wrong to consider heroin addiction a disease worthy of disability benefits connected with a life long treatment of methadone. So what do you think?

                      I agree I dont think it should be worthy of life long disability and I dont agree at all with methadone treatment. Methadone has worse and longer drawn out withdrawals than heroin does it is even harder to quit many times than heroin Is.

                      Growing poppies and producing heroin is relatively cheap espeically in comparison to the theft and robbery costs of addicts. So I think it would be worth looking into giving them for free like some countries are experimenting on. But lets be real like you said earlier CIA controls the drug trade and them and big pharmaceutical companies dont want to help addicts so I dont see it it happening in the US.

                  I feel like the stigma against drug use that western civilization holds is partly to blame, but I dont necessarily think legalization of all drugs would help.  Among the addicts that I have known and loved, the stigma feeds into the belief that using that drug (or any drug) gives the user some gravitas amongst the counter culture.  You are considered hardcore if you use hard drugs like heroin or meth.  In many criminal organizations, it is seen (falsely) as a test to prove that you are down for the cause.  It is amazing to me how any group can consider someone trustworthy once they have enslaved themselves to a chemical.  It does make that person easier to control, but that means they are also easier for others to control, and dont think the police havent figured that out and found ways to use that.

                    I have a family history of addiction. My Dad just passed away. He was an extremely strong willed person. He smoked for a few years and then quit for the rest of his life. He never had any other addictions, but I have no doubt he had the genetic predispositions.  I think there is something to the premise of this article. Free will counts. Its a force to be reckoned with. I hear lots of sob stories, but you know, some people make it despite the odds. Its not luck. Some people choose to succeed others dont.

                      Anyway, My Dad has gone around and around with some of my cousins, and nieces and nephews, about his alcoholic Father and Stepfather and how he chose not to follow in their footsteps, but in most cases it didnt work. Its not anything you can just say to somebody. Everyone has to make their own choices. So to me it comes down to personal responsibility.

                      From what I have witnessed, willpower is a very complicated mechanism and a big part of it involves psychological warfare with yourself.  There is also the fear, at least for opioid users, of the dope sickness.  People do die from withdrawals, and it does feel like you are going to die, so it takes a huge amount of willpower to take the leap.  I tried to quit drinking for years, then one day, I got tired of cleaning up the mess the drunk asshole I was the night before left, and dropped it cold turkey.  I have family history of addiction (biological father that was a heroin addict) but I dont think that means that I got the genes for addiction from him- its like any other gene, sometimes you get the blue eyes, sometimes you dont.

                      In 200 level psych classes, they take a rat and insert electrodes into its pleasure center.  If the hit is good, that rat will push the bar which gives him a pleasurable jolt to his basal ganglia (specifically the nucleus accumbens), sometimes until he dies of exhaustion. We arent rats but we are animals and respond in many of the same ways to certain stimuli. No one knows why some people succumb and others dont but it would be my guess that like you wrote, its not as simplistic as a weak will.

                      People do die from alcohol withdrawal; people dont usually die from heroin withdrawalthey just wish they would.  Its horrible.  I used to work in a treatment center where we would have to document withdrawal before accepting addicts into the methadone program and it was horrible-tragic to witness. One guy slit his wrists. I didnt work there very longI couldnt take the level of human misery which I was unable to keep separate from my own.

                      I agree. The frustration enters with the realization that maybe (even though they may not be entirely conscious of the fact) that person has willed their own destruction, but one must temper that frustration with compassion or risk losing humanity. Will accumulates in purpose. If one has no direction to apply the will, nothing to love, drugs can fill that space.

                    Prohibition does not work, EVER. Ask any high schooler how easy to get drugs it is for them and shit I only smoke weed sometimes and I could get heroin probably with a couple phone calls and few hours time. That doesnt mean im going to go running out and get it. Just like if it became legal people are not gonna be running out in masses to use drugs anymore than they already are.
                    <br/>
                    Obviously there is something besides the fact that its illegal that stops 99% of people from doing it. The fact that its illegal doesnt even scratch the addiction rate because addiction is far more powerful than giving two shits about what some man made law says.

                   <p>
                    Also as for your argument about people doing drugs to seem hardcore or accepted into some gang that is maybe a small minority at most of drug users. Not one I have ever met and I have met a lot has ever said they tried heroin to try and be hardcore.

                      Im more in favor of the type of proscription that you see with tobacco now.  Not really a prohibition, as it is a public campaign against it.  limiting usage locales and accessibility, as well as social stigmatization of it.  Of course, its hard for any prohibition to work when the govt. is the one shipping and selling it.

                      You wont hear me argue for the kind of prohibition that the government enforces-especially since the government is one of the prime dealers.  On the other hand, tobacco smoking has been on the decline for a while now, and it is certainly taken a dive in public opinion.  Drugs like heroin and meth will never be as publicly accepted as smoking is/was, so I doubt that we will see numbers of users go up if everything is legalized, but you will see an increase.  Your own argument that drug addicts dont care about man made laws shows that addicts are, at the very least in the beginning, placing themselves outside of the law intentionally.  I really doubt anyone in the history of drug abuse will ever cop to doing a drug to fit in, but surely you cant argue that fitting into a group is a prime cause of initial drug use.  That shit is put into your hands, you dont seek it out that first time.  Heroin is absolutely a counter-culture drug, in the extreme, and people doing it know full well that the majority of society are not going to accept them after they use it, but as long as they feel like they have some support among the other users, they feel comfortable enough to use it that first time.  After that, the addiction takes over and its another story.

                      Actually, the first time I went looking for street drugs, it was to score H.  I was largely socially isolated at the time, though I was encouraged to this course of action by an associate.  Nevertheless, I initiated the discussion and completed the transaction.

                      Two things, I think, ultimately saved me:
                      <br/>
                      1)  I dont do needles.  Not a line I will cross.
                      <br/>
                      2)  I did a

                       terrible

                      job with set and setting.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Looking back, Im actually amazed it didnt turn out drastically worse.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Perhaps this is what is meant by those who have said to me that I am too smart for my own good.  Alternately, perhaps I am the fool spoken of as receiving Gods protection, along with children and starships named
                      <i>
                       Enterprise

                      .  Possibly both.

                      That said, I am well acquainted with addiction as a multi-generational affliction on at least one side of the family.  In those instances, it was alcohol, but I know a dragon when I see one.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It is interesting to note so much conversation about addiction confined largely to a subset of behaviour related to the ingestion of a substance.  Me, Id say anything above and beyond what is required for homeostasis that cannot be dropped without a second thought and/or consequence is symptomatic of possible addiction.

                      Cannabis is another tricky one.  My peers in high school would not supply me with pot and I didnt really care enough to press the issue.  It was a family member that finally put it in my hands.  And frankly, the first half-dozen times or so I smoked, I didnt see what the big deal was.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And then there was the time the light-switch flipped
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So make of this what you will, but I tend to regard psychological pot addiction as something of a harmful meme perpetrated by stigmatization and compounded by prohibition.  I will readily testify there is no physical addiction to the plant or basic concentrates; the jury remains out on bubble hash and the other shit theyre blasting out there now.  By some standards, my cannabis usage could be considered psychological addiction.  However, I am a fairly honest self-reporter and Ive never had a professional tell me to seek help; btw: god bless Prop. 215.

                     <p>
                      Until the last year, my cannabis use has fluctuated from between several times a day x daily to long stretches of no use whatsoever; in the prior three years, Id made two eighths, separately purchased, last with leftovers.  Then I figured, what the fuck, why not get my doctors note; my GP would have given it to me if he didnt fear professional consequences.  So I started upping my dose, experimenting with strains, edibles, concentrates, and all the other things I could only pray to find on the black market.  If the initial high lasts 2-3 hours and effects linger for 6-8, I have been high and (surprisingly) functional for at least six months.  And it keeps me from popping too many lab-created, pharmacy-approved analgesics to combat the chronic pain that I experience on a daily basis.

The period of mental prayer is to begin with intense concentration on a scene of Christs passion; then the mind is, as it were, to abolish this imagination of the sacred humanity and to pass from it to the formless and attributeless Godhead which that humanity incarnates.

                       As a final summing up of the whole matter we may cite a sentence of Eckharts. He who seeks God under settled form lays hold of the form, while missing the God concealed in it. Here, the key word is settled. It is permissible to seek God provisionally under a form which is from the first recognized as merely a symbol of Reality, and a symbol which must sooner or later be discarded in favour of what it stands for. To seek Him under a settled formsettled because regarded as the very shape of Realityis to commit oneself to illusion and a kind of idolatry.

                      The Passion is kind of a harsh buzz, even at its most useful.  And I will admit to it being useful for a brief moment.  I experience far fewer side effects from Mama Cannabis though.  I feel lighter and less delusional too.

                      If we can get medical Shrooms and medical MDMA approved next, Im pretty sure I can finally learn to adjust to this fucked up plane of existence and achieve some semblance of normal homeostasis.

                      Yes I agree and know the government brings drugs onto this country. Either way the prohibition wont work because even if the government wasnt doing it someone else would. Heroin is derived from morphine which comes from a plant. Its not that hard to grow poppies. Also look how well prohibition of alcohol worked, instead of being regulated you had the mob and people in their bathtubs making boot leg alcohol that would sometimes blind or kill people. Anyways point is people are gonna do it no matter what the law says.

                      As for the tobacco reference the only reason it was ever as popular as it was is the tobacco companies and their paid off staff of physicians launched mass propaganda campaign and convinced people it wasnt bad for you and that it was the cool thing to do. I never said legalize drugs and try to lie to people about their physical, mental, and social consequences. I say legalize them amd regulate them and increase treatment options and funding and increase education on their effects and on addiction and abuse.

                      I agree about the first time using being more of a peer pressure or whatever thing but its not always especially now a days. I know of many people who were legally prescribed narcotic pain killers for a injury and got addicted to them and their presciption ended and they started getting them illegally and then switched to heroin because it is much cheaper so dont make assumptions that they all initially decided to break the law and go out and get it their first time. And after addicted then yes absolutely the law or anyone else including their kids or family or husband/wife will always come second to the addiction because it is basically a mind control.

                      Yep and doctors arnt alone in the blame though the pharmaceutical companies flat out lie to doctors about the side effects of many of their drugs.

                     <p>
                      You should look up the history of OxyContin which is brand name of oxycodone made by Purdue Pharmcuitcals. They knowingly misled doctors for years about the extreme potential for abuse and developing addiction. They have since been sued for close to aa billion dollars worldwide but this doesnt even come close to the profits they made or make up for the lives they helped destroy.

              Yeah, I tend to think addicts are weak. I mean its harsh and blunt, but its a reality. But everyone has weaknesses and everyone needs support from other people in order to thrive. No Man is an island. Still though its pretty fucking pathetic to be a zombie serving a dealer like slave master. I think more people should call it like they see it.

                Even though  I agree, any addiction is through a state of weakness and powerlessness. Telling them this is only going to feed into their reasons for addiction. Its something the person needs to come to grips with, before they can move forward. Otherwise they are stuck hurting themselves and everyone else.

                    No not really but you obviously are quick to judge and also quick to act like you are not doing something yourself. The CIA has many sources of income besides drug trade so dont be so naive as to think you are exempt.

                  I am a functioning addict. Without getting all self grandios, let me just say that i have created a reality around me that i am very happy with at 37. I do not let others fool me into self pity, or allow myself to feel any agitation from alienation. I am not careless with where i deposit used works, or do it in others homes, habits hand in hand with habits. I love opiates. They were the first Cultivated plant the modern humans husbanded, and life and mortality is far easier to cope with when i have a steady diet of opiates. I do not sit around Blasted all day. I do things, and am active, and when the time is right, i will do a nice amount and enjoy it. I cannot speak for all others, but in reality, there are many many functioning members of society that are full blown addicts. Its all about PERSPECTIVE and HARM REDUCTION.

                &gt;If neuroplasticity worked by act of will wed all be superhumanly intelligent and healthy.

               <p>
                Id like to explore this concept further. Also in connection, I think the word will is getting bandied around interchangeably in the thread with willpower which I see as two different applications of force with their own subtleties of use.
                <br/>
                Will is desire, motivation. Willpower is the ability to resist an urge. Having these two forces at odds with each other is a prime method for self-sabotage, and is at the heart of the matter of self-determination.
                <br/>
                Then there are many delicacies of the situation, involving the interaction of the chemicals of the brain with that of the drug affecting these twin blade forces which is the matter of automation.
                <br/>
                At no time are we wholly automaton, or wholly self-determined. To try to believe in the purity of either is only sure to invite disappointment and failure.
                <br/>
                I think its better to view these elements as connecting points in sets of overlapping matrices. This I find also accepts the existence of various mysterious forces we are in sway of but cannot currently recognise.
                <br/>
                Reflecting on my own attempts at willed periods of neuroplasticity I can identify that will and willpower are but a choice pair out of many components, most of which I only have a vague intuition of, a dim awareness at best.
                <br/>
                Hell, I read Robert Anton Wilsons Prometheus Rising in my late teens so I can only guess at how much of the groundwork he laid down for me, which isnt really a matter of will or willpower as much as gullibility and bare-faced innocence.

              And just as tragic/infuriating is our countrys illegalization of what has proven to be one of the best treatment options for this presumably incurable addiction  ibogaine (a Schedule I psychedelic).  It also doesnt require perpetual usage for maintenance (like methadone), it is effective after only one dose (ideally under proper guidance and in a safe and secure set and setting).
             </p>
             <p>
              For those who are unfamiliar, here is a brief introduction to it:

             <p>
              And here is a somewhat recent article (2013) featuring another addicts account detailing their experience with a small clinical trial that took place in Baja California, Mexico:

               Of the 29 others who took part in the trial, none are now reported as having problematic drug use. Two years after that one dose of ibogaine, I abstain from all drugs. Given the chance of relief from the physical and psychological dependence, I am free to make conscious choices again. We dont yet know how effective this treatment would be in others, but the change in my life is startling.

             </p>
             <p>
              I also recommend checking out the gut-wrenching documentary Detox or Die (produced by the BBC) about one filmmakers own journey with addiction (heroin to methadone), and  in a last ditch effort  his decision to give ibogaine a shot.  Here is the point in the documentary when he gets treated:

              The filmmaker has been clean ever since (10+ years), and has actually dedicated his life to advocating for making ibogaine a viable treatment option.
             </p>
             <p>
              Treatment centers are currently available in Mexico and Canada, but  while those who run the clinics go through great efforts to provide a safe and secure setting/atmosphere for their sessions and post-care  Im not sure if they are all regulated.  Which is all the more reason to raise awareness, to help encourage our own country to provide a safe, secure, and professional set and setting for those undergoing treatment.  Mind you, this has been known since the 90s, with small clinical trials  along with those who have sought out personal treatment  demonstrating its efficacy (along with thousands of years of therapeutic and ceremonial use among indigenous African tribes).  Check out the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) for more info:

              This isnt to say its an easy peasy, one-and-done magic bullet, but  given its incredible results  it could be a game-changer.  Might not benefit the bottom-line of drug makers/pharmaceutical companies, but it will benefit people.  Yes, a strong support system will likely remain necessary, and former addicts may very well have their good and bad days, but  as far as starting them off on the right foot and solid ground  ibogaine may be the best medicine available (treating mind, body, and soul).

              I dont think addiction is technically a disease either, and while I dont think addicts are biochemical automatons with no control over their destiny, I do believe they all deserve the utmost care and decency offered to them, whether they decide to take it or not.
             </p>
             <p>
              I too have seen far too many people vaporized at the end of a needle and if anything, every time it happens, it only reinforces my belief that addiction, whether a disease or not, is a terrible affliction, worse than any beast Lovecraft ever came up with. Lots of good people have gone the way of the dodo, yes, partially out of weakness, but I suppose its not my place to judge, only to offer a hand that unfortunately isnt accepted as often as I would like.

              The big H is the line i never crossed in my wayward youth.  I tried every other recreational substance available, but never was really tempted to push that button.  I know some awesome people in recovery from substance abuse, and I agree that willpower is involved actively in recovery:  Its a constant decision.  People who go clean have to keep making that choice every day.  But were human.  We fall down sometimes.  Im angry at my friends that lost their lives young due to bad decisions, but love them too much to judge.

              The harm reduction strategy is a very real tool to minimize the social cost of opiate addiction.  Medically supervised shooting galleries in civilized lands including Northern Europe radically improve the life expectancy and health of addicts.  Junkies with steady access to clean product are capable of leading long and productive lives.  WS Burroughs was no saint, but he was actively involved in creative work that defined an important part of the 20th century counterculture.

              So there are some street people around where I live. There are also meth addicts around that may or may not be homeless. I was homeless, so i know the drill. There is no reason to be stinky dirty and hungry. Food banks, food stamps, soup lines, free clothes, socks, underwear, day labor  etc.

              So really, if you want to, assuming you arent developmentally disabled, or mentally ill, you can be healthy. Yet, here are people with unkempt hair, missing teeth, filthy clothes, begging for spare change.  In the midst of all these people who are thriving.

              Why is it? In the wild, things dont get as sick as these people who linger on like this for years. Things get too sick and they either get better or they die. Animals may have scars or even missing limbs, but they arent wandering around in their own filth. They groom themselves.

                The first thing I wrote was that that piece had its merit. I didnt discredit any of his experiences. Though, now that you brought that up, I cant help but address that issue now. You give him credibility because he grew up around addiction, which is reasonable, but I grew up around addiction too, so by that logic, my credibility should stand too. That, and the fact that Im a recovering addict.
               </p>
               <p>
                I cant agree with the view that addiction is not a disease, specially coming from the author. The authors view is clearly subjective, you talk about credibility but how does his credibility stand against the credibility of psychiatrists, neurologists, and geneticists who have spent years studying and analyzing drug addiction? These people performed studies and surveys on drug addicts for years, objectively, in order to obtain empirical evidence and measurement.
               </p>
               <p>
                Ive read your comments, and I agree with you that its a choice to do drugs, and its a choice to kick the habit, both decisions come from moments of weakness and strength. Its so easy to fall into addiction, its way harder to get out of it. But you cant fault them for not seeking help immediately because its not easy to admit youre an addict. Its not easy to deal with the guilt and the shame. Even after they seek help theres still a stigma, recovering addicts are always under suspicion and face constant roadblocks. Its hard to admit youre a former drug addict when theres a powerful stigma against drug addiction that prevents a recovering addict from achieving life goals sometimes. Add to that the fact that government spends way more money blaming, punishing, and making moral judgments than on treatment and prevention. Its an insanely hard uphill battle on a muddy hill where you find yourself powerless most of the time, you can easily let yourself fall and theres people who dont wanna let you get up there and are trying to push you down.

                    I took the time to read through all of them except the last one. Sharon Begley and Marc Lewis didnt really state that addiction is solely a choice and not a disease. Begley had this to say: the short answer is I did not come across any research in that. But it makes sense, because there has been so much research that has documented where in the brain, you know, whether its a problem with the dopamine system, where in the brain addiction seems to take hold. So again, its a matter of you identify whats wrong in the brain and then figure out the input that can, you know, turn it back. Lewis ultimately had this to say: So, calling addiction a choice, which implies conscious intention and rationality, is as wrong as calling it a disease.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The articles werent about dismissing drug addiction as a disease but about new treatments in therapy and rehabilitation. Its not really about it being a choice or a disease, its both really. A drug addict can quit cold turkey without the aid of medical or psychological help but his body will still suffer from withdrawals and in severe cases, die from the symptoms. After you become addicted you cant just simply choose to not be addicted, you have a chemical and psychological dependency, your body and mind suffer from anxiety, irritability, fatigue, sweating, vomiting, insomnia, headaches, and nausea. Kicking the habit is just more than just not taking drugs anymore, its a complete life overhaul and can sometimes take years. There are triggers everywhere and one can easily relapse even after treatment.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Drug addiction has been treated as a choice all these years, landing non-violent people in jail, overcrowding jails, creating career criminals, creating more drug addicts. There is an alarming number of former inmates who become addicted in jail or after being released, and overdosing right after. By treating it as a disease instead of a crime, there could be less addiction and fatalities, and incidentally less crime. But like Ive said numerous times, the stigma is there, and it hurts an addicts path to recovery more than it helps.

                      I provided both the NYT and the NPR pieces as evidence that there is significant research being done on the efficacy of intentional manipulation of brain plasticity. You cherry-picked statements from the Lewis article. Yes, his thesis is different than mineif it were otherwise, I would have just posted a link to his article instead of writing my own.

                      Lewis also says:

                       The disease model of addiction seems to ignore the contemporary emphasis on neuroplasticity, the brains changeabilitythe statistics indicate that many, perhaps most, addicts recover without treatment of any kind.

                      I didnt ignore what Lewis said, in fact I stated that A drug addict can quit cold turkey without the aid of medical or psychological help, which is basically what you just quoted from Lewis sans the neuroplasticity argument. I never in any way disagreed with his research or any of the research done in those articles you posted. I in fact, I found them compelling and was open to their ideas and welcomed them, anything that helps an addict overcome their addiction, Ill be open to. Like I stated before, the articles just show another aspect on how to treat addiction, they never fully suggest that its solely a choice. It seems you just want to read Addiction is a choice. There are many factors involved in it being a choice. In fact, just go back to Lewis article and read through the comments, there are many discussing this.

                      Why did you automatically assume I was twisting your argument when talking about drug criminalization? You even quoted me before and agreed that the war on drugs is a lost cause, and I was just expanding on that in the last post I made. Thats what happens in a discussion, it grows out of its original point, so dont take it personally. I feel like youre treating this as a debate when it really isnt. I already compromised for the sake of discussion. So please dont accuse me of cherry-picking and twisting your argument, Im not trying to win a debate, Im simply having a discussion. I too want less addiction.

                      You suggested that the idea of choice leads to stigma, and stigma leads to criminalization and ostracism, therefore to label addiction as a consequence of choice leads to criminalization and ostracism. This is true to some extent, but I dont believe that criminalization is a necessary consequence of personal responsibility.

              This is an odd little piece. Once I started treating my bipolar and seizure disorders (which I didnt know I had for years) I found that I no longer craved Opiates. I totally got off of them and that was that. 50 dollar a day heroin problem over. When I think back to who I knew that did that drug with me or I knew from around the way I suspect that about 50% of them had some kind of Bipolar disorder too! We all exhibited the same behaviors and attitudes. The other 50% just had horrible lives and were looking for relief. If health care is available to all and drug counseling (NOT AA TYPE PROGRAMS) stay on top of helping people I could see this epidemic being reduced to almost nothing.

              I have to agree with you.
              <br/>
              When you think about it, its kind of a wonder that more people arent going completely off the rails, be it with addictions of one kind or another, or in other destructive ways.
              <br/>
              Our society is FUCKED UP and it produces fucked up people.
              <br/>
              This is not to suggest that people dont have choices and agency, they absolutely do. Its simply a recognition that this shit (early 21st capitalism) has the potential to totally fuck you up. The stress alone is enough to drive otherwise  healthy people into addictions and various other destructive behaviors.

              Joseph Allen is just a contributor. He doesnt have the power to delete comments. I do, but Ive not deleted any comments from you. This one  the one Im replying to  was caught in the pending folder for about 13 minutes. I happened to drop back in to check Disqus before heading to bed. I saw it and approved it. Since you mentioned a deleted comment, I searched all folders by your IP and could find nothing else. If there was a comment then there must have been something else that happened that kept it from reaching the site. See the screen grab of the pending folder. The second shot is from me searching all folders by your IP, which Ive obviously not shown here for your security and privacy.

              I was an opium poppy tea addict for 4 years.  Its a powerful plant to be sure, but my quality of life was not negatively affected in any way by my use of it.  Perhaps thats because it was dirt cheap and readily available without the need for shady dealers, unlike heroin.

              If less harmful drugs were legalized and controlled like alcohol and tobacco, fewer people would be jacking potent concoctions into their arms and dying from overdose.  Just a theory.

              Addiction is not a disease; its a symptom of a faltering will. Waning

              willpower stems from a lack of purpose and self-discipline.

              Ive been fortunate enough to avoid serious drug addiction, in part because Ive managed, even at my lowest points, not to lose sight of the bigger picture and put myself in a position to have one. I have, on a couple of occasions, skated a bit closer to alcoholism than anyone likely should, Ive also been a habitual tobacco user for two periods of time. I have no idea how I actually avoided the former, and the latter Ive been able to kick with relative ease on both occasions. There but for the grace of God go I.

              I have also fought with depression since I was a teenager, at least 15 years now. It may have started earlier, but that is the earliest time where my memory is clear enough to be sure. I describe depression as very much both a disease and a symptom of a faltering will; stemming from and contributing to a lack of purpose and self-discipline. Sometimes I can keep it in check, keep going forward, ignore the part of me that just wants to lie down and wallow. Sometimes I cant. Unfortunately, once Ive started to lose myself, it becomes progressively harder to fight back against it, thats just the nature of the beast.

                I dont disagree with you in general, but I think its still important to make distinctions on the intensity and duration that make up a depressive episode.  The last diagnosis I received was Severe Case of Major Depression.  My sample size is small, but good psychiatrists/psychologists tend to register at least some kind ofshockwhen such a case walks through their door.  This leads me to believe that those of us that can describe depression in terms of a personal long-term experience have, at best, a skewed perspective on the experience itself.
               </p>
               <p>
                One point of medical advice Ive received several times now is that I may never be able to live depression-free without some sort of medication.  Well to say I have issues with both the  implications and potential consequences of that type of prescription would be vastly understating things.  However in light of the present discussion, does implementation of this then become an addiction?  No pill has ever registered as homeostasis to me
