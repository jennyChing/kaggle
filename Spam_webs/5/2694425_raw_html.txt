            James Doerfling has made a name for himself as a mountain biker who knows how to handle real mountains. Growing up in Williams Lake, British Columbia he came to know the forests and mountains around him through biking and hunting better than most people know their own backyards. Now James is taking us back to some of his old haunts around Williams Lake and Farwell Canyon to show us the most majestic trails and ridge lines. James make them all look like a Sunday afternoon jaunt, but we have a feeling they are anything but.

            Kamloop's Dylan Sherrard is a genuinely all-around friendly character, fierce owl buff and one hell of a mountain biker. The Kona team rider has lived in one of the most famous biking destinations for the past 6 years, and really can't see himself doing anything other than riding on two wheels. In 'Longevity,' Dylan takes a step back and shares his humble view of how he sees his current lifestyle and presents an abstract vision of where he sees himself in the future. Oh, and he absolutely rips on his mountain bikes.

            Red Bull Rampage is one of the toughest physical downhill mountain bike events on the planet. We looked into our archives and found the roughest and hardest crashes from past events. Josh Bender, Lance Canfield, Garrett Buehler and Cam McCaul show us how difficult and physical Red Bull Rampage really is.
