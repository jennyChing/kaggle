  This past Friday the 13th was my dad's birthday. I posted his

  in honor of him, and I tried out a new cocktail recipe for us to enjoy while we celebrated!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It was actually my mom's idea to make a cocktail, and she mentioned they had rum. I knew her garden was being overtaken with mint, so I searched online for a rum/mint drink. I found a watermelon rum punch recipe, which looked easy enough for my low level of cocktail making skills, and all we needed was watermelon! Off to the store she went.

  I cut up the watermelon, which was actually a difficult task. Does anyone have any good tips for cubing watermelon? We decided to add 2 peaches at the last minute, because my mom wasn't going to do anything else with them, and blended watermelon, peaches, ice, and mint in her blender.

  The rum punch looked prettier than it tasted. It didn't have much of a distinct flavor, and one of my taste testers said it had too much mint. However, it was refreshing. And it hid the rum VERY well. I also thought the texture was a little off, but no one else said anything about it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No "wow" factor, but it was refreshing enough to finish off. I actually think this recipe has potential, and, I would love to experiment making it incredible. My
