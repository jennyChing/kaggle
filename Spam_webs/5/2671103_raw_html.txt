           How Rich People Think,
          </a>
           spent nearly three decades interviewing millionaires around the world to find out what separates them from everyone else.It had little to do with money itself, he toldBusiness Insider. It was about their mentality.[The middle class] tells people to be happy with what they have, he said. And on the whole, most people are steeped in fear when it comes to money.

         <p>
          The average person has been brainwashed to believe rich people are lucky or dishonest, Siebold writes. Thats why theres a certain shame that comes along with getting rich in lower-income communities. The world class knows that while having money doesnt guarantee happiness, it does make your life easier and more enjoyable.

         <p>
          The rich go out there and try to make themselves happy. They dont try to pretend to save the world, Siebold told Business Insider. The problem is that middle class people see that as a negativeand its keeping them poor, he writes. If youre not taking care of you, youre not in a position to help anyone else. You cant give what you dont have.

          While the masses are waiting to pick the right numbers and praying for prosperity, the great ones are solving problems, Siebold writes. The hero [middle class people] are waiting for may be God, government, their boss or their spouse. Its the average persons level of thinking that breeds this approach to life and living while the clock keeps ticking away.

         </h4>
         <p>
          Many world-class performers have little formal education, and have amassed their wealth through the acquisition and subsequent sale of specific knowledge, he writes. Meanwhile, the masses are convinced that masters degrees and doctorates are the way to wealth, mostly because they are trapped in the linear line of thought that holds them back from higher levels of consciousnessThe wealthy arent interested in the means, only the end.

         <p>
          Self-made millionaires get rich because theyre willing to bet on themselves and project their dreams, goals and ideas into an unknown future, Siebold writes. People who believe their best days are behind them rarely get rich, and often struggle with unhappiness and depression.

         <p>
          An ordinarily smart, well-educated and otherwise successful person can be instantly transformed into a fear-based, scarcity driven thinker whose greatest financial aspiration is to retire comfortably, he writes. The world class sees money for what it is and what its not, through the eyes of logic. The great ones know money is a critical tool that presents options and opportunities.

         </h4>
         <p>
          To the average person, it looks like the rich are working all the time, Siebold says. But one of the smartest strategies of the world class is doing what they love and finding a way to get paid for it.On the other hand, middle class take jobs they dont enjoy because they need the money and theyve been trained in school and conditioned by society to live in a linear thinking world that equates earning money with physical or mental effort.

         </h4>
         <p>
          Psychologists and other mental health experts often advise people to set low expectations for their life to ensure they are not disappointed, Siebold writes. No one would ever strike it rich and live their dreams without huge expectations.

         <p>
          Thats why people like Donald Trump go from millionaire to nine billion dollars in debt and come back richer than ever, he writes. While the masses are fixated on the doing and the immediate results of their actions, the great ones are learning and growing from every experience, whether its a success or a failure, knowing their true reward is becoming a human success machine that eventually produces outstanding results.

          Linear thought might tell people to make money in order to earn more, but Siebold says the rich arent afraid to fund their future from other peoples pockets.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rich people know not being solvent enough to personally afford something is not relevant. The real question is, Is this worth buying, investing in, or pursuing?' he writes.

         <p>
          Investing successfully in the stock market isnt just about a fancy math formula. The rich know that the primary emotions that drive financial markets are fear and greed, and they factor this into all trades and trends they observe, Siebold writes. This knowledge of human nature and its overlapping impact on trading give them strategic advantage in building greater wealth through leverage.

          Heres how to live below your means and tap into the secret wealthy people have used for centuries: Get rich so you can afford to, he writes. The rich live below their means, not because theyre so savvy, but because they make so much money that they can afford to live like royalty while still having a kings ransom socked away for the future.

         <p>
          Rich parents teach their kids from an early age about the world of haves and have-nots, Siebold says. Even he admits many people have argued that hes supporting the idea of elitism. He disagrees. [People] say parents are teaching their kids to look down on the masses because theyre poor. This isnt true, he writes. What theyre teaching their kids is to see the world through the eyes of objective realitythe way society really is. If children understand wealth early on, theyll be more likely to strive for it later in life.

          Average people let money stress them out. Rich people find peace of mind in wealth.
         </h4>
         <p>
          The reason wealthy people earn more wealth is that theyre not afraid to admit that money can solve most problems, Siebold says. [The middle class] sees money as a never-ending necessary evil that must be endured as part of life. The world class sees money as the great liberator, and with enough of it, they are able to purchase financial peace of mind.

         <p>
          While the rich dont put much stock in furthering wealth through formal education, they appreciate the power of learning long after college is over, Siebold says. Walk into a wealthy persons home and one of the first things youll see is an extensive library of books theyve used to educate themselves on how to become more successful, he writes. The middle class reads novels, tabloids and entertainment magazines.

         <p>
          The negative money mentality poisoning the middle class is what keeps the rich hanging out with the rich, he says. [Rich people] cant afford the messages of doom and gloom, he writes. This is often misinterpreted by the masses as snobbery. Labeling the world class as snobs is another way the middle class finds to feel better bout themselves and their chosen path of mediocrity.

         <p>
          Siebold theorizes that the wealthy focus on what theyll gain by taking risks, rather than how to save what they have. The masses are so focused on clipping coupons and living frugally they miss major opportunities, he writes. Even in the midst of a cash flow crisis, the rich reject the nickle and dime thinking of the masses. They are the masters of focusing their mental energy where it belongs: on the big money.

          For the most part, it takes guts to take the risks necessary to make it as a millionairea challenge most middle class thinkers arent comfortable living with. Physical, psychological, and emotional comfort is the primary goal of the middle class mindset, Siebold writes. World class thinkers learn early on that becoming a millionaire isnt easy and the need for comfort can be devastating. They learn to be comfortable while operating in a state of ongoing uncertainty.

          While the middle class squabbles over the virtues of Obamacare and their companys health plan, the super wealthy are enrolled in a super elite boutique medical care association, Siebold says. They pay a substantial yearly membership fee that guarantees them 24-hour access to a private physician who only serves a small group of members, he writes. Some wealthy neighborhoods have implemented this strategy and even require the physician to live in the neighborhood.

          Average people believe they must choose between a great family and being rich. Rich people know you can have it all.
         </h4>
         <p>
          The idea the wealth must come at the expense of family time is nothing but a cop-out, Siebold says. The masses have been brainwashed to believe its an either/or equation, he writes. The rich know you can have anything you want if you approach the challenge with a mindset rooted in love and abundance.

           This article sets to divide. A Win-Lose, old fashion paradigm aka Gordon Gecko (see picture above). I wouldn't recommend division in the pursuit of Wealth. Make the Money, but don't make other people wrong. Real Wealth is one of being enlightened, conscious and for a higher good. Make good with the money, contribute, allow others to succeed. Only then is one truely Rich.

             I read this in a personal way (another characteristic of rich people I aspire to be more like).  It points out for me ways of thinking that I am going to have to change about myself, and how I should start thinking.  Don't re-invent the wheel when thousands of years have already proven the wheel and you can just get to using it right?  There are proven results to proven strategies.  If you want things in you life to change, you have to change things in your life!  Buzz said it well.  This is about 100% personal responsibility.  When you take 100% responsibility for your self and your own success, you don't have room to take responsibility for everyone else's success.  For them to think they are entitled to you providing their success is just as selfish and simply wrong.  What's so much better about being "stuck down" than being "stuck up" through your own hard work and efforts?

             @Jarem Frye - Just on the point of 'don't re-invent the wheel'. Of course, you can't improve the wheel for what it is of itself. If you want your car to run smoothly, use round wheels, yes. However.. the wheel itself was an improvement over walking, and walking was itself an improvement of the evolutionary process over swimming (ONLY in terms of exploring dry land of course). Sooner or later the wheel will become as obsolete as the horse is now for everyday transport. New technologies will eventually be figured out - cleaner than burning old fossils and faster, safer and more maneuverable than pushing wheels around on flattened roads. So don't re-invent the wheel, but never stop looking for even better modes of moving onward...change, progress, improvement of any kind comes from developing, in whatever ways, new and better methods of going about things. ALWAYS. By that logic we humans, so proud of ourselves, should be working hard to keep finding better systems in all fields, not just finding something that works for a select few of us and then building walls and sticking our feet in the mud because some of us are content, because, sadly, the developed nations we live in only exist in such a comfortable state for most people because those nations abuse the developing world. Every bit of gypsum that makes every single circuit board in the computer you're sat at came from mines in Africa.. mined by grossly abused slaves. Never ever sit there thinking you deserve what you have. It's not your fault you happened to be born into a comfortable life, but it's your choice to delude yourself that everything is just fine.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am not having a go at you Jarem, I am sure you're a wonderful person, but this is simply reality. Unfortunately most people are utterly ignorant of just how they come to live the way they do. However hard you work for your wealth, it was still pure pot luck that you happened to be born into circumstances/live through circumstances which provided the opportunities for you. I'm sorry about that, but it's true. It doesn't stop any of us from doing something, however small, to try and help the billions of people in severe poverty around the world though.

             I don't believe that this article sets out to divide.  Noticing that division exists does not equal creating or causing the division.  And the division absolutely exists.  It has been observed by those interested in business for centuries.  Those who have desired to keep specific knowledge to themselves and those who push common knowledge away from themselves are the ones responsible for the division.  It separates sellers from buyers, lenders from borrowers, the experienced from the ignorant, the enlightened from the superstitious, the hopeful from the hopeless, the creators from the consumers.  Men like Andrew Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Zig Ziglar, Robert Kiyosaki and, apparently, Steve Siebold care enough to try to make as many people as possible aware of these differences in order to UNITE, not DIVIDE.  Unity through common knowledge and true truth.

             Jarem Frye 
very nicely said and to Aus Dyer, really, who says that thinking differently "like rich people" means you are deluded that everything is just fine. It means, you decided to think differently so you could change the circumstances of whatever situation you were born into. It sounds like you think the "rich" people are doing nothing for the ones in poverty or to be accepted they have to become the middle class again by giving away almost everything they worked for. That working hard and making money in the process should not be vilified like it now is, but celebrated. I know that people (any people) would be even more willing to give to people who were not demanding that for some reason they deserve it after doing nothing for it, but having a need. The need is real, but the entitlement we now have is ridiculous. I agree that we had nothing to do with where or what circumstances we were born in.  However, to act like it is not okay to think differently, so one can potentially get out of said situations or that it means you don't care or even worse you do nothing for the people in severe poverty is ludicrous, as well is not based in truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             First, it is shown by at least one source with research (Dataset of the Day: Who is more Generous? Republicans or Democrats? by ADMIN on JANUARY 7, 2009 ) that Republicans, over several categories of giving to charities, that Republicans far out donate to charities over democrats, even though democrats are the ones pushing for more government spending and higher taxes to pay for them, but not as willing to pull from their own pockets.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, as far as millionaires...the majority (80%) EARNED their money (which the republicans choose to give more away verses place on government (the people, which means even the poor ones, even though the democrats still want the rich ones to continue paying even more).

             The Real "1 Percent" (80% of millionaires EARNED their money through hard work)
Cato Institute ^ | 11/08/2011 | Michael Tanner 
Posted on November 8, 2011 4:49:26 PM EST by SeekAndFind
            </p>
            <p>
             So just who are those top 1 percent of Americans that we're all supposed to hate?
            </p>
            <p>
             If you listen to President Obama, the protesters at Occupy Wall Street, and much of the media, it's obvious. They're either "trust-fund babies" who inherited their money, or greedy bankers and hedge-fund managers. Certainly, they haven't worked especially hard for their money. While the recession has thrown millions of Americans out of work, they've been getting even richer. Worse, they don't even pay their fair share in taxes: Millionaires and billionaires are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.
            </p>
            <p>
             In reality, each of these stereotypes is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Roughly 80 percent of millionaires in America are the first generation of their family to be rich. They didn't inherit their wealth; they earned it. How? According to a recent survey of the top 1 percent of American earners, slightly less than 14 percent were involved in banking or finance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Roughly a third were entrepreneurs or managers of nonfinancial businesses. Nearly 16 percent were doctors or other medical professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawyers made up slightly more than 8 percent, and engineers, scientists and computer professionals another 6.6 percent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sports and entertainment figures  the folks flying in on their private jets to express solidarity with Occupy Wall Street  composed almost 2 percent.
            </p>
            <p>
             By and large, the wealthy have worked hard for their money. NYU sociologist Dalton Conley says that "higher-income folks work more hours than lower-wage earners do."
            </p>
            <p>
             Because so much of their income is tied up in investments, the recession has hit the rich especially hard. Much attention has been paid recently to a Congressional Budget Office study that showed incomes for the top 1 percent rose far faster from 1980 until 2007 than for the rest of us. But the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that since 2007, there has been a 39 percent decline in the number of American millionaires.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among the "super-rich," the decline has been even sharper: The number of Americans earning more than $10 million a year has fallen by 55 percent. In fact, while in 2008 the top 1 percent earned 20 percent of all income here, that figure has declined to just 16 percent. Inequality in America is declining.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for not paying their fair share, the top 1 percent pay 36.7 percent of all federal income taxes. Because, as noted above, they earn just 16 percent of all income, that certainly seems like more than a fair share.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe Warren Buffett is paying a lower tax rate than his secretary, as he claims. But the comparison is misleading because Buffett's income comes mostly from capital gains, which were already taxed at their origin through the corporate-income tax.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moreover, the Buffetts of the world are clearly an exception. Overall, the rich pay an effective tax rate (after all deductions and exemptions) of roughly 24 percent. For all taxpayers as a group, the average effective tax rate is about 11 percent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beyond taxes, the rich also pay in terms of private charity. Households with more than $1 million in income donated more than $150 billion to charity last year, roughly half of all US charitable donations. Greedy? It hardly seems so.
            </p>
            <p>
             And let us not forget the fact that the rich provide the investment capital that funds ventures, creates jobs and spurs innovation. The money that the rich save and invest is the money that companies use to start or expand businesses, buy machinery and other physical capital and hire workers.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has become fashionable to ridicule the idea of the rich as "job creators," but if the rich don't create jobs, who will? How many workers have been hired recently by the poor?
            </p>
            <p>
             My very rich, middle class and poor republican or conservative (which are not the same) far out give many of my democratic friends (which yes I have many).  So, even though you can probably poke holes in this, the point is that democrats are not more compassionate then republicans (rich or poor), rich do give their fair share (please read about how Buffet misled everyone about paying less taxes than his secretary) and yes to  Jesse Lozano https://www.facebook.com/jesselozano you can sure tell who is rich (or plan on being) and who is not by how everyone responds to this article, as they are either saying, yes great article and get what it says in the spirit it was given or they are still whining instead of doing something about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've spent way to much time on this, as it will only give some more reason to whine and others to say, "yep, i get it." God bless all of you rich or poor and I would still rather teach someone how to fish instead of giving them a fish!

             In the end it is the belief that rich is bad, poor is good.  Church has taught this from the beginning of time, or beginning of religions.  Men like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Warren Buffet, etc that made millions through hard work and never crushed someone to get above. Men like Bernie Madoff set a bad example, but they are the few spoiled of the bunch, they in no way represent the whole. Money is not the root of all evil, for money in all its forms has existed since man began to barter for goods and money as such has been our own instrument for survival.  The moral dilemma comes when the acquisition of wealth is through ill means; poisoning the environment, killing or hurting of people, fraud, embezzlement, laundering, extortion, etc..  That is bad and poor and/or rich people sometimes do it.  The status of the individual is not bad or good, but his/her actions are and they should be judged based on that.

           Good article, except it doesn't talk about how to cope with the stress and anger experienced when cleaning people miss a spot or when there is not -one- first class seat left on the flight to Tahiti (forcing one to fly business class), where to buy people outright, or where the best places are to stash your money so you don't pay -any- tax on it whatsoever, so poor people don't get their dirty, immigrant hands on it. I *really* wish slavery had never been abolished. Such an ill-informed decision. Slavery builds nations, as well as character, and I really wish poor people understood that.

             Average people make snide accusations about alleged failures in the character of rich people, accepting the warm comfort of stewing anger over so-called class injustices as an excuse to avoid seeking one's own success. Rich people don't waste their time with such nonsense.

             He already is a slave.  Slavery was not done away, it was just opened to the free market allowing people to choose slavery through embracing the poverty mentality, rather than being forced into slavery.  Now slave owners don't have to buy you at auction, they just buy with with a healthcare plan, 401k, vacation time ect, and you are okay with that because it's more comfortable than taking the risks you boss takes to be in a position to give you a job.

             I agree, Slavery should come back, when slavery was common place even the poor could live comfortably knowing that they could concentrate on earning instead of cleaning, building and cooking.. The way I see it, Poor people disgust me, there are always exceptions of course, but on the entirety of it, a poor person is poor because they can't be bothered to make money, so why not turn those into slaves? that way We (the middle/upper classes) can make more wealth feeding off the lower working classes, its win win (for us anyway) and It's not like the poor can lose out either, they would be housed, fed and buried with dignity, a far nicer life than what i see on the television of poor people.

             Slavery isn't dead.  All you have to do is look at the number of people living on government cheese and checks in return for their vote to keep their financial Santa in office.  I believe that the current economic/political slavery that allows the inmates to run the asylum is just as bad as the historic images of slavery we all have, because it perpetuates the entitlement and subservient lifestyle generation after generation.

             Mark, your's is the most sane comment here.  This "article" is the most condescending tripe I've read in a long time.  It is breathtaking in it's sociopathy.  Thankfully, most who read this will see it for what it is.  An anthem to the 1% who were born on third base and thought they hit a triple.  I would love to know who  was "interviewed" for this and what their bank balance was the day they were born.

             Agreed...Average people blame their inadequacies or failures to external forces, god, the white man, etc.. as it is easier to cope with if you make yourself believe it was not your fault.  The average like to see A as B and not accept that A is A and see if he can make A into B not make it appear as so, but truly make it so.  The average person creates illusions of grandeur to pacify their mental need for assurance, that they are ok, that they are fine, when in reality it keeps your from ever getting better. The indebted man with a nice ride to hide his bad credit, his downtrodden home or even his own ailing health. The average man believes he is awesome or great. The rich man simply is. When the rich man fails, he picks himself up and takes it as a learning experience and improves on his failure. The average man avoids anything else like it in future or simply fails to grasp what was being taught. The rich man makes his wealth. The average man waits for it to be given to him. Prays for it everyday, gambles away at it every day and fails to reap from it till the end of his days.  Growing up I always had the mentality I had now, but I was told it was wrong, "it is far easier for a camel to walk through the needle of an eye than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven" I was told.  Every day, I went multiple times a week to church with my grandma, there were men and women begging for help, instead of going out there and working to make wealth; an hour a day praying is 7 hours a week working. I can't say I am rich, but I am working to make my wealth. Do I make mistakes in my investments, yes, but I learn from them. I prod and poke every failure to find where I went wrong and how I can get around it, because the goal is set and that is where I want to be at.

             What you say makes sense to a certain extent, but One part of this article cleary explains that wealthy strive to become more wealthy through learning, I like to watch how poor people interact and how they treat money and work so that I know how mistakes can be made, and more importantly how to avoid them, how many times have you been to the pub, and seen the most obviously poorer people spend the most and get too drunk? if they limit themselfs and put the money into something more worthwhile they would not feel the need to drown their misery in cheap alcohol.

             Yes, totally agree!! And not just rich people, but those who are working towards it.  I wouldn't say I'm rich yet, but any reasons I am not are because I've put other things ahead of money at certain times in my life - and that's okay too.  I know if I did some of these I'd be rich faster.

             But then again you could say rich people are just curious to see what others think is the way to get rich. I believe a lot of this article is based on opinion. There is no one way to get rich and there certainly is not a sequence of steps.

           Give this list to a single mother raising three kids by herself in a city like Los Angeles.... If you are working two jobs to put food on the table and keep a roof over your head while trying to raise your kids on your own, especially if you get any type of public assistance which here in America is a part-time job just in paperwork and documentation, all these rich thoughts have little place in your head. Your thoughts are more along the lines of "where does the next meal come from", "how do I pay the rent this month", "will I lose my job because I had to stay home again with a sick child", "how do I pay for the medical care". I want to see the author of this article as a person from a poor household with major health issues, or as a single mother with three kids trying to follow his principles while trying to figure out how to keep things running on a daily basis. And to call selfishness a virtue is atrocious....selfishness is the reason why we have people living in million dollar houses with 20+ empty bedrooms while walking past people sleeping in the streets in their own excrements. Last time I checked, compassion qualifies much more as a virtue and does a lot better for society. And when you look at the majority of the top earners in America, they fit the profile of a psychopath to a T. And when you then consider that many of the poor people work at non-living wages for these billionaire psychopaths, the list becomes ridiculous. Yes, it's good in thought, but has nothing to do with the reality many Americans or people world-wide are facing in light of the growing corporate greed and income equality. I think we need to redefine what we consider rich. I don't have a lot of money, but I have enough to make ends meet for me and my son. But I consider myself richer than many millionaires, because I have the best friends, I have a career that doesn't make me rich but that makes a difference in other peoples' lives on a daily basis, I laugh a lot and I'm happy, and I'm teaching my son how to be a compassionate, good human being who knows how to look out for himself, but that is also willing to share what he has with the less fortunate and that doesn't need materialistic things and a big bank account to feel rich and blessed.

             An intelligent person that plans ahead and structures a life in which they can comfortably live below their means is unlikely to have several children before they are capable of supporting them.  Directing scorn at successful people because they choose to make better decisions in life is unseemly.

             Claudio, although from one perspective my heart goes out to you for having to take on the burden of raising three children alone However, women do have choices, and one of them is to get better at choosing  a good father, responsible, loving husband and good provider. Period. Please for your children's sake, and the sake of the next generations, TEACH THAT MUCH TO YOUR OWN CHILDREN and their world will be a better place to live in. The Universe has more to give than that, but you have to be wise enough to ask for and seek out that which you REALLY WANT, NOT WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SETTLE FOR.  Love, a Woman and a Single Mother

             Would you say a women from an abusive marriage is not intelligent? Countless women escape with their life but literally have to skip meals to feed her children. There are countless women who left the workforce to have a family and end up on welfare when the marriage falls apart and they can't get back into the job market. There are many factors that contribute to being poor and in certain situations it's extremely difficult to get out of the situation once in it. It's an interesting article but I'm not sure I agree with some of the things it tends to recommend in order to be rich.

             Just as directing scorn to people who were born into a situation that affords no out, while pretending we all have the benefit of the same opportunities is more than unseemly, it's grotesque.  Being poor, underpriviledged and born into a system that not only enforces that status quo, but also is ever increasing teh divide between haves and have nots is not some reflection of a person's virtue. But how convenient to assume that every poor person is simply toolaxy to be a millionaire.

             The rich ARE often snobby not because they are rich, but because of the class they are born into,
many usually coming from a genetic line of other rich families some have been wealthy for centuries. They are taught to look down upon commoners for not being from a particular bloodline they only breed into specific families, they look at people for their dollars and cents value and to them the poor are "worthless" and so on and so forth. It isn't true for every rich person, but some of the most wealthy and elite it is certainly the case. They exist in a different world than most could even know.
            </p>
            <p>
             @Amit bijlani children are the future. Why should it not be easier to raise a few children and live comfortably? Because the wages for average Americans are sub-par and the wages for corporate executives are to the moon?! In America the average CEO is paid 231 times more than the average worker, why is this so?. I'll answer you that, because to make a few rich and keep the majority poor is actually in the interest of the rich. It has to do with the value of the dollar and its buying power. I believe in a more eastern frame of thought, where the rich should think about giving back in order that others may reach some small level of success as well. In the "roaring 20s" such a dream was achieved for a few years. The average wage was enough to provide all of the necessities with surplus and the idea of not having kids until you can "afford" them would seem alien.
            </p>

             @Steve Fluke true there are some success stories like that but that is certainly not reasonable to expect on a nationwide basis. Regardless of what people like Donald trump say, if everyone in America was a business owner, it would not equal wealth and success for everyone. It would actually lead to the equalization of trading money. IE the decline of the value that the dollar can be exchanged for. Therefore if everyone becomes a billionaire or even a millionaire overnight, the price of everything would equalize because the value that a dollar could be traded for would be worth much less. So, everyone even though they are now millionaires and billionaires would not be technically "rich" everyone would be middle class having the same buying power. 
A capitalist society, controlled by capital and opportunity, cannot reach an equalization and still have incentive. This means you CANNOT have an overabundance of CAPITAL or OPPORTUNITY or the system equals out. Capital is purported to be the driving mechanism for advancement, if everyone had more then what they needed there would be no "incentive" to work. Therefore in our current governing form we cannot exist without a large portion of the nation being poor.  The poorer the poor become the greater buying power the rich have. Leading with capitalist incentive to keep the rich and savvy not wanting to give back anything. For giving back too much will actually lower the value of their own wealth, decreasing their dollars buying power, a few extra millionaires does nothing to lower a billionaires purchasing power. But a country full of them makes what you've accumulated worth thousands of times less, maybe even tens of thousands of times less.
            </p>
            <p>
             In conclusion, i will sum up my point by saying  not everyone can be rich in a capitalist society. Your views about money do not necessarily effect your ability to get it. (you can be rich and hate money, or poor and love it) Your opportunities and your initiative effect your ability to get money. Some are born with opportunities, some happen upon them by chance as with Paul Mitchell some are created through education and investing, but none come from attitude. The only thing your attitude can effect is your initiative. And finally, selfishness may be be the key to getting rich and staying rich but the rest of this article is prime grade made in the USA BS.

             Claudia I feel for you as a single mum, working hard to make ends meet, and having a child with health issues - I have the same experience. I know some of the questions of survival you asked. Asking different questions can lead you into a different mindset and informal education over time, it can change your outlook to other possibilities that might not be obvious, clear and present right here, right now but you are far from powerless. Obviously you are intelligent and passionate...great!  Use modern day - libraries can order you empowerment mind set books, business books, give you access to free internet for learning, and educate you on the best health choices you can make for you and your family. Is greed and profit out there? Yep...a fact of life...yet many many amazing entrepreuneurs and business people also are paying it forward in leaps and bounds to charities, education and support that they never advertise. Rich people have the choice of philanthropy, which I would love to experience one day. I applaud one of your definitions of being rich in the friends and career that you have, and your wonderful compassion for life. Would your life change, and otheer oppourtunities present if you expanded your mindset with more skills and possibiliities, more experiences and allow  people who can mentor you to a place of adventure and success, that then allows your son to absorb that as a possibility in his life and world? You can only start making a difference with yourself, and expand and amplify that energy in the world, your potential sings loudly, tune in your individual GPS to yourself and start making a difference. I know you can. And that can be more liberating than survivalist mindset...and attracting further lack into your world. Reality of getting through each day...you keep at it, keep going, and use your support network, watch the exhaustion. Your only magic wand is the mindset you have and the actions you take. Let me know how you are doing.

             Amit Bijlani  your life inexperience is demeaning in the comment  that intelligent people are "unlikely to have several children before they are capable of supporting them". Even intelligent people have life events that are unforseen - death, divorce, illness, abuse. Most people are not single parents as a pre requisite to becoming downtrodden. Many successful people have been sole parents, and elitist attitudes don't help. I also don't believe in scorning successful people...there are many definitions of success.
I do agree with your summary of the articles intent, which is simply a summary of old fashioned values in your eyes.
I think the article is about challenging yourself, taking risks and life long learning to approach life from a richer kaleidoscope of experience.

             Way to go Claudia.  You've got the correct values and are the type of person who our nation needs for the 21st century to fix our society's ills.  Ever wonder how some people got so wealthy since the 1980s?  Did they create something extraordinary?  Coordinate an idea, service, or group?  Co-opt the nation's wealth due to political cronyism and economic favoritism by tax advantages and loopholes?  Or was their wealth garnered by pure, unadulterated corruption?  We're on a path of self-destruction as our society becomes economically and politically unstable.  Whatever happened to following the golden rule and honoring the maxim that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link?  www.PsychicServices-FrankMchel.com

             You list a lot of sad things at the beginning, but then you end it saying that you are happy.  Then you make it sound like rich people don't have friends and aren't compassionate.  Why is it poor people always attack rich people, and rich people are always trying to help poor people?  If you want to change your situation, keep looking for ways to do that and never give up looking.  There are opportunities out there, but most of the time they will not fall into your lap.  There are some great points made in this article that can help you get started...for one, try and take more risks.

             OUCH! That was kind of mean, but in a way, I agree. A smart person will build their personal capital before having huge responsibilities like children. My mother always told me that after I get married, have my own money. Keep it tucked away for a rainy day ... or divorce. No one plans on getting divorced after being married for 10 years and with 3 kids. But I have to ask Claudia, isn't the ex-husband helping? I won't go into all that, but for the most part I agree with the article. Another difference between the rich and poor is the environment each grew up in. It's hard to have a rich man's mentality when you grew up in the slums [for lack of a better word] of some huge city.

             I am a single mother of three. I am struggling financially and had to file bankruptcy last year.  I am inspired to be better and do better than where I am now.  I do take exception with Amit Bijlani's comment on making poor choices.  Certainly there is truth in it, but don't assume one size fits all.  All three of my children I had during my marriage to one man.  My poor choice was in who I chose to spend my life with.  He is not involved.  He does pay child support, but it is not enough to live on.  He has real issues and is a mess.  I didn't see this until after a few years of marriage.   Don't be so quick to judge.  I do not scorn successful people...I'm on my way to becoming one.

             the single mother is EXACTLY one of the most important people this article can inspire!
IF this single mother is working 2 jobs to survive then bless her, she is trying, BUT she and all of us have to start thinking OUT OF THE BOX and start to realize that change comes from responsibility and not thinking like a VICTIM! The whole point is to show people like "CLaudia: that she is stuck in poverty consciousness. Of course, it's difficult when you're stuck in a bad situation, but instead of thinking "Where is my next meal coming from?" There's an opportunity to think "where do I want my next meal to come from?" What would I love to do to pay the rent for the next month and how can I make that happen?" It's the THINKING and actions that have to change. It's the poverty mentality that has to change. Kudos to the writer of this article for showing each person who responds where they potentially stuck in their thinking process! Blessings to everyone that you start to realize that you are not a victim regardless of your current situation and that you begin to allow prosperity consciousness into your life

             If you have kids before you have the means to reliably feed them, you're probably not cut out for owning and managing large amounts of money. Of course, if you had talent, there's opportunities to succeed regardless. Look at JK Rowling if you really want an example.

             This article is pretty good because there's a lot of truth in it. Some people are destined to be great, some to be rich, some to be famous, but not everyone can climb to the top. But just because you can't doesn't mean other people can't either.

             I couldn't agree more.  This is a contrived heap of garbage that literally has zero relevance in reality.  If this is an inspiration for someone, you may need to seriously step back, evaluate yourself, and give your head a shake.

             You think the idea of educating yourself (#16) and surrounding yourself with like-minded people (#17), just to name a few, has zero relevance in reality? You and your opinion are most certainly in the minority but thanks for sharing your feelings.

             The folks that don't chew on these points and try to see how they can benefit by changing their attitudes will be forever stuck. Rich people and average people don't think the same. Neither do average people and poor people. Everything starts with how you think. Reminds me of when Rich Dad/Poor Dad was big, and people complained it told them nothing. We gleaned a lot, still favorite books on our investment shelves!

             Absolutely Cris! People think that getting rich all comes from strategy. But like you said, it all starts with thinking. In fact, how one thinks counts towards 80% of someone's success, while 20% is strategy.

             Stephen Gebhardt Okay, maybe YOU need the headshake. Your comment is only relevant under the assumption that middle class people are not educated. Wrong answer, but thank you for sharing your feelings. As for #17, you seem to think that having that particular mentality and being wealthy necessarily go hand in hand. So if you have that mentality, you are necessarily rich; if you're rich, you have that mentality. For self-made rich people, one deduction might be true. How about people born rich, and who don't get educated and actually never work, cause they don't have to? The mentality described above doesn't come with the silver spoon they're born with, but they're still part of the community of wealthy people mentioned here. Let's be honest; it's not about a similarity in mentality, but about a similarity in lifestyle. And also, I happen to find it very interesting and enriching to hang out with people who think differently than me. Some of them might even be rich.

             The born rich people stay rich as long as they have the right mind set. Otherwise they end up poor like all the others.

             Studies in sociology tend to establish that :
-rich people care less about moral or consequences of their actions
-rich people cheat more (the study was with a dice game)
-rich people lie more
-rich people don' t take other's opinion into consideration as much
-rich people are less respectful of other beings in general

           It's interesting how the people who believe this article is BS automatically shut off any and every opportunity for them to get out of mediocrity and create extraordinary results in their life. To those people I suggest to get around people who have created bigger results in their life then watch, listen and learn and see for yourself how the difference in thinking makes all the difference. www.facebook.com/myplatinumlife

           LOL

          <p>
           What a load of of ole' horse shit.
          </p>
          <p>
           Capitalism is built on a foundation of menial labour that supports the rich. The structure is literally stacked against the impoverished people to maintain this hierarchy. You take that away, and the whole house of cards comes crashing down.
          </p>
          <p>
           The real brainwashing isn't done by conditioning people to go about amassing wealth in the wrong way, it's done by simply giving everyone the impression that they have a chance of becoming rich.
          </p>
          <p>
           The thought that all you need is the right mindset to acquire great magnitudes of wealth is not only naive, but pretty offensive to "Average" people. And make no mistake, if you're reading this. The odds suggest you are an average person. I know we have a tendency to see 'Cowboy, Astronaut billionaires' on the net, but lets be honest here. You're not one of the upper echelons of society if you're reading this contrived little mass of nonsense.
          </p>
          <p>
           Luck is and always has been the greatest factor in becoming rich, the luck of where you were born. What gifts you were born with, the luck of being born into a family or even a society that knows how to nurture those gifts so you have the best start in life. And probably most importantly, the simple blind luck of actually making it.
          </p>
          <p>
           How many millions of potential world altering ideas didn't make it simply because they never caught the right persons attention? How many potential Steve Jobs never made it because they bought into the wrong portfolio?
          </p>
          <p>
           Not only does it take smarts, dedication and a positive outlook to drag yourself up from poverty to the upper rungs of the society. It takes a fuck load of luck too.
          </p>
          <p>
           And as this douche talks about the difference between those willing to 'take the risk' and those who aren't. Shall we also consider how many people did take those risks and crashed and burned as a result?
          </p>
          <p>
           Being rich isn't the result of a mindset alone, and all I can think of whilst reading this drivel, is how hauntingly similar to the ideals of archaic British honour culture it sounds.

             You're not entirely wrong.....but you are partly wrong.....all due respect intended.   You have inverted the principles of capitalism and corporate socialism; but it's a mistake made by most people.  You have mistakenly concluded this because you believe that America practices capitalism.....we do not, and have not for about 100 years.  Our monetary system is incompatible with free-market capitalism.  It is "Corporate Socialism"; that uses a system of unfair taxation, together with a corrupt monetary system, to conscript the middle class into providing "menial labor that supports the rich".  The obscenely rich in the world did not get that way because we have a "level playing field" where everyone has to play by the same rules (the definition of a free-market).  Instead, our system allows a certain class of people, to make investments at little to no risk......while the rest of us must bear ALL risk, for them and for ourselves, in everything we do and in any venture we pursue (even investing in the corrupt stock-market).  The unfairness of our system that skews all risk to be borne by the middle class; while no risk is borne by the oscenely rich banking aristocracy is a Socialist construct (centralizing the means of production); and NOT a free-market capitalist construct.  Thinking otherwise shows that you have fallen prey to the "inversion of truth" propaganda perpetrated by the likes of "Michael Moore".  We don't practice caplitalism in America.....we practice "False Flag Capitalism".  If you doubt this assertion.....spend about 30 minutes and read the following:  "The Ten Planks of Communism", by Karl Marx; Then Read Article 1, Section 8 of the US Constitution; and finally, try to gain an understanding of our current monetary model (as well as fractional reserve lending practices); and hopefully you will connect the dots and realize that the ills of our country are NOT because of "capitalism" (since we don't practice this); but because of the socialist model that has been in place in the United States since 1913; with the founding of the Federal Reserve system.

             Somethings are true. Yes you can be lucky to be born into wealth. But there are countless that are not and make something of themselves.  Some turn tragedy into success. In the end they don't give in to whatever handicaps they may have been dealt.  And capitalism is a failure in this country, because this nation as a whole does not allow those that want to succeed to do it easily. There are many that are fine where they are and no disrespect to the truckers, service workers, etc.. but yes I agree that in those places there are those that want to get out and they find it hard to do so, but improbable is a better description than impossible.  The world would be a better place is it was all lassez faire in the business world, but the constraints that the government puts in place keeps everyone from being responsible for their actions. Yes we will have some bad businesses out there, but if no one buys from them because they disagree in their practices, they will fail. Everyone needs to be responsible for themselves and stop putting it on the government or worse giving them more and more reign over what they control. The average choose to let them in more and more because when THEY fail they have someone to blame, but eventually they will also find themselves robbed of all their rights and privileges.  We have states trying to put laws to prohibit companies from firing people over Facebook posts or requesting your login credentials. I say let them ask. They will find themselves with no one wanting to work for them and they will soon find themselves out of business.  The market is a good way of deciding in which direction we are heading, the whole law of a different averaging. It is understood that when you take a large poll of any specific variable, the average will ALWAYS be closest to the true center.  That is if there are not law or taxes or regulations moving the outliers more to one direction than another.  We find it harder getting out of this rut because of the system we are in, but it is possible, but sometimes it is easier for some to be content where they are and just survive, live by then make more out of it.

           Being rich here is exaggerated, it is subjective to who cares and relative to how comfortable you want to be. The 1 thing that suits me in all is living below your means. The rest is crackerjack bull..... Most rich Men are opportunists and besides Steve Siebold neglected the God factor completely. Height of arrogance! No doubt riches makes your Life way easier but not the guarantee to happiness. Sometimes you have to choose by the way being fort-right and being rich.

           Most of these points are true... I would add though that the NEW Rich focus on working for change, over money.
To focus on money over change often trips people up, because they are blinded by the flashing lights.  If you focus on the change you want to make, the impact drives deeper and lasts which creates a chain reaction of change, growth, evolution and monetary rewards. 
Because of this, they create massive change and earn much more than a 'living' they earn a life.

           Gina Rinehart didn't earn her wealth, she inherited it, and invested it, albeit wisely, but almost certainly with the guidance of expensive advisers.
          </p>
          <p>
           That aside, much of these "points" ignore so much of reality; I have taken action, and lost tens of thousands of dollars that I had actually labored for, rather than have handed to me.
          </p>
          <p>
           I could break down each one, but the reality is this article is contrived, and serves only to bolster the notion that those who are wealthy are somehow more deserving, when the reality is that most of the current wealthy people were handed their dollars.

             its not fun losing money obviously. especially when, like u said, laboured for. but Gina rinehart is one example on inherited wealth. there are countless stories of people who didnt inherit nothing. just had a dream and applied many of the principles above. getting wealthy isnt a one trick poney. it requries consistentency, persistance and dilegence.. and of course. alot of failure and mistakes along the way. dont let ur past determine your future. u still have the chance to create something

             Your point is very valid in the sense that the "risk profile" for investing is very different for those in the middle-class; than it is for those in the obscenely rich class.  What we invest; we must first trade our labor to earn.  What the banking arisocracy invests, they can "create from thin air" through fractional reserve banking.  When they mal-invest and lose money.....they are "bailed out" by taxpayers.  When we mal-invest and lose our money.....we lose every hour of our lives that we traded for it in laboring to first EARN it.  The obscenely rich didn't get that way because they are smarter, or more courageous than the rest of us; they got that way because the system is skewed in their favor.  This has been the case since our Federal Reserve system  and system of taxation on wages were both created in 1913.

           I am a lone parent, and didn't plan to be. However this is totally inspiring. I am self-employed also and agree with it all. It is definitely mentality. If I had followed the negative mindset of others and not pursue my passion, I would have never been in a position to take my two sons on holiday last year for 2 weeks. Drive and consistency is key. Follow your passion, firstly knowing what it is, is important and don't be afraid of success

           Financial abundance comes to those who already FEEL they have their fortune before it actually manifests in their reality. Most millionaires become millionaires within first. It's the emotion, the feeling of abundance that creates abundance. It's being able to FEEL GOOD most of the time that aligns you with receiving your abundance in being able to hear your intution and then follow the INSPIRATIONAL  idea through.

           It's also being of service to other's which will help you become more successful, this only works in an anonymous manner otherwise its just bartering. The universe says what you give out you get back : ).
