        The idea of purposeful networking has been discussed many times in the world of business, but somehow hasnt become a matter of importance in mainstream education. In my post

        This increasing use of networking in the business world leads us to believe that purposeful networking is an essential skill for students today. The
        <a href="http://www.iste.org/Content/NavigationMenu/NETS/ForStudents/2007Standards/NETS_for_Students_2007_Standards.pdf" title="ISTE National Educational Technology Standards (NETS)">
         ISTE National Educational Technology Standards for Students (NETS-S)
        </a>
        states standards for technology in education today, but doesnt actually mention networking as a skill. The closest standard is under Communication and Collaboration where it states 
        <em>
         interact, collaborate, and publish with peers, experts, or others employing a variety of digital environments and media
        </em>
        .

While this company is obviously on the cutting edge of social media, adoption of Web 2.0 technologies and online interactions, its a clear indicator of the future skills that our students will need in future professions.

       <p>
        Aaron and I spoke about how networking and Web 2.0 skills are essential for anyone entering (or already in) customer service, marketing, product design and recruiting, to name just a few fields (I would argue that education should be included). For those in public relations, things have changed  rather than releasing information directly to the mainstream media, now the mainstream media often looks to bloggers for the most current trends and information.

         it isnt necessarily a distinction between young and old, its a distinction between connected and unconnected
        </strong>
        . This is really interesting as the terms digital natives and net generation are being thrown about with abandon in education and the media. I did an
        <a href="http://googtweetblog.edublogs.org/2008/03/27/age-survey-results/" target="_blank">
         unscientific poll recently
        </a>
        of my twitter network and found that the average age of the people who follow me on twitter (226 of the 370 or so) is 39.6  while this was a very casual survey, this is a pretty clear indicator of the fact that social networking is not only for the under 25 demographic.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         One distinction is how the different age groups use networking
        </strong>
        . As Aaron pointed out, most younger professionals are coming into the workplace very comfortable with the concept of social media because theyre already using it informally  for interaction with social groups. In my experience, and evidenced below, the older demographic uses networking more for professional purposes. There are obvious reasons for this, but the implication is that purposeful networking is a skill not gained strictly through the use of social networking sites. There are levels of interaction in networking, and although transparency is becoming more accepted and valued, there is still a line between the strictly social use of networking and professional. Aaron describes how hes fine with seeing the real side of prospective employees on Facebook profiles and twitterstreams because it gives him a better picture of who people are, but in our opinion and experience, networking is much more than simply posting information about yourself on various sites.

        There are several great pieces about the topic of different generational uses of networking on the Wikinomics blog

        <strong>
         As shown in these answers, networking IS a skill and needs to be taught as such
        </strong>
        . Other terms that are thrown about in education are netiquette and digital citizenship, but too often these are focused on online safety, which although a concern, isnt the same as purposeful networking.
        <br/>

        One of the issues facing educators who are trying to bring about the use of these tools and tackle the issue of purposeful networking in the classroom, is that
        <strong>
         most educators are not in a field that is making use of these tools
        </strong>
        . Many educators have not had careers outside of the classroom. Those educators who have had other careers are most likely unaware of these changes that have been occurring in the use of technology in the business world if they havent worked outside of the classroom in the past five years or made a concerted effort to stay connected. Additionally, the education profession historically has been a profession of isolationism despite recent efforts to establish Professional Learning Communities within schools. Developing a system-wide understanding of the need for the use of these tools is challenging, but essential if we hope to prepare our students with the skills they need to communicate, connect, and collaborate effectively and professionally in this increasingly connected world. Networking is extremely powerful for connecting educators and students to professionals outside of education 
        <strong>
         the challenge in education today is breaking down barriers and allowing students and teachers access to the sites and time in the school day and curriculum
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Potential solutions for overcoming these barriers include everything from teacher externships in fields related to their content areas, systemic change in practice at all levels of the system to include the use of Web 2.0 and social networking tools, and integration of 21st Century literacies/tools across the curriculum.
        </strong>
        At this time, educators should make efforts to connect with fields related to content areas, whether in their own communities or globally. Networking tools give great opportunities for this. Just one example of this is the ability to connect with professionals in various fields through twitter, which has been an invaluable tool for seeing new trends in the business field. It would be equally beneficial for educators in all content areas. Networking, whether physically or online, is essential for staying current in the world for which we are preparing our students.

         Kate and Stephanie, you really put a lot of work into this post and it shows. I hadnt considered social networks from this perspective, having had some years to work on my own purposeful networking skills I see applications for those skills in the Web2.0 tools.
        </p>
        <p>
         I agree that education needs to teach socialization. It happens naturally at school, when you get the mass of kids into one location they have to learn how to interact.
         <br/>
         But translating that to an online context is much more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
         And yet, there are some indications that kids really are understanding how to connect online. Or, for the generation after the Net Gen, they arent seeing the clear lines that separate online and offline interactions.
         <br/>

        </p>
        <p>
         So, when those trends combine, how does traditional education incorporate the childrens online communities in a way that validates their relationships without disrupting their education?

         Very solid post. It is interesting to see that your survey and the information from your conversation with Aaron indicate that our young students are not really digital natives. I have often thought the term digital native was tossed around by people who wanted an excuse for the lack of their own knowledge regarding technology; it would allow them to remain ignorant by making two assumptions:
        </p>
        <p>
         1. Technology was just for young people
         <br/>
         2. Young people get all the technology education they need without getting it at school.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is time for education (the institution) to realize that they failed my generation (I am 40+) and they are failing this one as well and the attempts they are making now amount to little more than creating the environment that was needed in the 80s and 90s.

         This is an excellent summary of the current state of affairs. I was just in a meeting with a college dean who noted that while students may have great abilities to surf and text, they interact with information at a very shallow level.
        </p>
        <p>
         But these new tools enable a very deep engagement with people as well as content. An example was given of a history instructor in the US covering the Revolutionary War, who Skyped into the classroom of a colleague in the UK, allowing the students to debate the war from  literally  both sides of the Atlantic.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order for students to see these tools as more than playthings, they need to see that use modeled. Getting teachers up to speed on this new world is crucial, but just as important is to find those students who are already going more than a layer down, incent them to go even deeper, and then reward the heck out of that behavior.

         Very thought-provoking post. How do I reach beyond my profession to stay connected? Truthfully, this is counter to the ideas you present (which I completely agree with), but I spend so much time online and on the computer within my profession (education) that I try to make my beyond the profession connections in the offline world. I read books, talk to people, and stuff like that, which connects me with my body, the world around me and others who are in my community but have diverse interests. It is almost like existing in two worlds.

         I have been an educator for over 15 years but only recently started a blog, and I have found that blogging has been the key to becoming (or trying to become) part of a network of educators that I barely knew existed.
         <br/>
         As for solutions to breaking down the barriers.I think it is happening slowly but surely every day. And, of course, the network of the teachers is key. As you know, I immediately went to the network the other day when I had a run-in of sorts with a parent. The network was there to provide support for me, and knowing I have this support helps me go forward in my little corner of the world to increase networking opportunities for my students.

         I was actually thinking the other day, how did teachers connect before networking? They didnt. Only with those teachers in their schools via the staffroom! I remember spending lunch-hours at Dymocks (bookstore) scouring for class resources as I was always on the lookout for interesting materials (rather than regurgitating the same material for each class as some teachers tended to do). Yes it has certainly opened up a whole world of support and connections that I now cannot imagine life without.

         Hi Kate  thanks for linking to my post and thought you might like to read the comments in Darrens post

          Im Dissappointed in the Technology Skills of My Students.
         </a>
         Most interesting was that I wrote a lengthy comment about digital natives, which took me so long to write that by the time it was posted others had written similar also stating fairly similar thoughts. This post is definitely worth a read  most importantly the comments left.

         @JohnJohansen youve brought up a really important issue, and Im not sure of the solution yet. One thing we face in schools are very strong network filters that dont allow access to many networking sites. This is the most basic hurdle to bridging the distance between play and productivity with technology. We arent able to model how to use technology appropriately/productively if we dont have access. Thanks again for the great blogging post I referenced in this post!
        </p>
        <p>
         @indigo196 digital natives is just one of those terms that its really easy to throw around without truly thinking of whats behind it. Labeling generations is tough at any time, and grouping that with a skill set so controversial as technology use just isnt logical.
        </p>
        <p>
         @durff you provided such great food for thought that day on twitter about the ustream session  great stuff! Im so happy I was able to stop in and learn from that forum  thanks for letting us all know about it.
        </p>
        <p>
         @Aaron  yet again, thanks for taking the time to talk to me, companies like Mzinga are really showing educators what skills our students will need to thrive in business!
        </p>
        <p>
         @Corrie  I love this! In order for students to see these tools as more than playthings, they need to see that use modeled. Getting teachers up to speed on this new world is crucial, but just as important is to find those students who are already going more than a layer down, incent them to go even deeper, and then reward the heck out of that behavior. So many students great work is often overlooked by labeling an entire generation  it IS very important to give incentives to those who go above and beyond and model the skills wed like to see in all of our students. As for modeling by educators, thats key  how will students know how to use these tools productively if theyre the only ones using them? Of course, in order to model, teachers would need access.
        </p>
        <p>
         @edtechworkshop  I agree completely, the network of educators is amazing and I wouldnt give mine up for anything! Stepping outside that to interact with other professionals from around the world is very interesting, though, and the no borders atmosphere is something that is unique to the online environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         @Marie  very true about teachers not networking, but its true about all professions. Time and location are always issues, which is what is so neat about the online environment. I dont network at school because I never have time to leave my classroom!
        </p>
        <p>
         @Sue  loved your post and did read Darrens post  looks like were all thinking the same thing!
        </p>
        <p>
         @JohnLarkin  youre a constant inspiration, thanks for all the learning youve shared with me  as for working too hard, blogging isnt work for me  its one of my favorite things to do
