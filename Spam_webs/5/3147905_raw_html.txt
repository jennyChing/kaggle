            (PhysOrg.com) -- By using the sun's visible light and heat to power an electrolysis cell that captures and converts carbon dioxide from the air, a new technique could impressively clean the atmosphere and produce fuel feedstock at the same time. The key advantage of the new solar carbon capture process is that it simultaneously uses the solar visible and solar thermal components, whereas the latter is usually regarded as detrimental due to the degradation that heat causes to photovoltaic materials. However, the new method uses the suns heat to convert more solar energy into carbon than either photovoltaic or solar thermal processes alone.

           The new process, called Solar Thermal Electrochemical Photo (STEP)

            carbon capture
           </a>
           , was recently suggested theoretically by a team of scientists from George Washington University and Howard University, both in Washington, DC. Now, in a paper just published in
           <i>
            The
            <a class="textTag" href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/journal+of+physical+chemistry/" rel="tag">

            </a>
            Letters
           </i>
           , the scientists have experimentally demonstrated the STEP process for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
           The significance of the study is twofold, Stuart Licht, a chemistry professor at George Washington University, told
           <i>
            PhysOrg.com
           </i>
           . 
           <a class="textTag" href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/carbon+dioxide/" rel="tag">
            Carbon dioxide
           </a>
           , a non-reactive and normally difficult-to-remove compound, can be easily captured with
           <a class="textTag" href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/solar+energy/" rel="tag">
            solar energy
           </a>
           using our new low-energy, lithium carbonate electrolysis STEP process, and with scale-up, sufficient resources exist for STEP to decrease carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels within 10 years.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the scientists explain, the process uses visible sunlight to power an electrolysis cell for splitting carbon dioxide, and also uses solar thermal energy to heat the cell in order to decrease the energy required for this conversion process. The electrolysis cell splits carbon dioxide into either solid carbon (when the reaction occurs at temperatures between 750C and 850C) or
           <a class="textTag" href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/carbon+monoxide/" rel="tag">
            carbon monoxide
           </a>
           (when the reaction occurs at temperatures above 950C). These kinds of temperatures are much higher than those typically used for carbon-splitting electrolysis reactions (e.g., 25C), but the advantage of reactions at higher temperatures is that they require less energy to power the reaction than at lower temperatures.
          </p>
          <p>
           The STEP process is the first and only method that incorporates both visible and thermal energy from the sun for carbon capture. Radiation from the full solar spectrum - including heat - is not usually considered an advantage in solar technologies due to heats damage to photovoltaics. Even in the best solar cells, a large part of sunlight is discarded as intrinsically insufficient to drive solar cells as it is sub-bandgap, and so it is lost as waste heat.
          </p>
          <p>
           By showing how to take advantage of both the suns heat and light for capturing and splitting carbon dioxide, the STEP process is fundamentally capable of converting more solar energy than either photovoltaic or solar thermal processes alone. The experiments in this study showed that the technique could capture carbon dioxide and convert it into carbon with a solar efficiency from 34% to 50%, depending on the thermal component. While carbon could be stored, the production of carbon monoxide could later be used to synthesize jet, kerosene, and diesel fuels, with the help of hydrogen generated by STEP water splitting.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are exploring the STEP generation of synthetic jet fuel and synthetic diesel, Licht said, and in addition to carbon capture, we are developing STEP processes to generate the staples predicted in our original theory, such as a variety of metals and bleach."

            actually smashczar, trees are almost carbon-neutral. Trees breath in carbon but on a relatively short time scale they die and decompose, releasing the carbon back into the atmosphere. Unless you cut the tree down and make something permanent out of it, the carbon goes right back into the cycle. If you make paper from the trees and then bury that paper in a landfill the carbon is trapped semi-permanently, but it takes electricity to cut down trees and make paper, not to mention all the other chemical pollution from making paper. If all you want to do is trap carbon, then landfills are the answer though. I guess that's where the carbon from this contraption would end up too, unless they can make use of it all.

            If we really want to get rid of the carbon, we should drop it into subduction zones by fault lines, and let it get carried down into the mantle.  We could do that with the nastiest of the radioactive wastes, too - but then, our grandchildren will be cursing us vehemently for our short-sightedness.

            An interesting press release "lead" without a shred of information. The article is "for purchase" from "The Jopurnal of Physical Chemistry Letters". I saw no informatio sufficient to the claim "Solar-powered process could decrease carbon dioxide to pre-industrial levels in 10 years". I would not invest in this without evidence that the process is viable for production.

             These kinds of temperatures are much higher than those typically used for carbon-splitting electrolysis reactions (e.g., 25C), but the advantage of reactions at higher temperatures is that they require less energy to power the reaction than at lower temperatures.

            At first I was stumped by this statement.. However after giving it more thought I guess what they are trying to say is this.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            At a temp of 25C splitting carbon requires X energy.
            <br/>
            At a temp of 850C splitting carbon requires X - Y energy.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I guess I have to presume that Y energy is some number LESS than the energy used to raise the temp from 25C to 850C... Right?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Other than that it certainly SEEMS like an exciting announcement / discovery. However, I really wish these endless number of amazing stories found here ob a daily basis are put into some realistic perspective.. For example a story just a day or so ago stated that introducing a small qty of cheap nano mat into batts double capacity and greatly reduce recharging

            synthetic fossil fuel production is going to be a big step if we ever want to do anything in space cheaply.  This is a boon in my book, but I do understand the arguement for reduction of all fossil fuel usage, a first step in changing overall technology is proving you can out pace nature in fuel production and cheapen the production line -- the savings in money will spurr innovation into total replacements.

            Interesting. But there are much better things to do with that much energy. There has been 1/2 degree F global warming, up from the lows of the little ice age. Temperatures are well below average for the last 10,000 years. It was warmer in the 1930's, 1,000 years ago, 2,000 and 4,000 years ago. Let's stop being stupid, OK? Do some independent research, folks. You are being propagandized.

Since governments have shown they will not tax for investments that would offer positive returns, it's up to the oil companies.  We will no doubt have to offer them 2-for-1 tax credits to invest in this sort of thing, even though it would extend their monopoly on energy forever.

            <br/>
            How so?  They offset current carbon with this process (or some other carbon capture process, it really doesn't matter), and in so doing they generate a new, renewable stream of fuels that are fully compatible with current fossil fuel technologies and infrastructure, thereby staving off any conversion to other energy sources.

            Every possible avenue that leads toward humanity's survival should and will be explored. Of course, they will fall into two categories: reducing carbon emissions and capturing already emitted carbon.  The one that scares me the most is the geo-engineering approach of injecting sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to reproduce the cooling effect of massive volcanic activity.  This tactic is backed by the oil interests because it supports our petrol-based economy.  It is scary because it uses the earth as the experimental platform for an untried technology and because of the sudden temperature jump if the injection ever stops.

             Interesting. But there are much better things to do with that much energy. There has been 1/2 degree F global warming, up from the lows of the little ice age. Temperatures are well below average for the last 10,000 years. It was warmer in the 1930's, 1,000 years ago, 2,000 and 4,000 years ago. Let's stop being stupid, OK? Do some independent research, folks. You are being propagandized.

            I guess the process would form lithium carbonate or lithium bicarbonate which would then need to be regenerated before it could be used again? They don't mention any waste products. The lithium hydroxide CO2 scrubber systems used on the space shuttle operate at room temperature but you end up with lithium carbonate when the filter is used up. Then you heat the filter to regenerate it and use it again. I wonder why you couldn't use a simple system like that? It would be way less complicated than the molten salt thing they are talking about. You could use sunlight to regenerate the filter in the day and scrub CO2 at night.

            a few thoughts
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1) using the CO2 from the atmosphere to generate a synthetic fuel seems pretty carbon neutral once the fuel is burned.  Use solar to power the process and your doing pretty good.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            2)  " decrease carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere to pre-industrial levels within 10 years " ....*blinks*....Am I misunderstanding this or are they seriously proposing to remove nearly 300 years of carbon build up ( lets call it 1,000 gigatones )  in a Ten Year Period...without any mention of possible consiquences to the Climate?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If carbon emissions over the past 300 years have lead to a +1 degree temperature increase in the past century,  how could removing all that carbon, but 30 TIMES FASTER not have an effect worth mentioning?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            3) If your really worried about global warming, why the heck would it matter Who is doing it?  If they are saving us from all the disasters Al Gore describes, why does it matter Who It is?

            Seems that these  processes could be run in tandem-to produce fuel for auto purposes, and at the same time for power generation, while still producing pure carbon.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In terms of the pure carbon component, some could be sold for industrial use to produce goods, and another portion, if not all could be milled with the other necessary components as bio-char, to replace petrochem fertilizer, and to help reclaim depleted or marginal land for crop production and reforesting.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In terms of overall cost to society at large, and to enable control of allocation for maximum economic/societal/environmental benefit, this technology/production/distribution should be Nationalized, to prevent the monopolization/monetization/leveraging that dnatwork, above, rightly voices a fear of- why put the means of profit-above-all into the hands of the very same ones who have so egregiously abused it in the past, and with such detriment to so many?  contd

            This technology, if Nationalised, would create/sustain just as many jobs as it would if operated privately, would generate huge amounts of tax revenue(even at nominal rates) to finance government programs, would be strictly regulated, and could be deployed in a coordinated, comprehensive, approach for maximum benefit impossible in the free market.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Being operated in a not-for-profit way would free up hundreds of billions of dollars annually, that could be reinjected/reinvested into research and other programs.  Think about it.

            Gotta disagree with you about trees being carbon-neutral.  While that is more or less true, it is only so at equilibrium- whether for one tree or a forest.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            While forests are being replanted, the CO2 uptake is a positive curve, that only stops being so when planting stops, at which point it would trend to equilibrium.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I know it is hair-splitting, but it is an important distinction to make.

             actually smashczar, trees are almost carbon-neutral. Trees breath in carbon but on a relatively short time scale they die and decompose, releasing the carbon back into the atmosphere. Unless you cut the tree down and make something permanent out of it, the carbon goes right back into the cycle. If you make paper from the trees and then bury that paper in a landfill the carbon is trapped semi-permanently, but it takes electricity to cut down trees and make paper, not to mention all the other chemical pollution from making paper. If all you want to do is trap carbon, then landfills are the answer though. I guess that's where the carbon from this contraption would end up too, unless they can make use of it all.

            Corporation has motive of making profit, and keeping for self/shareholders.  Only driver for increased efficiency is to increase profit.  There is no value-added in this scenario, and only a dribble of tax revenue, if any at all -and this only assuming that enterprise is not subsidised directly or indirectly by taxpayer dollars.

            indeed, that just maintains current levels, but still better than getting worse. I like the synergy idea opto- and thermoelectric solarenergy capture but what about wallplug or milage (enduser) efficiency? how many solarwatts do you need to run an all electric car for 100 miles where the electricity in the battery comes from optoelectric solar cells vs Synthfuel car where the fuel comes from the thermo-opto cells?

            The article said it could produce either solid carbon OR carbon monoxide. The CO could be used for a carbon neutral fuel source. SOLID carbon would be sequestered for a carbon negative 'solution' to the problems caused by humans putting excess CO2 into the air. Anyone who denies that this is a problem is a fool.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Taking carbon out of the atmosphere quickly IMHO should not cause a big problem as what should happen is less heat gets trapped by the greenhouse effect. Recently some scientists have published data that says we have been storing this heat in the deep ocean waters. If we stop pumping extra heat into them, they should begin releasing this heat slowly. So there should be no dramatic cooling of the earth, only perhaps a gradual decrease in the average temperature, just as the pumping of CO2 into the air only increased the temperature gradually.

            For once you said something almost on point. If there is no value added for this solar to carbon process, why should the government try to operate this at a 'profit' (code word for taxes to Cali).
            <br/>
            Supposedly many here have some background with science yet many promote pure socialism that Cali just suggested: the government should run this project to raise taxes. How oxymoronic! Please provide some data from real experiments to show that such a project will do what you propose. But then why should you as you don't need data to support the belief that CO2 is the cause of 'global climate change'.
            <br/>
            And then, when challenged to support his idea with real data, he must resort to insults as he has no such data.
            <br/>
            Even the government today knows better than to try and operate as a business. That's why they hire contractors.

            Since we ain't got no real numbers(that I know of) I'll just say that we use the same pricing models that are currently used to retail the equivalent products.  That means that ALL of what is currently excise tax PLUS profit would go into treasury,  contd

            <br/>
            It would be hard to pin a profit figure on the entire petrochem industry, but it has to be nearing a trillion annually, if not in excess of that.  So, in my scenario, that is all equivalent to TAX REVENUE, that is directly collected and spendable.  That's a lot of money for R&amp;D, and full funding for programs.  Plus, I don't see how this would cost any jobs, with the possible exception of those that are directly involved in drilling/support operations, but we would need lots of staff for the new production facilities, and their construction, so that would probably offset.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            And stop saying it hasn't been done before, mangy- ever heard of BPA, TVA, REA?  Sorry if those hallowed acronyms scorched yer freimarketvampire flesh, but that's just the way of it.  No, all of your concern is based on the concept of something like my proposal making inroads against your investment portfolio.

             "low pay means low productivity. On Obispo street, a state-run cafeteria sells heavily subsidized soft ice cream and pork sandwiches for the equivalent of a few American pennies - meaning wages and tips are so tiny that the staff is indifferent toward customers."

            I am entirely aware that most people would automatically reject any such proposal based on the grounds that it would be "socialistic".  All argument of definition and terminology aside, however -is this a legitimate option or not?  Do people object to it because it is inoperable due to some inherent flaw in government(that is entirely absent in private enterprise), or because they just don't like the idea of all that sweet profit not going to the direct enrichment of a handful?

            Its not that the idea sounds Socialist, I couldnt care less about how it Sounds,  its the fact that governments are Inherently Inefficient at almost everything.  Far too much risk avoidance and desire to leave it at the status quo, no matter how bad that status quo is....

            <br/>
            Taxes?  On a government project?  Since you cited TVA, what is the tax rate they pay on thier "profits"  How realistic are those profits?  How overmanned is the project?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Case in point:  Worked at a government shop that was transitioned to a contractor run operation.  Manning at that shop went from 72 government workers to 41 contract workers.  Within a year it was 35 workers.  Since labor is a major cost factor, how much of TVA's overall budget goes to salaries?  How much of it would be pure "Profit" that they could pay taxes on if manning was lowered?

            All of your comment so far goes right back to my asking why you didn't read.  I already addressed that issue, specifically, using "taxes" in quotation marks to stand for the income generated over and above operating costs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            And the rest of your objections are window-dressing, since they are equally true of private enterprise, once you've inverted the meanings of a few operative terms.  "efficiency", for instance, which generally stands for "all other factors are secondary to profit"- which isn't the same as minimization of waste.  Status Quo vs. Innovation? Just ask Detroit.
            <br/>
            Some services are too important for the private sector. You named three:  Education.  Public Housing. The Military.  The same model of business "efficiency" that leads to offshoring and downsizing and pension-shedding would leave vast numbers completely exposed. Unless, of course, you want the rationale behind Walmart to provide those basic needs for us.

            Also- "the richer they become the more tax revenues they generate" is only partly true, as you should be well aware.  Check on, for instance, Dupont, AT&amp;T, General Electric, EXXON-MOBIL. Their stunningly small income tax- or entire lack thereof might just open your eyes.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I don't mean for this debate to be a political one -merely pragmatic.  And I don't see any reason why the industry could not be operated by Agency at a tolerable level of efficiency, and still generate vastly more revenue for the operations of government than the (privately held)petrochem industry does now(through direct taxation).

            Exxon employees nearly 80,000 people. How many of those people pay taxes on their salaries?
            <br/>
            In 2005, Exxon sold 26 billion gallons of gasoline with state and federal government collecting ~$.25 per gallon. So Exxon's gasoline products generated over $4 billion in taxes.
            <br/>
            As a shareholder owned company, all taxes must be taken from profit which is then not available for investments or dividends. That is called opportunity costs. Something that socialists just can't seem to comprehend. Taxes taken is money removed from the economy that could have been put into more wealth creation.
            <br/>
            That's why BHO's policies are not creating more private sector jobs. No one wants to risk their wealth just to have it confiscated by the state.

            Not true, marjon. 53% of Sweden's GDP is generated by public spending and we all know that Sweden is better off than the USA. It all depends on what you spend the public money for: wars and investments in China (the economics of dominance), or social programs, infrastructure and R&amp;D at home (the economics of partnership).

            It all depends on cost per energy unit.  If this device can produce energy as a fraction of the cost of other methods, then it'll be adopted worldwide in short order (well, in sunny places worldwide, that is) and the energy/climate crisis is over!  Somehow, I doubt it's that simple.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The technology sounds awesome.  I just hope they can find a way to bring it to market cheaply.  If they can't, then it'll be no more than a niche device sold to greenies who want to save the planet, but something that'll never become mainstream.

            Hm...  Sounds VERY reminiscent of how /private/, /for-profit/ contractors perform on government projects.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I've worked for several very large companies, and if I learned anything, it's this: a bureaucracy is a bureaucracy regardless of whether it's private or public.  Private companies have incentives to cut waste only when they are engaged in real competition (i.e. they're not patent-protected, brand-protected, or retail capture-protected: in all of which cases they happily keep the waste and let their customers pick up the tab for it.)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A government agency properly incentivized to cut waste (e.g. by remittance of budgetary savings or /timely/ milestone achievements in the form of salary bonuses), can also become quite optimal in its performance.

            If you increase the number of trees then you would take carbon out of the air, but it remains in the cycle. Since you haven't removed it from the cycle, the trees are almost carbon neutral. I didn't say they are completely neutral, by the way. Read my post carefully. Trees do end up shedding some debris into the ocean and lake bottoms where the carbon may be semi-permanently sequesterd in sediment, but that is a negligable amount. Just changing where the carbon is in the cycle doesn't really remove it, so it's not going to matter how many trees you plant. If you double the number of trees in the world today, then at some point later those trees will all die and return that carbon to the air. You're just moving carbon from one bank account to another with trees. You're not going to get carbon rich or carbon poor in the long run by planting trees. I also think it's funny that you can disagree with me and then say the same thing I said. You just disagree with me out of habit

            By the way, am I the only one here who looked up all the other methods of carbon scrubbing? This way seems very inefficient compared to the methods commonly used in many different real world applications. The exhaust gas from coal power plants is carbon scrubbed with a much more robust method than this.

Lithium is also prohibitively expensive, especially with the rise in demand of recent years, which is projected to accellerate.

            You miss the point. Efficiency is not important. Use of solar power and a government run operation is more important.

            lol, right on. Lets just sue everyone. I'll have to sue myself too of course. The lawyers will love that plan. In just 20 years I'll bet everyone could be a lawyer and we could do absolutely nothing but have trials. That could become the dominant world industry. Of course we would have to eat one another since all the farms would be shut down due to the carbon they produce, so I'm not sure how sustainable such an economy would be. Eventually we would eat everyone though, and then the manmade carbon problem would certainly be cured. Maybe we should start making babies right now, just in case that happens. My girlfriend will be thrilled.

             <br/>
             If carbon emissions over the past 300 years have lead to a +1 degree temperature increase in the past century,  how could removing all that carbon, but 30 TIMES FASTER not have an effect worth mentioning?

            Great point... And I'm somewhat puzzled why more people aren't discussing this. Reminds me of a story posted here just a few days ago about a way to reliable rid ourselves of Mosquitos ( I'm over simplifying ) and while the gut reaction is YEA!! After thinking about it for a second it's a really scary thought not only because of the possible ramifications but because we now have the knowledge to actually pull it off.

            Turn the captured carbon into plastics; we can make products out of them and they're useful before we sequester it (which happens to also be a landfill). We were going to bury garbage anyway. You see what I did there? Two birds with one stone.

            That is because governments grant monopolies to utilities.

            I just 'voted' for DSL over cable internet because I wanted to use the house cable for Direct TV and I chose Direct TV because they are the only source for the international programming we want.
            <br/>
            I can vote for satellite internet if ATT DSL is not satisfactory.

            Honda makes a NG electric generator for home use. It will take you off he electric grid and provide hot water.
            <br/>
            Honda also sells a NG powered car you can refuel at home. How will the state collect taxes?

            Perhaps I'm wrong, about trying to force innovation, however, we can't wait for oil prices to do the forcing as we will never be able to afford the fossil fuel prices required to build 50,000 sq mi or so of solar panels (which is about the same area used for roads in USA),

            natural gas exploration was "forced" by use of incentives. What {I think} we want is an over supply of NG.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since we do concern ourselves with excess CO2, we should ban coal in favor of NG since it can power the grid and cars. By doing so, we would effectively cut CO2 emissions by over half, for far less of a price than imaginable from RE and grid storage, at least in the mean time...

            Not what I was saying.  The carbon neutrality of trees depends on how they are managed.  And the amount of carbon "sequestered", if only in the form of a balanced equation, increases with the actual number of trees.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It is certainly true that when a tree dies, it's carbon is added back into the environment, but another tree can grow and take that much carbon up again.  So, as long as Forests are managed, by increasing planting, it is entirely possible to increase Carbon containment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            More trees growing = more carbon taken out of artmoshere.  That is the distinction I was trying to make, without success-at least as far as you are concerned.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Just as importantly, however, reforestation increases O2 production, maintains biodiversity, enhances the water cycle, cleans water, reduces erosion, provides jobs, et c.,et c. - all of which, I believe we can agree are beneficial in every conceiveable way.  And even more so if properly managed.

            Yeah, mangy, we all know that these enterprises are not models, but they do seem to hang on, don't they -even though they are designed to operate as not-for-profit.
            <br/>
            Especially in the case of the USPS, which our lawmakers allowed to be skimmed of the cream of their business- ie, parcel post, by unregulated private enterprise that could make up the rules as it went along.  Ironically(or maybe not), the vast majority of all parcels(UPS, FedEx, et c.) are transshipped on USPS jets.  Betcha didn't know that, eh?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I'll say it again, one more time, so that you'll have to waste your mangytime with another thoughtless, pointless, baseless, insupportable contradictory assertion:

            I propose an Agency, tasked with the coordinated development/deployment of this tech, both for fuel+energy production, and feedstock(Plastic,Carbon Nanofiber, Graphene, et c.) operated as a not-for-profit, but using the same mark-up as the Petrochem industry currently does, and all revenue generated above operating cost to be used to fund R&amp;D and the rest of government operations and programs that are otherwise taxpayer-funded.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I'll remind everyone that government/civil-service employees pay federal/state/local income taxes just like everyone else- and that in this scenario, one would expect that roughly the same numbers of jobs would be preserved and/or created as currently exist, industry-wide.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            All of the money that is currently siphoned out of the process, AT EVERY STAGE, from extraction to delivery of Fossilfuel products, as income/profit/dividend/deduction/subsidy et c, would equal gov't revenues -ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE greater than current taxes derived from Petro.

            That's like drinking your own urine in the desert. It will keep you alive, for a while. Government's create no wealth.
            <br/>
            Wealth creation from private, free enterprise creates the wealth, the energy, needed for an economy to be sustained and grow. Zimbabwe used to create wealth. Now they don't because the state decided they could raise crops better than the white farmers. Same for Cuba.
            <br/>
            Money and jobs are not wealth. Wealth creates money and jobs.

            Oh Many many more jobs would be created...However, Civil service folks (like me) pay taxes into the same pot of money they take their salaries from...so basically unless they pay more than 100% of their salary in taxes its a money drain on the federal budget isn't it?  Government projects are almost inevitably overstaffed, over budget and over enthusiastic in their benefit projections.

            Actually, marjon, wealth destroys jobs once it's been created.  Only during it's creation, when a new business is building up a market for its new product, does a business create jobs.  In this phase in the life of a market, businesses do not, and can not, act like competitive private enterprises, but as monopolies charging pre-determined prices to cover fixed start-up costs.

            Only once a new set of businesses have grown the market to the fullest extent possible do they begin to compete with each other to bring down inefficiency and spur new innovation.  But this process inherently sheds jobs as automation and new techniques wring every last unneeded man-hour out of the production process.  During this phase, government intervention is absolutely necessary to prevent early winners from absolutely dominating the new market and becoming monopolies in fact, instead of just in practice.

            Finally, once the market is fully mature, only a monopoly will be able to wring any profit out of it, as any competition will inevitably drive any profit margin down to nothing.  For markets as fundamentally necessary and basically unchanging as the markets for food, security and education, this means either extensive government subsidies to encourage private actors to do the work, in which case, their profit margin will match the subsidy and their lobbyists work to raise that subsidy and lower safety, environmental and other costs, or a direct government takeover, as is the case with education and security, whose effectiveness depends on the incentives built into the bureaucratic structure.

            Uh, Dang, AAhhzz01- you got me there, because I DON'T know how much money that is.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Now, I've a question for you:  How much money is represented by the revenue generated across the ENTIRE SECTOR of the petro/coal/chem industry over and above physical operating/administration costs?
            <br/>
            We'll ignore R&amp;D for oil/NG/coal, as there hasn't been any significant innovation in the industry in close to 50 years.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This represents quite a much larger figure than mere individual/corporate income taxes, tarriffs, excise taxes, et c., no?  And not just by a small margin, either.  We're talking an amount very near the entire annual budget of the US Federal government.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            How about that!

            Let's be fair, Cali.  There have been significant advances in the technology to drill/mine for and refine as well as burn all of the major fossil fuels.  If anything, the absolute dominance of the few global oil companies shows that governments need to be very watchful of the monopolistic tendencies of established markets.  They need to favor the emergence of new markets, watch, regulate and mistrust businesses in maturing markets, and subsidize or take over businesses in fully mature markets.  After all, one of the reasons these big companies are still on top is that only they, of all private actors, have the money to do R&amp;D, and so only they get to use the new innovations for a long time, and thus only they get all the new profits such innovation brings, and become even better at keeping any new competition out of the market.

             Actually, marjon, wealth destroys jobs once it's been created.  Only during it's creation, when a new business is building up a market for its new product, does a business create jobs.  In this phase in the life of a market, businesses do not, and can not, act like competitive private enterprises, but as monopolies charging pre-determined prices to cover fixed start-up costs.

            They can try. Apple is a 'monopoly' as it is the manufacturer of the Ixxxx.
            <br/>
            But there are numerous competitors.
            <br/>
            How does wealth destroy jobs? Paul Allen is using his wealth to create a private space travel business. Richard Branson is joining him. Wealth creates the opportunity for risk which creates new industries and technologies and jobs and the cycle grows. Until a government steps in and decides to tax that wealth and destroy innovation and more wealth creation.

            In 2005, Exxon sold 26e9 gallons of gas which was taxed at $.25/gal. From Exxon gas sales alone, governments took in +$4e9.

            Apple is a psuedomonopoly, as is Microsoft.  Insofar as consumers are purchasing a good based on "brand name" or other such proprietary features, the business selling those goods is a kind of monopoly.  After all, no one else sells Coca-Cola or Windows but Coca-Cola Inc. and Microsoft respectively.  Wealth can only create new jobs insofar as it creates new markets and new products.  This is what Branson and Allen are trying to do.  Within established markets, the innovation wealth purchases only reduces the number of jobs needed to maintain or increase output, and works to actively decrease wages by moving jobs to lower wage environs, increasing labor supply (which lowers wages), and increasing competition within the labor market, which also has a depressing effect on wages.  Capitalism is the theory which explains the operation of maturing or mature markets.  It has nothing at all to say about the primary means of wealth creation: the creation of new markets and new products.

            Those industries are not at all mature, and do not operate on a basis of pure competition.  Brand loyalty is very high, and there's constant new innovations and new products.  I mean, hell, there's a new gum out there that changes flavors as you chew.  That's proprietary, it'll take a while for competitors to figure out how to copy it, and if they try they can run afoul of patent laws.  So long as only one company can make flavor-changing gum, that company has a monopoly on the flavor-changing gum market.  That has a lot of implications with how those sorts of businesses are run, i.e. by setting prices before hand (not by letting the market set the price) in order to recoup fixed costs associated with opening up a new market.

            In fact, most businesses compete with one another in this way, a race to open up a new market and hold onto a monopoly in it long enough to recoup costs and make a profit, rather than the way you think, by cutting their prices or raising the quality of their product in an attempt to outsell a competitor's essentially identical product.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Once a market has matured enough to allow such direct competition, and provided there is no collusion between businesses or corruption in government oversight preventing monopolies, profit margins always start falling, and only start coming up again when one or more of the competing companies innovate new products and open up new markets.

            A market is maturing when the number of new consumers for the good being sold start slowing down.  When no net new consumers are being added to the market (adjusted for population growth) the market is fully mature.  Most markets never fully mature.  Usually, some other market subsumes them, making the old product virtually non-existent.  The buggy-whip industry is definitely mature.  The only way to make money manufacturing buggy-whips is to operate as a monopoly, set your prices beforehand to cover your fixed costs and a reasonable amount of profit so you can afford to keep making them.

            This new technology has a great deal of promise to maintain or increase the standard of living for nearly everybody, and after all, isn't that what the wealth of nations is all about?  The problem here is that, aside from the ability to produce fuel from carbon monoxide, there doesn't appear to be any way to price the benefit to individual consumers.  Everybody's made better off and nobody has to buy anything except someone has to pay for the new technology and its implementation.  It's rather like public wi-fi in certain areas in some towns and cities.  Either the tech has to become cheap enough that a private company can "donate" it, or it has to be provided by the government.  Lots of goods are like that, other people's health, air quality, water quality, and many others.

            Even if this reaction works, I think this ludicrous.  Start with their assumptions, starting with concentrating the sun's energy by a factor of 500 (necessary to clean the atmosphere in 10 years).  No problem their, eh. Yep, you can do it for a square meter, but for 700 square kilometers?  A mirror system that was 100% efficient would be 1/2 the size of Texas.
            <br/>
            Then assume you built that what do you do with 30,000,000 cubic meters (700 million tons) of solid carbon you split out each day?  Fuel, eh?  How big is the factory that does that?

            Perhaps we'll find a more effecient way to make carbon fiber as a more common building material.  This should lock the carbon up for an extended period of time until it is land-filled.  The binders for carbon fiber might be an issue though.

            I like the comment debate on economics.  Thrasymachus has it pretty much exactly right, Marjon almost nothing right at all but a Friedmanesque / Austrian School /Chicago School neo-con idea which has been clearly and dramatically proven wrong everywhereits been fully tested.  Chile, Argentina, Brazil in the mid-1900's are perfect examples.  Those countries lost half a century being forced by Chicago School neo-con economists, backed by US force and World Bank threats, to test the theories.  Their economies eventually totally collapsed.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Properly run government has a LOT to provide to all citizens.  The only argument Marjon has is that he can use the US government as an example of problems. For examples of much better run governments see Sweden, Norway or Canada.

            "The con of the decade (Part II) involves sheltering the Power Elites' income while raising taxes on the debt-serfs to pay the interest owed the Power Elites.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Con of the Decade (Part II) meshes neatly with the first Con of the Decade. Yesterday I described how the financial Plutocracy can transfer ownership of the Federal government's income stream via using the taxpayer's money to buy the debt that the taxpayers borrowed to bail out the Plutocracy."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In order for the con to work, however, the Power Elites and their politico toadies in Congress, the Treasury and the Fed must convince the peasantry that low tax rates on unearned income are not just "free market capitalism at its best" but that they are also "what the country needs to get moving again."
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The first step of the con was successfully fobbed off on the peasantry in 2001: lower the taxes paid by the most productive peasants marginally while massively lowering the effective taxes paid by the financial Plutocracy."

            Actually they're called incentivizing camps. That was the old socialism which was actually a brutal form of martial law, meant to discourage those who wanted socialism before the world was ready for it. The same reason organized crime took over the labor unions- to make sure they didn't turn red.

            You'll like the new socialism. No money-grubbing, no pointless waste, no exploitation, everybody content with what they already have. Only experts running govt, the way it obviously ought to be.

            If it was up your mangyhole, you'd know where it was.  However, since you have such a rabid, atavistic fear of the mere concept, allow me to enlighten you:  Denmark, Sweden, Norway- for example.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ironic, is it not, mangy?  That the Vikings of old are such exemplars of the Way Of Socialism, and of living such civilised lives, being the descendants of your very own Ancestoors, and all?
            <br/>

A recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute indicates that Sweden s real unemployment rate is around 15 percent. McKinsey reached its conclusions by including those who want to work and those could do so, meaning people on government programmes as well as those on prolonged sick leave, according to the Financial Times.

            "High marginal tax rates discourage work effort, saving, and investment, and promote tax avoidance and tax evasion."
            <br/>
            "The economic benefits of ERTA were summarized by President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers in 1994: "It is undeniable that the sharp reduction in taxes in the early 1980s was a strong impetus to economic growth.""
            <br/>
            "eduction in high marginal tax rates can induce taxpayers to lessen their reliance on tax shelters and tax avoidance, and expose more of their income to taxation. The result in this case was a 51 percent increase in real tax payments by the top one percent. Meanwhile, the tax rate reduction reduced the tax payments of middle class and poor taxpayers. The net effect was a marked shift in the tax burden toward the top 1 percent amounting to about 10 percentage points. Lower top marginal tax rates had encouraged these taxpayers to generate more taxable income. "

            If this pans out the benefit would be clear. If you can turn CO2 into fuel or carbon for storage using solar power you can control temperature to some limited degree. Keep in mind that CO2 has very little impact on temperature beyond the first 10 parts/million but you can use the waste carbon in the atmosphere to produce fuel without the permission of Chavez or the Saudis. But you would have the option of converting a lot of CO2 and sequestering it in a fairly permanent state, if that was needed.

            The major error in your thinking, marjon, is that you think that the use of markets as a means of distributing resources and creating wealth and the presence of a strong, regulative government are mutually exclusive.  Among the reasons the Scandinavian and other European countries have markets that outperform ours in terms of wealth and job creation is that they have a strong government presence in their markets that have a good track record of making and keeping things fair.  Markets can't exist without a government, and different markets require different kinds of intervention.  But every time any market has been attempted with no government intervention or regulation, it takes virtually no time at all for the situation to devolve into a "biggest scammer wins" type of game.

            If you dig a bit, any outperformance is due to limiting government interference.

            Government can help, if they are limited in power, which limits their corruptability.

            No, they don't, they are invariably taken over by the biggest, baddest guys around, and forced to pay "taxes" for "protection."  Every time.  Governments are what happens when the people who want to be able to trade with one another fairly and freely join forces to keep the thugs from taking over.  Then, shysters and conmen make their way in, selling snake oil as medicine, and run off with wads of cash before the "market" can take care of them, hurting consumers and honest sellers alike.  Governments help there too, by regulating the kinds and availability of trades that can take place, making sure it's hard to scam customers or sellers.  Finally, sometimes, people's trading or consuming harms others unintentionally.  Governments have a role here as well, as a fair place to redress grievances against one another.

            I'm not really interested in getting my guns out to go hunt evil-doers down.  There are no good o'le days.  To romanticise such times is a fallacy in my opinion.

            As for government regulation; I remember Uncle Billy Clinton pounding on a pulpet during a speech stating he will do whatever it takes to de-regulate the banking industry - to free up the money for the common man.  Well, he did and the housing market and economy went wild for a while, but Uncle W. Bush got stuck with the blame five years later after folks started discovering they couldn't pay for houses that cost 5 times their annual gross income.

            I'm all for "sensible" regulation to keep economic playgrounds equitable, and to protect the public.  For some reason we keep getting into the All-or-Nothing mentality.  Too much regulation (All) is bad and no regulation (nothing) is worse.  The trick is to find what Goldilocks was looking for "Just right".  Sensible regulation that protects the public, even from themselves.

            The banking industry was not de-regulated. It was forced to accommodate new 'incentives', new 'regulations'.

            The most sensible regulation is to let the markets do it.

Naturally, this is on the condition that we willingly submit to the rules and refuse the temptation of the jungle and of untamed capitalism. The market, to borrow Winston Churchill's famous phrase about democracy, is the worst solution, except for all the others. "

            Based upon this definition, corruption requires a the coercive power of a state.

            There is little or no chance a company can be corruptible without 'help' from some government.

            What would you call J.D. Rockefeller absolutely refusing to sell his competitors the right to finish their oil pipeline, as it went underneath his railroad tracks, at any price?  And what would you call his behavior when, after he learned that they were manually pumping their oil from the pipe, carting the oil across his tracks, and manually pumping it into the other side, he ordered his trains to be parked in the way of the cart path, making it impossible for them to use their pipeline?  Personally, I call it corrupt, and it didn't take any government to give him the ability or the authority to do that.

             The banking industry was not de-regulated. It was forced to accommodate new 'incentives', new 'regulations'.

             The most sensible regulation is to let the markets do it.

             The job of the government is to prosecute theft and fraud. It failed miserably with Madoff and meddled where it shouldn't, government backed and promoted mortgages.

            <br/>
            <br/>
            Ok, so the banking industry wasn't completely deregulated - a valid argument.  However the rules were changed so that everyone (the market) had access to money they simply could not afford to pay back.  The whole sector lost its collective mind.  Effectively the market was liberalized to the point that the brakes were off.  It was a feeding frenzy and we are now paying for our excesses.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            As for Madoff; I have difficulty defining any significant difference between what he did and what governments do via taxation - Except with him you could legally say no.

            "Thats because most analysts contend that Californias regulations actually created the problem. Foremost among them was the law that fixed pricing for retail with market pricing for wholesale, which made it difficult to maintain profitability."
            <br/>
            "One essential fact is that the problems in California were not created by deregulation, but by strong regulatory rules, said James Sweeney, a Stanford University professor and author of The California Energy Crisis."

            People being able to sue companies that commit fraud is also a form of government regulation.  See, there's this thing called law that defines fraudulent practices.  There's a process during a civil trail called "discovery" when certain kinds of evidence, defined by law, can be subpoenaed, and during which, certain practices are forbidden by law.  The very notion of being able to sue a company for violating your rights implies a strong, proactive regulatory government.

            (Rockefeller}prospered quickly in the intensely competitive industry due to the economic excellence of its entire operations. Instead of buying oil from jobbers, they made the jobbers' profit by sending their own purchasing men into the oil region. They also made their own sulfuric acid, barrels, lumber, wagons, and glue. They kept minute and accurate records of every item from rivets to barrel bungs. They built elaborate storage facilities near their refineries. Rockefeller bargained as shrewdly for crude as anyone has before or since; and Sam Andrews coaxed more kerosene from a barrel of crude than the competition could. In addition, the Rockefeller firm put out the cleanest burning kerosene and managed to profitably dispose of most of the residues, in the form of lubricating oil, paraffin wax, and Vaseline.[24]

            "Because of Standard Oil's superior efficiency (and lower prices), the company's share of the refined petroleum market rose from 4 percent in 1870 to 25 percent in 1874 and to about 85 percent in 1880.[27]"

            As my source stated, Ida's was trying to protect her brother's company because he could not compete.

            That is what happens in a highly regulated market and in other facets of life today. If companies or people can't compete they whine to the state to protect them. So schools stop failing students and little league teams can't keep score.

            Look at our legal code. Half the laws implanted there from the labor revolution at the turn of the century reflects the people's displeasure with the giant trusts that infiltrated our government. The banking industry did it again just recently and demo'ed our GDP and balance sheets. And you want to relax the regulations even more.

            "n 1885, John D. Rockefeller wrote one of his partners, Let the good work go on. We must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good. Or as he put it to another partner: Hope we can continue to hold out with the best illuminator in the world at the lowest price."
            <br/>
            "Even after 20 years in the oil business, the best . . . at the lowest price was still Rockefellers goal; his Standard Oil Company had already captured 90 per cent of Americas oil refining and had pushed the price down from 58 cents to eight cents a gallon."
            <br/>
            "Consumers were not only choosing Standard Oil over that of his competitors; they were also preferring it to coal oil, whale oil, and electricity. Millions of Americans illuminated their homes with Standard Oil for one cent per hour; in doing so, they made Rockefeller the wealthiest man in American history. "

            "Secretary Mellon knew that high tax rates caused the tax base to contract and that lower rates would boost economic growth. In 1924, Mellon noted: "The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business." He received strong support from President Coolidge, who argued that "the wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful." "

            "But detailed Internal Revenue Service data show that the across-the-board rate cuts of the early 1920s-including large cuts at the top end-resulted in greater tax payments and a larger tax share paid by those with high incomes."

            "Hes not alone. In the last decade, half of the police and firefighters who retired in Yonkers collected pensions that exceeded their base pay, in (at least one case) by as much as 75%.

            <br/>
            Dont blame the officers. New Yorks pension rules make it pay more to retire than to work. And the horrible habits here are a window on a national pension picture thats looking more disastrous by the day.

            Funny how you seem to determine my stance before you ask me. You're assuming some sort of great opposition that I don't think I can provide. I don't think the government should be in the housing market as a mortgage insurer. I don't think the government should have it's hands in business. I think the government should simply write the rules that businesses adhere to and uphold the court system to address those rules and contracts.

            No, moron, those pension plans were formerly backed by treasuries, and other(formerly) stable, long-term investments, and so the funds accrued reliably.
            <br/>
            Governments, Municipalities, Universities, and many large corporations and Unions typically under-contributed to the plans, borrowed against them, or raided them, and then, in the most recent couple of decades, abandoned safe, low-yield instruments like Treasuries, et c, for the siren call of high-profit hedge funds, CDOs, and the rest of the proverbial "complex financial instruments", all based on your wonderful freemarket's "notional value" of lipsticked collateralised DEBT.
            <br/>
            The failure of these investments to produce a return, coupled with under-contribution, liens, raids, and fund-manager bonuses and admin costs are what wrecked what were solid pension and retirement plan funds.
            <br/>
            When these eventualities became apparent, Private enterprise, at least, were the first to dump them off on the government to honor in their stead.

            Actually that'd be because of the population statistics primarily. All the baby boomers are retiring and taking their social security while the smaller next generation isn't large enough, or well employed enough to keep up with inflation.

            It takes a lot of us to vote out corruption, the problem is they are replaced by more corruption and stupidity.  Politics is a game, and we aren't even pawns.  Often we don't even know who to point at.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            An example: I own some land in Nevada that requires I drive on BLM land to get to it.  I have to yearly pay for the right of way.  I have no issue with this.  This year, some bone head in the present administration decided we would pay for the next 10 years worth of access, all at one time.  Where is their money going to come from 5 - 7 years from now?  What do you want to bet that in a few years another administration will be needing the funds they were deprived of by the present administraion?

            Marjon, do you deny that it was ultimately only the onset of WWII that lifted the US out of the Great Depression?  I don't want to hear your rhetoric about the morality of war or veiled allusions to Stalin or Hitler, a simple yes or no will do.

            But not just that, SH.  The lasting effects of having nearly every able-bodied man employed and paid wages for over four years, the income earned by women who took their places in the office and the assembly line, and the benefits they secured for themselves such as the G.I. bill and VA benefits were responsible for the prolonged growth of our domestic markets post-WWII, and indirectly responsible for the continuing growth through the 70s and 80s with the advent of computers, and in the 90s with the Internet.  The draft gave the middle and lower classes a jump start that has paid dividends ever since.  And you don't need a war to have the government give anyone who wants a job a job with a good wage and benefits.  It would have the same economic effect, and no killing people.

            The USSR claimed to have 100% employment. Old ladies swept the streets everyday.
            <br/>
            The USA has been giving away money in the 'war on poverty'. No progress has been made since 1965.
            <br/>
            The war was productive only in the sense that it provided a vital govt function, defense.
            <br/>
            After the war, there was pent up demand and no other production capacity in the world.
            <br/>
            But the government DID ease its tax policies and trade policies that started and prolong the Depression in the first place.
            <br/>
            The data is there for all to see, govt tax cuts in the 20s, 40s, 60s, 80s 2001 stimulated economic growth, and , unfortunately more tax revenue inspiring MORE govt spending.
            <br/>
            So keep raising taxes and the govt will go broke, as is happening now.

            The data shows just the opposite.  Hoover's tax cuts and deregulation exacerbated the irresponsible practices of speculative investors, which were the primary cause of the Depression in the first place.  His refusal to increase domestic spending made the situation unbearable for the majority of Americans.  Wealth and the means of production had become ensconced in the hands of very few.  The New Deal redistributed some of this wealth to the middle class, and once they had money to spend and save, their economic activity created much more wealth.  The very wealthy weren't in the driver's seat in this expansion, they were just along for the ride, and yet benefited very greatly as well.

            <br/>
            "Struggling to keep its budget under control after the financial crisis, the government in June cut into its benefits system, the worlds most generous, by limiting unemployment payments to two years instead of four. Having found that recipients either get work right away or take any job as their checks run out, {Imagine, people respond to incentives!}officials are also redoubling longstanding efforts to move Danes more quickly out of the safety net.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The cold fact is that the longer you are out of a job, the more difficult it is to get a job, Claus Hjort Frederiksen, the Danish finance minister, said during an interview. Four years of unemployment is a luxury we can no longer allow ourselves. "

            Yes, even those happy, socialist Danes understand that their economy was derailed by the same unregulated freimarket greed that that left most of the developed world raped and bleeding.  If your country's economy doesn't generate enough tax revenue, government services have to be scaled back, or financed by additional debt.  Has nothing to do with government control, and everything to do with the lack thereof.

            Is tax revenue created out of thin air? (It is now in the USA as the Fed starts to monatize the debt.)
            <br/>
            It is the free market that creates the wealth for the government to tax. When the government strangles the goose, it stops laying golden eggs.
