               <p>
                Lately we have been dealing with a lot of knots AKA "rats" in Adah's hair. My husband was getting frustrated with me because he wanted me to go buy her some detangler. Since I have been on this oily journey, my eyes have been opened to all the chemicals that are used in things that we all use everyday without even thinking about it. I try very hard to do everything I can to do non-toxic products...(It has been a process...but we are doing it 1 thing at a time!)
               </p>
               <p>
                I saw a friend post about some DIY Detangler, so I decided to give it a try. IT WORKS!!!!!!! Even my husband is impressed! Here is the recipe:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 Fill 8oz glass spray bottle 1/4 of the way with Apple Cider Vinegar (2 oz)
                </li>
                <li>
                 1 Tsp. Jojoba Oil
                </li>
                <li>
                 10 drops of Lemon Essential Oil
                </li>
                <li>
                 10 drops of Lavender Essential Oil
                </li>
                <li>
                 Fill the rest of bottle with distilled water
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                That's it! 5 ingredients that we all can pronounce! Shake the bottle each time before use. It works great!
               </p>
               <p>
                So, you may be wondering why these specific ingredients?
               </p>
               <p>
                Apple cider vinegar is a natural conditioner. It helps to fight frizz and may also have the ability to promote hairgrowth...(PLUS, its just good for you- who hasn't heard about all the great benefits of ACV?).
               </p>
               <p>
                Jojoba oil is pretty close molecularly to the oil our scalp naturally produces. It also adds shine and elasticity.
               </p>
               <p>
                Lavender Essential Oil helps with shine and reduce dryness. It also may help promote hair growth. It also makes it smell good! (Bonus!)
               </p>
               <p>
                Lemon Essential Oil helps with excess oily hair by bringing back a more natural ph balance.
               </p>
               <p>
                I was VERY Concerned about the "Vinegar" smell. But I will tell you that it does stink while applying it, but once Adah's hair has dryed, the smell is gone!
               </p>

                You probably wondered why my blog is named Oils and Trees.
                <span>
                </span>
                The oil part is pretty easy, Essential Oils.
                <span>
                </span>
                But the Tree.what is that all about?
                <span>
                </span>
                It is how God teaches me and speaks to me.
                <span>
                </span>
                In the spring of 2010 God first introduced Trees to me.
                <span>
                </span>
                I was 35 years old at that time.
                <span>
                </span>
                Trees had never had any significance in my life up to that point.
                <span>
                </span>
               </p>
               <p>
                In August of 2009 I came to the end of me.
                <span>
                </span>
                I literally hit my knees in defeat.
                <span>
                </span>
                My life was a complete mess, I was lost and very broken.
                <span>
                </span>
                I hit my knees and asked God to help me.
                <span>
                </span>
                I just said I cant do this anymore, please help.
                <span>
                </span>
                That was it.
                <span>
                </span>
                Very simple and urgent.
                <span>
                </span>
                I immediately felt peace come all over my body.
                <span>
                </span>
                I was instantly changed from that moment.
                <span>
                </span>
                God had been pursing me for all my life.
                <span>
                </span>
                I just had to be broken enough to need Him.
                <span>
                </span>
                I can look at my life and see Him in all of it.
                <span>
                </span>
                Not that He caused me to have a mess of my life, I caused a mess of my life, but I see His gentle hand in all the circumstances.
                <span>
                </span>
                I see where certain situations were allowed so that I could be pushed forward, toward God.
                <span>
                </span>
               </p>
               <p>
                I want to also note here that when I say Instantly changed I dont mean that I was perfect.
                <span>
                </span>
                I was far from perfect and still am to this day.
                <span>
                </span>
                But what I mean is that my Spirit was made perfect.
                <span>
                </span>
                When you accept Jesus as your savior and ask Him to become the Lord of your life, your spirit is sealed and made perfect.
                <span>
                </span>
                My flesh and mind were not made perfect.
                <span>
                </span>
                I believe that we have a Spirit, Mind and Body (flesh).
                <span>
                </span>
                I wont get into all the scripture behind all of that on this post, but I know my spirit was made perfect in Jesus that day in August 2009.

                I started going to church and slowly learning about the word of God.
                <span>
                </span>
                I was learning how to pray and seek God.
                <span>
                </span>
                Sometime in February 2010 (About 6 months after I was saved/born again) God gave me a vision.
                <span>
                </span>
                I honestly didnt even know what a vision was, I was that new.
                <span>
                </span>
                I didnt grow up in church at all.
                <span>
                </span>
                So, I was a baby Christian.
                <span>
                </span>
                I was at work helping with some written testing sessions for Firefighters.
                <span>
                </span>
                I was moderating the testing.
                <span>
                </span>
                My co-worker, Melanie, who God used to help get me saved, was there with me.
                <span>
                </span>
                (Side note: Melanie had asked God about a year earlier who she should witness to, God told her me and a family member of hers- I think this is important to note because God is so good, He has His hand in all things and wants us to come to the saving knowledge of Him).

                Melanie asked me if I wanted a book to read, to help pass the time.

                I told her sure.
                <span>
                </span>
                She pulled a book out of her purse.
                <span>
                </span>
                It was called the practice of the presence OF GOD by Brother Lawrence.
                <span>
                </span>
                <span>
                </span>
                I opened the book and read the very first page.
                <span>
                </span>
                As I was reading this part:
               </p>
               <p>
                He had told me that it had all happened one winter day, as he was looking at a barren tree.
                <span>
                </span>
                Although the trees leaves were indeed gone, he knew that they would soon reappear, followed by blossoms and then fruit.
                <span>
                </span>
                This gave him a profound impression of Gods providence and power, which never left him
               </p>
               <p>
                That's when God gave me a vision.
                <span>
                </span>
                Again, while it was happening, I had no idea what was going on.
                <span>
                </span>
                I now know it was a vision, at the time I didnt.
                <span>
                </span>
                God immediately showed me 3 trees.
                <span>
                </span>
                The first was barren, dead looking, no leaves or signs of life.
                <span>
                </span>
                The next one he showed me was a tree that was starting to grow, it was starting to get leaves and looked like a spring tree.
                <span>
                </span>
                The last one God showed me was a tree in full bloom with a ton of fruit.
                <span>
                </span>
                Then God said to me As you walk with me, you will always be in one of these 3 seasons.
                <span>
                </span>
                You wont stay in one season, you will move in and out of them all throughout your life.
                <span>
                </span>
                That was it.
                <span>
                </span>
                I remember looking around me to see if anyone else just saw and heard what I saw.no one did. It was quickly obvious that something extraordinary had just happened to me.
                <span>
                </span>
                Also- God told me to draw them, the trees, to display them so that I can use this story as a witness.
                <span>
                </span>
                I have shared this story many, many times, but I have not drawn those trees yet.
                <span>
                </span>
                God reminds me that delayed obedience is disobedience.
                <span>
                </span>
                I will blog my trees when I have them drawn and displayed in my home.

                What God has ministered to my heart from that vision is incredible.
                <span>
                </span>
                He shows me all the time how trees, roots, leaves, oils (the life blood of the trees, plants, etc.) branches, soil, weeds, water, sun all reflect the Gospel.

               <p>
                5 Years ago today my life changed forever.
                <span>
                </span>
                God introduced me to my husband, Phillip AKA Nick.
                <span>
                </span>
                In August 2009 I hit my knees (literally) in defeat and asked Jesus to come into my heart and to be the Lord over my life.
                <span>
                </span>
                The Lord immediately started working in my heart (and has been ever since!).
                <span>
                </span>
                One of the first things God showed me in scripture is about marriage.
                <span>
                </span>
                At that particular time in my life, I had been in a 3 year relationship with a man, we were not married and we did live together.
                <span>
                </span>
                He wasnt the only one either, so I had figured out that Scripture was clear about marriage.
                <span>
                </span>
                In my heart I knew I wanted to be married, however I knew that I could not pick them.
                <span>
                </span>
                The joke was My picker was broke.it was, trust me.
                <span>
                </span>
                So, I told God very early in my walk with Him that I would seek His face and follow Him. That He was all I needed.
                <span>
                </span>
                I told God that I didnt trust my ability to pick a mate, so He would have to pick AND HE would have to drop him in my lap so I knew without a doubt that the man I was to marry came from God only.
                <span>
                </span>
                God knew I had a desire in my heart to marry, I trusted that God put that desire there.
                <span>
                </span>
                So, I trusted He would give me a mate when He was ready.
                <span>
                </span>
               </p>
               <p>
                In February of 2010, God gave me a vision of 3 trees.
                <span>
                </span>
                It rocked my world, AND I told everyone who would listen about the vision and what God had taught me.

                (A blog post about that vision will be posted in the next few days).
                <span>
                </span>
                One of the people who I told my 3 Tree story to was Linda Williams.
                <span>
                </span>
                She was a co-worker with me.
                <span>
                </span>
                She had watched me deep in my sin and watched me come out of it as I gave my life to Christ.
                <span>
                </span>
                She had a neighbor named Phillip.
                <span>
                </span>
                One day, Phillip was at her house and was talking with Roger (Lindas Husband) about God.
                <span>
                </span>
                Phillip was explaining to Roger about roots of trees, leaves of trees and branches of trees and the biblical truths of those things.
                <span>
                </span>
                As Phillip was talking, Linda heard God clearly tell her Tell him about Jennifer. Linda told me later that she had an internal conversation going with herself- I dont fix people up, that is not my thing. Then as she was having this internal conversation, God said AGAIN Tell him about Jennifer.
                <span>
                </span>
                She said at that point it was clear that God meant what He was saying and she was to be obedient to His request.
                <span>
                </span>
                So, she said to Phillip,  I have a friend named Jennifer that is on fire for God, I think you should meet her.
               </p>
               <p>
                Later that day Phillip texted me.
                <span>
                </span>
                We decided to meet up and have Andys Frozen Custard.
                <span>
                </span>
                On this day, 5 years ago, I was introduced to my husband.
                <span>
                </span>
                I didnt immediately know that He was the one that God sent, but God revealed it to me pretty quickly. God has had His hand in every single step of our marriage, which is such a blessing.
                <span>
                </span>
                We both will tell you that we would not have picked each other, thankfully God knew what He was doing!
               </p>
               <p>
                I had no idea that day at Andys Frozen Custard how much a blessing God had given me in my husband.
                <span>
                </span>
                He is the strongest Godly man I know today and have ever known.
                <span>
                </span>
                He leads our family every single day and makes the hard decisions after he has sought Gods face for direction.
                <span>
                </span>
                He loves God with all his heart and chases fearlessly after God.
                <span>
                </span>
                I am in awe of him really.
                <span>
                </span>
                He isnt perfect, neither am I, but He is perfect for me.
                <span>
                </span>
                He has loved me through my sanctification (I think the fact that God actually showed him a vision of me after God has sanctified me has helped tremendously) because I have not always been easy and have had A LOT of growing to do.
                <span>
                </span>
                He works hard every single day for us.
                <span>
                </span>
                He provides so that I can stay at home and be with Adah.
                <span>
                </span>
                He is wise and even though he doesnt feel like I always listen to him, I do.
                <span>
                </span>
                He is the BEST father I have ever witnessed, Adah is so very beyond blessed, he makes up for my lack as a mamma.

                According to Webster Dictionary re-deem-ing (Adjective) :
                <br/>
                making a bad or unpleasant thing or person better or more acceptable.
               </p>
               <p>
                Galations 3:13-14 NIV Christ REDEEMED us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole." He REDEEMED us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
               </p>
               <p>
                WOW...powerful scripture.
               </p>
               <p>
                All around me are families who are hurting. Moms and Dads. They have teenage or young adult children who are making really bad choices. Choices that, as parents, we know there will be consequences for. I don't have a ton of experience being a parent yet, I am just 2 years into it. But, I am in my early 40's so I do have some life wisdom taught to me by God along the way.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is what I know for sure. God is a REDEEMER. If you get nothing from this blog post, please get that point. He REDEEMS us. If you know God at all, then you "Know" this fact. However, when your kids are making bad choices and you are emotionally tied to them and you are on that rollercoaster ride with them and their choices, it can be hard to remember this very important truth. God REDEEMS. Remember the parable of the Lost sheep?
               </p>
               <p>
                Jesus said: " Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says "Rejoice with me, I have found my lost sheep. Luke 15:4-6
               </p>
               <p>
                What a beautiful promise from Jesus in the scriptures. He cares. He notices what is going on in the lives of our children. He will go find them, that is what He does, that is what scripture says.
               </p>
               <p>
                I lived this. I was that lost sheep. I didn't come to a saving knowledge of Christ until I was 35. I had created quite the mess of my life. Although it always looked "Put together on the outside" it wasn't. At all. I made really bad choices. But I am here to tell you that I can see where God had his hand on my life. Every step of the way. Even when I was deep in sin and I am sure grieving God's heart, I know that He didn't leave me. I know He didn't. None of us want our children to experience pain, we would gladly take that pain for them, if we could. But the truth still remains, God REDEEMS. No decision is too bad that God will turn His back. The only sin that will separate a person from eternal life from God is the sin of unbelief. If you reject Christ. That is it.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, as parents, the most important job we have is to raise them up to know God. Then, once we have done that, we trust the promise God made us. That if our kids make bad choices, God will go after them, like the lost sheep.

                And so it has begun....honestly, I was the one who wasn't ready. I guess its the fear of the unknown. Plus, if I am totally honest, a fear of "what if's"..
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 What if I can't do it
                </li>
                <li>
                 What if I mess it up and she takes a really long time
                </li>
                <li>
                 what if I already missed my window of "opportunity"
                </li>
                <li>
                 what if she is resistant
                </li>
                <li>
                 what if I don't have the patience for it
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                So, my husband started the process and we are knee deep now! I am glad he did actually, I would have probably put it off for a very long time. So, we came home from church on Sunday (Mother's Day) and he saw Adah grab at her crotch area and asked her if she wanted to go potty, she said "yes" enthusiastically! He took her, put her on the potty and she went pee! YAY! I knew then, it was time.
               </p>
               <p>
                We had bought her a sit on potty that had a sensor in it that would say "Hooray!" when it got wet AKA she went pee. We had been introducing that to her for probably 6 months. We would put her on it at night before bath to get her familiar with it. We also had panties that we bought that we started putting on her. We went through different stages with the potty and underwear. Sometimes she wanted to wear them, sometimes she refused. Sometimes she wanted to sit on the potty and other times she would refuse. I had talked to a friend who has potty trained 5 kids, she highly suggested I get the potty insert. So, I did. I found one that had Elmo on it, Score! So, on Sunday, we used the first potty we bought as a step stool for the big toilet and put her Elmo insert in, that is where she used the bathroom. If you come to our house, you will have to move the step stool and remove the Elmo insert, we are in full training mode!
               </p>
               <p>
                Sunday: After church she went on the potty, we took her diaper off and she has been in panties ever since! She went in the toilet another time that evening and had a few accidents. All in all, a good first day.
               </p>
               <p>
                Monday: She slept through the night and was dry when she woke! (She had been doing that for the last month on and off). She held her pee until she had been awake for 2 hours, she kept grabbing herself and would go a little, enough to change her panties, but wouldn't release. She finally did release on the potty! We figured out "praise" is how we are going to reward her. She loves praise. Around lunch she went #2, I immediately praised her and she stopped, and kept doing a little at a time, each time praising her and letting her wipe and flush. We only allow her to wipe or flush unless she does something (This seems to be a motivator). Around dinner she did pee in her panties and when I went to change her, she had done #2 also, I didn't catch it because we were in the middle of dinner.
               </p>
               <p>
                Tuesday: She stayed dry all night again. She held her pee for 2 hours again, but this time she was in pain, I could tell. She would grab herself. I am not sure how to make her release it. I assume she will just learn to and get more comfortable as we continue this process. She had several accidents. She did pee once on the potty. No #2 bowel movement today.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wednesday: She woke up at 7am, I wanted her up early since MDO (Mom's Day out) starts at 9:30 and she had been taking 2 hours before she would pee in the mornings. I took her in a few times between 7-9am but she didn't go. I asked her several times. Then it was time to go to MDO and she wanted to put her coat on, so I told her she could put her coat on after she went pee in the toilet, then we would go to MDO. She climbed up on the pottyand finally went pee!! Hallelujah! She did great at MDO, she only had 1 accident, she went #2 in her panties.
               </p>
               <p>
                Fast forward one week.
               </p>
               <p>
                Today is Wednesday (in her 2nd week of training)and she had ZERO accidents!!! Yay! She even told me she needed to go #2 while she was in her bath tonight, so I put her on the potty and she went #2... Yay!!! She got a lot of praise when she did that. She has been great all week about going potty but #2 has been an issue. Each time she would do it in her panties and not tell me I would show her the soiled panties and in true Adah fashion she would say "What happened?" (She says that phrase all day long...such a funny girl!) Then I would tell her "What happened" and then tell her what should have happened. I would do it lovingly and tell her next time to tell me she has to poop and we can put it in the toilet instead of her underwear. Well, it worked, she finally did it tonight on her own! Now we just need to practice that and we will be good!
               </p>
               <p>
                I know this "adventure" is probably not completely over, but I feel like we have a great foundation established. Tonight at dinner I told her to take off her clothes (we were having spaghetti and I always make her strip down) she got upset because I took off her panties....(they were white and I didn't want the red stains on them) but she wanted her panties on, so she ate her spaghetti in her white panties. I have no idea if she got sauce on them, it really doesn't matter in the big scheme, the important thing is she wanted them on.
               </p>
               <p>
                I had to pray a lot...my instinct when she would stand there staring at me and just pee, was to yell and make her stop. But, I knew if I did, it would make this a longer and harder process. I really had to pray, because its a normal instinct to want to address it (at least it felt normal to me). Luckily she only did that a few times.
               </p>
               <p>
                For all the mamma's out there having a little anxiety about this process, like I did, it really wasn't that bad. I kept running this thought through my head each time she would have an accident "She won't still be doing this when she goes to college" just breathe and trust this is only a short season.
               </p>
               <p>
                Happy Potty Training moms!!

                This is my 3rd Mother's Day as a Mother. I spent most of my 41 years on this earth as a daughter, granddaughter and daughter-in-law. This year I seem to have such a different perspective. My first year as a Mom on Mother's day I was a brand new mom, just a few months in and the only thing I really remember was that I was tired and stressed out. Last year we traveled to Colorado and spent time as a family together. This year has been different for me. More emotional, more real. I know that its because I am finally out of the "fog" I feel like I was in for the first year and a half I was a mom.
               </p>
               <p>
                I was just telling my husband the other day that I feel like when I became Adah's mamma, I became a true woman. That is the only way I can really describe it. I never thought I would be a mom, ever. That wasn't on my radar, at all. I never thought in a million years I would be a stay at home mom, ever. God obviously knew better, He always does. God changed my heart, actually He healed my heart. During my life and my search for "love" AKA God, I made many bad choices. When I married my husband, God put hope in my heart about being a mom. I trusted that if it was His will, He would give us a child. My husband and I tried for 2 years. I begged God and pleaded with him for a baby. Each month I would be devastated when I wasn't pregnant. Each month I would be crushed and then renew my strength. In June of 2012 I was at our home church, Grace Church. During Praise and worship they played the song "The Great I Am" and I love that song. I slipped out into the isle and got down on my knees to worship, I didn't ask God for anything at all, I just sat at His feet and worshiped Him and all that He is and how much I love and need Him. While I was doing that, my husband looked over at me and he watched the Holy Spirit "heal" my womb. He said he had never seen anything like it before or since. In July, the very next month, I got pregnant with Adah. I askedmy husbandearlier tonight, while at a friend's house for dinner what it looked like, because I had never asked that before. He said it was like he saw God perform surgery on my insides....He watched a miracle. I am in awe at God and when I type this, all I can think is- WOW, that really happened, that really happened to me. It just seems so unreal, but it is very real. It happened. I won't know why God did it the way He did, I probably won't know that for sure until I meet Him face to face. I do know that it was His will that I be a mother. I believe that God allowed us to see that for 2 reasons. He knows we will share the story and He will be glorified by it. I alsothink that He was showing me that He did this, not me, He made me a mother, He blessed it. I needed to know that. He knew that. He is a good God, He is.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I reflect on my life right this moment and the many people I love around me. I see moms all around me, in different seasons. The first timemom who is miscarrying her baby right now, whom I have spent most of the day in prayer for. Themom who just went through a miscarriage and is healing from the pain that is so deep with that. For themom who has so many internal battles going on that she struggles with the day to day of mothering. For themom who needs her child healed. For the mom who is facing financial crisis from job loss and other financial burdens. For the mom who works outside of the home and can't ever seem to catch her breath to get everything done. For the mom who has a teen who is depressed and cannot figure out how to make it ok for that child. For the mom whodelivered a baby with Trisomy 13 and only got to hold him for a few hours before he passed. For the mom that is up multiple times each night with a baby and feels like she will never get to sleep again. For the mom of multiple kids, who homeschools and struggles with finding a moment to herself. For the mom who has terminal cancer and this is most likely her last mothers day here on this earth. For the mom who is watching her mother wither from cancer. For the mom who is estranged from her kids and just wants peace in her life. For the mom whose marriage is barely hanging on and has given up. The mom who in a year or two will be an empty nester, and knowing that her marriage is not on solid ground. The mom who is watching her daughter graduate College and start her life. The mom who will be spending her first mother's day without her husband. The mom who her children are all grown and have their own children that just wants to be honored by her kids. We are all in different seasons.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think the best thing we can give our moms for Mother's Day is grace and mercy. I know as a mother I desperately need mercy and grace. Being a mom is hard work, it is labor. It really is. It is having your heart walk around outside of your body...really. I mess up daily, sometimes hourly. I miss the mark many times and I give my all to try to get it all right. I am only human and I am going to make mistakes. The urgency I have for graceand mercy as a mom is pretty intense. I know I am not the only one that feels this way, am I right? I pray that Adah will learn how to give mercy and grace, because I already need it.
               </p>
               <p>
                The beautiful thing about learning how to extend grace and mercy to your Mom, Stepmom, Mother-in-law, is that there is freedom in it. I am serious. It will be like chains falling off of you when you get this concept and apply it. It just is the only way. How do you do this you are thinking? Its very simple actually, you accept the person they are right now, right where they are. That's it. It is simple. God does it for us daily.
               </p>
               <p>
                Happy Mother's Day to my Mom and all the beautiful women in my life who have mothered me and loved me.

                I became a mother on March 27, 2013 after 44 hours of labor. I was exhausted and was not at all prepared for motherhood, even though I "thought" I was. I distinctly remember about a month into motherhood calling my sister asking "Why didn't you tell me???!!" with obvious irritation in my voice. She giggled, because she knows me well, she knows how incredibly stubborn I am. She said "Because you wouldn't have listened and there really isn't a way to verbalize motherhood to a 'soon to be' mom". She went on to say, "You just have to jump in the middle of it to understand the unspoken world of truemotherhood". Yes, she was right.
               </p>
               <p>
                I first want to say this. If I can just be honest with you, motherhood has kicked my butt, and I am only 2 years into it. I am being real and raw here. I have been blessed, and I will say blessed, because it is a blessing that I am grateful for everyday, no matter how hard the day might be, that I get to stay at home with my daughter. But. IT. IS. THE. HARDEST. JOB. I. HAVE. EVER. HAD.
               </p>
               <p>
                As you are adjusting to the thousands of things that change when that tiny baby comes to live with you and you are fighting daily to get a grip and handle on all that is changing rapidly...suddenly you notice that there are other moms around you that have strong opinions about the best way to do something. I call it the "background noise" that comes into your life. Here is what it can sound like:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 don't use a binky, its so hard to get them off it
                </li>
                <li>
                 you are going to use cloth diapers? good luck with that
                </li>
                <li>
                 just let them cry...they will eventually stop
                </li>
                <li>
                 don't put them in bed with you
                </li>
                <li>
                 only use xyz brand of diaper cream
                </li>

                 are you sure they are getting enough milk nursing?
                </li>
                <li>
                 formula is so much easier to deal with
                </li>
                <li>
                 we only used Johnson &amp; Johnson soap, it has been around forever
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                I could go on, but you get the picture. What happens as a new mom is all this "background noise" of people whomean well, but really just add a lot of stress to an already stressful situation. If you are a mom, you know what I am talking about. It caused me serious stress as a new mom and now that I am through it and on the other side, I want to sharewhat I have learned and want to encourage any moms out there. Because, honestly, the "background noise" probably won't stop until that child is grown and gone.
               </p>
               <p>
                The encouragement I have is this: God gaveYOU that child. He didn't give that child to your best friend or your mother or your mother-in-law, He gave the child to you. God will give you wisdom and insight into that child that He gave to YOU. It is so easy to hear all the "Background noise" and start to second guess our insight and wisdom. We know that child intimately like no one else does. So, mamma, TRUST that, trust your gut, trust your instincts. They are all God given to YOU.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I look around at all the other moms out there, it is beautiful. If you really just stop and watch, instead of being judgmental, you will see the beauty of God working in each and every mother. What works for me and Adah might not work for others. That doesn't make me right and them wrong or vice versa. I love talking with other moms and learning and finding out how they do things, but at the end of the day, I always listen to my instinct about what is right for our home, our atmosphere, our routine and our family. To me, that is beautiful and how it should be and how God intended it to be.
               </p>

                Much love, Jennifer

                It is officially my Birthday....I cannot believe that I am 41, it just doesn't seem like that is even possible. I remember when I was a young adolescent and viewing people who were "40" as old. I also remember thinking that by that age (40), all your goals should be accomplished....boy was I wrong! Thankfully....
               </p>
               <p>
                I find the older I get, the more goals I dream of. The more I grow, the more I dream. My 20's and 30's were just surviving. I made some bad decisions early on and then had to deal with all the consequences of those decisions, so for me, 41 is like a new outlook! Seriously....people freak out about being in their 40's, I am embracing it. I have a 2 year old toddler I chase everyday....that does help to keep me young AND wear me out too!
               </p>
               <p>
                I am more inspired today than I have ever been in my life. I am in a place where I finally am stable, I have found love, "GOD" and I know that I am going to be ok no matter what life throws at me. I am at peace, finally. So, that allows me to dream. I have an amazing husband who is a dreamer and who strives to make our lives better each and every day.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, what are my dreams??
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 I want a boat and a camper- because I want to create great childhood memories for Adah as she grows.
                </li>
                <li>
                 I want to get healthy, I want to find my "best me" as far as health goes.
                </li>
                <li>
                 I am so inspired by the Young Living business. My goal and dream for this business is to allow my husband the option to work....yes, I said that. I am watching others do it, a lot of people actually, there is NO reason we can't do it too!
                </li>
                <li>
                 I want a house in the country with a HUGE garden and animals all over the place. I want to teach Adah a simple life that is centered around God.
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                What are your dreams? Do you know? Have you written them down? Spoke them? Committed to them? My Young Living Team is in the process of creating our Dream boards and its so fun to watch my team come alive and really speak into their lives what they want and desire!
               </p>
               <p>

                Hi! I wanted to introduce my family to you. We are a blended family. Phillip and I met in 2010 and married in 2010. We moved to Oklahoma from Missouri. Phillip has5 children, Brittany, Toniee, Nickolas and Joshua. Phillip and I had Adah in March of 2013. I am a stay at home mamma. Phillip owns his own business

                and loves what he does. I started with Young Living in October of 2014. I currently have a team that I am working with called Team Blessed and we grow each day.

               <p>
                We attend Grace Church in Broken Arrow, OK where we are able to volunteer and serve our church body. We love our church because it is a "word" based church and teaches us the word of God.

                We serve the Lord and place Him as the Lord over our lives and every aspect of our lives.

                We enjoy time at the lake during the summer, we travel to Table Rock Lake frequently. We enjoy swimming, boating, and attending Silver Dollar City while visiting Branson. We enjoy staying at home as a family and cooking. We eat Tacos nearly EVERY Friday night. We enjoy the simple life that is peaceful and centered around God.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is our humble life of service to God- we are but a vapor while here on this earth, we strive to make a difference while here.
