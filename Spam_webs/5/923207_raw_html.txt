      What scent of old wood hovers,  what softened

     </p>
     <p>
      Will you ever bring a better gift  for the world
      <br/>
      than the breathing respect that  you carry
      <br/>
      wherever you go right now? Are you  waiting
      <br/>
      for time to show you some better  thoughts?
     </p>
     <p>
      When you turn around, starting  here, lift this
      <br/>
      new glimpse that you found; carry  into evening
      <br/>
      all that you want from this day.  This interval you spent
      <br/>
      reading or hearing this, keep it  for life 
     </p>
     <p>
      What can anyone give you greater  than now,

      starting here, right in this room,  when you turn around?

      A Story That Could Be True

     <p>
      If you were exchanged in the  cradle and
      <br/>
      your real mother died
      <br/>
      without ever telling the story
      <br/>
      then no one knows your name,
      <br/>
      and somewhere in the world
      <br/>
      your father is lost and needs you
      <br/>
      but you are far away.
     </p>
     <p>
      He can never find
      <br/>
      how true you are, how ready.
      <br/>
      When the great wind comes
      <br/>
      and the robberies of the rain
      <br/>
      you stand on the corner shivering.
      <br/>
      The people who go by 
      <br/>
      you wonder at their calm.
     </p>
     <p>
      They miss the whisper that runs
      <br/>
      any day in your mind,
      <br/>
      Who are you really, wanderer?
      <br/>
      and the answer you have to give
      <br/>
      no matter how dark and cold
      <br/>
      the world around you is:
      <br/>
      Maybe I'm a king.

      The Little Ways That Encourage Good Fortune
     </h4>
     <p>
      Wisdom is having things right in  your life
      <br/>
      and knowing why.
      <br/>
      If you do not have things right in  your life
      <br/>
      you will by overwhelmed:
      <br/>
      you may be heroic, but you will  not be wise.
      <br/>
      If you have things right in your  life
      <br/>
      but do not know why,
      <br/>
      You are just lucky, and you will  not move
      <br/>
      in the little ways that encourage  good fortune.
     </p>
     <p>
      The saddest are those not right in  their lives
      <br/>
      who are acting to make things  right for others:
      <br/>
      they act only from the self 
      <br/>
      and that self will never be right:
      <br/>
      no luck, no help, no wisdom.

      Finish with goat cheese and  parsley. Eat.

      Only when I am quiet for a long  time

      and do not speak

      do the objects of my life draw  near.

     <p>
      Shy, the scissors and spoons, the  blue mug.
      <br/>
      Hesitant even the towels,
      <br/>
      for all their intimate knowledge  and scent of
      <br/>
      fresh bleach.
     </p>
     <p>
      How steady their regard as they  ponder,
      <br/>
      dreaming and waking,
      <br/>
      the entrancement of my daily  wanderings and tasks.
      <br/>
      Drunk on the honey of feelings,  the honey of purpose,
      <br/>
      they seem to be thinking,
      <br/>
      a quiet judgment that glistens  between the
      <br/>
      glass doorknobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Yet theirs is not the false  reserve
      <br/>
      of a scarcely concealed ill-will,
      <br/>
      nor that other, active shying: of  pelted rocks
     </p>
     <p>
      No, not that. For I hear the sigh  of happiness
      <br/>
      each object gives off
      <br/>
      if I glimpse for even an instant  the actual
      <br/>
      instant 
     </p>
     <p>
      As if they believed it possible
      <br/>
      I might join
      <br/>
      their circle of simple, passionate  thusness,
      <br/>
      their hidden rituals of luck and  solitude,
      <br/>
      the joyous gap in them where  appears in us
      <br/>
      the pronoun
      <u>
       I
      </u>

      Spring
     </h4>
     This morning
     <br/>
     two birds
     <br/>
     fell down the side of the maple  tree
     <p>
      like a tuft of fire
      <br/>
      a wheel of fire
      <br/>
      a love knot
     </p>
     <p>
      out of control as they plunged  through the air
      <br/>
      pressed against each other
      <br/>
      and I thought
     </p>
     <p>
      how I meant to live a quiet life
      <br/>
      how I meant to live a life of  mildness and meditation
      <br/>
      tapping the careful words against  each other
     </p>
     <p>
      and I thought 
      <br/>
      as though I were suddenly  spinning, like a bar of silver
      <br/>
      as though I had shaken my arms and  lo! they were wings 
     </p>
     <p>
      of the Buddha
      <br/>
      when he rose from his green garden
      <br/>
      when he rose in his powerful ivory  body
     </p>
     <p>
      when he turned to the long dusty  road without end
      <br/>
      when he covered his hair with  ribbons and the petals of flowers
      <br/>
      when he opened his hands to the  world.

      You do not have to be good.
      <br/>
      You do not have to walk on your  knees
      <br/>
      for a hundred miles through the desert,  repenting.
      <br/>
      You only have to let the soft  animal of your body
      <br/>
      love what it loves.
      <br/>
      Tell me about despair, yours, and  I will tell you mine.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile the world goes on.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile the sun and the clear  pebbles of the
      <br/>
      rain
      <br/>
      are moving across the landscapes,
      <br/>
      over the prairies and the deep  trees,
      <br/>
      the mountains and the rivers.
      <br/>
      Meanwhile the wild geese, high in  the clean
      <br/>
      blue air,
      <br/>
      are heading home again.
      <br/>
      Whoever you are, no matter how  lonely,
      <br/>
      the world offers itself to your  imagination,
      <br/>
      calls to you like the wild geese,  harsh and
      <br/>
      exciting 
      <br/>
      over and over announcing your  place
      <br/>
      in the family of things.

     <p>
      The time will come
      <br/>
      when, with elation,
      <br/>
      you will greet yourself arriving
      <br/>

      <br/>
      and each will smile at the other's  welcome,
     </p>
     <p>
      and say, sit here. Eat.
      <br/>
      You will love again the stranger  who was your self.
      <br/>
      Give wine. Give bread. Give back  your heart
      <br/>
      to itself, to the stranger who has  loved you
     </p>
     <p>
      all your life, whom you ignored
      <br/>
      for another, who knows you by heart.
      <br/>
      Take down the love letters from  the bookshelf,
      <br/>
      the photographs, the desperate  notes,
      <br/>
      peel your own image from the  mirror.
      <br/>
      Sit. Feast on your life.

       I  walk down the street.

       There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.

      Shoveling Snow with Buddha
     </h4>
     <p>
      In the usual iconography of the  temple or the local Wok
      <br/>
      you would never see him doing such  a thing,
      <br/>
      tossing the dry snow over the  mountain
      <br/>
      of his bare, round shoulder,
      <br/>
      his hair tied in a knot,
      <br/>
      a model of concentration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sitting is more his speed, if that  is the word
      <br/>
      for what he does, or does not do.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even the season is wrong for him.
      <br/>
      In all his manifestations, is it  not warm and slightly humid?
      <br/>
      Is this not implied by his serene  expression,
      <br/>
      that smile so wide it wraps itself  around the waist of the universe?
     </p>
     <p>
      But here we are, working our way  down the driveway,
      <br/>
      one shovelful at a time.
      <br/>
      We toss the light powder into the  clear air.
      <br/>
      We feel the cold mist on our  faces.
      <br/>
      And with every heave we disappear
      <br/>
      and become lost to each other
      <br/>
      in these sudden clouds of our own  making,
      <br/>
      these fountain-bursts of snow.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is so much better than a  sermon in church,
      <br/>
      I say out loud, but Buddha keeps  on shoveling.
      <br/>
      This is the true religion, the  religion of snow,
      <br/>
      and sunlight and winter geese  barking in the sky,
      <br/>
      I say, but he is too busy to hear  me.
     </p>
     <p>
      He has thrown himself into  shoveling snow
      <br/>
      as if it were the purpose of  existence,
      <br/>
      as if the sign of a perfect life  were a clear driveway
      <br/>
      you could back the car down easily
      <br/>
      and drive off into the vanities of  the world
      <br/>
      with a broken heater fan and a  song on the radio.
     </p>
     <p>
      All morning long we work side by  side,
      <br/>
      me with my commentary
      <br/>
      and he inside the generous pocket  of his silence,
      <br/>
      until the hour is nearly noon
      <br/>
      and the snow is piled high all  around us;
      <br/>
      then, I hear him speak.
     </p>
     <p>
      After this, he asks,
      <br/>
      can we go inside and play cards?
     </p>
     <p>
      Certainly, I reply, and I will  heat some milk
      <br/>
      and bring cups of hot chocolate to  the table
      <br/>
      while you shuffle the deck,
      <br/>
      and our boots stand dripping by  the door.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aaah, says the Buddha, lifting his  eyes
      <br/>
      and leaning for a moment on his  shovel
      <br/>
      before he drives the thin blade  again
      <br/>
      deep into the glittering white  snow.

      The Law That Marries All Things
     </h4>
     <p>
      1.
      <br/>
      The cloud is free only
      <br/>
      to go with the wind.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rain is free only
      <br/>
      in falling.
     </p>
     <p>
      The water is free only
      <br/>
      in its gathering together,
     </p>
     <p>
      in its downward courses,
      <br/>
      in its rising into air.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
      <br/>
      In law is rest
      <br/>
      if you love the law,
      <br/>
      if you enter, singing, into it
      <br/>
      as water in its descent.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
      <br/>
      Or song is truest law,
      <br/>
      and you must enter singing;
      <br/>
      it has no other entrance.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the great chorus
      <br/>
      of parts. The only outlawry
      <br/>
      is in division.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
      <br/>
      Whatever is singing
      <br/>
      is found, awaiting the return
      <br/>
      of whatever is lost.
     </p>
     <p>
      5.
      <br/>
      Meet us in the air
      <br/>
      over the water,
      <br/>
      sing the swallows
     </p>
     <p>
      Meet me, meet me,
      <br/>
      the redbird sings,
      <br/>
      here here here here.
