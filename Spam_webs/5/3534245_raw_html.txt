         Almost a century ago
        </strong>
        , H.G. Wells predicted that It is quite possible that in contact with western science, and inspired by the spirit of history, the original teaching of Gautama [The Buddha], revived and purified, may yet play a large part in the direction of human destiny.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, were seeing this cross-fertilization between science and mindfulness practice becoming a reality. It seems like you cant scroll through a Facebook feed without coming across an article describing the latest scientific study about meditators
        <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071008193437.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071008193437.htm', 'reporting less stress']);">

         fMRI brain scanning technology
        </a>
        and behavioral studies, science has managed to provide objective evidence that meditation does indeed work. Thanks to science, what once was dismissed as something only hippies and airy-fairy new agers did has now moved into the mainstream.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is just the beginning. As I hope to illustrate in the examples below, science and technology will do more than provide us with empirical data suggesting that meditation has value; it will revolutionize meditation practice itself. It will provide us with the tools to help this ancient discipline become many times more effective than it has ever been.

        To me, the most exciting application of this technology is one that will help beginning meditation students improve their concentration, their ability to focus on one thing at a time without getting distracted. As concentration becomes stronger, meditators begin to notice the subtlest of sensations, like tiny biochemical reactions on the skin, or the very movements of ones inner organs. Meditators use concentration to develop insights about the nature of mind and body, just scientists use electron microscopes or particle accelerators to understand the nature of the physical world.
       </p>
       <p>
        A common meditation technique for students to develop concentration is to focus on the breath. A student will follow the sensations of the in-breath and the out-breath and will seek to stay focused on these sensations without getting lost in thought. This isnt easy, and beginners often get lost in a stream of thoughts within the first few breaths. When this happens, the student is instructed to gently bring their attention back to the breath once theyve realized their mind has wandered.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a frustrating process since many students wont realize that theyve been lost in thought until 5-10 minutes after the fact. To help shorten this period, Meditation teachers will speak up after 10 or 20 minute intervals of silence to remind students to go back to the breath if their attention has wandered. While this is better than nothing, wouldnt it be nice if the teacher could tell a student to return their focus the very moment their mind wanders?

        This is precisely what mind-reading technology can help us do. The soon-to-be-released app,

        , for example, uses an EEG headset that connects to an iPhone through Bluetooth. During the course of a meditation session, the headset will monitor brain activity to determine whether or not youve lost focus. Once the Brainbot app detects that your mind has started chasing errant thoughts, your phone will tell you to refocus your attention. (Check out the

        Innovation #2: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
       </h2>
       <p>
        Broadly speaking, there are three levels of intelligence where software is concerned. The first, is the software that forms the majority of code written since people started writing code. It mindlessly does exactly only what its programmed to do and nothing more. A good example of this is your run-of-the-mill pocket calculator.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second, there is narrow artificial intelligence. This is software built upon very complex algorithms meant to perform a specific task very well. An often cited example of narrow AI is that of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)', 'Deep Blue']);">
         Deep Blue
        </a>
        , the computer that defeated the chess world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. While Deep Blue can simulate millions of possible chess moves per second, it can really only understand the rules of chess, and is (without significant modifications made by humans) completely useless outside the 64 square universe of a chessboard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, there is general artificial intelligence (also called universal AI). A general AI system can take in external inputs from the outside world and determine its own goals and objectives based on the situation at hand. A general artificial intelligence could figure out the rules of chess by studying videos of chess matches instead of being fed the rules through lines of code. Although we are a ways off from computers learning chess,
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6153" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6153', 'we do have software']);">

         Tower of Hanoi problem
        </a>
        without being pre-programmed to do so. As well see in the examples below, all three types of software (non-intelligent software, narrow AI, and general AI) have the potential to provide great benefit to meditation students.

        <strong>
         Non-Intelligent Meditation Software
        </strong>
        <br/>
        One doesnt need to utilize AI technology in order to create incredibly powerful tools to aid a meditator in their practice. Oftentimes these solutions have algorithms that are much less complex than those in your average video game.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take an app like the BrainBot example mentioned above. Heres a very abstracted representation of the algorithm governing the function of the application:
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://www.unreadyandwilling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BrainbotAlgorithm1.jpg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.unreadyandwilling.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BrainbotAlgorithm1.jpg', '']);">

        </a>
        <strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">
         Lets go through this algorithm step by step:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         First, the application starts and plays an audio recording encoded in a .wav file with some basic instructions for meditation.
        </li>
        <li>
         Once the instructions are complete, a timer starts and gives the meditator 2 minutes to focus their mind.
        </li>
        <li>
         When the timer runs out, the app then uses the information it receives from the brainwave scanning device to determine whether or not the meditator has lost focus.
        </li>
        <li>
         When both the timer reads zero and the meditators brainwaves match what the app has predetermined as an unfocused mind, the reminder plays and the whole thing starts over again.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Of course, this flowchart masks the complexity involved in processing the reams of data that the brainwave scanning device sends to the app. I imagine that thousdands of lines of code would be required to determine just what losing focus would mean to a machine. Human beings would have to measure the brainwaves of enough meditators to determine just what ranges of frequency and amplitude of alpha and beta (and delta and theta and gamma) waves would constitute a focused or unfocused mind. These parameters would have to be painstakingly measured, recorded, and spoon-fed into the app before it could even begin to answer the question: Has the meditator lost focus? So, although the idea behind the app is really quite brilliant, the app itself is not all that intelligent.

       </p>
       <p>
        The first time I was introduced to the idea of a virtual meditation teacher was in a

         Buddhist Geeks Interview
        </a>
        with the meditation instructor and science scholar Shinzen Young. In the interview, Young mentions a project he has in the works, called Virtual Shinzen, whereby an automated program would periodically ask a student certain questions about his or her mental state and then prescribe a meditation technique appropriate to that state of mind in accordance with a meditation algorithm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Narrow AI would take this concept one step further by helping to process the subtle ebb and flow of mind states just as Deep Blue would process the millions of potential moves on a chessboard. In order to develop something like this, students wearing EEG scanning devices would provide the raw data of their brainwave activity from a meditation session and then describe their experience to a human teacher. The teacher would then provide the appropriate advice for each shift in mind state. The narrow AI system, after getting enough data from students and instructions from teachers would develop certain
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)', 'heuristic guidelines']);">
         heuristic guidelines
        </a>
        , rules of thumb about the appropriate meditation advice to give a student depending on the brainwave readings the EEG scanners pick up. The more data the virtual meditation teacher collects from students, the better those heuristics will become.
       </p>
       <p>
        Initially, meditation students taking instructions from virtual teachers will probably need to check in with human teachers at least once a month (probably once a day, for users of Alpha versions of this program). The students will describe their experience to the human teachers and the teachers will then examine the advice given by the virtual teachers for quality assurance. If the virtual teacher gives inappropriate advice (which will happen), the human teacher will provide a correction and the AI system will take that into account for future teaching sessions. Over time, these virtual AI systems could become complex enough that the teachings they provide could become virtually (pun intended) indistinguishable from those of the great masters. In fact, their teachings could even be better because the AI teachers would have the ability to monitor mind states in real time.

         our very extinction being one possible outcome
        </a>
        . If we do manage to create an artificial intelligence that doesnt kill us, however, it will most likely lead to a quantum leap in our understanding of the inner workings of our own minds, as well as meditation and mindfulness practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meditation techniques are, boiled down to their essence, no more than algorithmsa set of instructions, rules and triggers that change based on certain conditions. A computer working through an algorithm cycles through a series of conditions and then performs actions based on those conditions. The benefit of narrow AI is that it can potentially digest existing teachings and techniques from the meditation masters, and then provide instruction comparable to those of the masters themselvesperhaps even better instruction because of the mind reading capabilities they would conceivably have.
       </p>
       <p>
        General AI would take meditation one step further by formulating new solutions and meditation techniques from scratch. It would take the guidelines from the existing masters and then could gobble up massive amounts of data that meditators provide through use of EEG headsets. This would then help refine meditation techniques much faster than the slow evolution theyve had over thousands of years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to develop general AI, we must either write extremely complicated software which can exhibit intelligence, or we must create what is called Full Brain Emulation (FBE), whereby we simulate the workings of the human brain through electronics. At this point it seems like a toss-up which type of AI well create first, but when it comes to mindfulness, FBE seems to have the greater potential. The development of FBE will be in large part due to

These scientists aim to create 3D computerized models of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses which would then emulate the behavior of neurons and synapses observed in the brains neocortex (the thinking layer of the brain). Obviously this would take a lot of data and processing power. Just to give you an idea, one simulated second of what amounted to half a mouse brain (about 8 million neurons)

Hyperintelligent AI computers (even narrow AI computers) could then use their enhanced capability to recognize patterns within complex systems to determine just what conditions need to be present in the brain in order for its owner to experience that which the meditation masters call enlightenment: the complete cessation of suffering and a dissolution of the sense of self.

We could, essentially, hack meditation by having an objective, data-driven understanding of what meditation techniques are effective and what meditation techniques arent. From this understanding we could create new techniques and perhaps even create new meditation tools and softwarea BrainBot 5.o if you will. We could perhaps even learn how to shut off the very neurons in the brain that work to produce the sense of self, thereby creating a technologically induced moment of

            The core problem of the human race is the egoistic mind. Meditation is a way to disconnect from egoistic mind with its greed, fear, negativity etc. Therefore, virtual meditation teachers could facilitate bringing peace and prosperity in a world awakening to the benefits of heightened consciousness.

            This is a great article. Thank you. My only question is this. If the technology already exists in us, which many have seenwhy not just meditate and get there?  :0

            Because if the goal is enlightenment, then the amount and intensity of meditation required is beyond the reach of most people.  So few actually attain enlightenment in one life that the Buddhist traditions are built around the notion of future lifetimes with which to accomplish it.  We live in a society far more technologically advanced than the ones Buddhism evolved in, so why not take advantage of that?

            Considering the tremendous possibilities inherent in this kind of research, I wonder why so few Buddhist teachers are talking about it.
