       Our adventure will continue from Dec. 23rd-28th with a 4 night/5 day   cruise down the Nile River on 2 beautiful boats, stopping to visit some   of the worlds most ancient and fascinating temples along the way. You   can imagine our days to be filled with inquiry and exploration and our   evenings we will spend intimate time getting to know each other,   discussing and digesting what weve learned and dancing under the stars   on the rooftops of our cruise ships as we dock together in the middle of   the Nile.

        As we converge at this powerful place at this particular time, we   will be acknowledging and participating in a great astronomical   alignment, drawing upon the lessons and wisdom from our past and   inspiring us in our creations for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        This particular winter solstice not only denotes the completion and   renewal of our yearly orbit around the Sun but also culminates in a   prophesized galactic alignment that happens only once every 26,000   years.This alignment is what many ancient cultures, like the Mayans were   pointing towards with the completion of their calendars.

       <strong>
        COSMOGENESIS
       </strong>
       is an event focused on
       <strong>
        TRANSFORMATION
       </strong>
       using shamanic   tools including dance, music, meditation and ceremony. This cutting-edge   event will occur at the most significant date in human history, the   21st December 2012. This date marks the end of the Mayan calendar and   the birth of a new age... and on this auspicious occasion we are   creating a festival of cosmic consciousness in South Africa called   COSMOGENESIS, which means the birth of a new world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seeds of Cosmogenesis are to be found in many of us around the   globe who feel attracted to this pivotal point in time, but Cosmogenesis   was inspired by visionary psychedelic artist Carin Dickson, who has a   deep calling to initiate a very special event for the 21st December 2012   in South Africa. This event is being created by the Global Psytrance   community and like-minded people around the world, enabling all to   participate in creating a powerful experience to shift the consciousness   of humankind.

        This event will harness the power of intention to focus the   awareness of participants and observers around the planet on a new   vision of reality for humankind on planet Earth.Everyone involved in   this event, from the venue owners to the organizers, funders,   volunteers, artists and healers are there for the same reason  to   create a new awareness for humankind, a new vision of ourselves and our   relation to our planet. The intention is to create a life-changing   experience for all who participate in it, as well as those who resonate   with it around the planet.

        Other aspects of the event will introduce new ways of living and   sustainability. There will be a healthy array of food provided through a   community kitchen and food vendors all situated in a large shaded   communal eating area. The intention here is to bring people together as   we eat to create a real sense of community. People can also bring their   own food to the event and look after themselves if they wish. The local   community will provide a small grocery shop selling day-to-day supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The festival will utilize food gardens on-site which will help to   create awareness of the earth as the source of our food. Toilets and   showers will be built using earth-friendly methods and the venue will be   powered as much as possible with alternative energy sources.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be no alcohol on sale at the event. People who wish to   drink can bring their own booze but no glass will be allowed. We will   have a few refreshment stations offering interesting alternative energy   drinks and refreshments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event starts on 12/12/12 and ends on 23/12/12.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gates will be open to all passport holders on 11/12/12 and close on 24/12/12.

26,000-year cycle accurately measured by one of the most advanced
astronomers from ancient times: The Mayans.

    TRIBAL GATHERING 2012
    <br/>
    KUNA YALA ** THE CARIBBEAN SEA ** OFF THE COAST OF PANAMA
    <br/>
    21ST - 28th DECEMBER 2012
    <br/>
    <br/>
    GeoParadise will be holding its next festival 21st - 28th December 2012,
 coinciding with the end of the 13th B'ak'tun of the Mayan Long Count
Calendar and the last full moon of the year.
    <br/>
    The dates cannot be more emblematic for the indigenous and psychedelic tribes attending this event!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We have already started booking an amazing lineup of international high profile musicians.
    <br/>
    Picking the very best from the Psychedelic Scene with Progressive, Goa,
Full-on and a touch of Dark ensuring the main stage absolutely brings it
 on. We'll post the line up as soon as contracts are finalized.
    <br/>
    The Global stage will feature a more eclectic and laid back musical
selection, with a blend of International, local and tribal acts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Twelve Indigenous Tribes of Central America will come to the festival to hold the first in a series of much needed conferences.
    <br/>
    They will be having positive debate around the gathering theme: "Our
roots in Mother Earth", discussing possible solutions for todays
environmental and social challenges. They will be holding workshops,
talks, rituals, stories, dances, etc to help the global party community
understand their cultures and realize how many common elements we share
and how we can help one another.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Mayan Shaman from Guatemala and the Americas will guide us in this epic journey into the new cycle to our full potential.
    <br/>
    Western scientists, thinkers and body movement instructors will complete the educational cocktail for this area.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There will be nightly sweat-lodges held on an adjacent island.
    <br/>
    Allowing the ceremonies to be unaffected by the electronics and ambiance
 of the main island. There will be local tribesmen in dug outs that will
 row you there and back, or you can swim as its only 50 or so meters,
the waters warm and rather shallow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    All structures will be built from sustainable, locally sourced
materials. The event will be carbon offset. Food and drink will be
provided by the Kuna Tribe. There will be a zero waste policy. Hand
built Showers and Compost toilets.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As with all GeoParadise events, this festival will Leave a Positive
Trace, providing funds and resources for the bioregion in many different
 ways. A local NGO will be set up with the Kuna indians to run
educational and environmental programs, empowering them to become more
sustainable and resilient.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well dance together for a week to celebrate the achievements. A sense
of purpose and belonging to a caring community will fill our hearts. We
no more are isolated tribes struggling to survive, we are one GeoTribe,
the Tribe of the Earth, and we together will keep our loved planet a
paradise. We call it GeoParadise.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    KUNA YALA IS A TROPICAL PARADISE CONSISTING OF 365 PERFECT CORAL REEFED
ISLANDS, ADORNED WITH COCNUT PALMS AND WHITE SANDY BEACHES, NESTLED IN
THE WARM TROPICAL CARIBBEAN SEA OFF THE COAST OF PANAMA
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Kuna (People) Yala (Land) are quite simply the last islands in the
Caribbean not to be overrun by foreigners, the Kuna are the last
indigenous peoples to still control their lands. They still live in
traditional wood and bamboo huts, fish in dugout canoes, the women wear
traditional dress and only three island groups have electricity.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Kuna People and their land are really a beacon of self managed
autonomous tribes. They are one of a few tribes in the Americas that
still exist in their own form and are, in fact, thriving. They manage
this seemingly impossible task by keeping their traditions alive and
holding on to a strict policy that no foreigner can own land or a
business there. Huge and powerful consortium's are constantly turned
away, the lure of wealth and power does not sway the Congreso General
Kuna. Disney Land will never come to Kuna Yala.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Kuna have a Pacha Mama or Gaian based philosophy. They are elements
of the universe interwoven with all. They are matriarchal with land
being owned and passed down by women to women. The men are warriors,
defenders of the land and are honored as such with authority to manage
the lands being bestowed on them by the matriarchs.
    <br/>

      have been attracting folks from 61
countries and exceed 2,700 folks into participating on one level or
another. Websites and Web Groups around the world feature news of the
event(s) and it tops Google searches in several categories as many
post/publish on their networks.

 We are currently working on creating
 a video short, with the background music created by the group Galactic
Butterfly titled Mayan Prayer and several music groups have expressed an
 interest in creating songs dedicated to the event which we will compile
 and present in CD &amp; DVD form to help with funding needs and of
course furthering awareness of the events.

 To date Sister Events are
 in the works for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.S., Chile, South
 Africa and the Middle East. Possibly others in Indonesia, Europe,
Palestine and Central America.
      <br/>
      We have a Blog TV channel in its
embryonic state and various Blogs posted with a number of networks. Most
 known Rainbow groups web pages have been posted, with positive
acceptance from the overall global network(s). Various Native American
Web Pages are also involved and enthusiastic about Indigenous Peoples
participation, though we still have much more work to do in getting the
word out to all Tribes.

 We have started publishing to alternative
media sources world wide and will be expanding that greatly in the near
future. We invite all folks interested in helping with this to publish
the Invitation to your local alternative media sources as well.

 We
encourage all positive alternative groups, events and projects to become
 actively involved via Councils on ways which they can plug in, e.g.
workshops &amp; exhibits, encouraging volunteers at the 2012 events to
participate in their efforts, creating new projects towards world peace
and environmental consciousness and anything else they would like to see
 as parts in the co-creation of this/these historic event/events. As
well as formulating events in their regions as lead-ups to the main
event in Palenque, Chiapas - Mexico and creating Sister Events in their
regions for  folks who may not be able to attend events in other
regions.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      There is no minimum, nor maximum, size for such events and all
are welcome to be parts in whatever ways they consider feasible for them
 to do so.

 We will be having complete internet media coverage via
our own fully equipped buses and motor homes ready to record and
transmit from the main event in Palenque and would hope to have others
at events globally, with all networked. We plan on having films produced
 as well.

 With the rather phenomenal growth which we have been
experiencing we are in need of volunteer focalizers/coordinators for
various aspects and needs.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      This entire effort will remain in the
formulative stages as everything evolves so that all which everybody
wants to see included can be considered by Councils and those that
resonate well will be pursued as events &amp; projects to be included in
 the general schedule of what will be shared. Consensus is the rule of
the thumb when it comes to making decisions on that.

    <p>
     There is much mystery and confusion surrounding the date of 2012. The   end-date of the Maya calendar's 5,125-year cycle on the December   solstice of 2012 has become a focal point for ideas about planetary   change. A unique opportunity exists to harness this attention into a   global event that celebrates the essential unity of humanity and the   power of positive intention.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Peace 2012 provides a simple, yet effective, template that   invites people from all cultures to celebrate this singular moment in   time. Events of any size and scale can be synchronized around the Peace   2012 'moment of peace'.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Peace 2012 offers a positive counter balance to popular media   misconceptions about 2012, and will include representations of all   perspectives, including the wisdom of indigenous peoples. To support   this goal, Peace 2012 is creating a web portal and media campaign to   promote the understanding that 2012 is an opportunity for positive and   peaceful change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Peace 2012 is a participant-driven event that empowers people across   the world to unite around the Peace 2012 'moment of peace'. Peace 2012   participants will be able to sign up online, register an event and   download audio-visual content for 'the moment of peace', as well as   receive supporting materials to help organize and focus their local   events.
