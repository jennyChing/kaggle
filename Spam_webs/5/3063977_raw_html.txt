  <meta content="In my last article, I made the point that the market economy rests on love: affection and friendship between people as well as the romance of living out a dream. Its a peaceful love that depends fundamentally on human choice and the constant engagement of individual volition. Nothing happens through initiated force. The result is not a utopia  there are always privations, misfortunes, misdeeds  but the market sees all of these things as problems to solve and contains mechanisms and means to work progressively toward solutions. To more clearly see this, its useful to compare it with the state, which also goes by the name public sector. But is it really about serving the public? Many thought it would be. About a century ago, when the intellectuals, politicians, and professional bureaucrats started building Leviathan, they said it was all about us. There were things we wanted that we just couldnt do for ourselves. If we let them have vast resources and power, and put the right people in charge, we could make ourselves wealthier, smarter, healthier, and happier. This old idea of liberty for all really had to go. The claim seemed viable for a time. They would provide schools, keep our meat and hospitals safe, stabilize the money, bring about fairness, and professionalize philanthropy. There would of course be a cost to getting these great benefits. There would have to be a tax. It would only apply to the richest of the rich who deserve to take it on the chin. Their income would be taxed and their estates would be taxed. Its a small thing really. And look at the benefits! The whole bargain really was a poison apple. It looked delicious but it was deadly for society. The realization of what had been unleashed on the world came early. The birth of leviathan coincided with historys first world war. It was a total war, meaning that it wasnt just between states; it was between whole nations and peoples. More than 37 million people became casualties of that war, which was financed all around the world through the new magic money machine called central banking. At the same time, states around the world found a great excuse to test out their new-found powers. There were price controls, wage controls, speech controls, conscription, labor camps, shutdowns of financial markets, censorship of the press, and all-round planning. The whole of life, which had been somewhat normal and peaceful only ten years earlier, became ugly, oppressive, bloody, and despotic. It was a moment that shocked the world. But the precedent had been established. The wartime bureaucracies did not go away in peacetime. A new class of bureaucrats had been born, people who held their jobs and powers regardless of public will or elections. Unlike businesses, which go away when they stop being useful to others, the new agencies were designed as permanent fixtures, and thereby became essentially unaccountable to the people. The first global world set the stage for a series of calamities that came after, each of which became a new excuse for the new class of planners to unleash hell on their populations. There was prohibition in the U.S. followed by the Great Depression and the fascistic experiment in national planning called the New Deal. All told, we had it pretty good as compared with others. The war ushered in Communism to Russia. In Europe, the political and economic destabilization of the war gave rise to fears of communism and the response of fascism, which was another version of the total state. The eventual result was the very thing that two generations of peace activists desperately tried to prevent: yet another world war, this time with more weaponry, brutality, and cruelty. This time 60 million people died, amounting to 2.5% of the worlds population. Its amazing to consider. Every effort to bring peace consumed intellectuals and activists for twenty years and, because the state had more power and influence than all of them combined, and because the state had all the weaponry and power, war came anyway. The response to the depression and the second war world gave birth to another layer of state control. Massive welfare states were born that control health care, mandate work hours, form cartels of corporate establishments, provide security to old age, stamp out drug use, end invidious discrimination, redistribute income domestically and internationally, and so on. Nothing was beyond the power of the state. Not every power was used in every sector or in every case, but from this point on, very few states in the world were willing to acknowledge any effective limit on their powers. They were total. None of these new monstrosities unleashed on the world bore much in common with the original Enlightenment-era vision. There was a time when people dreamed of a limited state, one that was checked by constitutions, representative democracy, courts that complied with laws passed by legislatures beholden to the people. This dream fully died 100 years ago. But lets move forward to the scene in contemporary America. Until recently, people imagined that there were still good parts to the state, aspects of this machinery that were a net positive for our well being and safety. This good part was embodied in the police. They kept us safe, and surely we need that because private criminality remains a threat to everyone. There is a difference between the police and a police state. Surely the latter will never happen to us. There were three major landmark events that changed that situation in the United States. The first came in 1995 with the bombing of the Oklahoma federal building. It was a retaliatory act, accomplished by a man who had his conscience darkened by the killings in the first Iraq War, and was inspired to an act of vengeance in response to the government slaughter of an entire religious community in Waco, Texas. The explosion seemed to signal the start of a new kind of cold war, one between government and the people it ruled. From that point on, the public sector coalesced into a tribe of its own, no longer thinking of itself as civilian. The bureaucracy united based on a paranoid fear of the people. The second step came with the domestic terror of September 11, which seemed to confirm the public sectors fears of its own safely and instilled in the population a conviction that liberty had to be traded in for security. Spending on protection, surveillance, militarization of the police at all levels, was ramped up beyond what anyone had previously imagined. This effort consumed the better part of ten years of public policy planning and effort. The American police state was now lying in waiting at all levels of society. The third step came in an unlikely form: the financial crisis of 2008, which devastated local tax revenues due to the collapse in real estate prices. At the federal level, the multi-trillion dollar bailouts of established banking, corporate, and financial firms, effectively ending any serious commitment to the idea of competitive market capitalism. At the local level, to protect revenue streams and pensions, police establishments turned to raising their own money through enforcement. They became agents of tax collection, living as direct parasites on otherwise peaceful people, and governments sincerely appreciated it. There was a time when it was seemingly plausible to imagine the state as a helper, a benefactor, an agent of charity, a force for justice, a bringer of fairness, a planner more far-seeing and wise than the decentralized, diverse, and dispersed population over which it ruled. Those days are really over. Now it is just a matter of connecting the dots and taking notice that the same institution that people believed would bring us to new glories has brought us to new depths of depravity. The state does not love us. Its just not that into us. We should have known all along. How and why? Because the state brings to the social matrix only one unique thing: the legal use of compulsion, which means the power to hurt people and take their stuff (Matt Kibbes phrase). One can only look back with astonishment that anyone ever believed unleashing it would do good things for the world. How to make matters right? It is not enough to understand what is wrong with the world, though that is an essential step. What awaits is a new awareness, one that reclaims the old liberal insight, that society can manage itself without a monopolist of power and coercion. Generations ago, people misidentified violence as a source of love; it is up to this generation to correct the error and embrace the real thing.

            <p>
             In my last article, I made the point that the
             <a href="http://tucker.liberty.me/2014/08/30/capitalism-is-about-love/">
              market economy rests on love
             </a>
             : affection and friendship between people as well as the romance of living out a dream. Its a peaceful love that depends fundamentally on human choice and the constant engagement of individual volition. Nothing happens through initiated force. The result is not a utopia  there are always privations, misfortunes, misdeeds  but the market sees all of these things as problems to solve and contains mechanisms and means to work progressively toward solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
             To more clearly see this, its useful to compare it with the state, which also goes by the name public sector. But is it really about serving the public? Many thought it would be. About a century ago, when the intellectuals, politicians, and professional bureaucrats started building Leviathan, they said it was all about us. There were things we wanted that we just couldnt do for ourselves. If we let them have vast resources and power, and put the right people in charge, we could make ourselves wealthier, smarter, healthier, and happier. This old idea of liberty for all really had to go.
            </p>
            <p>
             The claim seemed viable for a time. They would provide schools, keep our meat and hospitals safe, stabilize the money, bring about fairness, and professionalize philanthropy. There would of course be a cost to getting these great benefits. There would have to be a tax. It would only apply to the richest of the rich who deserve to take it on the chin. Their income would be taxed and their estates would be taxed. Its a small thing really. And look at the benefits!
            </p>
            <p>
             The whole bargain really was a poison apple. It looked delicious but it was deadly for society. The realization of what had been unleashed on the world came early. The birth of leviathan coincided with historys first world war. It was a total war, meaning that it wasnt just between states; it was between whole nations and peoples. More than 37 million people became casualties of that war, which was financed all around the world through the new magic money machine called central banking.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the same time, states around the world found a great excuse to test out their new-found powers. There were price controls, wage controls, speech controls, conscription, labor camps, shutdowns of financial markets, censorship of the press, and all-round planning. The whole of life, which had been somewhat normal and peaceful only ten years earlier, became ugly, oppressive, bloody, and despotic. It was a moment that shocked the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the precedent had been established. The wartime bureaucracies did not go away in peacetime. A new class of bureaucrats had been born, people who held their jobs and powers regardless of public will or elections. Unlike businesses, which go away when they stop being useful to others, the new agencies were designed as permanent fixtures, and thereby became essentially unaccountable to the people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first global world set the stage for a series of calamities that came after, each of which became a new excuse for the new class of planners to unleash hell on their populations. There was prohibition in the U.S. followed by the Great Depression and the fascistic experiment in national planning called the New Deal. All told, we had it pretty good as compared with others. The war ushered in Communism to Russia. In Europe, the political and economic destabilization of the war gave rise to fears of communism and the response of fascism, which was another version of the total state.
            </p>
            <p>
             The eventual result was the very thing that two generations of peace activists desperately tried to prevent: yet another world war, this time with more weaponry, brutality, and cruelty. This time 60 million people died, amounting to 2.5% of the worlds population. Its amazing to consider. Every effort to bring peace consumed intellectuals and activists for twenty years and, because the state had more power and influence than all of them combined, and because the state had all the weaponry and power, war came anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
             The response to the depression and the second war world gave birth to another layer of state control. Massive welfare states were born that control health care, mandate work hours, form cartels of corporate establishments, provide security to old age, stamp out drug use, end invidious discrimination, redistribute income domestically and internationally, and so on. Nothing was beyond the power of the state. Not every power was used in every sector or in every case, but from this point on, very few states in the world were willing to acknowledge any effective limit on their powers. They were total.
            </p>
            <p>
             None of these new monstrosities unleashed on the world bore much in common with the original Enlightenment-era vision. There was a time when people dreamed of a limited state, one that was checked by constitutions, representative democracy, courts that complied with laws passed by legislatures beholden to the people. This dream fully died 100 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             But lets move forward to the scene in contemporary America. Until recently, people imagined that there were still good parts to the state, aspects of this machinery that were a net positive for our well being and safety. This good part was embodied in the police. They kept us safe, and surely we need that because private criminality remains a threat to everyone. There is a difference between the police and a police state. Surely the latter will never happen to us.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were three major landmark events that changed that situation in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first came in 1995 with the bombing of the Oklahoma federal building. It was a retaliatory act, accomplished by a man who had his conscience darkened by the killings in the first Iraq War, and was inspired to an act of vengeance in response to the government slaughter of an entire religious community in Waco, Texas. The explosion seemed to signal the start of a new kind of cold war, one between government and the people it ruled. From that point on, the public sector coalesced into a tribe of its own, no longer thinking of itself as civilian. The bureaucracy united based on a paranoid fear of the people.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second step came with the domestic terror of September 11, which seemed to confirm the public sectors fears of its own safely and instilled in the population a conviction that liberty had to be traded in for security. Spending on protection, surveillance, militarization of the police at all levels, was ramped up beyond what anyone had previously imagined. This effort consumed the better part of ten years of public policy planning and effort. The American police state was now lying in waiting at all levels of society.
            </p>
            <p>
             The third step came in an unlikely form: the financial crisis of 2008, which devastated local tax revenues due to the collapse in real estate prices. At the federal level, the multi-trillion dollar bailouts of established banking, corporate, and financial firms, effectively ending any serious commitment to the idea of competitive market capitalism. At the local level, to protect revenue streams and pensions, police establishments turned to raising their own money through enforcement. They became agents of tax collection, living as direct parasites on otherwise peaceful people, and governments sincerely appreciated it.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was a time when it was seemingly plausible to imagine the state as a helper, a benefactor, an agent of charity, a force for justice, a bringer of fairness, a planner more far-seeing and wise than the decentralized, diverse, and dispersed population over which it ruled. Those days are really over. Now it is just a matter of connecting the dots and taking notice that the same institution that people believed would bring us to new glories has brought us to new depths of depravity.
            </p>
            <p>
             The state does not love us. Its just not that into us. We should have known all along. How and why? Because the state brings to the social matrix only one unique thing: the legal use of compulsion, which means the power to hurt people and take their stuff (Matt Kibbes phrase). One can only look back with astonishment that anyone ever believed unleashing it would do good things for the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             How to make matters right? It is not enough to understand what is wrong with the world, though that is an essential step. What awaits is a new awareness, one that reclaims the old liberal insight, that society can manage itself without a monopolist of power and coercion. Generations ago, people misidentified violence as a source of love; it is up to this generation to correct the error and embrace the real thing.

                  Great article Jeffrey. I am a systems engineer who, in my off hours, studies the malevolent behaviors of the Leviathan as a complicated system running amok. The government and its captured industrial/banking cronies act seemingly haphazardly, yet taken as a whole, it inexorably acts to grow itself. This is because it is learning to preserve itself. It is the opposite of the self-organizing peaceful competitive market that libertarians loveits agents act in a somewhat decentralized manner still, but all agents know that taking power is what will eventually get them promotedeven if temporarily they are voted out, some other statist agency will admire their ambition and they will be back at aggressing in no time. The principles by which complex/complicated systems run amok is well documented by Mr. John Gall (I know, pretty close to our other hero) in his book Systemantics: The Systems Bible. Ive compiled 23 of my favorite axioms of his:
                  <br/>
                  1 New Systems mean new problems.
                  <br/>
                  2 Systems tend to expand to fill the known universe (they grow their scope in all directions).
                  <br/>
                  3 Complicated systems produce unexpected outcomes [Generalized Uncertainty Principle]
                  <br/>
                  4 Systems tend to oppose their own proper function.
                  <br/>
                  5 People performing roles in systems often do not perform the role suggested by the name the system gives that person, nor does the system itself perform the role that its name suggests.
                  <br/>
                  6 People in systems do not actually do what the system says they are doing [Functionarys Falsity]
                  <br/>
                  7 The system itself does not actually do what it says it is doing. [The Operational Fallacy]
                  <br/>
                  8 The real world is what it is reported to the system [The Fundamental Law of Administrative Workings (F.L.A.W.)]
                  <br/>
                  9 A complex system cannot be made to work. It either works or it doesnt.
                  <br/>
                  10 A simple system, designed from scratch, sometimes works.
                  <br/>
                  11 A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.
                  <br/>
                  12 A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.
                  <br/>
                  13 The Functional Indeterminacy Theorem (F.I.T.): In complex systems, malfunction and even total non-function may not be detectable for long periods, if ever.
                  <br/>
                  14 The Newtonian Law of Systems Inertia: A system that performs a certain way will continue to operate in that way regardless of the need or of changed conditions.
                  <br/>
                  15 Systems develop goals of their own the instant they come into being.
                  <br/>
                  16 Intrasystem goals come first.
                  <br/>
                  17 The Fundamental Failure-Mode Theorem (F.F.T.): Complex systems usually operate in failure mode.
                  <br/>
                  18 A complex system can fail in an infinite number of ways. (If anything can go wrong, it will.) (See Murphys law.)
                  <br/>
                  19 Success or Function in any system may be failure in the larger or smaller systems to which the system is connected.
                  <br/>
                  20 Loose systems last longer and work better. (Efficient systems are dangerous to themselves and to others.)
                  <br/>
                  21 Complex systems tend to produce complex responses (not solutions) to problems.
                  <br/>
                  22 As systems grow in size, they tend to lose basic functions.
                  <br/>
                  23 Control of a system is exercised by the element with the greatest variety of behavioral responses.

                  You raise many excellent points and express them with crystal clarity, but there is one thing that concerns me about this article and many others which Ive read not only by you, but other libertarians.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The issue is that in recognizing the evils produced by the state, and the many undesirable consequences brought about by the actions of bureaucrats, leaders, politicians and other actors, there seems to be a tendency to view these people as inherently evil and by extension imply that they deliberately set out to produce these insidious results.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I dont deny there there are people in this world that are evil, or that some become corrupt after they have tasted the prerogatives of power, however, leaving these exceptions aside I wonder if, most of the time, the people who have contributed to our current mess have sincerely believed that they were acting in the best interests of society or certain groups that they were attempting to better.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If my view seems too pollyannaish Id like to ask what evidence exists which demonstrates that most of the deficiencies and problems which we have in our current world were deliberately brought about.

                  Jack, every time a politician orders a bombing or invasion, its deliberate. Every time a covert program to spy on the masses is funded, its deliberate. Every time a cop brutalizes someone, its deliberate. Every law thats passed which interferes with your ability to make peaceful choices you would prefer to make is deliberate. Its impossible to be inside the head of those who do these things, so the full degree of their intentions and motivations can never be known.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Nevertheless evil can and should be judged by peoples actions. Every act of aggression is a greater or lesser measure of evil. Institutions which foment, promote, engender and enable aggression are evil institutions. The bright side is that if any of these people youre referring to are well-meaning and dont actually intend to cause harm to anyone, then they should be subject to persuasion that theyre in the wrong line of work I dont anticipate a mass awakening any time soon, but hope springs eternal.

                    David, without doubt, all the actions you cite are done deliberately, but by pre-judging the results as evil you are in effect labelling the person who takes that action as evil.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I totally agree that actions should be judged by their results, but as we have seen in many analyses of actions (Bastiat comes to mind), many of the actions when they are initiated are blind to the unseen consequences which they will bring.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The point Im trying to get to is that if all people in bureaucracies and government positions are labeled as evil they are immediately put on the defensive. If, on the other hand, they were depicted as they might themselves view themselves, that is as well-intentioned individuals who are unaware of the full consequences of their actions, it might be easier to get them to become allies of libertarian views.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I do believe that it is best to call a spade a spade, but in the realm of gaining wide spread support, the shock approach is certainly going to alienate a lot of people.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    When discussing issues with committed libertarians or people who you know are open to rational thinking then no punches need to be held back, but if youre talking to someone who has been raised and schooled in believing that the state is sacrosanct maybe a more diffuse approach will win more support and open the door to more conversions.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Like you, Im not expecting any mass awakening, and any growth in the numbers is encouraging. The fantastic thing about platforms such as this is that is allows those who are like minded to discover others who have a similar leaning which might not have been evident in earlier times.

                      This exchange is getting at a critical subterranean issue that normal left-right debate never gets close to digging down to with the archeological care required to understand it, because of the typical modern short-segment TV debate practice of ad hominem fragging which ends up digressing to impugn motives. That critical issue is whether a bureaucracy, by either design or evolution, insulates all its agents from the culpability of intent to do harm. I argue that it does, if the agents say the right things:
                      <br/>
                      1. Action agent: I was just following Orders doing X, I didnt know Y was the result.
                      <br/>
                      2. Functionary agent: The Process says to do X, it doesnt indicate that Y could result.
                      <br/>
                      3. Policy agent: The Policy is to follow Process and follow Orders. The fact that Y resulted is not the fault of the Policy.
                      <br/>
                      4. Leadership agent: I am responsible for reciting and teaching Policy and Process and making sure Orders are carried out. I didnt know my agents were doing X or Y. Its not my fault, but I take responsibility. This means I shouldnt be criminally charged because I had no direct knowledge of imminent harm and did not intend any harm.
                      <br/>
                      If all agents in a harmful but unaccountable system stay within their assigned functions and follow this script, AND they are prevented from knowing what other part of the bureaucracy/system are doing, all agents will be protected from criminal prosecution. Babies could get put on a conveyor belt and dumped into a furnace as long as the guy who put the babies on the belt could defensibly claim he didnt know the babies ended up in a furnace.
                      <br/>
                      Bottom line: Human-agented systems can be designed to do great harm without any single human to hold criminally harmful intent. A large system that harms millions without culpability is a Leviathan. Government is such a system.
