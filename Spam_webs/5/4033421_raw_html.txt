           Yeah, my friends and I used to send Adam Curry, MTV VJ, death threats. On paper. Through the United States Mail. Signed, and with our return address. I don't remember why, but looking at that picture up top, I am guessing it had to do with his Richard Marx hair. I also seem to remember being outraged by his leather jackets? Not because they were leather, either, but '... just because? He was a phony fucking leather-jacket-wearing poseur who needed us to murder him?

           I'll just go out and say it: an organization with hundreds of Twitter users at its beck and call has decided to push Tor, The Onion Router, and it's software Tails as 'the software Snowden uses to keep safe'. This organization doesn't seem to worry that Amazon, Ebay or Google will get pissy about their logos being used in the operation. This organization decided to swamp Twitter in one big Tails ad after the close of business on April 15th, the day when US taxes are due. (At least that is what my Twitter stream is showing me.)

           The article being pushed most is Joe Fingas' ''Here's the software that helps Edward Snowden Avoid the NSA''. The piece is two paragraphs long'' perfect for those of us with a short attention span:
          </li>
         </ul>

          <li class="o outline">
           Edward Snowden hasn't escaped the NSA's watchful eyes purely by exploiting lax security '-- he also uses the right software. We now know that he communicates with the media using Tails, a customized version of Linux that makes it easy to use Tor's anonymity network and other tools that keep data private. The software loads from external drives and doesn't store anything locally, so it's relatively trivial for Snowden and his contacts to discuss leaks without leaving a trace.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">

          <li class="o outline">
           The underlying technology isn't completely original, and it's not perfect; Tails' open source code and anonymous developer base help resist pressure to include spy-friendly back doors, but there are still potential security holes. Users also have to be careful with their choices of internet services while using Tails, as the wrong ones could give the whole game away. Even with those concerns in mind, the software is a big help to Snowden, journalists and others that want to keep their conversations under wraps with a minimum of effort.

           Now this will seem odd to people who watched Snowden's SXSW talk a few weeks ago, where he stated that Tor was useful for blocking run-of-the-mill spybots, but not good for journalists or activists who might be targeted for NSA surveillance.

           Do you think Snowden thought he might have been targeted for surveillance once he signed up to work with the CIA/NSA/BoozAllen? He certainly knew Laura Poitras was under surveillance. So why would he use TOR/Tails for 'keeping safe' when he clearly stated at SXSW that these tools are not good for targeted individuals?

           [Today we have another announcement of an exciting new research paper. Undergraduate Dillon Reisman, for his senior thesis, applied our web measurement platform to study some timely questions. -Arvind Narayanan]

           Over the past three months we've learnt that NSA uses third-party tracking cookies for surveillance (1, 2). These cookies, provided by a third-party advertising or analytics network (e.g. doubleclick.com, scorecardresearch.com), are ubiquitous on the web, and tag users' browsers with unique pseudonymous IDs. In a new paper, we study just how big a privacy problem this is. We quantify what an observer can learn about a user's web traffic by purely passively eavesdropping on the network, and arrive at surprising answers.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           At first sight it doesn't seem possible that eavesdropping alone can reveal much. First the eavesdropper on the Internet backbone sees millions of HTTP requests and responses. How can he associate the third-party HTTP request containing a user's cookie with request to the first-party web page that the browser visited, which doesn't contain the cookie? Second, how can visits to different first parties be linked to each other? And finally, even if all the web traffic for a single user can be linked together, how can the adversary go from a set pseudonymous cookies to the user's real-world identity?
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           The diagram illustrates how the eavesdropper can use multiple third-party cookies to link traffic. When a user visits 'www.exampleA.com,' the response contains the embedded tracker X, with an ID cookie 'xxx'. The visits to exampleA and to X are tied together by IP address, which typically doesn't change within a single page visit [1]. Another page visited by the same user might embed tracker Y bearing the pseudonymous cookie 'yyy'. If the two page visits were made from different IP addresses, an eavesdropper seeing these cookies can't tell that the same browser made both visits. But if a third page, however, embeds both trackers X and Y, then the eavesdropper will know that IDs 'xxx' and 'yyy' belong to the same user. This method applied iteratively has the potential of tying together a lot of the traffic of a single user.

         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Once we had this idea, we wanted to test if it would actually work in practice. Everything depends on just how densely third-party trackers are actually embedded on sites. We conducted automated web crawls of 65 simulated users' web browsing over three months, and found that unique cookies are so prevalent that the eavesdropper can reliably link 90% of a user's web page visits to the same pseudonymous ID. (We omitted pages that embed no ID cookies at all, but those are a minority.)
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           We also found that the cookie linking method is extremely robust and succeeds under a variety of conditions (Section 4.1). We considered how variations in cookie expiration dates, the size of the user's history (i.e., the number of pages visited), and the types of pages visited affect the eavesdropper's changes, and found the impact to be minimal. Perhaps most significantly, however, we found that this surveillance method can still link about 50% of a user's history to the same pseudonymous ID even with just 25% of the current density of trackers on the web. This means that even if 75% of sites or trackers adopt mitigation strategies (such as deploying HTTPS), the eavesdropper still learns a lot.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Finally, we studied how an eavesdropper might learn the real-world identity behind a cluster of web pages associated with a pseudonymous ID. It turns out that this is surprisingly easy '-- many sites display real-world attributes such as real name, username, or email on unencrypted pages to logged in users, which means that the eavesdropper gets to see these identifiers. We conducted a survey of such leakage on popular sites, and found that over half of popular sites with account creation leak some form of real-world identity (Section 4.2).
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           While it's no surprise that web traffic contains sensitive information about individuals, what we've shown is just how complete a profile can be extracted even if the user's traffic is mixed with millions of other users. Further, an eavesdropper can connect these profiles to real-world identities without needing the co-operation of any websites. While HTTPS deployment by trackers can help, the only practical solution at the current time seems to be for users to install anti-tracking and anonymity tools.

           [1] An exception is if the user routes traffic through Tor. Different requests can take different paths and the exit node IPs will be different. Thus, use of Tor with application-layer anonymization (e.g., Tor browser bundle) defeats our attack.

           Hello. My name is John Cook, and as of three weeks ago I became the editor-in-chief of The Intercept. Since then, we haven't published much material on the site, and that's been on purpose. I'd like to take a moment to catch interested readers up on where we are and what you can expect from us over the coming weeks and months.

           The site launched in February with an announcement from co-founders Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Jeremy Scahill that The Intercept was coming online with an initial short-term focus on stories about the operations of the National Security Agency, based in large part on an archive of documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The decision to begin publishing at that point was based on a commitment to continue the work of reporting on, publishing, and explicating those documents. It was not based on an assessment that everything that one needs for the successful launch of a news web site''staff, editorial capacity, and answers to questions about the site's broader focus, operational strategy, structure, and design''had been worked out.

           Those things still have not been worked out, and over the past three weeks I have begun the process of resolving them in collaboration with the remarkably talented team that has already been assembled here. Until we have completed the work of getting staffed up and conceptually prepared for the launch of a full-bore news operation that will be producing a steady stream of shit-kicking stories, The Intercept will be narrowly focusing on one thing and one thing only: Reporting out stories from the NSA archive as quickly and responsibly as is practicable. We will do so at a tempo that suits the material. When we are prepared to publish those stories, we will publish them. When we are not, we will be silent for a time, unless Glenn Greenwald has some blogging he wants to do, because no one can stop Glenn Greenwald from blogging.

           There are a lot of stories out there right now that we are very eager to cover''the Heartbleed vulnerability, the Senate intelligence committee's report on the CIA's torture program, the president's claim that he wants to end the intelligence community's bulk collection programs''in depth and in detail. But you shouldn't expect to be hearing from us on much aside from the very specific work of the documents, which is itself time-consuming and exacting, for some small, indeterminate, but discrete period of time as we get the site set up to operate for the long term. It is of course very gratifying that some folks out there who admire the excellent work our reporters have done are eager to see what we come up with in this new venture, and we appreciate the attention and curiosity.

             Pam OmidyarReutersApril 14, 2014PrintIn the 20 years since the horrific 1994 genocide in Rwanda and its terrible spillover into the Congo, it has been clear that the global community remains ill-equipped to address such human-made catastrophic tragedies.

             While many have worked to heal Rwanda, crises of unfathomable mass violence have continued to unfold in places like Sierra Leone, the former Yugoslavia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Syria. In each case, the international community has failed to live up to a global commitment to prevention, protection and accountability for mass crimes.

             President Barack Obama announced the Atrocities Prevention Board (APB) during a 2012 speech at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. It was established after a 2008 report by the Genocide Prevention Task Force recommended it, and is supported by a coalition of civil society groups '-- the Prevention and Protection Working Group '-- and funded by Humanity United.

             The APB brings together every relevant U.S. agency, such as the State Department, the Defense Department and U.S. Agency for International Development to develop new tools for identifying, preventing and responding to escalating crises around the world. But two years later the board's record is mixed.

             There have been some successes, such as the APB's work with the international community and local civil society groups to prevent election-based violence in Kenya. There was also an early response to violence in Jonglei, South Sudan in 2013. It was successful in focusing public attention on the Myanmar regime's oppression of the Rohingya people and increased aid to the Central African Republic. The U.S. Treasury Department has increased efforts to locate and punish those responsible for atrocities.

             Critics cite these cases as APB failures. Yet the solution does not lie, as these critics argue, in dismantling the APB.  In fact, the board requires far more support '-- and should have more investment.

             The APB's mission and mandate is to ensure that atrocities prevention is treated as a core national security priority. But its structure is problematic. One unfortunate consequence of interagency boards is the dilution of leadership and accountability.  Clarity on the ultimate responsibility for the APB and its conduct is needed '-- as well as continued development and better access to the tools, including high-level diplomatic pressure on parties to the conflict, increased humanitarian access and assistance, denial of impunity for perpetrators and strengthened targeted sanctions for the enablers of atrocities.  All this is crucial to prevent a tipping point into chaos.

           The recent dust-up at the Media Lens forum has, among other things, really made me appreciate '-- even more than usual '-- the smart, funny, talented people that read and comment here. I'd like to have discussions rolling constantly, but for various reasons I can't create as many full-fledged blog posts as that requires. So I'm going to try something tonight where I just throw out some food for thought, and see what you all make of it.  You can work with the topic, or you can throw out something else you think is more interesting. If it works out, I'll make it a regular thing.

           I'll start by saying that the fact that Marxists and anarchists now call a billionaire by his first name is reason enough to keep looking at/writing about the social phenomena that brought that about. So getting accused of monomania for doing so is getting very old, especially since people like Henwood are no less obsessed. They're just obsessed in a different way.  The right way. Accusing people who are making a point of not applauding of obsession is just another way of getting people to shut up '-- another form of ostracism '' like what Patrick Higgins wrote about here in part 3 of his excellent recent series.

           Once  again, I'm with Mark Ames (sue me).  As I have said before, the way left journalists and media watchdog groups like Media Lens and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting have stood down on this story is nothing short of shameful. The sad thing is, there will be no catching up. There is a timeframe when something is newsworthy, and somehow Omidyar and Co have managed to avoid scrutiny and analysis during their allotted time. They will be old news before they've been anything more than the stuff of successive press releases.

           Tripoli: The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) has filed a $1.5 billion lawsuit against Soci(C)t(C) G(C)n(C)rale (SocGen), claiming the French investment bank helped channel bribes worth tens of millions of dollars to associates of Saif al-Islam, the son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

           The LIA, a $60 billion fund set up to invest the country's vast oil wealth, alleges that SocGen fraudulently paid over $58 million to a company called Leinada for "advisory services". These services related to $2.1 billion of derivatives trades that the LIA entered into with SocGen between 2007 and 2009.

           Goldman Sachs was one of many Western banks that tried to curry favour with the fund in the mid-2000s when Libya's relations with Western governments thawed, reportedly by plying executives with expensive chocolates and aftershave, and funding luxury trips for officials.

           Under Gaddafi, the LIA is understood to have been riddled with large-scale misappropriation, misuse and misconduct of funds.

            The troop carriers seized by the militia on Wednesday had apparently arrived by train, possibly from the neighboring region of Dnipropetrovsk. They were taken without a shootout, suggesting that the troops who had arrived with them had at least to some extent joined protesters.

           <b>
            armed pro-Russian militants
           </b>
           seized government buildings in a coordinated and professional operation conducted in six cities in eastern Ukraine.
           <b>
            Many were outfitted in bullet-proof vests, camouflage uniforms with insignia removed, and carrying Russian-designed weapons like AK-74s and Dragunovs.
           </b>
           These armed units, some wearing black and orange St. George's ribbons associated with Russian Victory Day celebrations, raised Russian and separatist flags over seized buildings and have called for referendums on secession and union with Russia. These operations are strikingly similar to those used against Ukrainian facilities during Russia's illegal military intervention in Crimea in late February and its subsequent occupation.

It would not be happening if a large Russian military force were not massed on the border, destabilizing the situation through their overtly threatening presence. There simply have not been large-scale protests in the region. A small number of separatists have seized several government buildings in eastern cities like Donetsk, Luhansk, and Slovyansk, but they have failed to attract any significant popular support. Ukrainian authorities have shown remarkable restraint in their efforts to resolve the situation and only acted when provoked by armed militants and public safety was put at risk.

           Fact: The Ukrainian parliament (Rada) did not change in February. It is the same Rada that was elected by all Ukrainians, comprising all of the parties that existed prior to February's events, including former president Yanukovych's Party of Regions. The new government, approved by an overwhelming majority in the parliament -- including many members of Yanukovych's former party -- is committed to protecting the rights of all Ukrainians, including those in Crimea.

            Fact: Following Russia's illegal annexation and occupation of Crimea, Russia raised the price Ukraine pays for natural gas by 80 percent in the past two weeks. In addition, it is seeking more than $11 billion in back payments following its abrogation of the 2010 Kharkiv accords. Russia's moves threaten to increase severely the economic pain faced by Ukrainian citizens and businesses. Additionally, Russia continues to restrict Ukrainian exports to Russia, which constitute a significant portion of Ukraine's export economy.

           15 April 2014Russia has warned the pro-Western regime in Kiev against mounting military operations against anti-government protests in eastern Ukraine, unleashing a new wave of anti-Russian warmongering in Berlin.

           What an absurd distortion of reality! The truth is, 100 years after the beginning of the First World War and 75 years since the outbreak of the Second World War, it is Germany that has returned to an aggressive foreign policy, threatening a military confrontation with Russia, a nuclear power, and a Third World War.

           Berlin, working closely with the United States, organised a putsch in Ukraine led by fascist forces that brought to power a pro-Western regime, which is driving Ukraine into a civil war and provoking a confrontation with Russia. Now, the German media is seeking to depict Russia as the aggressor, using the most brazen lies and distortions.

           The media accuses Moscow of doing precisely what the West did in Kiev only a few weeks ago: instigating anti-government protests. While the Western media glorified the fascist putsch against the elected government of Yanukovych as a ''democratic revolution,'' now, without batting an eye, it is demanding the bloody suppression of the protests in east Ukraine and a more aggressive course against Russia.

           The Sddeutsche Zeitung derides Russia in an editorial as a ''warmonger,'' and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as ''chief cynic.''

           How is the aggressive war hysteria in the German media and political establishment to be understood? It is part of a systematic revival of militarism by ruling circles in Germany.

           The opening shot was fired by German President Joachim Gauck in his October 3 speech. On the Day of German Unity, he provocatively declared that Germany was ''not an island'' that could abstain ''from political, economic and military conflicts.'' At the beginning of the year at the Munich Security Conference, he announced, together with Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, an end to ''the policy of military abstention.'' In future, Germany would have to ''intervene more decisively and substantially'' in regions of international crisis.

           Ever since, the Grand Coalition of the SPD and Christian Democrats in Berlin has ruthlessly implemented this policy, amid relentless warmongering from the media.

           It is increasingly clear that the Ukraine crisis was deliberately provoked by the Western powers to be used as a pretext by Germany and its allies to rearm and return to an aggressive foreign policy. The defence ministry supports NATO's military build-up against Russia, deploying ships and aircraft close to the Russian border and holding military manoeuvres there. At the same time, the German military, politicians and leading journalists are demanding the reintroduction of conscription and the procurement of new tanks and attack drones.

           The Greens, who have beaten the drum incessantly for German military operations abroad ever since they entered government in 1998, were active participants in the fascist-led putsch in Kiev.

Their lead candidate in the European elections, Werner Schulz, alternately abuses the Russian president as a ''criminal,'' ''aggressor'' and ''war-monger,'' and calls for military action.

           MOSCOW: Fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden on Thursday made an unexpected intervention in a phone-in with Russian President Vladimir Putin, quizzing him over the extent of Moscow's surveillance activities.

           By Patrick Martin17 April 2014In separate statements in the US and Europe, President Obama and NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen ratcheted up the threats by US and European imperialism against Russia. Their statements came on the eve of four-party talks set for Thursday in Geneva, with the US, the European Union and their Ukrainian puppet regime facing off against Moscow.

           Obama gave an interview to Major Garrett of CBS News, who asked a series of provocative questions suggesting that the White House should step up its campaign of economic warfare against Russia. Before the interview, the White House announced that a new round of economic sanctions had been ''prepared'' for use against Russia if there was no progress in resolving the crisis in Ukraine.

           Obama told CBS that it was ''absolutely clear'' that Russia had violated Ukrainian sovereignty in annexing Crimea and that it was continuing to do so by supporting ''non-state militias'' in southern and eastern Ukraine, where there is overwhelming popular hostility to the US-backed right-wing regime in Kiev.

           Offering no proof for his accusations against Russia, Obama declared: ''What I've said consistently is that each time Russia takes these kinds of steps, that are designed to destabilize Ukraine and violate their sovereignty, that there are going to be consequences, and what you have already seen is the Russian economy weaker, capital fleeing out of Russia.''

           In language that suggested possible US support for future Ukrainian membership in NATO'--a radical break from previous policy'--Obama said, ''We don't need a war. What we do need is a recognition that countries like Ukraine can have relationships with a whole range of their neighbors and it is not up to anybody whether it is Russia or anybody else to make decisions for them.''

           This declaration is remarkable for its hypocrisy, since US government officials have been ''making decisions'' for Ukraine, including who should head its government. Tapes of phone conversations between the US ambassador and State Department official Victoria Nuland indicated that they had already selected the man who is now Ukrainian prime minister'--Arseniy Yatseniuk, or ''Yats'', as they familiarly termed him'--during the US-backed protests that installed the current regime in Kiev.

           More ominously, CIA Director John Brennan visited Kiev secretly last week for discussions on how to deal with the popular movement in eastern Ukraine. Coming out of those sessions, both interim president Oleksandr Turchynov and prime minister Yatseniuk denounced the anti-Kiev activists in the east as ''terrorists'' and ordered in the armed forces, commanded by a general who threatened the ''destruction'' of the opposition.

           Given that Brennan heads the world's largest organization dedicated to assassination and provocation, and previously worked at the Obama White House directing drone missile attacks on people identified as ''terrorists'', his discussions in Kiev were undoubtedly focused on demonizing the political opposition to Kiev as criminals, and engineering a bloody outcome to the crisis.

           The threat of military escalation came after a NATO meeting Wednesday in Brussels. NATO Secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the US-dominated military alliance would increase air patrols over the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia'--all former Soviet republics that border on Russia. This would represent an escalation of previous actions, which included dispatching warplanes to Poland and the Baltic states, and deploying AWACS surveillance aircraft in Poland and Romania.

           ''You will see deployments at sea, in the air, on land to take place immediately'--that means within days,'' Rasmussen said. ''We will have more planes in the air, more ships in the water, and more readiness on the land. More will follow, if needed, in the weeks and months to come.''

           All indications are that the Geneva talks are not intended to resolve the crisis, but rather will be the occasion for further provocations against Russia. The acting foreign minister for the right-wing Ukrainian regime, Andriy Deshchytsia, said he would demand Russia return Crimea to Ukraine and rescind the decision of the Russian parliament authorizing Russian troops to deploy to Ukraine if President Vladimir Putin deemed it necessary to protect the Russian population in that country.

           Claims by US, NATO and Ukrainian officials of ''Russian involvement'' in Ukraine are both completely hypocritical'--given the record of US-EU subversion in Kiev'--and deeply cynical.

           Russia and Ukraine are deeply intertwined by common history, culture, economic ties and geography.

           It is hardly surprising that the seizure of power by ultra-right Ukrainian nationalists, spearheaded by open fascists, anti-Russian chauvinists and anti-Semites, whose first significant policy decision was to prohibit official use of the Russian language, should provoke popular opposition, especially in the Russian-speaking east and south.

           As for the claims that this popular opposition is ''instigated'' or ''fomented'' by Russia, the Putin regime, based on billionaire oligarchs, is hostile to any genuine popular movement in eastern Ukraine, a stronghold of the industrial working class, which might spill across the border and intensify the class struggle within Russia itself. If the Russian armed forces were eventually to intervene in eastern Ukraine, it would be to suppress such a popular movement before it could get out of control.

           The imperialist powers and their stooges in Kiev regard the population of eastern Ukraine with undisguised loathing.

           The military actions ordered by Kiev pose the danger of a full-scale bloodbath to crush broad sections of the eastern Ukrainian population who distrust and oppose the Kiev regime. Casualties have already been reported earlier this week in Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. On Wednesday, press reports indicated that Ukrainian soldiers opened fire on protesters in Mariupol, a city of 600,000 on the Sea of Azov, killing one person and wounding 12 more.

           The Obama administration has scheduled a deputies committee meeting this week'--tentatively set for Tuesday'--to resolve a bitter inter-agency dispute over a request from Russia with respect to the Open Skies program. Informed sources believe the White House is likely to side with the State Department, which wants to accommodate Russia, over the objections of the Obama administration's Defense Department and intelligence agencies.

           The Open Skies treaty allows the United States and Russia to fly over each other's territory with planes loaded with certain agreed-upon sensor packages, in order to ensure compliance with arms control agreements and to provide assurance against preparations for various military surprises. Russia has asked the U.S. to agree to an upgrade in the sensor package their planes can carry. (Obviously, the exact nature of these sensor packages and the proposed upgrades is highly classified.) The request would apparently result in a significant increase in Russian spying capabilities; the first response from Pentagon was, according to one government official close to the situation, "You've got to be kidding." But the State Department has been making the case for acceding to the Russians' demands, and the White House seems to be on State's side. The White House has also stonewalled requests for information from the congressional intelligence committees.

           The White House and State Department have engaged in brazen lying to EU governments regarding the ability of the US to supply more than enough natural gas to replace Russian gas deliveries. Recent statements by US President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are so patently false that it betrays an incredible desperation in Washington over the situation in Ukraine versus Moscow. Or it suggests that Washington is so out of touch with any factual reality she simply doesn't care what she says. Either way, it suggests an unreliable diplomatic partner for the EU.

           After his recent meeting with EU leaders Obama issued the incredible statement that the secret Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) that is being secretly negotiated behind closed doors by the major private multinational companies would make it easier for the United States to export gas to Europe and help it reduce its dependency on Russian energy: ''Once we have a trade agreement in place, export licenses for projects for liquefied natural gas destined to Europe would be much easier, something that is obviously relevant in today's geopolitical environment,'' Obama stated.

           That bit of political opportunism to try to push the stalled TTIP talks by playing on EU fears of Russian gas loss after the US-orchestrated Ukraine coup of February 22, ignores the fact that the problem in getting US shale gas to the EU does not lie in easier LNG licensing procedures in the USA and EU.

           In other recent statements, referring to the recent boom in unconventional US shale gas, Obama and Kerry have both stated the US could more than replace all Russian gas to the EU, an outright lie based on physical realities. At his Brussels meeting Obama told EU leaders they should import shale gas from the US to replace Russian. There is a huge problem with that.

           Number one, the ''shale gas revolution'' in the USA has failed. The dramatic rise in US natural gas production from ''fracking'' or forcing gas out of shale rock formations is being abandoned by the largest energy companies like Shell and BP as uneconomical. Shell has just announced a huge reduction of its exposure to US shale gas development. Shell is selling its leases on some 700,000 acres of shale gas lands in the major shale gas areas of Texas, Pennsylvania, Colorado and Kansas and says it may have to get rid of more to stop its shale gas losses. Shell's CEO,Ben van Beurden stated, ''Financial performance there is frankly not acceptable '... some of our exploration bets have simply not worked out.''

           A useful summary of the shale gas illusion comes from a recent analysis of the actual results of several years of shale gas extraction in the USA by veteran energy analyst David Hughes. He notes, ''Shale gas production has grown explosively to account for nearly 40 percent of US natural gas production. Nevertheless, production has been on a plateau since December 2011; eighty percent of shale gas production comes from five plays, several of which are in decline. The very high decline rates of shale gas wells require continuous inputs of capital'--estimated at $42 billion per year to drill more than 7,000 wells'--in order to maintain production. In comparison, the value of shale gas produced in 2012 was just $32.5 billion.''

           So Obama is either being lied to by his advisers on the true state of US shale gas supplies, or he is willfully lying. The former is most likely.

           The second problem with the US ''offer'' of gas to the EU to replace Russian gas is the fact that it requires massive, costly infrastructure in the form of construction of new Liquified Natural Gas terminals that can handle the huge LNG supertankers to bring it to similar huge LNG terminal harbors in the EU.

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           The problem is that owing to various US laws on export of domestic energy and supply factors, there exist no operating LNG liquefaction terminals in the US. The only one now under construction is the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, owned by Cheniere Energy, where John Deutch, former CIA head, sits on the board. The problem with the Sabine Pass LNG terminal is that most of the gas has been pre-contracted to Korean, Indian and other Asian LNG customers, not to the EU.

          <li class="o outline">
           The second problem is that even were a huge port capacity installed to satisfy EU gas needs to replace Russian supplies, that would push domestic natural-gas prices higher and cut short the mini-manufacturing boom fueled by abundant, cheap shale gas. The ultimate cost to EU consumers of US LNG would have to be far more than current Russian gas pipelined over Nord Stream or Ukraine. The next problem is that the specialized LNG supertankers do not exist to supply the EU market. All this takes years, including environmental approvals, construction time, perhaps seven years on average in best conditions.

           The EU gets some 30% of its gas, the fastest-growing energy source there, from Russia today. In 2007, Russia's Gazprom supplied 14 percent for France, 27 percent for Italy, 36 percent for Germany, with Finland and the Baltic states receiving as much as 100 percent of gas imports from Russia.

           The EU has no realistic alternative to Russian gas. Germany, the largest economy, has foolishly decided to phase out nuclear power and its ''alternative energy'''--wind power and solar''is an economic and political disaster with consumer electricity costs exploding even though alternatives are a tiny share of the total market.

           By JOSEPH FITSANAKIS | intelNews.orgSaudi Arabia has replaced its intelligence chief, who is widely seen as the architect of the kingdom's interventionist policy on the Syrian civil war. The government-owned Saudi Press Agency announced on Tuesday that prince Bandar bin Sultan had been ''relieved of his post at his own request''. Bandar was born in 1946 to a concubine of crown prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz, 12th son of Saudi monarch King Abdulaziz. In 1983, Bandar was appointed ambassador to the United States, a post he held until 2005. He developed numerous connections in Washington and rose to become a leading operator in Middle East affairs, enjoying to this day very close personal ties with Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. In 2012 he was appointed director of the Saudi Intelligence Agency, the country's primary intelligence organization. Since that time, he has been the primary planner of Riyadh's hawkish policy on the Syrian civil war, which has been to openly support the rebel groups fighting to oust the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia began supplying weapons, cash and intelligence to the Syrian rebels as soon as Bandar took control of the country's intelligence apparatus. But his once close relations with Washington went sour last year, when he described US President Barack Obama's refusal to launch military strikes on Syria as a ''major shift'' in American Middle East policy. He also angered the US by criticizing it's rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is Riyadh's major regional adversary. Perhaps most important of all, Bandar appears to have underestimated the strength of the al-Assad administration and over-confidently advising King Abdullah in 2012 that the Syrian government's days were numbered. The stalemate in the Syrian civil war seems to have frustrated the Saudi government, which began to gradually distancing itself from Bandar's musings since January. The prince has spent most of 2014 in the United States and Morocco, ostensibly for ''medical treatment''. According to Saudi government media, Bandar has been replaced ''on an interim basis'' by his deputy, Yousef al-Idrissi. Meanwhile, insiders report that the Syria file has been transferred to prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the kingdom's minister of interior. It is worth noting, however, that Bandar remains secretary general of the National Security Council, an influential advisory board that directs Saudi Arabia's national security, intelligence and foreign policy strategy.

           A plane crash at Smolensk in Russia four years ago wiped out the Warsaw leadership. It used to be seen as an accident. Now, after Putin's games in Ukraine, people aren't so sure.

           Four years ago this week, Polish President Lech Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash near the Katyn Forest in Russia where he was flying to honor the 22,000 Polish officers, lawyers, priests and professors slaughtered there by the Soviets 70 years before. Ninety-five other military, political and public figures including his wife died on that plane. One of the more heartbreaking details to emerge was that First Lady Maria Kaczynska's body could be identified only by her nail polish and the inscription inside her wedding ring.

           Less than two years before the crash the late president had given a speech warning that if Russian aggression was not stopped in Georgia, which Russia had invaded, it would extend to Ukraine, the Baltics, and possibly Poland as well. ''We are here to take up the fight,'' he said. And many Poles still believe that their president died in the cause of that effort. Physicist Kazimierz Nowaczyk is one of them.

           On April 10, 2010 at 10:41 a.m. Polish Air Force Flight 101 crashed several hundred meters short of the Smolensk runway in dense fog. Within hours the Russian government issued a statement citing the incident on pilot error. Russia's final report on the incident blamed the late President Kaczyski and his ''inebriated'' air force commander-in-chief for using ''psychological pressure'' to force the Polish pilots to land in a low-visibility environment.

           The plane's black boxes, laptops, sensitive documents, mobile phones, address books, telephone numbers, correspondence, and the top-secret military, NATO and diplomatic codes on board were salvaged from crash site immediately by the Kremlin's operatives in what was a ''coup for Russia's intelligence service'' according to retired CIA analyst Gene Poteat. What Nowaczyk calls ''years worth of work for security services'' was completed in a single day by Russia's OMON Special Purpose Police, which were immediately deployed to the site.

           The airplane was a 20-year-old Russian Tupolev-154M that had been refurbished and upgraded in Russia four months before, a detail that has become the subject of considerable speculation on the many forums and groups dedicated to investigating the conspiracy theory surrounding the flight.

           According to Poteat, ''Forty minutes before the crash, a Russian YAK-40 airplane with 40 people on board landed safely. Twenty minutes before the crash a Russian AWAC airplane did a touch-and-go at the airport then flew on to Moscow.''

           In an interview with The Daily Beast, Nowaczyk describes the findings of an independent Polish parliamentary committee investigating the crash of which he is a member. The group consists of scientists from various backgrounds and relies only on ''scientific tools'' in its investigation, he said. But the committee was formed by Polish parliamentary factions, such as that of the late president's brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who have not found the official Polish-Russian report on the incident satisfactory.

          <li class="o outline">
           ''From our point of view this report was full of mistakes,'' Nowaczyk explains, citing various inconsistencies and contradictions in the official narrative. A key issue raised by Nowaczyk's committee and the many online forums dedicated to the crash is that the amount of debris found at the site'--an estimated 60,000 aircraft fragments'--would be impossible in the case of a simple plane crash. He cites the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the 1996 TWA 800 flight out of New York, both of which exploded in the air but had only 11,000 aircraft fragments and 3,168 fragments respectively. Both planes were reconstructed to 95 percent completion. Nowaczyk believes that an explosion caused the fragmentation of the Polish president's plane. In the official report the plane's black boxes indicate that the aircraft's electricity was cut two to three seconds before the crash, which Nowaczyk believes also was caused by that explosion.

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Like many of those pursuing these theories Nowaczyk personally knew four people who died in the crash, including the late president. The Polish physicist's voice grows faint, almost pleading, ''I simply want to know the truth.''

           Earlier this week'--on April 8, 2014'--Polskie Radio reported that the Polish District Military Prosecutor in Warsaw, Colonel Ireneusz Szelag, presented 1,300 pages of documentation, in advance of the four-year anniversary, ruling out ''any possibility that an explosion occurred aboard the Polish presidential plane that crashed in Smolensk on 10 April 2010.'' The prosecutor stated, ''After analysing 700 samples, experts found no traces that an explosion had taken place aboard the Tu-154 plane'... The experts had unimpeded access to the site of the catastrophe, and to the place where the wreck of the plane is being stored.'' The prosecutor stated that the investigation would be closed next year, even if the aircraft's wreckage is not returned to Poland.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           That is not likely to calm the roiling tide of speculation about a conspiracy, especially in light of Putin's recent actions in Ukraine. Already last year nearly one third of the Polish population believed there was a possibility that their president had been assassinated. The number is unusually high for a conspiracy theory, suggesting just how fearful Poland is about Russian intentions.

         </ul>

          <li class="o outline">
           But it is increasingly hard to separate the forensic aspects of the case from the intense political maneuvering around it in Poland. The incident has been used to fuel anti-Russian sentiment among far-right groups, to demonstrate anti-Russian credentials and to further political careers. The general public has every reason to be skeptical. Now at a time when anti-Russian sentiment is already running high, this theory could further embitter the Polish people if it continues to gather momentum and recognition.

           For the majority of the country and the mainstream media, supposition that the Smolensk crash was not an accident remains a fringe theory fraught with political implications. Those who propagate it are considered paranoids or activists with an axe to grind. But Putin's performance over the last eight weeks has given the world good cause to revisit conspiracy theories, including some that only two months ago would have seemed ludicrous and absurd.

           Open-Source Software Implementation of a DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) Receiver under the GNU General Public License (GPL)

           IntroductionDigital Radio Mondiale (DRM) is the digital radio standard for the long-, medium- and short-wave ranges (DRM30) and the VHF Band (DRM+). The standard was formed by a consortium in co-operation with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The system offers the radio stations and new service providers access to the multimedia age for all kind of radio stations, from high power broadcasters with large target areas and long distances reception to low power line-of-sight broadcasters. For more information visit www.drm.org.

           The bandwidth of a DRM bandpass signal is less than 20 kHz in the DRM30 mode and less than 100kHz in the DRM+ mode, and the number of carriers used in the OFDM-modulation is relatively small. These features motivate a real-time software implementation of a DRM-receiver for conventional personal computer (PC) or smartphones/tablets using affordable input devices like the FunCubeDongle Pro+ or a sound card connected to a standard radio receiver with an IF ouput.

           This software project implements a working software DRM30 receiver with, at least, the basic features (DRM+ support is planned). Since this project was created at a university and the fundamental idea of such an institution is to teach and stimulate the creativity, this source-code is free under the GNU-General Public License (GPL). Dream is a development project which uses the open source model to improve DRM technology. The main aim of this project is to implement and test new research results on an existing system, whereby the synchronization and channel estimation is of special interest.

           The most common problem is that dream runs but won't decode audio. It may look like dream is decoding the FAC and SDC but not the MSC but this is an artifact of the way the MSC 'LED' is driven on the front panel.

           If you are a computer geek like me, the first thing you will think about when I tell you ''DRM'' is ''Digital Rights Management''. You know, this process that consists in giving you both encrypted content and the keys to decrypt it, but in a really obfuscated way to attempt to discourage you from doing the decryption yourself'... anyway, this is not the subject of this post. The DRM I want to talk about today is ''Digital Radio Mondiale''. A strange acronym choice if you ask me, but there you go'...

           So what is ''DRM'' ? It is an attempt at keeping shortwave broadcast radio live and kicking, by broadcasting in digital format rather than using amplitude modulation. Gone are the days of listening to ''Radio France International'', ''BBC World Service'' or ''Voice of America'' hunched over a small SW radio, trying to make out what was being said over the static'... I will always remember a conversation in China back in 1997 when I clumsily tried to understand what sort of ideas my Chinese student friends had about Tibet, and the comment I got was ''ah ah, my friend, you sound like you have been listening to Voice of America propaganda too much''. But I digress.

           DRM uses AAC audio at a low bitrate '' 16kbps mono, typically '' and is able to stream data and basic text, in a manner similar to RDS. DRM in itself is a pretty well defined standard, and you can read all about it at http://www.drm.org/ but it is not widely used yet. As a bystander, it looks like getting agreement on standardisation of shortwave radio broadcasts is an extremely difficult and lengthy exercise: you have to get dozens of countries to agree and cooperate to broadcast information all over the globe, not hard to see why this can take time.

           This means that the number of broadcasts today is actually fairly limited, and the number of commercially available shortwave receivers with DRM capabilities is even more limited, but the good news is that if you have a computer and a shortwave radio receiver with an IQ output, you will be able to listen to DRM fairly easily using an Open Source reference receiver implementation called ''Dream''. You can head over tho the wiki referenced in that link to learn more about it and install it.

          <li class="o outline">
           This is where things get a bit hairy: I mentioned above that DRM uses AAC: AAC is not license free, and for some strange reason, the DRM consortium chose it over other similar open codecs. This means that the downloadable versions of Dream do not contain what is needed to actually listen to DRM'...

           On a Mac, this means you will have to install libaac using homebrew '' easy '' but you will then need to compile Dream yourself since the binary on the Dream wiki is 32 bits only and all current Macs run a 64 bit OS, and the libaac you just compiled will be a 64bits lib. Yeah, I know, it's a bit of a pain, but compilation works OK '' I had to do a few nudges and updates to the code to make compile to the end, but I eventually managed.

           Dream is configured to use the I/Q output of the radio, channel is set to ''I/Q Neg Zero'', and the sound device is the built-in input of the Mac: on my machine, Dream seems to have a bug and I need to select the entry directly above the one I actually want to use for both sound input and output, so if you have trouble, you might want to check this.

           Sound quality is actually surprisingly good, as long as you have a decent signal! I would not go as far as saying it is worth going through all this trouble just  to listen to radio '' there are definitely easier ways to do it in 2014 '' , but the whole exercise is a good technical learning experience, and I will definitely be happy if I can listen to good audio quality western propaganda broadcasts next time I visit China!

            Heartbleed was branded by the international security company Codenomicon, which if extraordinary coincidence is to be believed, independently discovered the CVE-2014-0160 OpenSSL exploit on the same day as Google researcher Neel Mehta.

           The only part of the story that's certain is how Codenomicon scored the credit for unearthing the bug: by branding the crap out of it, an approach the company dubbed Bugs 2.0. Most security holes like CVE-2014-0160 would be posted on messageboards read only by the coding and hacking community.
           <b>
            Here, a Codenomicon engineer came up with the name Heartbleed--inspired by a tangentially related piece of software called Heartbeat--and quickly thereafter, Codenomicon registered Heartbleed.com, designed sleek FAQs explaining the bug, and accompanied it with a logo by Codenomicon designer Leena Snidate.

           Deep blood red. Because it's talking about a heart that's bleeding. Heartbleed is not a clever logo, no, but it's not going for clever. Its power is in sheer, bold literalness--the visual equivalent of talking slowly to a slack-jawed luddite audience that has no clue what the hell CVE-2014-0160 means. And in that regard, it's perfect for its purpose of welcoming the masses to Heartbleed.com and assuring us, yes, you've come to the right corner of the Internet, you idiot. In return, Codenomicon is forever associated with being the solution to what will likely go down as one of the greatest security oversights in Internet history. Plus they get a halo effect to, not just their peers in the security community, but all of the laypeople who barely understand what's even going on in the first place.Don't be surprised if the next major bug has many names and many logos.

           Less than a month after announcing its plan to abandon U.S. protection of the open Internet in 2015, the White House has stepped back from the abyss. Following objections by Bill Clinton, a warning letter from 35 Republican senators, and critical congressional hearings, the administration now says the change won't happen for years, if ever.

           ''We can extend the contract for up to four years,'' Assistant Commerce Secretary Lawrence Strickling told Congress last week, referring to the agreement under which the U.S. retains ultimate control over the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as Icann. If the administration makes good on that reassurance, it would punt the decision to 2019 and the next president.

          <li class="o outline">
           Mr. Strickling originally linked the end of U.S. control to the September 2015 expiration date of the current Icann agreement. He backtracked at a Hudson Institute conference last week: ''We did not intend that to be a deadline after which 'bad things' would happen. There has been some misapprehension that we were trying to impose a deadline on this process. We weren't.'' Fadi Chehade, Icann's CEO, agreed. ''There is no deadline,'' he said. ''The U.S. has many years on the contract.''

           In an interview, Mr. Chehade assured me that he understands why supporters of the open Internet want the U.S. to retain its oversight role, which keeps countries like Russia and China from meddling. ''I'm worried, too,'' he said. ''There's no question that governments like power and certain governments will always try to take control of the Internet, so we will have to be careful.''

           Wall Street gave Yahoo stock a big boost today '-- largely due to the stellar quarterly performance of China's Alibaba, in which the Silicon Valley Internet giant has a big stake.

           Also encouraging was a slight increase in core revenue after many quarters of decline, although a one percent rise pales in comparison to current industry averages and is downright depressing next to the hair-on-fire recent results at both Google and Facebook.

           While a lot of the chatter about Yahoo's latest financials seems focused on increasing display advertising sales '-- which went up two percent in Yahoo's first quarter '-- sources inside the company say the big focus for truly turbocharging revenue will be an aggressive effort being led by CEO Marissa Mayer and Adam Cahan, its SVP of mobile and emerging products, around search.

           And, according to sources, the lodestone of two internal projects aimed at building a viable mobile search engine and monetization platform is to convince Apple to make Yahoo the default search engine on its Safari browser on the iPhone and iPad.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">

           Currently, Google is set as the default search on Apple's mobile devices, but you can change it to either Yahoo or Microsoft's Bing by adjusting certain device settings.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Mayer aims to change that. A number of Yahoo insiders I have talked to said her plan to pitch Apple on the idea as its marquee mobile search partner is far along. The company has prepared detailed decks, including images of what such a search product would look like, and hopes to present them to Apple execs.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           That has not happened as yet officially and no deal is imminent '-- it's just the big honking goal of the new Yahoo effort, said sources. Still, several said Mayer has already buttonholed a few Apple executives on the topic, including its powerful SVP of design, Jony Ive, who knows the former Google exec well.
          </li>
         </ul>

           ''This is the aim of the whole effort here, to grab the pole position in iOS search,'' said one person working on the effort. ''It will take more than pretty pictures, though, to convince Apple to give up Google, given its focus on consumer experience being top-notch. But Marissa wants it very badly.''
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Mayer has shown a willingness to take on Google already, with advanced efforts under way to create a rival to YouTube, focusing on more professional content rather than user-generated. The company has been signing up partners for the service, with enticements of revenue guarantees and more. Many video makers are unhappy with the deals they currently get from YouTube and Mayer is essentially rubbing salt in those wounds.

           She'll have the cash to do more soon, as Alibaba goes public later this year, yielding Yahoo billions since it has to sell almost half of its 24 percent stake.

           Thus, being spent on bringing back search to Yahoo.

          <li class="o outline">
           Apple has long had a good relationship with Yahoo, which Mayer hopes to further improve. Yahoo already is the default data source on the iPhone for the device's stocks and weather apps, the latter of which is a very slick and attractive piece of technology.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           But search is Mt. Everest by comparison, especially since Google does a very good job already, is well-liked by consumers and, perhaps most of all, pays Apple upward of a $1 billion a year in fees for the business it engenders.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           The even bigger issue, according to those familiar with the plan, is that Yahoo still does not have adequate technology to mount such a serious effort, despite its many attempts to build such technology in the past.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">

           Its most recent foray into the area was Axis, a mobile browser for iOS devices that debuted in mid-2012 under the leadership of former Yahoo exec Shashi Seth. At the time, I liked it, describing it thus:
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           ''It's a slick offering, which essentially eliminates the texty link-filled search page for one of pretty visual tiles and pull-downs and more. Think Pinterest of search and you have the general idea.''
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Despite other decent reviews, there was little uptake for it, and Yahoo whacked it a year later.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           But Mayer did not move off search, an area she knows well from her many years in charge of product development in that arena at Google. Her aim: To move Yahoo squarely into competition with both Google and Microsoft in an attempt to regain control over a key revenue stream.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">

          <li class="o outline">
           She ordered up two under-the-radar initiatives '-- Fast Break and Curveball '-- to get the company back into algorithmic search as well as search advertising.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           Sources said the plan is being done as part of a contemplation of how Yahoo can accelerate the end of '-- or actually end '-- its longterm search and advertising partnership with Microsoft.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           But rather than focusing on the Web and keywords, which Yahoo is contractually bound to allow Microsoft to serve under a 10-year search and advertising partnership deal, Mayer is aiming all this toward mobile and contextual search.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           As I have pointed out before, there is a big loophole here for Mayer, since it is not included in Yahoo's agreement with Microsoft to provide search and search advertising technology.

           Whether Mayer can build adequate mobile search technology to satisfy Apple's exacting standards around user experience remains to be seen. Execs there like Eddy Cue, who is in charge of software and services, have noted that they will not remove Google as default until there is a comparable alternative. So far, they don't seem to think there is.

           But there is no question the company certainly has been trying to remove default Google apps and services from its devices over the years, including dumping maps and YouTube.

          <li class="o outline">
           So why not search as well? While there is an existing contract that extends into next year between Apple and Google, said sources, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that there's a flexible renewal clause.

           The idea has certainly been kicked around for a while, most recently with some positing that Apple would eventually replace Google search with Bing. In a piece titled ''The Google-Free iPhone'', my BFF M.G. Siegler pointed out the obvious:

           ''Apple is directly responsible for billions of dollars being sent Google's way via search on its devices. This will only continue to increase.

           The number of "paid clicks" by consumers on Google's ads increased by 26 percent in the first quarter, disappointing some analysts that had hoped for stronger volume growth. And the average "cost per click" declined 9 percent, extending a downward trend as mobile advertising, typically cheaper than traditional online ads, make up a bigger slice of its business.

           Melissa MeltonActivist PostAccording to a program launched yesterday by CTIA - The Wireless Association, an international nonprofit that has represented the wireless communication industry since 1984, all phones manufactured in the U.S. after July 2015 will be required to contain a ''kill switch'' system that can remotely disable and wipe any cell phone's data.

           Yeah, because law enforcement really cares quite a bit about whether or not your smartphone is stolen'...unless it's law enforcement stealing your phone from you in the first place because you've used the camera on it to protect yourself from police state activity by taking incriminating photos and videos of said law enforcement.Well, now they won't even have to physically take your phone from you, because apparently they'll be able to just push a button and remotely wipe it clean of all data.

           In this day and age of dwindling privacy ala 1984, you would think there would be a major market for a privacy-respecting telecom, but it takes a lot of money to set up the infrastructure for that kind of thing, and it's no secret that the U.S. intelligence community via sources like In-Q-Tel (the CIA.'s official venture capital firm) are the ones incubating all the new technology these days:

The best way to do that is have a budget because when you have a checkbook, everyone comes to you,'' said Jim Rickards, an adviser to the U.S. intelligence community who is familiar with the activities of Arlington, Va.-based IQT.

           Computer hard drive maker LaCie has acknowledged that a hacker break-in at its online store exposed credit card numbers and contact information on customers for the better part of the past year. The disclosure comes almost a month after the breach was first disclosed by KrebsOnSecurity.

           On Mar. 17, 2014, this blog published evidence showing that the Web storefront for French hardware giant LaCie (now owned by Seagate) had been compromised by a group of hackers that broke into dozens of online stores using security vulnerabilities in Adobe's ColdFusion software. In response, Seagate said it had engaged third-party security firms and that its investigation was ongoing, but that it had found no indication that any customer data was compromised.

           In a statement sent to this reporter on Monday, however, Seagate allowed that its investigation had indeed uncovered a serious breach. Seagate spokesman Clive J. Over said the breach may have exposed credit card transactions and customer information for nearly a year beginning March 27, 2013. From his email:

         <ul class="outline">

          <li class="o outline">
           ''To follow up on my last e-mail to you, I can confirm that we did find indications that an unauthorized person used the malware you referenced to gain access to information from customer transactions made through LaCie's website.''

         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           ''The information that may have been accessed by the unauthorized person includes name, address, email address, payment card number and card expiration date for transactions made between March 27, 2013 and March 10, 2014. We engaged a leading forensic investigation firm, who conducted a thorough investigation into this matter. As a precaution, we have temporarily disabled the e-commerce portion of the LaCie website while we transition to a provider that specializes in secure payment processing services. We will resume accepting online orders once we have completed the transition.''

          <li class="o outline">
           Security and data privacy are extremely important to LaCie, and we deeply regret that this happened. We are in the process of implementing additional security measures which will help to further secure our website. Additionally, we sent notifications to the individuals who may have been affected in order to inform them of what has transpired and that we are working closely and cooperatively with the credit card companies and federal authorities in their ongoing investigation.

           It is unclear how many customer records and credit cards may have been accessed during the time that the site was compromised; Over said in his email that the company did not have any additional information to share at this time.

           As I noted in a related story last month, Adobe ColdFusion vulnerabilities have given rise to a number of high profile attacks in the past. The same attackers who hit LaCie also were responsible for a breach at jam and jelly maker Smuckers, as well as Alpharetta, Ga. based credit card processor SecurePay.

           In February, a hacker in the U.K. was charged with accessing computers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in October 2012 and stealing names, phone numbers and email addresses using ColdFusion flaws. According to this Business Week story, Lauri Love was arrested in connection with a sealed case which claims that between October 2012 and August 2013, Love hacked into computers belonging to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Energy.

           The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) took over the investigation, and on April 18, released photographs and surveillance video of two suspects.[9][10][11] The suspects were identified later that day as Chechen brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Shortly after the FBI released the images, the suspects allegedly killed an MIT police officer, carjacked an SUV, and initiated an exchange of gunfire with the police in Watertown, Massachusetts. During the firefight, an MBTA police officer was injured but survived with severe blood loss. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot several times in the firefight and subsequently run over by the car then driven by his brother. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

           An unprecedented manhunt ensued on April 19, with thousands of law enforcement officers searching a 20-block area of Watertown.[12] During the manhunt, authorities asked residents of Watertown and surrounding areas, including Boston, to stay indoors. The public transportation system and most businesses and public institutions were shut down, creating a deserted urban environment of historic size and duration.[13][14] Around 7 pm, shortly after the "shelter-in-place" advisory was rescinded, a Watertown resident discovered Dzhokhar hiding in a boat in his back yard. Dzhokhar was arrested and taken to a hospital shortly thereafter.[15]

           During an initial interrogation in the hospital, Dzhokhar alleged that Tamerlan was the mastermind. He said they were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that they were self-radicalized and unconnected to any outside terrorist groups. According to him, they learned to build explosive devices from an online magazine of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen.[16] He said that he and his brother had decided after the Boston bombings to travel to New York City to bomb Times Square. Dzhokhar was charged on April 22, while still in the hospital, with use of a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.[5][17] He has pleaded not guilty to 30 charges.

           Bombings[edit]On Patriots' Day, April 15, 2013, the annual Boston Marathon began without any indications of an imminent attack.[18] Officials swept the area for bombs twice before the explosions; the second sweep occurred one hour before the bombs went off. People were able to come and go freely, and carry bags and items in and out of the area.[19]

           At 2:49 pm EDT(18:49 UTC), about two hours after the winner crossed the finish line,[20] but with more than 5,700 runners yet to finish,[21] two bombs detonated on Boylston Street near Copley Square about 210 yards (190 m) apart,[22][23][24] just before the finish line.[18] The first exploded outside Marathon Sports at 671''673 Boylston Street at 2:49:43 pm EDT.[22] At the time of the first explosion, the race clock at the finish line showed 04:09:43,[25] reflecting the elapsed time since the Wave 3 start at 10:40 am EDT. The second bomb exploded at 2:49:57 pm EDT,[20][23] about 13 seconds later and one block farther west at 755 Boylston Street.[8]

At least 14 people required amputations, with some suffering traumatic amputations as a direct result of the blasts.[3]

           The marathon was halted abruptly. Police, following emergency plans, diverted the remaining runners away from the finish line to Boston Common and Kenmore Square. The nearby Lenox Hotel and other buildings were evacuated.[18] Police closed down a 15-block area around the blast site; this was reduced to a 12-block crime scene on April 16.[26][30]Massachusetts Army National Guard soldiers already at the scene joined local authorities in rendering aid.[18] Boston police commissioner Ed Davis recommended that people stay off the streets.[26]

           Many people dropped backpacks and other bags as they fled, requiring each to be treated as a potential bomb.[22][31] A number of news reports stated that more bombs had been found nearby and the Boston Police Bomb Squad said they would perform a controlled explosion on the 600 block of Boylston Street, but in the end no other bombs were found.[9][18][32][33][34][35][36] Some media outlets also reported a potential bombing at the John F Kennedy Presidential Library in the Dorchester section of the city, but this turned out to be an unrelated electrical fire. The Navy sent one of its bomb-disposal units to Boston to help local authorities.[37]

           The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency suggested people trying to contact those in the vicinity use text messaging, instead of voice calls, because of crowded cellphone lines.[20] Cellphone service in Boston was congested but remained in operation, despite some local media reports stating that cell service was shut down to prevent cell phones from being used as detonators.[40]

           Events of April 18''19[edit]Identification of suspects: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev[edit]In a news conference held at 5:20 pm on April 18, the FBI released photographs and surveillance videos showing two suspects'--each carrying backpacks and walking nonchalantly but purposefully in single file formation'--and sought the public's help in identifying them.[64][65] The FBI released the photos, in part, to limit the damage by those wrongly targeted by incorrect news reports and social media speculations.[66] Authorities later said that releasing the suspect's photos "was a turning point in the investigation, no doubt about it."[63]

           The suspects, initially identified by the FBI as unnamed suspects 1 and 2 (or "black hat" and "white hat", respectively) from photographic and video evidence, had "acted differently" after the explosions; they had stayed to watch the aftermath and walked away "casually", rather than fleeing.[65] Asked for assistance in identifying the suspects, the public provided a deluge of photographs and home movie records to police, which were scrutinized by both authorities and online public social networks.[65]

           Despite video footage taken at the scene,[70] the suspects were not identified by authorities before killing a police officer and hijacking a civilian. The source of identification was RMV records on the Honda vehicle, which was used in a subsequent kidnapping and then abandoned.[71] The suspects were then identified as two brothers whose family had immigrated to the United States as refugees around 2002: 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev (Russian: &gt;&gt; ...//), born on October 21, 1986, and killed on April 19, 2013, and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (Russian: -- ...//), born on July 22, 1993.[72][73][a]

           MIT shooting and carjacking[edit]A few hours after the photos were released, the suspects allegedly shot Sean A. Collier of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department multiple times, killing him[74] for his gun, which they could not get out because of the holster's retention system.[75] Collier, aged 27, was seated in his police car near the Stata Center (Building 32), on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus.[15][76] He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital in nearby downtown Boston, where he was pronounced dead.[15][77] Some law enforcement officials described the killing as an assassination.[76]

Later interrogation allegedly revealed that the brothers "decided spontaneously" that they wanted to go to New York and bomb Times Square.[78]

The car's owner, Danny, a Chinese national, escaped while the suspects stopped at a gas station; he ran across the street to another gas station, asking the clerk to call 911.[82][83] His cellphone remained in the vehicle, allowing the police to track the suspects to Watertown.[84]

           Firefight with police[edit]Shortly after midnight on April 19, a Watertown police officer identified the brothers in a Honda Civic and the stolen SUV, and a "ferocious" gunfight followed on the 100 block of Laurel St, between the brothers and police arriving at the scene.[4][15][85] An estimated 200''300 rounds of ammunition were fired and at least one further bomb and several "crude grenades" were thrown.[85][86]

           According to Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau, the brothers had an "arsenal of guns."[87] Also according to Deveau, the older brother, Tamerlan, ran out of ammunition and was tackled and apprehended by police, while the younger brother Dzhokhar drove the stolen SUV toward police and over Tamerlan, dragging him a short distance down the street.[15][88][89][90] Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sped off, but about a half-mile away at the corner of Spruce and Lincoln streets he abandoned the car and escaped on foot.[15][84][91][92]

[spraying] the neighborhood ...

           Manhunt and capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev[edit]The FBI released additional photos of the two during the Watertown incident.[101] Early on April 19, Watertown residents received reverse 911 calls asking them to stay indoors.[102] On the morning of April 19, Governor Patrick asked residents of Watertown and adjacent cities and towns (Allston-Brighton, Boston, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, and Waltham)[103][104] to "shelter in place".[105]Somerville residents also received a reverse-911 call with orders to shelter in place.[106]

           A 20-block area of Watertown was cordoned off and residents were told not to leave their homes or answer the door as officers in tactical gear scoured the area. Helicopters circled the area and SWAT teams in armored vehicles moved through in formation, with officers going door-to-door.[107] On the scene were the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Guard, the Boston and Watertown Police departments and the Massachusetts State Police. The show of force was the first major field test of the interagency task forces created in the wake of the September 11 attacks.[108]

Seven improvised explosive devices were recovered by bomb squads.[111]

           The manhunt ended on the evening of April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted.[114] Outside the search area, a Watertown resident stepped outside and noticed that the cover on his boat in his back yard was loose.[115] He looked into the boat and saw a body lying in a pool of blood, and he promptly notified police.[116] Authorities surrounded the boat and verified movement through a forward looking infraredthermal imaging device in a State Police helicopter.[4][117] When the suspect started poking at the tarp of the boat, police began a large volume of gunfire at the boat, stopping only after the Superintendent on the scene called for a cease fire. Celebrations followed law enforcement's capture of Tsarnaev.[118][119]

           Legal proceedings[edit]Interrogation[edit]United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King, suggested that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, should be tried as an unlawful enemy combatant rather than as a criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel.[126][127] Other sources, including Alan Dershowitz, a prominent American legal scholar and lawyer, said that doing so would be illegal and would jeopardize the prosecution.[128][129] The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.[130]

           Dzhokhar was questioned for 16 hours by investigators but stopped communicating with them on the night of April 22 after Judge Marianne Bowler read him a Miranda warning.[78][131] Dzhokhar had not previously been given a Miranda warning, as federal law enforcement officials invoked the warning's public safety exception.[132] This raised doubts whether the suspect's statements during this investigation would be admissible as evidence and led to a debate surrounding Miranda rights.[133][134][135]

           Charges and detention[edit]On April 22, formal criminal charges were brought against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts during a bedside hearing while he was hospitalized. He was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction, and with malicious destruction of property resulting in death.[5] The charges carry potential sentences of life imprisonment or the death penalty.[136] Tsarnaev was judged to be awake, mentally competent, and lucid, and he responded to most questions by nodding. When the judge asked him whether he was able to afford an attorney, he responded "no"; he is represented by the Federal Public Defender's office.[137] On April 26, Dzhohkar Tsarnaev was moved from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the Federal Medical Center at Fort Devens, about 40 miles (64 km) from Boston. FMC Devens is a federal prison medical facility at a former Army base[138] where he is being held in solitary confinement at a segregated housing unit[139] with 23-hour-per-day lockdown.[140][141]

           Motives and backgrounds[edit]According to FBI interrogators, Dzhokhar and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamic beliefs, and "were not connected to any known terrorist groups"; instead learning to build explosive weapons from an online magazine published by al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen.[16] It is further alleged that "[Dzhokhar and] his brother considered suicide attacks and striking on the Fourth of July;[147] but ultimately decided to use pressure cooker bombs (capable of remote detonation) and other IEDs." Fox News reported that the brothers "chose the prestigious race as a 'target of opportunity' ... [after] the building of the bombs came together more quickly than expected".[148][149]

           Dzhokhar said he and his brother wanted to defend Islam from the U.S., which conducted the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, in the view of the brothers, against Muslims.[6][130][150] Later a CBS report revealed that a note scrawled by Dzhokhar with a marker on the interior wall of the boat where he was hiding said the bombings were "retribution for U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq", and called the Boston victims 'collateral damage', "in the same way innocent victims have been collateral damage in U.S. wars around the world."[151] According to The New York Times the portion of the boat's interior with the note would likely be cut from the hull with permission from the owner and presented in court as evidence.[152]

           Despite the seemingly outwardly religious motivation of the Tsarnaev brothers, some political science and public policy scholars suggest that Islam may have played only a secondary role in the attacks.[153] Sympathy towards the political aspirations in the Caucasus region and Tamerlan's inability to become fully integrated into American society appear to be the primary motives in their opinion.[153] According to The Los Angeles Times, a law enforcement official said Dzhokhar "did not seem as bothered about America's role in the Muslim world" as his brother Tamerlan had been.[59] Dzhokhar identified Tamerlan as the "driving force" behind the bombings, and said that his brother had only recently recruited him to help.[130][154]

His goal was a place on the U.S. Olympic boxing team saying that "unless his native Chechnya becomes independent" he would "rather compete for the United States than for Russia".[165] He was married on July 15, 2010 in the Masjid Al Quran Mosque[166] in Dorchester, to a U.S. citizen, Katherine Russell, who was pregnant with their daughter.[167] He stated that he "didn't understand" Americans and had not a single American friend.

The FBI was informed by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in 2011 that he was a "follower of radical Islam."[171] In response, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan and his family, and searched databases, but did not find any evidence of "terrorism activity, domestic or foreign."[173][174][175][176][177][178] During the 2012 trip to Dagestan, Tamerlan was reportedly a frequent visitor at a mosque on Kotrova Street in Makhachkala,[179][180][181] believed by the FSB to be linked with radical Islam.[180] Some experts believe "they were motivated by their faith, apparently an anti-American, radical version of Islam" acquired in the U.S.,[182] while others believe the turn to radicalism happened in Dagestan.[183]

All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.[190] Tamerlan Tsarnaev had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his "best friend."[191] After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect.[188] Both ABC and The New York Times have reported that there is strong evidence that implicate Tsarnaev for this triple homicide.[191][192]

           Contrary to widespread reporting, no arrest has been made in connection with the Boston Marathon attack. Over the past day and a half, there have been a number of press reports based on information from unofficial sources that has been inaccurate. Since these stories often have unintended consequences, we ask the media, particularly at this early stage of the investigation, to exercise caution and attempt to verify information through appropriate official channels before reporting.[315][316]

           The decision to release the photos of the Tsarnaev brothers was made in part to limit damage done to those misidentified on the Internet and by the media, and to address concerns over maintaining control of the manhunt.[66]

           BBC News reported that the initial announcements from the authorities had been praised for using language "with care and deliberation" to avoid victimization of religious minorities, but that "a xenophobic undercurrent in the American response to the tragedy" was shown by some comments on social networking websites.[317]

           2014 anniversary incident[edit]On April 15, 2014, two unattended backpacks were found at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, one on Boylston Street. Police apprehended a man nearby, and the bomb squad was called to the scene.[318][319] The man was barefoot and wore a black veil and makeup on his face.[320] Boston police destroyed both packages, apparently containing rice cookers and confetti, and nobody was harmed.[320]

           Police evacuated the Boston Marathon finish line earlier tonight after they discovered two unattended backpacks at the site of last year's bombings. Both bags were detonated by a bomb squad. One of the bags contained a rice cooker filled with confetti; the other contained photo equipment.

           A man has been charged with possession of a hoax device, disorderly conduct, and disturbing the peace. He'd been wearing a black veil and yelling "Boston Strong!" on Boylston Street when he was detained. According to WBZ-TV's Peter Wilson, the suspect's name is Kayvon Edson, though a reader who knew him in high school says his name then was Kevin.

French said the man wore "black netting" and had no shoes on. It's unknown if the backpacks and the man are related incidents. (See updates below)

           Over the last decade, the United States has been drawn into a series of imbroglios in the Middle East and South Asia, sapping military and financial resources and frustrating policymakers who seem to have no good options for managing regional troubles. In Asia, by contrast, the picture is clearer. America has tangible economic, political and military interests there. The region is also where many believe America's global superpower status faces the most obvious challenge: China. Thus, realists such as John Mearsheimer, writing in TheNational Interest, approve of the ''pivot'' or ''rebalance.''

           In Asia, America is trying to support its allies and preserve regional stability in the face of rising tensions and nationalist recrudescence, while avoiding unnecessary confrontation with China. The recent diplomatic conflicts over air defense identification zones and increasing confrontations over territorial disputes demonstrate that playing referee in Asia while protecting American interests is no easy task. While Asia deserves America's focus and resources, the real dress rehearsal for China's challenge to America's superpower status is already taking place'--in the Middle East. Here, Mearsheimer's insistence on the need for Middle East retrenchment, in order to concentrate on the more serious rivalry with China, suffers from a major flaw in logic.

           History suggests that when a great power draws down from a region, another takes advantage and fills the void. And indeed, as America grows weary of its involvement in the Middle East, China is filling the vacuum. As a result, states in that region are using relations with China to push back against America, with few economic or political consequences. Unfortunately, American policymakers seem blind to this fact, looking at countries such as Syria and Iran, or those in Asia, as discrete issues, rather than as constituent parts of the broader great game that is taking place.

           Though China is not widely seen a major power in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf, it should be. Through its economic strength and power of attraction, the country has made major inroads that cannot be dismissed, and may be laying the key foundations for a new balance of power.

           China's ''rise'' has captured the imagination of many in the Arab world. Gulf rulers in particular stand in awe of how China's economy has skyrocketed (see the chart below) while rejecting Western norms and maintaining its own political structures. So fast has China's rise been that, since 2000, it has achieved practically 30 percent yearly average trade growth rate with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, 26 percent with the UAE and Iraq, and 28 percent with Iran

           Meanwhile, America's trade with the Gulf is in decline. Total trade decreased by $6.3 billion from 2012 to 2013. While some gains were made, the losses include a $3 billion drop in trade with Saudi Arabia and a $6 billion drop with Iraq. A reduction in oil imports accounts for a majority of this, but U.S. exports to Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman were also all down over this period. Chinese trade data for 2013 has yet to be reported, but based on these trends China has, or will this year, overtake America as the largest trading partner for every Gulf state.

           At the microeconomic level, Arabs and Iranians are becoming more aware of China in their daily lives. In Dubai, locals are increasingly shopping at the Dragon Mart, a mile-long mall where more than 4,000 Chinese vendors sell everything from basic goods to Qur'ans. Chinese motorcycles are commonplace, as are low-priced cell phones, cameras, shoes and cigarettes. China is even exporting large amounts of halal meat, raised and butchered in its Muslim-populated Ningxia region, to the Gulf.

           Meanwhile, China has spent considerable time and energy wooing Gulf States with soft power. Beijing has provided no-strings development funding, as well as a CCTV station to broadcast news in Arabic favorable to Chinese views. It is also trying to appeal to Arab youth through Confucius centers in the region aimed at framing how these youth see China, while also offering a growing number of scholarships for students to study in China. China's efforts have paid dividends. Recent polling showed that Arabs think China is the preferred global superpower: by 23 percent to America's 7 percent.

           Middle Eastern energy resources are seen as part of China's core national interests, vital to its continued growth, domestic stability, and thus the very survival of the Communist Party. Like the U.S., China fears instability in the Gulf that could produce energy supply disruptions and price spikes. These fears were institutionalized after the 2003 Iraq War, when China's leadership believed American policy was destabilizing the region's energy markets. It was at this point that China began to develop long-term strategies that would initially help it to contain American influence in the Gulf, while it developed enough power to form a new multipolar balancing alliance with regional states to curtail American unilateralism.

           China's core aim is to constrain the United States without direct confrontation. Such confrontation is unlikely in certain key areas where Chinese aims overlap with those of America. Elsewhere, though, Beijing can be seen acting more as a direct competitor to the U.S. In addition, China has developed the ability to accomplish its goals partly through its own efforts, but more so by exploiting America's missteps. Saudi Arabia is a case in point.

           Saudi irritation at American foreign policy has provided an opening for China, whose support is not conditional on human rights reforms or democratization. America's tentative decision to support the Arab Spring movement in Egypt'--dislodging Mubarak who was considered a regional security pillar by the House of Saud'--damaged relations. So too did the U.S. decision not to act against the Syrian regime.

           While ties with America were fraying, Saudi Arabia reached out to China. Since 2009, the Kingdom has dramatically increased oil exports to help China and has awarded it half a dozen major projects on healthcare, energy exploration, mining, and railroad construction in the Kingdom, totaling more than $2 billion. So important is the burgeoning relationship with Saudi Arabia that King Abdullah's first state visit after ascending to the throne was to China in 2006. The visit resulted in Saudi Arabia giving more help to China to develop an increased refining capacity for its oil. Since then, the Kingdom has also become the largest supplier of petrochemicals for Chinese textiles.

           Not to be left out, Iran has made similar moves, awarding telecommunications contracts and construction projects to Chinese companies. Iraq, looking to regain its regional power status, is also opening up its oil fields to Chinese companies in order to increase revenues and develop stronger relations.

           There are catches and traps, of course. While these agreements have helped China's development, the Chinese are just starting to understand the phrase, ''buyer beware.'' China's thrust into the region is presenting consequences and challenges that its foreign policy establishment does not wish, and may be ill equipped, to address. Like emerging international powers before it, China sees the dangers of the Gulf alliance quicksand, but may be unable to extricate itself. Each of the Gulf powers is trying to befriend the new kid on the block, pulling him to their side in the region's playground politics.

           While there have been disagreements about Iran and Syria, the Saudis continue to enhance Saudi-Sino relations because they see them as the tool by which to free themselves from American policies in the region. Riyadh wants America's continued security backing, but with fewer conditions attached. It realizes that China is the vehicle by which it can square that circle, because China now provides it economic security.

           This is not to over-hype the problems this poses for the United States. Rather than competing with China for resources, America's abundance of shale oil means it need not fear China's growing consumption. While China can now make it more laborious for America to operate in the Middle East, it cannot in the near term ''balance'' America in a traditional sense. America obviously retains tremendous power in the Middle East through its military and trade relations. Therefore, rather than fear China, it should point out China's policy discrepancies with others in the region while at the same time engaging with it.

           Ultimately, Beijing's overall policy objective is the same as Washington's: stability. Cooperation on a range of important regional issues should thus be possible. Indeed, China could actually be the missing piece of the puzzle that America seeks, giving it the opportunity to reduce its regional footprint while ensuring greater stability.

           Either way, China's growing status and power can no longer be ignored and must be factored into America's strategic thinking about the Middle East. The unseen price of the Asia pivot is that, while America focuses on China in Asia, China is being provided the time and space in the Middle East to develop and implement a skillful challenge to American power.

           EFF received these records in response to our Freedom of Information Act lawsuit for information on Next Generation Identification (NGI)'--the FBI's massive biometric database that may hold records on as much as one third of the U.S. population.

           NGI builds on the FBI's legacy fingerprint database'--which already contains well over 100 million individual records'--and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data, including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data. NGI combines all these forms of data in each individual's file, linking them to personal and biographic data like name, home address, ID number, immigration status, age, race, etc. This immense database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal, state and local law enforcement agencies across the United States.

           The records we received show that the face recognition component of NGI may include as many as 52 million face images by 2015. By 2012, NGI already contained 13.6 million images representing between 7 and 8 million individuals, and by the middle of 2013, the size of the database increased to 16 million images. The new records reveal that the database will be capable of processing 55,000 direct photo enrollments daily and of conducting tens of thousands of searches every day.

           Currently, if you apply for any type of job that requires fingerprinting or a background check, your prints are sent to and stored by the FBI in its civil print database. However, the FBI has never before collected a photograph along with those prints. This is changing with NGI. Now an employer could require you to provide a ''mug shot'' photo along with your fingerprints. If that's the case, then the FBI will store both your face print and your fingerprints along with your biographic data.

           In the past, the FBI has never linked the criminal and non-criminal fingerprint databases. This has meant that any search of the criminal print database (such as to identify a suspect or a latent print at a crime scene) would not touch the non-criminal database.  This will also change with NGI. Now every record'--whether criminal or non'--will have a ''Universal Control Number'' (UCN), and every search will be run against all records in the database. This means that even if you have never been arrested for a crime, if your employer requires you to submit a photo as part of your background check, your face image could be searched'--and you could be implicated as a criminal suspect'--just by virtue of having that image in the non-criminal file.

           The records detail the many states and law enforcement agencies the FBI has already been working with to build out its database of images (see map below). By 2012, nearly half of U.S. states had at least expressed an interest in participating in the NGI pilot program, and several of those states had already shared their entire criminal mug shot database with the FBI. The FBI hopes to bring all states online with NGI by this year.

           The FBI worked particularly closely with Oregon through a special project called ''Face Report Card.'' The goal of the project was to determine and provide feedback on the quality of the images that states already have in their databases. Through Face Report Card, examiners reviewed 14,408 of Oregon's face images and found significant problems with image resolution, lighting, background and interference. Examiners also found that the median resolution of images was ''well-below'' the recommended resolution of .75 megapixels (in comparison, newer iPhone cameras are capable of 8 megapixel resolution).

           At such a low resolution, it is hard to imagine that identification will be accurate. However, the FBI has disclaimed responsibility for accuracy, stating that ''[t]he candidate list is an investigative lead not an identification.''

           Because the system is designed to provide a ranked list of candidates, the FBI states NGI never actually makes a ''positive identification,'' and ''therefore, there is no false positive rate.'' In fact, the FBI only ensures that ''the candidate will be returned in the top 50 candidates'' 85 percent of the time ''when the true candidate exists in the gallery.''

           It is unclear what happens when the ''true candidate'' does not exist in the gallery'--does NGI still return possible matches? Could those people then be subject to criminal investigation for no other reason than that a computer thought their face was mathematically similar to a suspect's? This doesn't seem to matter much to the FBI'--the Bureau notes that because ''this is an investigative search and caveats will be prevalent on the return detailing that the [non-FBI] agency is responsible for determining the identity of the subject, there should be NO legal issues.''

           One of the most curious things to come out of these records is the fact that NGI may include up to 1 million face images in two categories that are not explained anywhere in the documents. According to the FBI, by 2015, NGI may include:

This is a problem because we do not know what rules govern these categories, where the data comes from, how the images are gathered, who has access to them, and whose privacy is impacted.

           A 2007 FBI document available on the web describes SPC as ''a service provided to Other Federal Organizations (OFOs), or other agencies with special needs by agreement with the FBI'' and notes that ''[t]hese SPC Files can be specific to a particular case or subject set (e.g., gang or terrorist related), or can be generic agency files consisting of employee records.'' If these SPC files and the images in the "new repositories" category are assigned a Universal Control Number along with the rest of the NGI records, then these likely non-criminal records would also be subject to invasive criminal searches.

           The company responsible for building NGI's facial recognition component'--MorphoTrust (formerly L-1 Identity Solutions)'--is also the company that has built the face recognition systems used by approximately 35 state DMVs and many commercial businesses. MorphoTrust built and maintains the face recognition systems for the Department of State, which has the ''largest facial recognition system deployed in the world'' with more than 244 million records, and for the Department of Defense, which shares its records with the FBI.

           The FBI failed to release records discussing whether MorphoTrust uses a standard (likely proprietary) algorithm for its face templates. If it does, it is quite possible that the face templates at each of these disparate agencies could be shared across agencies'--raising again the issue that the photograph you thought you were taking just to get a passport or driver's license is then searched every time the government is investigating a crime. The FBI seems to be leaning in this direction: an FBI employee email notes that the ''best requirements for sending an image in the FR system'' include ''obtain[ing] DMV version of photo whenever possible.''

           There are several reasons to be concerned about this massive expansion of governmental face recognition data collection. First, as noted above, NGI will allow law enforcement at all levels to search non-criminal and criminal face records at the same time. This means you could become a suspect in a criminal case merely because you applied for a job that required you to submit a photo with your background check.

           Second, the FBI and Congress have thus far failed to enact meaningful restrictions on what types of data can be submitted to the system, who can access the data, and how the data can be used. For example, although the FBI has said in these documents that it will not allow non-mug shot photos such as images from social networking sites to be saved to the system, there are no legal or even written FBI policy restrictions in place to prevent this from occurring. As we have stated before, the Privacy Impact Assessment for NGI's face recognition component hasn't been updated since 2008, well before the current database was even in development. It cannot therefore address all the privacy issues impacted by NGI.

          <li class="o outline">
           Finally, even though FBI claims that its ranked candidate list prevents the problem of false positives (someone being falsely identified), this is not the case. A system that only purports to provide the true candidate in the top 50 candidates 85 percent of the time will return a lot of images of the wrong people. We know from researchers that the risk of false positives increases as the size of the dataset increases'--and, at 52 million images, the FBI's face recognition is a very large dataset. This means that many people will be presented as suspects for crimes they didn't commit. This is not how our system of justice was designed and should not be a system that Americans tacitly consent to move towards.

           The 20 pot users in the study, ages 18 to 25, said they smoked marijuana an average of about four days a week, for an average total of about 11 joints. Half of them smoked fewer than six joints a week. Researchers scanned their brains and compared the results to those of 20 non-users who were matched for age, sex and other traits.

Federal agents raided an unknown number of marijuana dispensaries and growing sites in Colorado, confiscating piles of marijuana plants and cartons of cannabis-infused drinks just weeks before the state allows recreational marijuana retailers to open their doors.

           Four Denver-area medical marijuana businesses may be permanently shuttered after federal officials reportedly probing links with Colombian drug cartels raided the shops in November.

           The raid on the four interconnected companies came during a search of more than a dozen medical marijuana businesses in Denver and Boulder -- the largest by federal law enforcers on Colorado pot businesses since the state legalized medical marijuana in 2000. The Denver Post reported Tuesday that no federal charges have been filed as a result of the raids and people involved in the businesses denied any connection to illicit drug activity or Colombian drug cartels.

           Nevertheless, Colorado marijuana industry regulators are pursuing the shutdown of four of the raided businesses: VIP Cannabis, Kushism, and Highlands Cannabis Co. in Denver, as well as Grateful Meds in Nederland. State regulators notified the four shops on April 3 that state licenses to operate as medical marijuana dispensaries and cultivation facilities would be denied. The state alleged violations of state code that in some cases stretched back to 2012, according to state Marijuana Enforcement Division documents.

           The denial notices say regulators have placed administrative holds on the shops' inventory of "marijuana plants, marijuana, finished marijuana products, marijuana-infused products or other marijuana inventory." Shop owners have 60 days to request hearings on the denial notices.

           Federal raiders seized more than $2 million worth of marijuana plants and products from VIP Cannabis. Owners Carlos Solano and Gerardo Uribe said the raid forced them to lay off more than 100 employees. They reopened about a month later.

           The Department of Justice has released little about the raids, which came less than two months before Colorado's legal recreational marijuana shops opened. Federal authorities suggested the businesses may not have complied with guidelines outlined in DOJ's August memo that assented to the new retail marijuana laws in Colorado and Washington state.

           California's ongoing drought has been blamed on a lot of different factors, ranging from climate change to over consumption to the agricultural industry. But here's one more factor that may be draining California dry: marijuana farms. These farms '' some legal, most not '' soak up a tremendous amount of water in the wilderness. At summer's peak, each plant can soak up about six gallons of water a day, according to a recent report from McClatchy DC. It's so bad in some regions, particularly California's North Coast, that important fish populations are suffering.

           Illegal pot farms in Northern California have already been linked to extensive wildlife deaths, as the farms are often protected with rat bait. This has even affected federally protected endangered species. (California banned the sale of rat poison last month to help protect wildlife.)

           All of these problems are compounded by the fact that many pot farms are situated, illegally, on public land. "Those are lands that you and I own," Congressman Mike Thompson told McClatchy. "And when people are growing dope there and guarding their operations with guns and the likes, and sometimes with booby traps, we can't use the land that we own. It happens all over."

           Other pot farms are apparently being set up in secret on land belonging to traditional farmers. "[Pot] grows hidden in trees on someone else's farm have become more and more common over the past two years," an undercover drug agent told KCRA in February. The National Guard reported that these illegal growers put pumps, dams and irrigation tubing on the sites, diverting water from the farmers' canals. These illegal sites also use pesticides, which end up in the water, sometimes in wells intended for drinking.

           The marijuana industry, perhaps not surprisingly, says it is being scapegoated. "It's really easy to point fingers at a very large cash crop that's completely unregulated," Emerald Growers Association founding Chairwoman Kristen Nevedal told McClatchy. "It's one of the main cash crops of the state." Marijuana sales are projected to reach nearly $1 billion in California in 2014.

           Washington (CNN) -- A new video shows what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. And the CIA and the Pentagon either didn't know about it or couldn't get a drone there in time to strike.

           In the middle of the clip, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi, the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, has said he wants to attack the United States. But in the video, he looks unconcerned that he could be hit by an American drone.

           "The U.S. intelligence community should be surprised that such a large group of al Qaeda assembled together, including the leadership, and somehow they didn't notice," said Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst.

           Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. The CIA and the Pentagon have repeatedly killed AQAP leaders with drone strikes. But the group is now emboldened.

           "The main problem about this group is that it has a bomb maker who can put bombs on to planes that can't be detected," Bergen said.

           Al-Asiri doesn't appear in the video. He remains in hiding, and intelligence experts say he and other AQAP leaders have gone back to using couriers to communicate to avoid detection. That makes it even harder to figure out what al-Wuhayshi may order next.

           U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer" that leaks tied to Yemen have affected U.S. intelligence collection, but he said he couldn't say whether U.S. intelligence knew about the meeting.

He noted that there are more foreign militants fighting in Syria today than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined over the past 10 years:  ''Put very bluntly, Syria has become the most dangerous terrorist sanctuary in the world today'--and the United States has not coherent or credible policy for dealing with it.''

           Frederick Kagan, director of the critical threats project at the American Enterprise Institute, warned that the Obama Administration has underestimated the threat posed by al-Qaeda's ideology, which has inspired a global insurgency. He assessed that al-Qaeda's ''brand is spreading like wildfire, the groups affiliating themselves with it control more fighters, land and wealth than they ever have, and they are opening up new fronts.''

           Heritage Foundation analysts long have warned about the more permissive environment that al-Qaeda and other Islamist extremist groups have exploited in many countries destabilized by the ''Arab Spring'' uprisings.  Syria, in particular, has been a magnet for foreign militants and a rich recruiting ground for al-Qaeda.

           The chief takeaway from the hearing was that the Obama Administration needs to focus more on the revolutionary threat posed by al-Qaeda and its affiliates in the Middle East and Africa. Furthermore, the administration should alter its narrow definition of the al-Qaeda threat, which it currently holds as the immediate terrorist threat posed by the al-Qaeda core group based in Pakistan.

           WASHINGTON, DC -- U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Congressman Doug Lamborn, CO-05, today called for President Obama to immediately sign into law their bipartisan legislation that will prevent terrorists from getting visas to enter the United States as United Nations ambassadors.

           ''Congress has voted unanimously in support of a bill to reject Iran's deliberately insulting nomination of a known terrorist '' one of the 1979 hostage-takers '' to be their ambassador to the United Nations,'' said Sen. Cruz. ''I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting it, and urge the President to act quickly. We, as a country, can send an unequivocal message to rogue nations like Iran that the United States will not tolerate this kind of provocative and hostile behavior."

           ''I have been working hard with House Leadership to move this bill even before it passed the Senate,'' said Congressman Lamborn. ''I appreciate House Leadership's rapid response to my request to quickly bring the Cruz/Lamborn bill to the House Floor for a vote. It will give the President the power to prevent an Iranian terrorist from entering our country with diplomatic immunity. This is a great example of leadership in action by both Houses of Congress. After Senator Cruz worked to ensure Senate passage earlier in the week, I felt that it was extremely important that the House respond in-kind by considering the Cruz/Lamborn bill in an expedited manner. It is great to see Congress send a strong, bipartisan message that Iranian evildoers will be treated like terrorists, not tourists. Terrorists, from Iran or elsewhere, should not be allowed to walk the streets of Manhattan with diplomatic immunity.''

           It's all about a rancher named Cliven Bundy who has not paid his grazing fees since 1990 and is now upset that the government has come to collect over two decades in back fees.

           You see, Cliven believes that he has every right to graze his cows free of charge on public land. It's called welfare ranching and they believe their ''right'' to feed at the public trough trumps the right of endangered species to exist.

           Cliven Bundy is a cattle rancher whose family has lived near Bunkerville, NV for the last 140 years. The Bundy family's cattle have always grazed on what had always been state-owned, public land. In 1993, the Federal Government discovered that Bundy's grazing area was also home to the endangered Desert Tortoise. As a result, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) swooped in and took over control of the land. In order to dissuade farmers and ranchers from using the land and threatening the tortoise population, the BLM instituted a policy where ranchers would be forced to pay a grazing fee before using the land.

           (PW: Let me see, the Bundy family has lived on the land for 140 years and the desert turtle has lived there for hundreds of thousands of years. The Bundy family took their land by force from Native Americans but the turtles were there even before the Native Americans. In 1993, the government did not discover that the grazing area was home to the turtle. They knew that. What they discovered was that the turtle was endangered and one probable cause was over-grazing by rancher Bundy's cows.)

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           For Cliven Bundy, this was an unacceptable affront to his livelihood. His family has lived off this land for over a century, long before the creation of the BLM, and the idea that he would now have to pay a tax to protect a turtle was nothing short of absurd.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           (PW: To the turtles it is an unacceptable affront to their right to survive as a species. Rancher Bundy believes the turtle's right to survive is absurd yet he believes he has a God-given right to graze his cattle for profit at public expense. It is also not a tax but a grazing fee. In exchange for the fee, Bundy gets to graze his cattle. Bundy wants free food for his cows at public expense. In other words he wants welfare.)
          </li>
         </ul>

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           So, Bundy refused to pay the tax. He allowed his cattle to graze on the land and didn't pay the federal government a dime to do it. Why should he? The land is technically state-owned public land, yet the federal government want's a cut because of an endangered turtle. Well, after twenty years of court battles, the Bureau of Land Management has finally swooped in and begun confiscating Bundy's cattle at gunpoint to pay the $1.1 million that he owes in back ''grazing fees'' for using public land! This is absurd and should be a wake-up call to everyone! The government doesn't care about common sense or decency'... these militarized agencies and bureaus will use every law, regulation, and technicality to come after YOU with the full weight of the Federal government!

          <li class="o outline">
           (PW: The law assessed a fee and rancher Bundy refused to pay the fee for over two decades and now he seems surprised that the government has called to collect back fees. Otto states the land is state owned and public but somehow rancher Bundy has a right to use it free of charge. Bundy owes back fees and the government is collecting those back fees by the confiscation of the cattle that Bundy has been raising at the expense of the public. It's a classic case of welfare ranching where the rancher believes he is entitled to have his animals raised for slaughter at public expense. I hope the government does use every law, regulations and technicality to collect the back fees and to protect the right of the turtles to survive.)

           Now, the full weight of the government has come down on the Bundy ranch. There are snipers watching the family's movements, armed agents rounding up cattle, and the BLM has effectively made the whole area a ''constitution free zone,'' or at least that's what they want it to be. The land is public land on a public road. Yet, anyone who wants to protest the government's tyrannical actions is limited to doing so within a preset ''First Amendment Zone'' set up by government officials.

It is not Clive Bundy's land. It is however turtle land. Thank you United States government for defending our endangered turtles. As for snipers, the fact is with dozens of trigger happy militia nut bars in camo, armed to the teeth, the deployment of snipers seems like a reasonable response. I admit the First Amendment zone is unacceptable but by order of the Governor of Nevada it has been taken down.)

           That is ridiculous, and the protesters have fanned out, taking their frustration directly to the federal agents. In the last two days, one protester has been tackled to the ground and another has been shot with a stun gun. Now, militias from around the country have been mobilized and are beginning to arrive in Nevada to defend the ranch from this clearly tyrannical action. One county official warned the ''inbred'' militiamen (his words, not mine) from neighboring Utah that if they come to Cliven Bundy's aid, then they ''better have funeral plans.''

           The crux of the "sharing economy" is that someone else's property becomes yours for as long as you're willing to pay for it, usually no questions asked. In the case of Airbnb, you're going to miss out on room service, but in exchange for missing amenities, you get free reign of a stranger's apartment, without regulation or oversight. This is terrific if you want to break the law:

           The Aims study found the diversity of fish at the CO 2 vents was not influenced, but that fish nerve-stimulation mechanisms were altered, meaning the smell of predators became alluring.

           "What we have now also found in our study of fish behaviour in this environment is that the fish become bolder and they venture further away from safe shelter, making them more vulnerable to predators," said Alistair Cheal, co-author of the research.

           Over the winter, as polar vortices plunged the U.S. Midwest into weeks of unceasing cold, the icy covers of the Great Lakes started to make headlines. With almost 96 percent of Lake Superior's 32,000 miles encased in ice at the season's peak, tens of thousands of tourists flocked to the ice caves along the Wisconsin shoreline, suddenly accessible after four years of relatively warmer wintery conditions.

           The thing is, all of that ice takes a long time to melt. As of April 10, 48 percent of the five lakes' 90,000-plus square miles were still covered in ice, down from a high of 92.2 percent on March 6 (note that constituted the highest levels recorded since 1979, when ice covered 94.7 percent of the lakes). Last year, only 38.4 percent of the lakes froze over, while in 2012 just 12.9 percent did '' part of a four-year stint of below-average iciness.

           And as the Great Lakes slowly lose their historically large ice covers over the next few months, the domino effects could include lingering cold water, delayed seasonal shifts, and huge jumps in water levels.

           Already, the impact of this icy blockade can be felt. On March 25, five days after the official beginning of spring, the Soo Locks separating Lake Superior from the lower Great Lakes opened for the season. But after a long and harsh winter, Lake Superior's nearly 32,000 square miles were still nearly entirely covered in ice. It would be another eleven days before the first commercial vessel fought its way across Lake Superior '' with the aid of several dedicated ice breakers '' and down through the locks.

           The trip across Lake Superior to the Soo Locks, which usually takes 28 hours, took these first ships of the season nine days. A third ship had to return to Duluth after being damaged by the ice (Detroit District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Facebook).

           More than 200 million tons of cargo, mostly iron ore, coal, and grain, travel across the Great Lakes throughout the year. Even a little ice can make a big dent on this total. Only three shipments of coal were loaded up during March '' 69 percent less, by volume, than last year. Shipments of iron ore from the northern reaches of Minnesota were so low that the U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Indiana, had to scale back production significantly in early April.

           A sluggish start to the shipping season is just one of the cascading effects of the Midwest's cold and icy winter. Some are good, and will allow the region to recover from years of historically low water levels. Others, like this delayed shipping season, less so.

           Like the shipping troubles, some of the more unexpected things the lakes and their ecosystems could face in the next few months are the direct result of the lingering ice and cold:

           Throughout the winter, huge numbers of ducks that feed by diving below the water for fish ended up starving to death. Connie Adams, a biologist in New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, told the AP that the die-off was "unprecedented."Next in line for concern are a huge number of the Lakes' fish species. Warming water temperature often biologically triggers migration to traditional spawning grounds, and experts expect that Northern Pike, lake sturgeon, steelhead, and rainbow trout could make moves far later this year. As Shedd Aquarium research scientist Solomon David told Michigan Radio, later egg laying could mean younger and far weaker fish come next winter, leading to an even longer impact.Other changes will come about long after the ice melts, as water levels are predicted to rebound to levels not seen in the last few years. Seasonal shifts in water levels, with winter lows and summer highs, are normal. "If things stayed in sort of a balance, we would see all the lakes water levels going up and then going down. Every year: up, down; up, down," says Drew Gronewold, a scientist with NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. But, "when water levels change a lot over time, something is happening in one of those two parts of the season."

           Over the last few years, the summer highs and winter lows have both been well below their long-term average, as climate change produced far more rapid rates of evaporation. In December 2012, the Michigan-Huron system set a new low, breaking a record that had stood since the 1960s, according to Keith Kompoltowicz, the chief of watershed hydrology for the Army Corps of Engineers' Detroit District.

          <li class="o outline">
           Though Kompoltowicz says the usual March and April rise in water levels is occurring later than usual this year, already the lakes are seeing water levels that they haven't had for several years. This past March marked the first time since April of 1998 that Lake Superior had reached its long-term average. And over the next few months, melting snow will feed the lakes and colder water could lower the rates of summer and fall evaporation. The amount of rain could either add to or subtract from this total. The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration generally forecast water levels six months out, and predicted levels for this September, Kompoltowicz says, range from 10 to 13 inches higher than lake levels were a year ago.

           Here's what higher lake levels could mean:

          <li class="o outline">
           Shippers may be hurting now, but higher lake levels will allow them to load more cargo per boat later this year, according to the Chicago Tribune. These higher water lines also mean that those who manage the Great Lakes' harbors won't have to invest huge sums of money in dredging out the bottom. Ships will carry more, at less of a cost, once the ice melts.Fluctuations in water levels could also help maintain the diversity of plant and animal species along many coastal wetlands, according to Kurt Kowalski, a wetland ecologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Great Lakes Science Center. Too many years of consistently low water allows certain species, often non-native plants, to take over.And even far less large-scale ripple effects will matter. Scott Stevenson, the executive vice president of the company that manages Chicago's harbors, told the Tribune that higher water levels will allow them to rent out 100 expensive slips along the lakefront that shallow water took out of commission last year.Though water level changes even over a several year period are normal, the rebound from record-low water levels is going to be a relief from the hand-wringing of the last few years. But it will likely be a temporary one. A hot summer with little precipitation could mute the effects of the icy winter. And, even if the lakes have more water this year, 2014 could be nothing more than a blip as climate change continues to wreak havoc. "We don't know, as this winter really exemplified, what's going to happen," Gronewold says. "If we're going to have three more severe winters, or flip back to three more winters like we've had the past few years."

           "Nobody alive can say they've had it colder in Winnipeg," Dave Phillips, the national meteorologist with Environment Canada, said Friday. "The story about this winter was the relentlessness of it. There was really no break. It was from the get-go. Even October was a half-degree colder than normal.

           "Nobody had the look and feel of winter more than Winnipeg," he said. "So if we award the prize for citizens who've endured the toughest winter, I think you guys would win gold. I'm not sure you want to brag about misery, but... "

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           According to Phillips, the average temperature in December was -20.5 C, followed by January (-20.0 C) and February (-19.9 C). Then came March, which averaged -12.5 C, almost seven degrees colder than average.

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           That's what sent Phillips scouring the record books of Winnipeg temperatures dating back to the 1870s. He calculated the average temperature during the past four months at -18.3 C. In 1898, the average Winnipeg temperature from December to March was -18.4 C.

          <li class="o outline">
           Even more impressive, said Phillips, was the severity of a 2014 winter in the age of global warming.

          <li class="o outline">
           "It's hard to break a cold-weather record nowadays," he said. "When you compare Winnipeg to 1898, think about it -- there was only about 40,000 people. No cars. No heavy industry. No pavement. Not a lot of burning going on. So when you think you can break a record this year with all the urbanized effect, what they talk about in terms of climate change, it really is quite remarkable."

         </ul>

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           But wait, there's more. The average number of days the temperature plummets to -30 C is 12 in Winnipeg. This year, "there were 30 of those suckers," Phillips said.

         </ul>

          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           "So not only was it persistent, but it was intensely cold," he said.

         </ul>
         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">

          <li class="o outline">
           So while all the newsworthy issues associated with this winter -- blizzards, potholes, frozen water pipes -- have dominated the headlines, Phillips noted there's another cost: heating.
          </li>
         </ul>

          <li class="o outline">
           "Just to keep comfortable, you have to burn about 17 per cent more heating fuel because of the demands of the cold," he said. "So you can grin and bear it, but it takes money out of your pocket, too."
          </li>
         </ul>

           Not cold enough for you? Then consider that despite the length and depth of cold this winter, the snowfall now stands at 155 centimetres, well above the average of 100 cm.

           One plus of the coldest winter in more than a century is it probably has a positive effect on modest flood forecasts. Why? "It's been so cold it's probably the driest snow that's ever existed in the city," Phillips said.

           In the VICE interview the guy ranted on and on about how technology is evil and destroying the world while he crawled into his little sweat lodge with a feather in his hair. Of course, while expounding upon the evils of technology, he was running a website, had a Facebook page with 5,000 ''friends'' and a weekly podcast and was currently making deals with a network for a new TV show. Do you think he arraigned all of that with smoke signals?

           He and his co-host, Carolyn Baker, opened up the phone lines about midway through the show. No one called in at first for a long time.

           In actuality, Ruppert was sued for back rent on the office space in Ashland where he was located (about an hour south of CIAland) and there were many complaints from his subscribers (yes, he operated a paid subscription site for telling folks ''the truth'') that they hadn't received any newsletters since they moved there. He also ran afoul of a former employee who stated he sexually harassed her by coming into her office ''wearing nothing by his underwear and a smile''. She sued him and won $125,000

           In the VICE video at the end of the program (see part 6 here), Mr. Ruppert seems to be calling for the (or predicting) massive ''die off'' of human population, stating that before oil was discovered there were 1 billion people on the planet and that now at 7.1 billion, life as we know it is unsustainable. His conclusion is that there must be a ''die off'' in order to ''maintain balance''.

           UPDATE: Everyone gives Ruppert all this credit for showing up at a high school and spilling the beans about the CIA importing coke in front of then CIA director John Deutch but what people don't seem to take into consideration is that move actually facilitated Deutch's leaving the CIA and a guy by the name of George Tenet taking his place. Where did the ''whistleblower'' Ruppert get that intel which ultimately only served to get a more vicious careerist in place preceding 9/11? He got it from his CIA linked family.

           ''Initially, I thought it'd be interesting to talk to one such whistle-blower, to learn more about what makes the clock tick in his world where the bad guys aren't just in the movies. Mike Ruppert was a good candidate. For one thing, he had connections. His mother was a cryptographer for the NSA (National Security Agency). His father was an Air Force officer involved with the Titan IIIC project that launched the CIA's satellite surveillance system. He has cousins who were CIA agents, one of whom was with the OSS during WWII. And Mike himself was a highly regarded LAPD narcotics agent who was at one time engaged to a CIA domestic operative''  Tom Dooley, 1998

           So even the very first thing he did to garner credibility in the alternative news circles, was actually an ambush designed to get someone out of office who may or may not have gone along with the program and replace him with someone who would. Was Ruppert simply helping facilitate an in-house coup at the CIA? Did Tenet put him up to it through his multiple CIA linked family members?

           From The WildernessEditFrom The Wilderness was a newsletter published from 1998 to 2006 by the media company From The Wilderness Publications. The newsletter covered political and governmental issues. It was published eleven times per year but featured weekly updates online. Critics such as David Corn[17] and Norman Solomon argued that Ruppert on occasion veered off into making unsubstantiated conspiracy theory claims.

           The Ashland Daily Tidings would later report that, in June 2006, Ruppert had accused a former female employee of burglarizing the offices of From The Wilderness, a case in which Ruppert himself was considered a potential suspect. Around the same time, the former female employee accused him in turn of sexual harassment. Ruppert would later in 2009 be ordered to pay a $125,000 fine by the Oregon labor board in the case. The female employee claimed Ruppert fired her after she refused his sexual advances, Ruppert denies this and claims he fired her for "disruptive behavior, poor work performance and wearing inappropriate clothing". The former employee further claims Ruppert approached her in her office "wearing only his underwear and a smile", something Ruppert doesn't deny.[19][20][21]

I spent twenty-seven years as a dedicated public activist and that is something which I am no longer able or inclined to do. The price was ultimately too great."[23]

           As recently as 2010, Ruppert lived in Los Angeles, California and launched Collapse Network to build sustainable communities across the world. But in 2011 he announced on his Lifeboat Hour radio show that he was relocating to Sonoma County, California, because he thought that it would be a safer location in the event of societal collapse. Ruppert left the Collapse Network in May 2012.

           Columnist Norman Solomon has argued that Ruppert has a flawed analytical model. "Some of the problem is in how he characterizes news reports. These citations can be narrowly factual yet presented in a misleading way. Yes, such-and-such newspaper reported that thus-and-so claim was made by so-and-so. The paper reported on the claim, but that doesn't mean the claim is true."[24]

           By Bill Van Auken17 April 2014As the government of President Nicols Maduro entered a second round of talks with Venezuela's right-wing opposition, a leading national daily reported that the number of military officers under arrest for involvement in an alleged coup plot has risen to over 30.

          <li class="o outline">
           The talks, which have been billed as a vehicle for pulling Venezuela out of its political and economic crisis, and the alleged military conspiracy have both unfolded in the context of two months of nationwide protests, riots and street blockades organized by the right with the aim of forcing the year-old administration of Maduro from office. Those organizing the violent street clashes, which have claimed at least 40 lives, have enjoyed longstanding political support and funding from Washington.

           Citing unnamed high level sources at the Miraflores presidential palace, Ultimas Noticias reported that among those in custody were the Rivero Lago brothers'--one of them a colonel and the other a lieutenant colonel'--two officers from the National Guard, two from the Navy and one from the Army. The majority of those implicated were from the Air Force, as were the three generals whose arrests were announced three weeks ago: Oswaldo Hernndez Snchez, Jos(C) Machillanda Daz and Carlos Milln Yaguaracuto.

           According to the report, the plot had been set to unfold on March 20, at the height of the violence orchestrated by the right and was to include air maneuvers and the strafing of Army soldiers as part of a plan to trigger nationwide upheavals and a military seizure of power.

           The investigation, according to the report, had uncovered links between the alleged military conspirators and at least one leading member of the right-wing opposition.

          <li class="o outline">
           President Maduro, whose public announcement of the arrest of the three generals coincided with last month's arrival in Venezuela of a mission of foreign ministers from the UNASUR (Union of South American Nations) seeking to mediate between the government and the right, made no comment directly on the revelation of a significantly wider coup plot.

           In a rally called to mark the first anniversary of his election as president on April 15, however, he warned that a coup was being prepared to overthrow his government as a ''strategic play by the great powers'' to gain control of Venezuela's oil reserves and use them as a means of ''dominating'' Russia, China and India.

           ''The world must know that the coup against the Bolivarian revolution is also a coup against the independent energy development of the world,'' Maduro said. He added that, if this strategy were successful, it would sink the economies of 18 Caribbean countries that benefit from Petrocaribe, a Venezuelan program providing subsidized oil, and open the door to their ''recolonization.''

           Even while denouncing the coup threats against his government, Maduro has moved ahead with talks with the right-wing opposition aimed at reaching an accommodation. After a six-hour publicly televised round held last week, the two sides met for closed-door discussions on Tuesday.

           At the end of the meeting, the two sides announced that the government's rightist opponents had agreed to participate in a ''pacification'' plan being prepared by the government to crack down on the country's high crime rate.

           Ram"n Guillermo Aveledo, the secretary general of the opposition coalition known as MUD (Democratic Unity Roundtable), said that the opposition, which controls three of Venezuela's states, 76 municipalities and the metropolitan Caracas government, would work together with the government. ''We are prepared to coordinate on the plans for security and peace,'' he said.

           In particular, the two sides discussed the case of Ivn Simonovis, the US-trained Caracas metropolitan police commander, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the shootings that killed 19 demonstrators and wounded around 60 more during the CIA-backed coup against then-President Hugo Chavez in April 2002. Aveledo said that in the spirit of ''national reconciliation,'' special attention would be given to Simonovis's case as well as to those of other police jailed on similar charges. The opposition is also seeking the release of right-wing leaders jailed for instigating violence during the current round of protests, including Leopoldo L"pez, the head of the Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) party.

           The two sides also agreed to the broadening of a ''Truth Commission'' proposed by the government to investigate responsibility for the violence that has plagued the country since mid-February.

           Mediating these talks are the foreign ministers of three UNASUR countries'--Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador'--and the Vatican's representative in Venezuela.

           In recent Senate testimony, US Secretary of State John Kerry, who had previously denounced the Venezuelan government for what it called a ''terror campaign against its own people'' and threatened US sanction, voiced Washington's ''strong support'' for the UNASUR's mediation efforts and expressed the hope for an ''honest dialogue'' to deal with ''the legitimate demands of the people of Venezuela.''

           Clearly, the hope of Washington'--like that of the Venezuelan right itself'--is that with the aid of the UNASUR governments and the Vatican these talks can be used to push the Maduro government further to the right. Colombia, the closest US ally in Latin America, is serving as one of the mediators, while Brazil's position was indicated in a statement made by the country's former president Lula da Silva, who called for Maduro to form a coalition government with the right as a means of ''diminishing tension.'' Lula insisted that a power-sharing deal must be reached because, for Brazil, ''Venezuela is strategic.''

           The talks have generated increasing unease within the Venezuelan working class as the government has engaged in ''peace conferences'' with the country's wealthiest businessmen and big business associations and ''dialogue'' with the right, while implementing policies that have driven down real wages, including currency devaluations and the lifting of price controls.

           The last two months of violent protests have been concentrated in wealthy and better-off middle class neighborhoods, while the masses of Venezuelan workers and poor have shunned them. Nonetheless, rising prices, shortages of basic necessities and repression of workers' strikes has generated rising popular anger against both the government and the right.

           This has found pale reflection in protests by unions at their exclusion from any of the discussions of the crisis organized by the government. Last week, leaders of the Workers Federation of the western state of Zulia protested that ''until now only the powerful economic groups and capitalists are the ones that are meeting with the government'' seeking their own interests.

           Er zitten 11.769 mensen opgesloten in de Belgische gevangenissen. De ochtendeditie van De Standaard bericht over dat nieuw record. Het groeiend aantal personen in voorhechtenis is de hoofdoorzaak van die stijging.

           Al sinds 2008 stijgt de gevangenisbevolking: van 9.804 tot 11.769 op 1 april dit jaar. En dat is een absoluut record.

           De toename van het aantal gedetineerden speelt zich al decennia af en het aantal plaatsen in de cellen kan die constante groei niet bijbenen. Volgens de laatste gegevens die de FOD Economie van Justitie kreeg, is er in de Belgische gevangenissen een capaciteit van 9.592 plaatsen. Met andere woorden: er is een tekort van meer dan twintig procent.

           De groei van de gevangenisbevolking komt door de grote instroom van mensen die in voorhechtenis zitten: zij zijn (nog) niet veroordeeld voor de feiten waarvoor ze zijn opgesloten en blijven in afwachting van een proces of uitspraak in de gevangenis.

           By Kumaran Ira14 April 2014On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in France and in Italy, protesting the social-democratic governments' austerity measures and pro-market labour reforms.

           The protest in Rome, attended by tens of thousands of people, ended in violence as police attacked protesters. The police used tear gas and baton-charged demonstrators. There were dozens of lighter injuries among police and protesters, and at least six arrests, police said.

           In France, the protest was called by the unions and their pseudo-left supporters, the New Anti-capitalist Party and the Left Front, a coalition of the Stalinist French Communist Party (PCF) and the Left Party of Jean-Luc M(C)lenchon. In the rally, Alexis Tsipras, the chairman of the Greek Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), marched alongside Pierre Laurent of the PCF, M(C)lenchon and NPA spokesman Olivier Besancenot. Tsipras is the European Left (EL) candidate for the Presidency for the European Commission in the European elections.

           Turnout at the Paris protest was around 25,000 people, according to police estimates, though the PCF claimed 100,000 participated. Several other protests were also called in other French cities, including a protest of 1,600 in Marseille.

           In Paris, protesters carried banners criticizing austerity measures being carried out by the Socialist Party (PS) government of President Franois Hollande. Banners read, ''Enough, Hollande,'' ''If you're left-wing, you tax the financial sector,'' ''If you're left-wing, you help the workers,'' or ''If you're left-wing, Europe means people first.''

           The relatively low turnout for the rally in Paris, despite deep opposition to the social agenda of the EU and of France's PS government, reflects deepening popular disillusionment and anger with the reactionary politics of the European pseudo-left. The rally drew largely on the membership and periphery of the pseudo-left parties and had the air of a family festival.

           The Left Front and the NPA play a similar role to their counterpart, Syriza, which helped the ''troika'''--the European Commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank'--impose devastating austerity measures on the Greek working class. While making tactical criticisms of EU policy, Syriza did everything to block social opposition and tacitly backed the crushing of strikes against austerity. This allowed the ''troika'' to cut wages by 30 percent or more and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs.

           As for the PS, after a humiliating defeat in the March municipal election that saw a significant victory for the neo-fascist National Front (FN), it is shifting further to the right, vowing to intensify austerity and making law-and-order appeals to the FN. The government is planning to slash '50 billion in yearly public spending under Hollande's so-called ''Responsibility Pact.''

           The sharp turn to the right reflects the disintegration of bourgeois ''left'' politics in France and Europe as a whole. Workers' deep social opposition to these reactionary policies finds no expression in the reactionary politics of the protest organisers, the NPA and Left Front, however, which are key allies of the PS and supporters of the EU.

           Their empty opposition to Hollande is a political fraud. The NPA and the Left Front supported Hollande against right-wing incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy during the 2012 presidential elections, working to promote illusions in the PS. While acknowledging that Hollande would carry out austerity policies, they claimed that the PS could be pressured to adopt left-wing policies. These claims have proven completely bankrupt.

           After the rally, the Left Front and the NPA cynically claimed that they would not allow the PS to carry out austerity measures. Besancenot said, ''The message is clear, Manuel Valls is starting out with a first protest, and it's important because this means a new political scenario is opening.''

           Such remarks are a backhanded acknowledgement of the widespread sentiment in the population that there is no political left in France, and that the PS and its allies, including the Left Front and the NPA, are indifferent or hostile to workers' interests.

           The verbal opposition of M(C)lenchon and Besancenot to the PS offers nothing to workers seeking to fight EU-dictated austerity measures, however. They are mere political shadows of the PS itself. Their aim in calling this protest is to subordinate the working class to the reactionary agenda of the EU and the PS government, blocking a politically independent movement of the working class against the capitalist ruling elite.

           The protest in Rome was called against rising housing costs, unemployment and labour market reforms amid a slowdown of the Italian economy. Protesters denounced the social-democratic Democratic Party (PD) government of Matteo Renzi, who is planning to reform labour rules to make it easier for companies to hire and fire employees.

           Problem: Being too trusting is often associated with a sort of navet(C) or foolishness'--if you really understood the way the world works, you'd be looking out for number one. You don't want to get played, be a sucker, fall prey to schemes or betrayal. None of the ''smart'' reality TV show contestants are here to make friends, right? Or at least, you know, the wily ones.

           Science says trust is good for you, though, and it's good for society. Previous research has shown that ''generalized trust'''--that is trusting other members of society generally, rather than trusting your friends or family specifically'--is linked to better self-reported health and happiness. And ''countries whose citizens place greater trust in one another have more efficient public institutions and experience higher rates of economic growth.'' So notes a recent study published in PLOS One, which adds to the literature on the topic by looking at how generalized trust is related to intelligence.

           Methodology: Noah Carl and Francesco C. Billari of the University of Oxford analyzed data from the General Social Survey, a nationally representative U.S. public opinion survey administered every one to two years. Generalized trust was measured by the question, ''Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you can't be too careful in dealing with people?'' To measure intelligence, they looked at participants' scores on a 10-question vocabulary quiz (''Despite its brevity, the test has a correlation of 0.71 with'...an IQ exam developed by the U.S. Military,'' the study notes), as well as the interviewer's assessments of how well participants understood the survey questions.

           Results: Both vocabulary and question comprehension were positively correlated with generalized trust. Those with the highest vocab scores were 34 percent more likely to trust others than those with the lowest scores, and someone who had a good perceived understanding of the survey questions was 11 percent more likely to trust others than someone with a perceived poor understanding. The correlation stayed strong even when researchers controlled for socio-economic class.

           Implications: ''The finding that generalized trust is highly correlated with intelligence, even after conditioning on socio-economic characteristics such as marital status, education, and income, supports the hypothesis that being able to evaluate someone's quality as a trading partner is a distinct component of human intelligence, which evolved through natural selection,'' the study reads.

           A sequence of important events that occurred in Saudi Arabia, simultaneously with the recent visit of U.S. President Barack Obama to that country, have roused close attention and numerous comments of analysts around the world. First of all, this is because the kingdom is one of the leading oil producers and exporters in the world. Moreover, not only is Saudi Arabia the leader of the so-called Sunni Arab bloc, but it also plays a major role throughout the Arab world. In addition, if we consider just these two roles, it is natural that any change in the leadership of this country would be cause for close attention of the world community.

           The visit of U.S. President Barack Obama to Saudi Arabia, so widely touted in the West, has led to very disastrous results. Western, and especially American media, which greatly discussed this event on the eve of the visit, after the completion of the American president's mission, is now keeping silent. The formal reports were so brief that they produced the impression that this was a visit to some third-rate country, rather than a visit to the current leader of the Arab world, which is being asked to play a decisive role in the global arena.

           After the talks with King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, Barack Obama said, trying to make the best of bad situation, that ''despite their differences, both countries continue their friendship and cooperation''. Thus, we can say that the optimistic plans of the Saudi rulers, that the Americans would pull their Middle East chestnuts out of the fire, have failed. As usual, the United States is only pursuing its selfish goals and plans, regardless of the opinions even of its old allies. This apparently explains the fact that the official statements on the visit of Barack Obama to Saudi Arabia were indecently chary. As the saying goes, if there is nothing good to be said, it is better to keep silent.

           Indeed, as the events show, the Saudi king and his entourage are deeply disappointed by Washington's deviation from the previous strategic course, which has bound together both countries for 70 years '' and where Riyadh has always played the role of errand boy for the Americans. We should recall that on February 14, 1945, a historical meeting took place aboard the U.S. Navy ship USS Quincy in the Suez Canal. The U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia's King Abdul Rahman bin Saud Al Saud (Ibn Saud). Under this agreement, the U.S. guaranteed continued support for the Saudi royal family and the Aramco Oil Company, while they would provide an uninterrupted supply of the black gold. These relationships have been maintained almost until the last day, despite many ups and downs in connection with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However now, Washington, being guided by its selfish reasons, is gradually beginning to depart from its unconditional support of Riyadh.

           Nevertheless, one theme of Saudi-US negotiations, as diplomatic sources have noted, has been kept fully secret. This concerned the transfer of power in Saudi Arabia, given that the current King Abdullah is 90 years old, the Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz is 79, the governance of the country, in most cases, is being carried out by other people, but of course these are members of the Saud family. On this occasion, a well-informed Arabic newspaper Al Quds Al Arabi, citing Saudi sources, wrote: ''King Abdullah has learned his lesson from the change of power in Qatar, but still has not determined the time to transfer the crown and throne to his brother Salman bin Abdulaziz.'' It is well known that Crown Prince Salman, just like King Abdullah, has physical disabilities. Some persons close to the supreme authority of the kingdom claim that given the poor state of his health, Prince Salman apparently will refuse to accept the throne.

           This is confirmed by the fact that Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud was appointed as the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. He has the potential to become the Crown Prince and King, in the case of death of any of the Saudi patriarchs, according to the TV channel Al Arabiya. Experts of the channel believe that this appointment reduces tensions around the question of succession to the throne in Saudi Arabia. The 70-year-old Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the youngest son of the founding father of the kingdom, is considered one of the main contenders for the Saudi throne. Since 2005, he has headed the country's intelligence services, and also served as the second Deputy Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia. ''The 70-year-old Muqrin, stepbrother of the monarch,'' wrote the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, ''will inherit the throne upon the death, or refusal to take power, of the current Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, whose health may not allow him to take ascent the throne.''

           The Saudi king also appointed his eldest son Mutaib, third heir in line to the throne, according to Saudi media. Prince Mutaib, the eldest son of the present King, will respectively, follow Prince Muqrin, who is second in line to the throne. As King Abdullah says, the health of the 79-year-old Crown Prince Salman is a major concern, and he may in the future refuse to lead the country. The Saudi monarch intends to call the so-called Allegiance Council, consisting of 34 representatives of the ruling Saudi family, to approve of his will. In accordance with the rules for succession of power in the Saudi Kingdom, the throne is passed inside the ruling family from brother to brother, by seniority. The Allegiance Council was created in 2006 to regulate the transition of power by the right of succession. In case of the death of the king, this council enthrones the successor and appoints the next crown prince.

           The thing is that Abdul Rahman bin Saud Al Saud (Ibn Saud), who founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, left a testament to his sons, which stipulated the transfer of power from one son to another. Ibn Saud was a very amorous Bedouin, who only officially was married to 19 women, not counting the so-called temporary, brief marriages. Annually, for almost 10 years, Ibn Saud went to a Saudi Arabian city for one day, visiting during a local Muslim holiday. There, he formally married one of the women, spent the night with her, and in the morning got divorced and returned to Riyadh. The following year, that woman would show him the child that was born during that year and the whole procedure was repeated. However, neither these women nor their children were considered as legitimate family for Ibn Saud. His official wives gave birth to 21 daughters and 45 sons, or perhaps more, as the special committee, which was created to find the heirs of Ibn Saud, keeps working hard and is always giving different figures. In other words, there are very many contenders to the royal throne, but Ibn Saud, who died in 1953, apparently did not anticipate that the issue of succession would be very relevant after 80 years. Today, the total number of members of the family of Saud reaches 25,000 people, including more than 200 princes.

           It should be noted that the influence of the members of the royal family is primarily determined by their belonging to a particular family clan, whose members are connected to each other with close kinship relations (usually brothers and uncles on their mother's side). In their activities, the princes have to confine themselves to the position, occupied by their clan. However, they make wide use of solidarity within the clans, and provide mutual support in obtaining government positions and consolidating their positions in state structures. The most important family clan is the Al Sudairi. The ''core'' of the clan was constituted by seven sons of King Abdulaziz from Hassa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi. The ''second generation'' of princes, the clan support, is mainly represented by the sons of the ''Seven Sudairi''.

           A certain counterbalance to the influence of the Sudairi clan in the ruling family and the state is created by the Sunaiyan clan of eight brothers '' the sons of former King Faisal. The most prominent of them is the Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. According to some accounts, the Sunaiyan clan is patronized by King Abdullah, who is, on his mother's side, the representative of a less influential clan than Sudairi '' the Shammar clan.

           Enormous changes are brewing in Saudi Arabia now, and a change of generations may occur, as King Abdullah and Crown Prince Salman are not just old, but seriously ill. Tensions are increasing and contradictions are spreading in the ruling Saud family, because the younger generation no longer wants to live by the standards of the 18th century Wahhabis. The protests of the Shiite minority, living in the country's main oil production areas, are also growing. The shortsighted policy of involving the kingdom in conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Egypt and Iraq has damaged the country. Hostility towards Iran, which is quickly coming out from Western isolation is artificially fomented. Everything seems to indicate that these changes will happen very soon, and they will affect not only the country, but also the entire Arab world. These will have an impact on the overall global policy.

           While the western media paints Vladmir Putin as some cross between Napoleon and Hitler marauding across Europe breaking international laws willy-nilly, there is one red line he is apparently unwilling to cross. In a somewhat surprising turn of events, none other than Edward Snowden called in to a Putin live telethon and asked the Russian President: "Does Russia intercept millions of citizens' data?" Putin's response (whether true or not) is worth paying attention to by his opponent on the world stage: "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country."

           In Compton last year, police began quietly testing a system that allowed them to do something incredible: Watch every car and person in real time as they ebbed and flowed around the city. Every assault, every purse snatched, every car speeding away was on record'--all thanks to an Ohio company that monitors cities from the air.

           The Center for Investigative Reporting takes a look at a number of emerging surveillance technologies in a new video, but one in particular stands out: A wide-area surveillance system invented by Ross McNutt, a retired Air Force veteran who owns a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems.

           McNutt describes his product as "a live version of Google Earth, only with TiVo capabilities," which is intriguing but vague (and also sounds a lot like the plot of this terrible Denzel movie). More specifically, PSS outfits planes with an array of super high-resolution cameras that allow a pilot to record a 25-square-mile patch of Earth constantly'--for up to six hours.

           It's sort of similar to what your average satellite can do'--except, in this case, you can rewind the video, zoom in, and follow specific people and cars as they move around the grid. It's not specific enough to ID people by face, but, when used in unison with stoplight cameras and other on-the-ground video sources, it can identify suspects as they leave the scene of a crime.

           The PSS system has been tested in cities including Baltimore and Dayton, and, last year, police officers in Compton used it to track crimes, including a necklace snatching. In one case, they could track a criminal as he approached a woman, grabbed her jewelry, and then ran to a getaway car. They eventually drove out of frame, which meant they weren't caught'--but, as the Compton police explain in this video, the system told them that this particular car was involved, at the very least.

           Plenty of critics argue the technology is an ominous invasion of privacy: Video surveillance free of any traditional technological barriers, tracking everyone and everything that moves in a city. But according to police and its creators, it's not as invasive as other systems, because it can't see into homes or identify faces. It "allows us to provide more security with less loss of privacy than any of the other options that are out there," says one officer. That's definitely one way to look at it.

           (NECN) - Kevin Edson, a 25-year-old Boston man, was detained Tuesday night and the area near the Boston Marathon finish line evacuated after an unattended backpack was found.Boston Police said a backpack was left unattended by the finish line at 6:50 p.m. There was a second bag, but that was not left by the suspect.  The Boylston Street area was shut down for about 3 hours, with pedestrians and motorists asked to avoid the area.

           NECN witnessed a man being put in the back of a police cruiser on Tuesday night. Boston Police said the suspect faces charges of threatening battery, disorderly conduct, possession of a hoax explosive device, threats to commit a crime, disturbing a public assembly and disturbing the peace. According to the Suffolk District Attorney, he is expected to be arraigned on those charges Wednesday in Boston Municipal Court.

           "With the marathon coming, we are taking it seriously," Boston Police Superintendent Randall Halstead said. "Our officers have been trained in looking for any kind of suspicious activity. I want to emphasize the fact that the safety of the public is utmost, and the training my officers have gone through will come to the forefront. That's what we're going to do to make this the best marathon in the wake of last year."

           Halstead said the suspect was taken into custody after an officer saw him "walking down the middle of Boylston Street in the rain, barefoot." Eyewitnesses also told NECN the man was wearing all black with a veil and hat covering his face and he was screaming. He also had blue and yellow paint on his face. The officers who stopped Edson also noticed a rice cooker in the man's backpack. Fragments consistent with a rice cooker were recovered after it was detonated by police.One backpack was detonated by the bomb squad around 8:50 p.m. The second bag was detonated shortly after 9:30 p.m. Boston Police later said that both unattended bags were "disrupted" for precautionary reasons.NECN General Manager Mike St. Peter released a statement saying, "One of the two bags that police detonated last night belonged to a NECN news crew. The crew had put down their bag - which contained cables - while on the scene covering last night's developments. They were not permitted to retrieve the bag when the area was quickly evacuated. The NECN crew cooperated while asking officers several times if they could get their bag back. Because of the ongoing investigation, police denied access. Once the scene was cleared, the crew picked up the remains of the bag." NECN is owned by NBCUniversal.

           When Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 back in November of 2012, they set in motion a system for adults to legally obtain recreational marijuana. But there's been less attention on how to keep it away from those for whom it's still illegal - anyone under 21. Parents and educators are struggling to fill the void, but public health campaigns are only in the planning stages.

           BRUNDIN: Also on the panel was Dr. Judith Shlay, associate director of Denver Public Health, the city's public health department. She points to research showing that teens who use marijuana heavily risk a six to eight point reduction in their adult IQ, similar to lead poisoning, and long-term trouble with abstract reasoning and decision making.

           BRUNDIN: One in six kids who uses marijuana eventually becomes addicted to it according to studies cited by the National Institutes of Health. Lisa Filholm is a Denver mom who attended the panel. She has had lots of open, very candid discussions with her two teen sons about the pressures and temptations to use pot. But at the end of the day, she says, kids need firm boundaries.

           LISA FILHOLM: And I think it's pretty clear. When you're an adult, figure it out for yourself. When you're a kid, nope, zero. I mean, we have a zero tolerance policy in our house, which involves urine testing at home if we think we need it. We put our foot down. No way. No way. The answer was no way. And I think that is how you have to handle it.

           BRUNDIN: That kind of no-nonsense approach is exactly what Denver Health's Judith Shlay recommends. Shlay points to a regular survey of Denver students showing that what a parent thinks about marijuana is actually a huge factor in whether kids will use.

           SHLAY: If they perceived that the parent approves of it, they are more than three times to four times as likely to use marijuana, alcohol. So parents, how they communicate their feelings about this is very important for kids.

           BRUNDIN: But how parents feel about marijuana isn't simple. Many parents at the event don't have a problem with pot being legal. Some may even use it themselves. They just don't want their kids using it. One of their big questions: If you ever smoke pot, should you tell your kids? Several parents at the South High forum felt they should be honest. But research actually shows the opposite.

           Health educator Mandy Copeland points to a study of 650 teens, which found that children whose parents stayed mum about past drug use and who delivered a strong anti-drug message were much more likely to develop anti-drug attitudes of their own.

           COPELAND: Teens just don't have the capacity at this age to process that information. And I think parents often share that out of goodwill to say: I made some mistakes, hopefully you don't make these as well. But when in fact, teens really can't process it and instead say: Oh, well, my parents did it. They're functioning, healthy adult, and so I'll be OK.

           BRUNDIN: Copeland doesn't think parents should lie if asked directly but could instead try to redirect the conversation back to why teen use is harmful. And Dr. Shlay points out that even if parents do have drug experience, it's likely out of date.

           SHLAY: We know that the marijuana of today is not the marijuana of parents' generation when they were kids. It's much, much more potent. We don't know what's in all marijuana products, so we can't say that one puff is like four puffs before, or whatever that is.

           ANGEL: There's two parts of the brains. There's the impulses, and then there's the breaks. And when you're a teen, the impulses are really strong and the breaks aren't very well developed.

           Dr. Sanjay Gupta is in Guinea reporting on the Ebola outbreakEbola has spread to Conakry, the capital city with 2 million residentsIt has gone "viral," and now the hope is that it doesn't go global, Gupta saysEbola, a simple virus with a small genome, is a swift and bloody killerConakry, Guinea (CNN) -- It took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here.

           We had just landed in Conakry, the capital of Guinea. In the fields right outside the airport, a young woman was in tears. She started to wail and shout in Susu, one of the 40 languages spoken in this tiny country of 12 million people. The gathered crowd became silent and listened intently.

           The young man sitting next to me quietly translated, although I already had my suspicions. He told me the woman's husband had died of Ebola, and then quickly ushered us away.

           It is probably not surprising the airplane bringing us into Conakry was nearly empty, as are all the hotels here. Not many people in the United States have ever visited Guinea, or could even identify where it sits in West Africa. It is already one of the world's poorest countries, and the panic around Ebola is only making that worse.

           Some of it is justified. That's because this time, the outbreak is different. In the past, Ebola rarely made it out of the remote forested areas of Africa.

           Key to that is a grim version of good news/bad news: because Ebola tends to incapacitate its victims and kill them quickly, they rarely have a chance to travel and spread the disease beyond their small villages. Now, however, Ebola is in Conakry, the capital city, with 2 million residents. Equally concerning: it's just a short distance from where we touched down, at an international airport.

           When I asked doctors on the ground about that scenario, they had split opinions. Several told me the concern is real but unlikely. Most patients with Ebola come from small villages in the forest and are unlikely to be flying on international trips, they told me. Furthermore, they don't think Ebola would spread widely in a western country; our medical expertise and our culture -- not touching the dead -- would prevent it.

           With an international airport close by, that means you could be on the other side of the world before you develop the headache, fever, fatigue and joint pain which make up the early symptoms of an Ebola infection. The diarrhea, rash and bleeding come later. Hiccups is a particularly grave sign with Ebola. It means your diaphragm, which allows you to breathe, is starting to get irritated.

           Ebola appears to kill in a clever way. Early on, it strategically disarms your immune system, allowing the virus to replicate unchecked until it invades organs all over your body. It convinces your blood to clot in overdrive, but only inside your blood vessels. While those blood vessels choke up, the rest of your body starts to ooze because the clotting mechanisms are all busy.

           You start to hemorrhage on the outside of your body. Nose bleeds, bruising, even a simple needle stick will refuse to clot. But, it is the bleeding you don't see -- the bleeding on the inside -- that causes even more catastrophic problems.

           To become infected, you generally need to spend extended time with someone who is gravely ill, and come into contact with his or her infected body fluids. That's why family members and health care workers are the most likely to get sick.

           With some infections, you can shed and spread the virus long before you get ill. That's not the case with Ebola. It's only after you are sick and feverish do you become contagious. However, it only takes a miniscule amount to infect and kill. A microscopic droplet of blood or saliva on your bare hand could enter through a break in your skin. And, whether you realize it or not, we all have breaks in our skin.

           Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated with outbreaks. I learned in medical school that new pathogens generally make a jump from animals to humans, a process called zoonosis.

           This is happening in areas where human and animals come into continuous contact. David Quammen refers to it as "Spillover," in his book of the same name. A stew of ducks, geese, chickens, pigs and humans in southeast Asia led to the spillover of avian flu, H5N1. Contact between pigs and humans in Mexico led to swine flu, H1N1; pigs and fruit bats were the recipe for Nipah fever in Malaysia.

         <ul class="outline">
          <li class="ou outline">
          </li>
          <li class="o outline">
           The best guess is that fruit bats may be a natural reservoir for the Ebola virus too, but this has not been confirmed. Quammen makes the point: Ebola didn't enter our world -- we entered its world.

          <li class="o outline">
           Pathogens can be predators, like lions, tigers and bears. A virus may not plan the way a big cat does, but in a sense it stalks its prey -- waiting for the moment of opportunity, then attacking with fury. Because it can lie silent for years, it's also easy to see Ebola as a killing ghost, like Jack the Ripper.

           Presumably outbreaks begin through some human-animal contact, but since that contact is ongoing we don't know what it is that leads Ebola to rear its ugly head. We don't know how to treat the illness or vaccinate against it. We certainly don't know how to cure it.

           It also made this mysterious, exotic virus the world knows, but doesn't fully understand, so much more real and frightening. For the next 21 days (the outer range of the incubation period) the woman we saw will be monitored for a fever or any early signs she may have contracted Ebola from her husband. If she exhibits symptoms, she will be isolated and treated with fluids, oxygen and nutrition.

           For her neighbors, in Guinea and across its border, another critical number is 42 -- as in 42 days, or two incubation periods. If the health care teams here don't see any new cases during that time then they officially say the outbreak is over. We are not there yet, not even close.

           It turns out that this brutally cold, miserably long, snowfest of a winter did more than wreak havoc on the bundled Mid-Atlantic masses. It also caused elms, cedars and other trees that typically flower early in the year to hold off for warmer weather.

           Now, with more springlike days finally in the forecast, those trees are poised to pollinate alongside oaks, cottonwoods and pines, as well as some grasses. The result could mean a perfect storm of pollen in coming days '-- and an especially miserable stretch for allergy sufferers.

           Every day on the roof of Kosisky's lab in Silver Spring, two small greased rods spin through the air, collecting pollen particles. She said that over the past 15 years, the average daily measurement for the first week in April has been about 353 grains per cubic meter of air. That figure can spike to more than 4,000 at the peak of the allergy season.

           That meant temporary good news for many allergy sufferers, Kosisky said. But it also suggested a tidal wave of pent-up pollen could be coming our way as the area heads toward the height of allergy season later this month. In fact, by Friday, the decent weather already had sent pollen counts climbing.

It can get into your lungs.''

           Experts say people with allergies can take measures to lessen their contact with pollen, including using central air conditioning rather than opening windows, wearing sunglasses when outdoors and washing their hands frequently. In addition, doctors say patients who know they have spring allergies can begin taking antihistamines before the worst of the season arrives.

           Scientists have documented that in many parts of the world, the allergy season starts earlier and lasts longer each year, potentially because of climate change. Researchers have theorized that the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the warmer the temperatures, the more plants produce flowers or food, which means more pollen.

           The spring ragweed allergy season has lengthened by up to 27 days since 1995 depending on where you are in North America, according to research by the Agriculture Department published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2011.

           Higher latitudes are warming faster than those closer to the equator and are seeing proportionally longer pollen seasons, according to that study. For instance, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the season was 27 days longer than the usual 44 days, while in Minneapolis, it was 16 days longer than the usual 62 days. By contrast, the effect in places such as Texas was minimal.

           He said that this year's long, frigid winter is especially intriguing to scientists because one of two extremes could happen: ''It could be everything happening all at one time. In that case, there will be records for pollen count set. Or the damage to plants could be severe enough that you may not get much of a pollen season at all.''

           Still, he said that in more than a decade of private practice, he has never seen an allergy season begin as late as this one. But like other local specialists, he said he expects that when pollen counts spike this spring, so will the number of patients seeking help.

           Faux "news" and "Judge" Jeanine Pirro are still flogging the fake Benghazi "scandal" for every drop they can get out of it. This Saturday, Pirro attacked former CIA director Michael Morell as a "political whore" and accused him of lying to Congress to protect Hillary Clinton.

           Tom "Suck On This" Friedman was in top form today on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS while discussing climate change. He's on the right side of the issue thankfully, but his ideas are way out there when it comes to solutions. He actually believes it would be a good idea for Putin to shut off the power on the Ukraine while they are living on the precipice of war which will suddenly kick start the world into being serious about renewable energy? Is he huffing airplane glue?

           Friedman: Fareed, I'm going to ask you something. Would you think I'm a bad guy if I were hoping that Vladimir Putin turned off the gas to Europe? Because that's my secret hope, because I believe if Putin turns off the oil and gas to Europe right now, it would be the equivalent of the 1973 Arab oil embargo, which is what launched the solar wind and efficiency industry.

           We only got the first auto mileage standards after that. I think we are poised to take off. I hope you bought solar stocks last year, because if you did, they're all exploding. And I don't have to tell you about Tesla stock. We just need a little push. We just need Vladimir to do the right thing and turn the gas off. I'm happy to pay all the energy bills for the Ukraine because the impact it would have on the whole clean tech industry, which is poised to take off now, would be just like 1973. You go, Vlad. Give it to us.

           Yes, Tom, you are a bad guy for suggesting that. How many people would be killed in the aftermath of Putin shutting off the gas in the Ukraine? And if war broke out, I doubt anyone would be talking about climate change in the world. And we all know that the only thing Republicans would be just talking about how weak President Obama is compared to that bastion of strength, King Vlad.
