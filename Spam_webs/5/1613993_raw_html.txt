         <strong>
          Oooooo a shiny New Year! What would I like to change???
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Fast Forward 1 month (on average): What New Years resolution? Why did I care about that?
        </p>
        <p>
         As it turns out, you are not alone if you struggle to change habits. Turns out we are creatures of comfort and stability, and our enthusiasm is short-lived formeaningfulchanges. Thats why solely relying on willpower will never get us where we want to go.
         <strong>
          Instead we have to be more strategic and intelligent about overcoming our natural resistance to change by using ALL the sources of influence that act upon us.
         </strong>

        <h3>
         The New Science of Personal Success
        </h3>
        <p>
         The amazing authors of Change Anything: The New Science of Personal Success have done the research to examine what it takes to change almost anything. Its an easy read that walks you through how you can help yourself and others overcome resistance to change.
        </p>

          <img alt="change" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1202" height="300" src="http://stephaniecirihal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/change-198x300.jpg" width="198"/>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, why is it that 95% of all diet attempts fail? Why do New Years Resolutions last no more than a few days?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Why cant people with good intentions seem to make consistent and positive strides in the way they want to improve their careers, financial fitness, physical fitness, and so on?
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, as it turns out we need more than willpower, as there are subtle yet powerful forces acting on us at all times. Specifically there are Six Sources of Influence that significantly impact our behaviors. Lets look at them.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Six Sources of Influence
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Six Sources of Influence are divided between motivational forces and capability forces (otherwise known as Will and Skill). They are further broken down into Personal, Social, and Structural forces:
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://stephaniecirihal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/influencer_6box.jpg">
          <img alt="influencer_6box" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1207" height="258" src="http://stephaniecirihal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/influencer_6box.jpg" width="340"/>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         In each of these categories lies a force that is either acting to help or hinder your quest for change. So whatever it is that you want to change, it would be wise to understand HOW these forces are acting upon you.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, have you ever been sabotaged on your diet by food thats in the pantry? Yep, thats a Structural Ability hindrance. Ever been sabotaged in trying to drink less by your friends? Yep, thats a social motivation/ability barrier. Every successful change we make, we make because somehow we have overcome these barriers, whether we were conscious of it or not. And being conscious of these forces HIGHLY increases the likelihood that youll be successful.
        </p>
        <h3>
         What This Means for Your New Years Resolution
        </h3>
        <p>
         Lets get more specific. Lets say you want to successfully do a cleanse diet for 21 days (Im just sayin.). How would you be impacted by these influences and how could you plan for them?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          There are questions you can ask yourself in each area to determine your likelihood of success and what you can do to increase it.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://stephaniecirihal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/0560260401001.png">
          <img alt="0560260401001" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1214" height="568" src="http://stephaniecirihal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/0560260401001.png" width="544"/>
         </a>
        </p>
        <p>
         Lets look at each separately, as they relate to embarking on a 21-day cleanse:
        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <span style="line-height: 13px;">
           <strong>
            Do I enjoy it?
           </strong>
           In this area you have to find reasons for why you are doing this cleanse. I suggest writing down 10 different reasons and carrying them with you at all times. In tempting situations, you can pull out your list and review it to remind yourself why you signed up for this in the first place. You could also review the recipes ahead of time to discover some that you are excited to try. Finally, you can visit your default future and write about what your life will be like if you do nothing and just maintain the status quo in your life. That can also be personally motivating.
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Am I personally able?
          </strong>
          This area speaks to your skills in effecting this change. When doing a cleanse, you need to ask yourself if you know how to use a blender. Know what needs to beeliminatedfrom your diet and how to do that? Know how to read labels to ensure the ingredients are on the cleanse?
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Do others motivate?
          </strong>
          What is your support like? Are the people in your life behind you in your change? Or are they accomplices in you staying the same? You will have to redefine a new normal with people  have you advised them of it? In a cleanse, this is REALLY important! You may need to be less social than usual to avoid temptation, or maybe you can corral some friends and do the cleanse as a group. Or hire a coach (Im just sayin.)
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Do others enable?
          </strong>
          The key to the social influence is turning your accomplices into your friends of change. That means having a conversation with them, and perhaps even distancing yourself from those that are unwilling to support you. In a cleanse, are others willing to eat what you cook for yourself? Are they willing to not eat tempting things in front of you for 21 days? When I did my cleanse, I roped my husband into doing it with me so that we could enable each other.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Do things motivate?
          </strong>
          Consider your incentives. Can you set up some rewards for yourself along the way? Its better to reward small wins than wait until the end. For instance, if you are going to do a cleanse, can you reward yourself with a massage after the first week? Is there something that would motivate you to stick to the cleanse? For me, I promised myself a Brazilian bikini as my reward for my cleanse and to enjoy my less-puffy body.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Do things enable?
          </strong>
          This is where your pantry comes into play. If you are doing a cleanse, what are you going to do with all the chocolate? Dont trust yourself to have the willpower to stay away from it, because research shows you probably wont. How can you build fences around temptation and better control your space? What systems will make it automatic for you to comply? For me, I always make 2 servings of smoothies so that I dont have to answer the question of what to have for breakfast the following day. Its automatic.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         Whatever your New Years resolution is, it makes sense to put this kind of thought into how you are going to achieve it. And as you can see, its not difficult but its not simple either. Having a long list of resolutions probably doesnt help you because figuring out the influences for one change is probably enough. So, for less shiny, but more realistic resolutions, try looking at what and who is influencing you.
