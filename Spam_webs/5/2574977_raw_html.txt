       Time and Impermanence in Middle Way Buddhism and Modern Physics
       <br/>
       by Vic Mansfield
      </a>
     </b>
     <br/>
     <blockquote>
      Vic Mansfield, author of
      <i>
       Tibetan Buddhism and Modern Physics: Toward a Union of Love and Knowledge
      </i>
      was a professor of physics and astronomy at Colgate University from 1973 until his death in 2008. In this article, Vic explores how Buddhist philosophy and modern physics can mutually illuminate each other, focusing in particular on the interrelated concepts of time, impermanence, emptiness, and interdependence. With down-to-earth examples, Vic shows how understanding of these can open our experience up to greater compassion and sense of connection with the entire cosmos across all time and space.

       Quantum Physics Encounters Consciousness:
       <br/>
       An Interview with Bruce Rosenblum
      </a>
     </b>
     <br/>
     <blockquote>
      In this fascinating and dynamic discussion of the mysteries of quantum physics, Holos editor Tom McFarlane interviews Bruce Rosenblum, Professor Emeritus of Physics and former Chair of the of Physics Department at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Rosenblum is a coauthor of
      <i>
       Quantum Enigma: Physics Encounters Consciousness
      </i>
      , which is based on a popular university course that he has taught for many years. Using simple experimental demonstrations that can be directly understood without any knowledge of math or physics, Rosenblum explains the two quantum enigmas: the dependence of reality on observation and the instantaneous connection between remote events. Through both of these quantum enigmas, Rosenblum argues, physics encounters the mystery of consciousness.

       Revitalizing the Heart of Islam:

       An Interview with Joseph Lumbard
      </a>
     </b>
     <br/>
     <blockquote>
      In this interview, Professor Joseph Lumbard of Brandeis University discusses the importance of revitalizing the heart of Islam by reconnecting with its traditional roots in the classical scholarship of Islam. He also shares his perspective on the historical factors related to the modern turn away from tradition, and ways that the recovery of the essence of Islam can be fostered. The interview touches upon other topics, such as the nature of Gnosis in the philosophy of Ibn al-Arabi, and the relationship between this type of knowledge and scientific knowledge.

       The Play of Distinction
       <br/>
       by Thomas McFarlane
      </a>
     </b>
     <br/>
     <blockquote>
      This unique article demonstrates how the primordial act of distinction provides a foundation for a universal language that unites all mystical traditions and links them to the mathematical language of science. The introduction by Joel Morwood discusses the relevance of this to the creation of a new sacred worldview in which science and mysticism can be seen as compatible ways of describing the same underlying Reality.

       Lack and Liberation in Self and Society:
       <br/>
       An Interview with David Loy
      </a>
     </b>
     <br/>
     <blockquote>
      Holos editor Tom McFarlane interviews philosopher, writer, and Zen practitioner David Loy on a broad range of topics, including a detailed discussion of Professor Loy's innovative notion of
      <em>
       lack
      </em>
      and how it relates to our selves and society. Our sense of lack, Loy explains, arises as a kind of "shadow" of our sense of self. The flip side of our attachment to self is our aversion to our ungroundedness or emptiness of self. And this manifests as a sense of lack which we often find manifested both individually and culturally as futile projects to try and make ourselves real in the world. The implications of this on the personal and collective levels are profound and shed light not only on our history, but on current events in our world today.
