   This study calculates how much additional money middle-

vices--a new car, a computer, or a year's college tuition for
their children--after all taxes are fully taken into account.
For instance, a wage earner in an average-tax state must earn
$17,038 to purchase a $10,000 car. That means that the work
er pays $7,038 in income, payroll, and sales taxes on a
$10,000 car. The study finds that in some high-tax states,
such as California and New York, the "true" price to consum
ers of goods and services is twice the retail price because
of taxes. Self-employed workers, who must pay a self-employment tax, routinely must also earn double the retail price of
an item to have the after-tax income to buy it. That is the
"rule of two on taxes."

   <strong>
    Introduction
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Most Americans complain that taxes are taking a larger
        bite out of their incomes than ever before. During the
        month
        of April, tax-filing time, they complain most bitterly.
        But
        do workers really know how much they pay in combined
        federal,
        state, and local taxes each year?
  </p>
  <p>
   In 1960 middle-income Americans paid less than 30 percent of their earnings in local, state, and federal
        taxes;
        today that figure is up to 40 percent.[1] Furthermore,
        many
        middle- and upper-income families living in the states
        that
        have the highest taxes, such as New York and California,
        pay
        nearly half their incomes in taxes. High taxes reflect
        the
        growth of government, at all levels, in the United States
        since World War II.[2]
  </p>
  <p>
   This study presents a new and easily understood method
        of measuring the impact of taxes on the finances of
        American
        workers. We calculate how much additional income middle-
        income workers must earn to purchase various goods and
        ser-
        vices--a new car, a computer, a year's college tuition
        for
        their children, or a year's supply of gasoline--after all
        taxes are fully taken into account.
  </p>
  <p>
   That is a good measure of the impact of taxes on American workers because the main reason people work is to
        earn
        money to buy the things they want. But much of American
        workers' income is consumed by taxes. The question is,
        how
        much? Our standard example is the purchase of a new car
        with
        a sticker price of $10,000.[3] Because of taxes, the
        average
        worker needs to earn significantly more than $10,000
        extra
        income to pay for that car.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In an average-tax state a middle-income worker with
        earnings of $34,000 must earn an additional $17,038 to
        purchase a $10,000 car. That means the worker must earn
        $1O,000 to pay for the car and $7,038 to pay the sales
        tax on the car and the income and payroll taxes on the
        earnings used to pay for the car.
  </p>
  <p>
   * A worker with an income of $34,000 must work three and
        a half months of the year to pay for the car, and then
        two and a half additional months to pay the taxes on the
        income used to purchase the car.
  </p>
  <p>
   * For a self-employed middle-income worker, the true
        cost of the $10,000 car is $18,320, because self-
        employed workers pay a 14.1 percent self-employment tax,
        to cover the employee and the employer shares of Social
        Security and Medicare (FICA) payroll taxes, on their incomes.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In a high-tax state, such as California, the pre-tax
        cost of the car is $18,776 for a wage earner and $20,186
        for a self-employed worker. In a low-tax state, such as
        New Hampshire, the car costs a middle-income wage earner
        $15,540 in pre-tax income and a self-employed worker
        $16,708.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In the five states with the highest taxes, wage-
        earners have to make roughly $2,000 more to purchase a
        $10,000 car than they do in the five states with the
        lowest taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Taxes also affect the true price of a variety of other
        products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In an average-tax state the amount of earnings needed
        to pay for a $1,500 computer is $2,568. A self-employed
        worker needs $2,748.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In an average-tax state the amount of earnings needed
        to pay for a year's tuition at a private college
        ($8,000) is $13,107, and a self-employed worker needs
        $14,092.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In an average-tax state the typical driver spends $479
        a year on gasoline, excluding all taxes. But the income
        needed to purchase that gasoline, after accounting for
        all taxes including the federal and state gasoline
        taxes, is $1,065. Self-employed workers must earn
        $1,145 to purchase the gasoline.
  </p>
  <p>
   As those examples demonstrate, taxes take a much larger
        chunk out of Americans' incomes than is generally
        realized--
        which leads us to our rules of thumb on taxes:
  </p>
  <p>
   * In high-tax states the true price of goods and services is roughly twice the retail price at the store.
        To figure how much income you need to purchase an item,
        multiply its price by two.
  </p>
  <p>
   * The rule of two applies to self-employed workers in
        most states. Half of their earnings are consumed by
        taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   * In low-tax states the true price of goods and services, including all taxes, is one and a half times the
        stated price. To figure how much of your income goes to
        purchase an item, multiply its price tag by 1.5.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Calculating Your Tax Burden
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The purpose of this study is to provide practical and
        understandable examples of how much middle-income workers
        actually pay in taxes when purchasing goods and services.
        We
        address the question by showing how much extra income a
        person must earn to pay for major purchases. In all of our
        examples we examine the taxes paid by a married couple
        with
        an income between $34,000 and $53,400.
  </p>
  <p>
   This study takes into account four types of taxes that
        raise the "true" price of a product. We ignore
        the impact of
        business taxes, which are ultimately borne by workers and
        the
        owners of capital. For wage earners we also ignore the
        employer portion of FICA payroll taxes. Four taxes are
        examined.
  </p>
  <p>
   * The income tax paid on the worker's earnings. We
        assume that the worker in our examples has an income between $34,000 and $53,400 per year. That means that
        workers are paying a 28 percent marginal federal tax
        rate on all additional earnings.
  </p>
  <p>
   * The payroll tax. For most workers (with earnings up
        to $53,400) this constitutes a 7.65 percent tax on earnings on top of the income tax. Self-employed workers
        must pay a self-employment tax that raises their effective payroll tax rate to 14.1 percent.[4]
  </p>
  <p>
   * The state income tax. Rates vary widely from state to
        state. They range from a low of zero in 10 states to a
        high of 12 percent in North Dakota.
  </p>
  <p>
   * The state and local sales tax. Those taxes also vary
        from state to state and even among localities within
        states. The highest combined state and local sales tax
        rate is 10 percent in Louisiana, but many states have no
        sales tax.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Taxes on a Car in a Typical State
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Taxes on Wage Earners
  </p>
  <p>
   In our first example we examine the amount of extra
        money a middle-income worker needs to earn to purchase a
        car
        in a state where taxes are typical, Michigan. (A detailed
        summary of the tax calculations is given in the
        Appendix.)
        Michigan taxpayers pay a 4.6 percent income tax on
        taxable
        income. (For simplicity we ignore the personal exemption;
        the standard deduction; and itemized deductions, except
        the
        state income tax deduction, in all analyses.) Michigan
        also
        imposes a 4 percent nondeductible sales tax on the retail
        purchase of most products.
  </p>
  <p>
   When all income, payroll, and sales taxes are taken into
        account, how much money does the typical middle-income
        Michigan wage earner have to make to purchase a $10,000
        automobile?
  </p>
  <p>
   First, to determine the required earnings, the consumer
        adds the 4 percent sales tax to the price of the
        automobile.
        In Michigan that adds $400 to the retail cost, so the
        automobile now costs $10,400.
  </p>
  <p>
   But to earn $10,400 in take-home pay, the worker will
        have to make an additional $17,038 because the government
        will take $7,038 from the worker's paycheck in (1) state
        income tax, (2) payroll taxes, and (3) federal income
        taxes.
        The breakdown of those taxes is given in Table 1 and
        shown in
        Figure 1. (The formula for deriving the numbers is given
        in
        the Appendix.)

    Taxes on the Self-Employed
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   All self-employed workers are keenly aware that they
        have additional taxes taken directly out of their incomes
        because they pay a self-employment tax, which is equal to
        the
        employer and the employee shares of FICA payroll taxes.
        The
        self-employment tax rate was 14.1 percent on 1991
        earnings of
        up to $53,400,[5] which means, of course, that
        self-employed
        workers must earn an even greater amount of extra income
        to
  </p>
  <p>

        required
        to purchase the car rise to $18,320 (see Table 2).
  </p>
  <p>
   In our example a self-employed worker must earn $1,282
        more in pre-tax income than a non-self-employed worker
        must
        to pay for the car. That is because of the hefty self-
        employment tax.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Taxes in High- and Low-Tax States
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The above example shows the tax liability in a typical
        state. But the states vary widely in the level and
        mixture
        of taxes they impose on their residents. The state with
        the
        highest sales and income taxes, California, charges an
        8.25
        percent sales tax on most items and imposes a 9.3 percent
        marginal income tax rate on middle-income workers,
        whereas
        Alaska and New Hampshire have neither a state income nor
        a
        sales tax. Table 3 compares the amount of income a worker
        must earn to purchase a $10,000 car in eight
        jurisdictions
        with the highest taxes and the eight with the lowest
        taxes.[6]
        It also shows the amount of taxes self-employed workers
        pay
        in those jurisdictions.
  </p>
  <p>
   In California, a middle-income worker must earn an
        additional $18,776 to be able to purchase a $10,000 car.
        A
        self-employed worker in California must earn $20,186 to
        purchase the car. That worker must earn more than double the
        sticker price of the car if all taxes are taken into
        account.
        In other words, in the high-tax states, self-employed
        workers
        spend more of their income to pay the taxes on the car
        than
        on the car itself.

   Our examples demonstrate that workers in high-tax
        states
        must earn significantly more extra income to purchase
        goods
        and services than those in low-tax states (see Figure 2).
        For example, a California worker must earn $3,000 more
        income
        to purchase a $10,000 car than a worker living in New
        Hampshire or Alaska.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is evidence that people try to avoid working and
        purchasing goods and services in high-tax states. For in-
        stance, to avoid high income taxes, businesses and
        workers
        tend to move from high-tax to low-tax states.[7] That was
        clearly the case in the 1980s, for example, when
        low-income-
        tax states saw business and population growth, while
        high-
        income-tax states experienced little or no business and
        population growth. Moreover, to avoid high sales taxes, many
        consumers shop for major items in low-sales-tax states.

   The retail price of a new IBM personal computer is
        roughly
        $1,500. The income needed to purchase that computer after
        taking into account all taxes is $2,556 for a wage earner
        and
        $2,748 for a self-employed worker. A summary of the taxes

    A Year's Tuition at a Private College

  </p>
  <p>
   Many parents spend years sacrificing and saving money to
        pay for their children's college tuition. Those parents
        are
        paying much more than they may suspect. Although there is
        no
        sales tax on college tuition, the parents must pay income
        and
        payroll taxes on the money they use to send their child
        to
        college. To pay the $8,000 tuition, the parents must earn
        $13,107 if they are wage earners and $14,092 if they are
        self-employed (see Table 5).

    A Year's Supply of Gasoline
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   A typical car owner uses 504 gallons of gasoline a year,
        according to the Federal Highway Administration.[9] The
        pre-
        tax price of that gasoline (premium unleaded) is $479.
        Yet
        gasoline is different from most other products in that it
        is
        subject to special federal and state excise taxes in
        addition
        to normal sales taxes. The $1.29 per gallon pump price
        includes those taxes. In a typical state the combined state
        and federal gasoline tax is roughly 34 cents a gallon.
        The
        income needed to purchase the year's supply of gasoline,
        after all taxes including the federal and state gasoline
        taxes
        are accounted for, is $1,065. Self-employed workers must
        earn $1,145 to purchase the gasoline (see Table 6).

    The Rule of Two on Taxes
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Table 7 summarizes the amount of extra earnings necessary to purchase each of the four items examined in this
        study. The table shows the amount of taxes paid in an
        average-tax and a high-tax state. As the table
        demonstrates,
        for certain products, taxes can add up to more than the
        retail price of the purchased item.
  </p>
  <p>
   That suggests that there are several easy-to-remember
        rules of thumb for determining how taxes affect your
        financial condition and your consumer behavior.

  <p>
   In high-tax states the true price of goods and services
        is about twice the retail price. To calculate how much
        income you need to earn to purchase an item, multiply its
        price
        tag by two. That is the rule of two on taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   The rule of two on taxes also applies to most self-
        employed workers. To pay all taxes, those in business for
        themselves must earn twice the retail price of goods and
        services. Half of the income self-employed workers earn pays
        for the goods and services they purchase, and half goes
        to
        pay all federal, state, and local taxes. That means their
        marginal tax rate is more than 50 percent.
  </p>
  <p>
   In low-tax states the true price of goods and services,
        including all taxes, is closer to one and a half times
        the
        stated price. To figure how much additional income you
        need
        to earn to purchase an item, multiply its price tag by
        1.5.

   <strong>
    Conclusion
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   There is an old saying that describes the feelings of
        workers in difficult economic times: my take-home pay
        won't
        take me home. One reason for the squeeze on workers is
        the
        rising tax burden at all levels of government. Since 1990
        the federal government has enacted a five-year $200
        billion
        tax increase and the states have added $40 billion in new
        taxes to the total. After a brief respite in the early
        1980s, taxes are climbing again. By one calculation
        Americans work from January to the end of the first week in
        May
        just to pay their tab to the government.
  </p>
  <p>
   For most Americans, tallying all the various taxes that
        they pay to all levels of government is a hopeless task.
        Americans pay excise taxes, sales taxes, income taxes,
        and
        payroll taxes.
  </p>
  <p>
   This study develops a direct and easily understood
        method of determining the impact of taxes on
        middle-income
        Americans' finances: calculate the amount of extra income
        workers must earn to pay for the goods and services they
        desire. In many states workers have to earn twice the
        retail
        price of most goods and services before they have the
        after-
        tax income to purchase them. In those states
        middle-income
        workers are devoting over half their income, not to the
        goods
        and services they want, but to the government tax
        collector.

   The terms used in calculating the income a middle-income wage earner needs to purchase a new car in Michigan
        are
        as follows.
  </p>
  <p>
   State and Local Sales Tax
        = Retail Sales Price x State and Local Sales Tax
        Rate.
        State Income Tax
        = State Income Tax Rate x Taxable Income.
        FICA Tax
        = 7.65% x Taxable Income up to $53,400.
        Federal Income Tax
        = 28% of taxable income after deduction
        of state income tax.
  </p>
  <p>
   The formula for the purchase of a $10,000 car in Michi-
        gan is:
  </p>
  <p>
   State and Local Sales Tax
        = $10,000 x 4%
        = $400 +
        State Income Tax
        = Required Earnings x 4.6% +
        FICA Tax
        = Required Earnings x 7.65% +
        Federal Income Tax
        = 28% x (Required Earnings - State Income Tax).
  </p>
  <p>
   Required Earnings
        = (Retail Sales Price + State and Local Sales Tax)/
        [1 - Federal Income Tax Rate x (1 - State Income
        Tax Rate) - State Income Tax Rate - FICA Tax
        Rate]
        = $10,000 + $400/[1 - 28% x (1 - 4.6%) - 4.6% -
        7.65%]
        = $10,400/(1 - 0.28 x 0.954 - 0.046 - 0.0765)
        = $10,400/(1 - 0.267 - 0.046 - 0.0765)
        = $10,400/0.6105 = $17,038.
  </p>
  <p>
   To buy a $10,000 car a wage earner needs $17,038. The
        summary of each tax is as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   State and Local Sales Tax
        = $10,000 x 4% = $400.
        State Income Tax
        = Required Earnings x 4.6% = $17,038 x 0.046
        = $784.
        FICA Tax
        = Required Earnings x 7.765% = $17,038 x 0.0765
        = $1,303.
        Federal Income Tax
        = (Required Earnings - State Income Tax) x 28%
        = ($17,038 - $784) x 28% = $4,551.
        Total Taxes
        = State and Local Sales Tax + State Income Tax +
        Federal Income Tax + FICA Tax = $400 + $784 +
        $1,303 + $4551 = $7,038.
        Total Required Income
        = Retail Price + Taxes = $10,000 + $7,038
        = $17,038.
  </p>
  <p>
   The terms used in calculating the income a self-employed
        worker needs to purchase the car are as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   State and Local Sales Tax
        = Retail Sales Price x State and Local Sales Tax
        Rate.
        State Income Tax
        = State Income Tax Rate x (Taxable Income after
        deduction of half of Self-Employment Tax).
        = State Income Tax Rate x (Taxable Income -
        one-half x Self-Employment Tax).
        Self-Employment Tax
        = 14.13 percent x Taxable Income.
        Federal Income Tax
        = 28 percent of taxable income after deduction of
        State Income Tax and half of Self-Employment
        Tax
        = 28% x (Taxable Income - State Income Tax - 0.5
        Self-Employment Tax).

   The formula for the purchase of a $10,000 car in Michigan is:
  </p>
  <p>
   State and Local Sales Tax
        = $10,000 x 4%
        = $400 +
        State Income Tax
        = Required Earnings x 4.6% (1 - 14.13% x 0.5)
        = Required Earnings x 4.6% x (0.92935)
        = Required Earnings x 4.275% +
        Self-Employment Tax
        = Required Earnings x Self-Employment Tax Rate
        = Required Earnings x 15.3 x (1 - 15.3 x 0.5)
        = Required Earnings x 14.13% +
        Federal Income Tax
        = (Required Earnings - State Income Tax - 0.5
        Self-Employment Tax) x 28%
        = Required Earnings x 28% x (1 - 4.6% x 0.92935 -
        14.13% x 0.5)
        = Required Earnings x 28% x [(1 - 0.046 x 0.92935)
        - 0.07065]
        = Required Earnings x 28% x (1 - 0.04275 - 0.07065)
        = Required Earnings x 28% x 0.8866
        = Required Earnings x 0.24825.
  </p>
  <p>
   Required Earnings
        = Retail Sales Price + State and Local Sales Tax/
        [1 - Federal Income Tax Rate x (1 - State Income
        Tax Rate x 0.92935 - 0.07065) - State Income Tax
        Rate x 0.92935 - Self-Employment Tax Rate]
        = $10,000 + $400/[1 - 28% x (1 - 4.6%) x 0.92935 -
        4.6% x 0.92935 - 14.13%]
        = $10,400/(1 - 0.28 x 0.954 x 0.92935 - 0.046 x
        0.92935 - 0.1413)
        = $10,400/(1 - 0.24825 - 0.04275 - 0.1413)
        = $10,400/0.5677
        = $18,320.
  </p>

   To buy a $10,000 car the self-employed worker must earn
        $18,320. The summary of each tax is as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
   State and Local Sales Tax
        = $10,000 x 4% = $400.
        State Income Tax
        = Required Earnings x 4.6% x 0.92935
        = $18,320 x 0.04275
        = $783.
        Self-Employment Tax
        = Required Earnings x 14.13% = $18,320 x 14.13%
        = $2,589.
        Federal Income Tax
        = (Required Earnings - State Income Tax - 0.5
        Self-Employment Tax) x 28%
        = ($18,320 - $783 - $2,589 x 0.5) x 28%
        = $4,548.
  </p>
  <p>
   Total Taxes
        = State and Local Sales Tax + State Income Tax +
        Federal Income Tax + Self-Employment Tax
        = $400 + $783 + $2,589 + $4,548 = $8,320.
  </p>
  <p>
   Total Required Income
        = Retail Price + Taxes = $10,000 + $8,320
        = $18,320.

   3. Total taxes paid on income used to purchase the car
        are
        roughly the same, regardless of how the car is paid for
        (cash or
        loan).

   4. The effective self-employment tax rate is 15.3% x
        92.35% on
        earnings up to $53,400.
  </p>
  <p>
   5. The 14.13 percent FICA rate is calculated as follows.
        The
        workers pays a rate of 15.3% for the employer and the
        employee
        shares of the FICA tax. But the 7.65% employee share of
        the tax
        is deducted from earnings, so that the effective rate is
        15.3% x
        (1 - 7.65%) = 14.1%. In addition, the employer share of
        the FICA
        payroll tax is deductible from the federal income tax, so
        that
        the effective rate is not 28% but 28% x {[1 - 7.65% x
        (1 - 7.65%)]} = 26%.
  </p>
  <p>
   6. Only state income and sales taxes are used in rating
        state tax
        burdens. Other state taxes, such as those on corporate
        income
        and property, are not included.
