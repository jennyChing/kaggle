       I dont think I really need to say anything else here.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Apparently, I do. Because some people dont Get It.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sorry if
       <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2009/03/calvin-and-susie-get-it-on-displeasing-stuffed-tigers-everywhere/">
        you dont understand
       </a>
       it, and actually feel sorry for you because you lack the capacity to look beyond yourself and the things YOU cherish, and embrace the universe that is. Im sorry you cant stomach that *gasp* Calvin could mature  though, really, its Calvin he was already pretty damned mature for a six-year-old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is static in this life. Sacred cows make the best hamburgers. All things grow, and change, and we adults are supposed to pass on the important lessons weve learned to our progeny, in order to help them do even better than we did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didnt create this image but I wish I had. Because it depicts, in metaphor, something that Ive done literally with my own daughter. I gave her my own stuffed tiger and watched as it came to life for her, just as it had for me. I hope, in due course, she will pass the torch to her kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I taught her to read using Calvin and Hobbes. Shes learned to think critically and creatively because of C&amp;H. Weve made the Snowmen of Horrors (though, were in Florida, so theyre really Sandmen of Horrors). Great epic battles have taken place with dinosaurs flying fighter jets, and Spaceman Spiff has met his match in a blonde-and-blue pixie who takes great delight in teasing him for his taste in spacesuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the pages of the many books of collected strips, Ive shown her important life lessons  including the one that most people miss: Of all the assets you have in this life, your imagination is the only thing without limits. Well some peoples imaginations, at any rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, my favorite lesson is one she pointed out to me: If someone DOES try to limit you, they do so at their own peril, for a tigers vengeance is legendary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So dont limit those of us who want to give our children the best of what weve had ourselves. Theres plenty of us who DO like the image and what it represents. If you dont like the image, move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theres a great big Internet out there.

       I understand the sentiment behind this and all, but ultimately for me, if Watterson didnt draw it, it should be considered sacrilege. If youve got something you want to say about growing up as an artist, create it yourself. Dont co-opt the characters you used to love whose creator has pretty much made it clear that he doesnt want other people co-opting. Thats pretty childish.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the by, Im not trying to rag on the owner of this site for just reposting this. I just call into question the intent of the anonymous artist who spent time working this up.

       Um its a comic. Sacrilege? Really?

       No, its art. And, really, all art is the co-opting of images and ideas.

       I daresay Watterson would not. As I recall, he gave up C&amp;H because he was being pressured to merchandise more, and he didnt want to, and he was getting ripped off every other minute. So its just one more rip-off of someone who was truly original and truly creative and put in the time and the work to make something that we all enjoyed. And then we (speaking metaphorically) just made free with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if its art, and not just a comic, all the more reason that it shouldnt be co-opted.  Even if art is the co-opting of images and ideas, the expression of those images and ideas has to be ORIGINAL or its NOT ART. So, sorry, no, it isnt all right to co-opt, that is, steal.

       Ah but it is art.
       <br/>
       Its made people think. And express those thoughts. And have dialogue.
       <br/>
       Its reached beyond mere thought into the emotions.

       Im afraid thats a false argument. True that art is capable of pissing people off. But only if its the message that is a disquieting one. I dont disagree with the art. I disagree with the stealing of intellectual property. Not the same thing at all. This same drawing could have been done without referencing C&amp;H and still been successful, but the person drawing it would have had to do the work to communicate the idea without falling back on the shorthand of someone elses creation.

       I can see your point, techrat, but ultimately even if we consider the above art, making someone think or react isnt necessarily the same thing as being good art. The original Calvin &amp; Hobbes strip interacted with its audience on multiple levels, asked big questions, entertained in terms of humor and occasionally drama and generally have a very unique and original point of view. Id argue that the above has none of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more to my original point, if were assuming the artist of the above image loves and respects the original work (which I think everyone can agree that this person is a fan of Calvin &amp; Hobbes) then their choice to use Wattersons characters despite his expressed desire to not have anyone use them is a very selfish and ethically bankrupt act as far as the creation of art goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone wanted to use Calvin &amp; Hobbes to satirize Wattersons own staunch refusal to merchandise his characters or some other direct confrontational idea, Id be more open to granting them their right to do so (I wouldnt agree with their point, but I could accept that they do have a right as artists). The above is a simplistic statement that cobbles together two different popular works (a classic strip and a highly stylized marketing campaign) with what I  would say is a bare minimum of craft or uniqueness. Ultimately, its hollow and unoriginal, which in light of the achievements of the original work, I find to be pretty worthless and a little offensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, POSTER = FAIL.

      <p>
       Leslie  Actually, its a true and valid argument. It doesnt fail any test of logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The message doesnt need to be a disquieting one in order to piss people off. How many pieces of art have been vandalized or destroyed not because of their message, but just because of their form? The Venus de Milo, broken asunder by the Catholic Church? The Buddha statues in Afghanistan that were blown up by the Taliban?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just about all art and literature references other art and literature, going back to the Bible and beforehand. (Hell, visual art is itself a shorthand representation of things that have actually been seen or imagined, so reality is the ultimate reference that gets stolen from all the time.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Words and ideas have cumulative meaning to each of us because of all the things weve experienced that add their individual contributions to those meanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly since youre bringing in the pissing match of intellectual property (which is its own can of worms): much to the surprise of every hypersensitive artist out there, derivative works CAN be made, legally and ethically, if there is no attempt to profit from them and if there is no attempt to represent them as the original work. This piece does neither. So, legally, youve not a leg to stand on. See also: parody.

       Kiel  I respect your opinion, and the way in which youve presented it. We will simply need to agree to disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rather like the message created by the original artist, as Ive said repeatedly in the OP and comments both.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding of Wattersons refusal to merchandise was that he didnt want to reduce the characters to mere monetary objects. That he wanted the ideals represented to remain just that  ideals, inspirational ones at that. I rather think the artist (still unknown to me, by the way) respected that aspect  nothing is being commercialized, or reduced to the lowest common denominator. The child-like sense of wonder that we tend to lose as adults is shown being passed to the next generation something that doesnt happen much in the real world, as most parents try to get their kids to grow up too fast and never explore those sides of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate message here is one of positivism and hope. Thats very much in keeping with Wattersons original.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Save the hate for the assclown who made the Calvin on Ritalin strip. THAT was vile.)

       It appears that the issue of intellectual property is the only issue that was being brought up, techrat, not that of the art. And, yes, it is its own can of worms, precisely the can of worms in question. You seem to be missing the point, or at least deliberately twisting the discussion in order to bring up a lot of pretentious twaddle about art, which has nothing at all to do with the argument.

       ha. well, i found this page, golly, i dont quite remember how, but here i am. when i first saw the picture and read your lil thing about it, honestly, it brought tears to my eyes. (im a girl about shit like that)
       <br/>
       and then i read all the comments, and laughed, and had to join in.
       <br/>
       first of all, none of us can say if Watterson would have liked it or not. but, id really have to agree with the argument that he would have because of the warm feelings it conveyed and blah blah blah, its not like making shit toys about it, ya know?
       <br/>
       anyhow, i just have to say i love calvin &amp; hobbes, and this picture touched my heart.

       Watterson was against his characters being commercialized and pushed into a static one-dimensional state of existence.  He didnt want his characters to be seen as talking heads who barked out whatever a company was paying them for.  He wanted his comic to be art, not merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The art posted above is not trying to turn a profit.  Its not hollowing the characters out, leaving them flat and lifeless.  Its making a statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its funny, one of the things Watterson hated was the idea of a stuffed Hobbes doll.  He argued that it would create a false answer to the question: Is Hobbes real or a stuffed tiger.  The answer, of course, is that Hobbes is Calvins best friend, and to the parents hes a stuffed tiger, and neither perception of reality is more important or more official than the other one.  The above tribute plays with that beautifully, yet people are arguing that its ripping Watterson off.  Crazy.

       These comments are taking this poster way to serious! Its supposed to be a fun, inspirational image to remind us of our childhood. The sad thing is, you people that rag on this poster are probably the exact ones this poster was made for. Also I would hope that watterson would not mind someone using C&amp;H to promote such an innocent idea.

      <p>
       As a father of three who grew up on comics, toys that still litter the house, and all the trappings of youth, I absolutely love everything about that image, and since it in no way seems to have been made to profit from the characters in a fiduciary sense nor treats them in a manner disrespectful, I really do think Watterson himself would have had a smile on his face looking at that.  Its just a simple little nod to so much, an homage really.

       Sorry I got this one late, but I wanted to chime in a bit. I recently read the Calvin and Hobbes 10th anniversary edition and read what Bill W. thought about his comic.  Its hard to know, honestly, what he would have thought, but I certainly think he would like the idea because he believed that Calvin and Hobbes was more than just a Sunday strip.  It was something from his heart and the idea that we will pass something that was dear to us on to our children would make him smile.  Quite the opposite of the decals on the back of trucks with Calvin peeing on things.

       I personally have tried to do the same things with my kidsfrom Calvin to TMBG.  If she likes them great, if not, I let her make up her own mind.

       For all the cynics out there like Kiel and Leslie, something about Forest and Trees comes to mind here.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, I got the point right off. Im an artist myself and I hate ripoffs as much as anyone, but if I was Watterson, Id appreciate this homage and the sentiment simply for what it is.

       I think its stinkin AWESOME and, as was stated before, I think Watterson would, too.

       When talking about art, the number of words you use is inversally proportioned to your chances to figure out something about it. Im talking to you, Kiel.

       Im just wondering why everyone is referring to Bill Watterson in the past-tenseto my knowledge, hes still alive and well.  I love this, by the way, and unless Mr. Watterson comes onto this site to complain, I really dont think its necessary for the self-appointed Copyright Police to be ranting on so.

       Okay, I get it, dont stifle the imaginations of your children, but who does that anyway?  I didnt need to endorse someone elses fantasies to bring up my girls with active imaginations, we had our own.  Now one is a gifted teacher and the other is a cutting-edge graphic designerand we never once read a Calvin and Hobbs comic.  Those that can will, those that cant will read the comics.

       Blah blah blah blah!!! WHY must people take things so fucking seriously! Its a comic strip which we all love and reflects our own thoughts! Nothing is original anyways, so take what you love from the world around you and make something of it!

       There is a huge difference than fanart and merchandising.  Merchandising is stripping art of its creative value for its money value.  Fanart is a very pure form of art about reflecting on something you love or just making it porn.

       I think Bill would like this a lot,and I just love Hobbes looking back at Calvin.

       why the attitude? you get a thumbs down. your blog is a cartoon you found somewhere. If people dont get your intention maybe that is because you had no original content? No comment?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when you do comment its to tell a stock story about your little girl. Whatever, dude. I will go elsewhere, right after clicking the thumbs down button.

       The arguments/debates that have taken place here, dont and cant come close to the truths held by the subject of art.
       <br/>
       For the most part, these ideas and views here are snippets, equivalent to sound-bytes; theyre views and opinions drowned in contradiction.
       <br/>
       There are very real and serious issues when dealing with definitions of art and many people talk and think too loosely when dealing with or conversing these matters. Art is in a very fragile and perilous state due to the many scattered, free-believed, and unfocused that travel along biases and catchy phrases or trends. The problem here is that whether or not one is an expert on the matter they spout falsehoods, allowing the spread of and aiding the demise of arts truths.

       Its completely fine to remix old things into new things, and legal under fair use. Its an avenue that is not void of creativity, meaning, or artistic value.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTHING IS sacrilege. NOTHING. If you believe anything is be prepaid for the world to show you otherwise. Everything you are sensitive about will be needled, poked, and prodded. Your soft spots will be romanced only to be ripped out. Sacrilege? Bahahahaha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watterson would not approve of the use of his characters. He quit while calvin was still hot, saving us all from the misery of calvin devovling into crap. He kept merchandise to a minimum as to not dilute calvins impact thru over satiation. Hes been quoted as hating those calvin pissing on ford mud flaps, and has pointed out people love to pirate particular images. But know what? Tough shit. He created calvin but he belongs to the world now. Hes ours, and no amount of QQing is going to give you exclusive rights to him. He will be pirated, misappropriated, torn, splintered, and mutilated And Watterson should be honored that he has created thing that has moved millions. We each feel as if we know calvin and in our own way we LOVE SOMEONE WHO HAS NEVER EXISTED.

       We recognize this as Watterson-esque.  At first blush, it does not offend, but reminds us of the truth of Calvin &amp; Hobbes.  Sometimes this is the best way to reach a lot of people.  There is no point in dissing the creator of this piece or the person who posted it.  I doubt either are attempting to make money from it, let alone ripping off Bill Watterson.  It uses the imagery of Calvin &amp; Hobbes to convey a nice message.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of it.

      <p>
       techrat, using the internet to convince us of your point using the biggest words you can muster is pretty lame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think if you muddle your point with incomprehensible blabber it will make you seem smarter? Your point more clear? More clever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry. Artists create original art. They dont manipulate anothers images into some personal distortion of their own, like this cheap peice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watterson created these images and has been outspoken on his desire to prevent them from commercialization. It is clear he had a personal connection (obviously) to his characters. For other people to take those characters and create something that was never intended is wrong. Make the statement in your own, original way. You argue that Watterson wouldnt disapprove because of no commercial gain. Are you saying his characters can be taken, twisted, recreated, and strewn about the internet as long as no money is being made and he would be okay with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, this is the INTELLECTUAL property of one person. If you arent that person, well, you dont have the right to distribute the images and then make claims as to what the owner would approve or disapprove of. No matter how inspiring YOU make believe it to be.

       Wondering if theres a bigger version of this image. Id love to have it on my wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the whole rip-off argument while I think Watterson might in fact actually like this one, the only way to know for sure is if he were to comment on it himself. Maybe that would resolve the issue

       Can anyone pls explain this? I didnt get it.Thx.

      <p>
       Dodo, its based on an American comic strip called Calvin and Hobbes. The guy waving in the background (Calvin?) used to own the tiger, but now hes grown up and given it to his kid, I guess. Hope that clears things up.

       Very well said. Bravo, and if Id like to say, I challenge any artist out there that is bold enough Id like to see this adult Calvin stuff continued on in a webcomic or something.  Nice article on top of the art as well. Ive been store-housing my old calvin and hobbs comics for when I have kids.

       to all the people arguing, its a fanart. Its someone who admires the original work, and did their take on it. Its not for profit, and if you dont like it, you can exit the browser

       Just a thought  It could be possible that the artist who drew this was not aware of Wattersons stance on others using his work in way such as this.  Ive always liked C&amp;H, but I dont spend time reading about Watterson.
