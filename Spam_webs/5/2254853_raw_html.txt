      Furs, particularly
those of sea otters and fur seals, lured the first European explorers, and
later Americans, to the Pacific Northwest and the Columbia River. They came by
sea. In the mid to late 1700s, the thick, luxurious and water-repellent furs of
sea mammals were highly valued in China as well as in Europe, where they were
sewn into coats, hats and bed covers. In China, furs were traded for tea and
spices.
     </p>
     <p>
      A
Russian, Semen Dezhnev, may have been the first to venture into the northern
Pacific for the purpose of commerce in furs. In 1648, Dezhnev completed the
first recorded voyage between the Arctic and Pacific oceans by sailing east
from the mouth of the Kolyma River, which flows into the Arctic Ocean, around
the northeastern tip of Siberia and south to a point near the mouth of the
Anadyr River, on the Pacific Ocean. Historian Stephen Haycox of the University
of Alaska calls Dezhnevs voyage a remarkable Russian geographical
accomplishment, a highly significant voyage like the later explorations of
Vitus Bering in 1728 and 1741 that led to the colonization of Alaska
by Russian fur merchants. Bering recognized the importance of Dezhnevs
accomplishment; he reported on Dezhnevs voyage upon his return to St.
Petersburg after exploring the Siberian Pacific coast. Others recognized, it,
too. In August 1778, Captain James Cook named the easternmost point of
Asia  the northeastern tip of Siberia  East Cape, but Russia has preferred
the name Cape Dezhnev.
     </p>
     <p>
      By
leading the way into the North Pacific, Dezhnev inspired those who would
follow. And it was the knowledge of Berings discovery of Alaska, among other
concerns, that influenced the naval officers of New Spain to dispatch their own
explorations north along the eastern coast of the Pacific into the Northwest in
the mid-1700s and to protect and expand their empire by establishing an outpost
at Nootka Sound on the west coast of present-day Vancouver Island in 1789. At
the same time, stories about Russians trading Alaskan furs in China, and the
continued search for the Northwest Passage, intensified European and,
ultimately, American interest in the Pacific Northwest and the Columbia River.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cook
approached the Northwest coast on his third voyage to the Pacific in March
1778. He first sighted the coast near present-day Yaquina Bay, Oregon
(Newport), on March 7. Because his instructions were to search for the passage
farther north, he spent little time off the Oregon coast, but he did name
several prominent capes  Gregory (today called Arago), Perpetua and
Foulweather  then was blown out to sea in a storm and missed both the
entrance of the Columbia River and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. He stopped at
Nootka Sound, which he did not realize was on an island, for the purpose of
repairing and rerigging his two ships, the
      <i>
       Resolution
      </i>
      and
      <i>
       Discovery
      </i>
      .
The expedition spent most of April at Nootka, where the local Indians carried
on a lively trade with the crew for metal. The Indians possessed some brass and
silver objects, apparently acquired from Spaniards who had visited the coast
previously, and they wanted more. Cooks crew traded practically everything
metal they possessed  buttons, drawer knobs, kettles  in exchange for sea
otter skins, which were needed to mend their worn clothing. The pelts also were
beautiful and luxurious, and the crew was passionately fond of them, Cook
later noted in his report of the voyage. At Canton on the return voyage to
England, following Cooks death in Hawaii, the crew sold their surplus pelts
for $100 apiece, a remarkable price at the time.
     </p>
     <p>
      News
of the fabulous value of Northwest furs sparked the interest of traders in
America, England and Spain and led to the beginning of the sea-based fur trade
in the Northwest. It was interest in the maritime fur trade following the
publication of the official report of Cooks voyage in 1784 that led to the
discovery of the Columbia River. British interest in the maritime fur
trade peaked between 1785 and 1794 and gradually declined over the next 10 years
as the wars that grew out of the French Revolution diminished Britains
manpower and investment. The country also concentrated its foreign trade
activities in India. But as well, competition intensified as more Americans
entered the Northwest fur trade. American merchants sought new business
opportunities in the wake of the American revolution and the loss of prior
trading relations with Great Britain, parts of Europe and in the West Indies. 
Robert Gray, who would discover the Columbia River on his second voyage
to the Northwest coast, was outfitted by Boston merchants for both voyages, the
first in 1787 and the second three years later. The trade grew steadily and
remained active and prosperous until war with Great Britain broke out in 1812.
     </p>
     <p>
      As
Cooks crew discovered, the prized sea otter fur initially brought $100 or more
in Canton, but over time the price declined to about $22  still a lot of money
in the early 1800s. At the height of the trade, in 1801-02, 15 vessels were on
the coast and 15,000 pelts were carried to Canton. Between 1790 and 1812,
American traders sold an average of 12,000 sea otter pelts in Canton annually.
The skins of beaver, marten and seals also were traded, but these were less
valuable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
Columbia River was not a major trading depot for sea otters, but the estuary
provided a convenient place for traders to spend the winters.
Vancouver's lieutenant, Broughton, found the American trader James
Baker in the estuary when he entered in October 1792, six months after Gray discovered
the river. During the winter of 1805-06, when the
      <a href="/history/LewisAndClark/">
       Lewis and Clark
      </a>
      expedition stayed at
      <a href="/history/FortClatsop/">
       Fort Clatsop
      </a>
      , local Indians gave the explorers
the names of 14 traders who had visited the river, but it was impossible to
identify them based on the Indians pronunciation of their names. In the
Columbia River, traders often acquired locally made leather war dresses, also
called clamons, which could be traded to Indians elsewhere on the Northwest
coast for furs  until the Americans started trading guns for furs and the war
dresses became obsolete.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steadily
the relentless pursuit of sea otters diminished their populations in the
Northwest, and traders turned to California, where the animals remained in
great supply. Enterprising businessmen sought to expand the Northwest trade to
embrace the Russian forts in Alaska by using Alaskan native hunters to kill sea
otters in California, trade them in Hawaii or Canton for cash and goods, and
then supply the Russian forts in a sort of triangular trade route between the
Northwest, Canton and Lima.. The Columbia River provided a suitable location
for the Northwest headquarters of such an enterprise, and Captain Nathaniel
Winship established a post about 30 miles upriver in May 1810 for that purpose.
The site was on the south shore approximately across the river from present-day
Oak Point, Washington. Repeated warnings by local Indians that Europeans were
welcome to trade at the coast but not settle inland convinced Winship to
abandon the project, but it was the first effort to build an American
settlement in the Northwest. Historians Dorothy Johansen and Charles Gates say
the Winship attempt at settlement also shows that East Coast business interests
saw the Columbia as a vital link in Pacific commerce and as the future business
center of the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      It
was the nature of the fur trade, Johansen and Gates wrote, that new fields of
opportunity needed to be opened continuously to feed the voracious demand for
fur. In 1807 the North West Company, a Canadian firm that employed
      <a href="/history/ThompsonDavid/">
       David Thompson
      </a>
      , began exploring the region west of the Rocky
Mountains. In competition with the Hudsons Bay Company, the North West Company
sought to leave the drainage of Hudsons Bay to its rival and attempt to
dominate the Columbia River fur trade. At the same time New York merchant John
Jacob Astor, who had made a fortune in the East Coast fur trade, sought to
expand his empire to the Pacific through a succession of separate companies
that ultimately would be established in succession across the country and
eventually joined. One of these, which he incorporated in 1810, was the Pacific
Fur Company. It was an alliance among Astor and three former North West Company
principals.
     </p>
     <p>
      To
stake his claim on the Pacific, Astor dispatched two parties to the mouth of
the Columbia in September 1810, one by sea in an Astor ship, the
      <i>
       Tonquin
      </i>
      ,
and the other by land. The ship arrived in the Columbia River estuary in late
March 1811, where eight men died as the ship attempted, and finally succeeded,
to cross the bar. Fort
      <a href="/history/Astoria/">
       Astoria
      </a>
      was built, the
      <i>
       Tonquin
      </i>
      left in
June for summer trading, and it never returned, the crew apparently massacred
and the ship destroyed in Nootka Sound. The land party would not arrive at
Astoria until early 1812, and then in small groups between January and late
spring. The outpost was seriously undersupplied, as most of the trade goods and
supplies had been stored in the
      <i>
       Tonquin
      </i>
      and were now lost.
     </p>
     <p>
      In
July 1811, meanwhile, a small party of Astorians who had arrived in the
      <i>
       Tonquin
      </i>
      decided it was safe enough to journey up the Columbia in search of furs.
Shortly, though, they met David Thompson coming down the river. All returned to
Astoria, stayed a week while Thompson scouted the area, and then resumed the
journey together up the Columbia. Thompson was the only one who had seen the
upper Columbia. The Astorians established their inland trading post at the
place where the Okanogan River flows into the Columbia in north-central
Washington.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
outbreak of war between the United States and Great Britain in June 1812
greatly affected Astors far-flung enterprise on the Pacific. Astors ship
      <i>
       Beaver
      </i>
      had arrived at Astoria to resupply the fort with trading goods and personnel,
and the Astorians upper Columbia party had returned with hopeful news of hunting
and trading prospects in the interior, but North West Company employees also
returned with plans for their own expanded business and, of course, news of the
war. Feeling outnumbered and undersupplied, the Astorians and Canadians agreed
to join forces, dissolve the Pacific Fur Company and sell Fort Astoria to the
North West Company. This was accomplished on October 16, 1813, and Fort Astoria
was renamed Fort George in honor of the British kin, George IV.
     </p>
     <p>
      Astor
later would blame the war for his loss of Astoria, which he estimated
ultimately cost him $200,000, but the truth is that the post was sold willingly
by the partners present, which was allowed in the articles of the companys
incorporation. As well, Astors Pacific adventure simply was poorly supplied
and managed, and even without the war he very likely would have been run out of
the Northwest business by the better organized and managed North West Company.
     </p>
     <p>
      From
1813 until 1821, when it merged with its rival Hudsons Bay Company, the North
West Company dominated the interior Northwest fur trade. But dreams of an
enterprise that would include England, the Northwest coast and the Orient never
were fulfilled, largely because the British-controlled East India Company
refused to allow rival North West Company ships to carry Chinese goods to
England. The North West Company had a foothold in the Northwest, but not a
continental monopoly; the Hudsons Bay Company had a monopoly within its
chartered area in Canada and wanted a monopoly in the West. It made sense for
the competitors to merge, and they did so in 1821.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
Bay Company took over Fort George, closed it and relocated at
      <a href="/history/FortVancouver/">
       Fort Vancouver
      </a>
      , which was constructed about 100 miles inland, the Indians now being
more receptive to European settlement. The Columbia Department of the Bay
Company included all of the Northwest from the Rocky Mountains west to the
Pacific and from Russian Alaska to Spanish California. By 1845, when the
company was at its peak, the Columbia Department included 23 forts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Meanwhile,
American interest in the western fur trade was growing. In 1821, the same year
the Bay Company and North West Company merged, Congressman John Floyd of
Virginia issued a report speculating on the profitability of a transcontinental
trade route to tap furs and profits from Oregon. He proposed that a community
be established at the mouth of the Columbia with a port, customs house, civil
administration and an Indian agent. Floyd was a friend of William Clark and a
cousin of Sgt. Charles Floyd, the only man to die on the Lewis and Clark
expedition. At the time, Astors American Fur Company was beginning to dominate
the fur trade in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, and he would eliminate
the competition there by 1835.
     </p>
     <p>
      To discourage competition from American traders in the Columbia Basin, the
Bay Company adopted a policy of trapping as many
      <a href="/history/Beavers/">
       beavers
      </a>
      as possible, particularly in the vast area south of the river where the company
knew American trappers were working, or would be. Beavers were not the only
fur-bearers that were hunted, but they had a high value. The company employed
its own trappers and hunters but also traded food and other goods with Indians
for furs. Over time, many Indians became essentially wards of the company,
trapping and trading in a sort of subsistence round of furs and food.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
Bay Company dominated the Northwest fur trade from its merger with the North
West Company until 1846, when the United States and Great Britain ended the
joint occupancy of the Northwest that had existed since 1818 and agreed on the
49
      <sup>
       th
      </sup>
      parallel as the international border. The interior fur trade
had its heyday in the 10 years between 1823 and 1833. Profits could be
enormous. H.M. Chittenden, whose two-volume
      <i>
       The American Fur Trade of the
Far West
      </i>
      is an authoritative work on the subject, estimated, for example,
that the profits of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, an American firm, were
$50,000-$60,000 per year between 1823 and 1827.
     </p>
     <p>
      After
1833, the aggressive trapping of the Bay Company and the subsequent decline of
beaver populations, competition among the various firms engaged in the trade
and a shift in public preference away from fur clothing, particularly hats,
vastly reduced profitability. The fur trade declined after 1840. In the
Columbia River Basin, the Bay Company experienced a decline. Between 1826 and
1830, the company took in more than 51,700 beaver pelts at its Columbia River
Basin posts. Between 1841 and 1845, the number was barely half as many, about
26,500. Other business operations, including lumbering and agriculture,
steadily grew in importance as the company consolidated its operations north of
the new border.
     </p>
     <p>
      The
decline of the fur trade coincided roughly with the decline of the Christian
      <a href="/history/MissionsAndMissionaries/">
       missions
      </a>
      in the Columbia Basin following the 1847 WHITMAN
MURDERS. Geographer D.W. Meinig, author of
      <i>
       The Great Columbia Plain: A
Historical Geography, 1805-1910
      </i>
      , described the fur trade as one of three
significant cultural impacts on Columbia Basin Indian tribes, the others being
the missions and the military posts. None of these specifically was intended to
destroy the Indians, but each had its own negative impact. The fur trade, he
maintained, attempted to placate and exploit Indians, the missions to convert
and civilize, and the military posts to chastise and control. These points of
contact, from the standpoint of Indians, take on the appearance of festering
sores whose influences spread gradually and insidiously to infect whole tribes
with disease, economic distortion and social disintegration. Anthropologist
Eugene Hunn, also of the University of Washington, has a similar, if less
pessimistic, view of the impact of the fur trade on tribes. Indians tolerated
the traders and assisted them by providing horses and venison, Hunn says. But
there were social and cultural impacts of the traders presence, including the
introduction of diseases, the easy procurement of material goods and food that
made many Indians dependent on the trading posts, and inter-tribal warfare that
was exacerbated by guns provided by the traders in exchange for furs. The
encounter between Indians and non-Indians on the Columbia, which began with the
fur trade, encompassed a relatively narrow exchange between the discoverer
and the discovered, historian William Lang of Portland State University has
written. For Indians, trade was an opportunity to improve their lives, not the
context of their lives, Lang wrote. Nonetheless, the encounter was part of a
great world-changing experience [that] spun a kaleidoscope of consequences that
continue to inform and shape our decisions in private and public matters. The
Encounter changed this region, and it would never be as it was before.
