       If you're wondering where all the good men are or you doubt if you'll ever find the love you deeply want, then there is
       <b>
        one thing
       </b>
       that you must come to terms with.
                            And that is the fear of making the first move.
                            From a young age we've been told that if a man likes you he WILL make an effort to get to know you, there will be no two ways about it!   
                            We've been fed the line that your Prince Charming will see you from across the room, swoop over and claim you as his one and only!
                            And then you know - castle, white horses, the whole thing.
                            BUT times have changed. Men often don't make the first move any more. They are distracted. And they have often been taught that it's "inappropriate."
                            Gender roles have become confusing for everybody - but there are ways for you to cut through the confusion and find and attract EXACTLY the man you want.
                            The truth be known; for decades women were taught to make the first move - though using indirection.
      </p>
      <p class="readmorearticles">
       <img src="imgs/article5.jpg" style="float:left;padding-right:14px;margin-top: 5px;"/>
       For example - the subtle drop of the hanky was born in the 1950's to lure a good man.  And it worked.
                            In fact, making the first move works in a woman's favor for a few reasons - when a woman initiates contact she gets to show off her "sass" and personality, which heightens attraction with the right guy.  It shows you are not a marshmallow.  Not passive.  Not boring.  Which tells the right man that you ADD something to life. Energy.  Verve.  Motivation.
                            The RIGHT men find this sexy.
                            The other advantage is that you get to choose who you would like to be with.  We are not wallflowers of women.  We help create our dreams.
                            So if you tend to be sitting at home alone on a Friday night or often out with girlfriends wishing you were on a date, or talking about why there are so many useless men out there, or whining that no one asks you out... then stop waiting for prince charming to turn up. Be the queen who reigns over her life and Queendom!
                            Princesses wait around.
                            But queens gracefully get the love they want.
                            Here's how to do it:
       <strong>
        Step #1:
       </strong>
       Define your intention - is your expectation to have a man respond in a specific way to your "first move" or are you simply open to an opportunity to connect with someone new regardless of outcome? Your intention or your expectation will determine how you come across and will tamper your success.
                            Are you so desperate for love or rather are you consciously looking to meet new men no matter what happens? The latter will attract men and allow you to be relaxed when engaging with a man, the former will tend to repel men.
       <strong>
        Step #2:
       </strong>
       Assess your energy - Women can confuse men by the energy they give out.
                            Some women are overly sexual and wonder why they only attract guys who only want "fun".
                            Some women wear brown and rein their sexuality in and end up wondering why nobody is paying attention to them!
                            There is a happy medium. You can exude femininity and be sexy like Goldilocks - right in the middle.
                            You can flirt without sending the message that anyone can have you. What men truly find sexy has little to do with a light, playful, curious, confident, radiant presence, and I can show you how to do to that.
                            If you want to find your King, then be a Queen who isn't ashamed of her confidence and self-worth.  And who knows how to turn up the flirtation dial!
       <strong>
        Step #3:
       </strong>
       Go to places where YOUR type of man frequents - What are you interested in that offers a mixed  gender opportunity? 
                            You want a sweet, conscious yoga guy - go to yoga class, personal development courses or workshops.
                            You want a high-powered professional - there are wine bars and restaurants near courthouses and executive centers.
                            Want that artistic type?  Painting classes, dancing, book clubs, raw food cooking classes all work.
                            The key is to be PROACTIVE and go where the gold is!  The gold that YOU want.
                            Of course you should try singles Meetup Groups or meeting a man walking on the street or out at a bar, but going to organized activities or events can increase your chance of finding love fast by filtering out the kind of guy you want.
       <strong>
        Step #4:
       </strong>
       Remember - men can be shy too.  Men have insecurities too and lots of men do not approach women they desire.  So often men tell me that if they find you attractive, they assume you're already with someone.
                            So just because he thinks your cute or interesting, doesn't mean he has the courage to come over to you.
                            Your job is not to go up and ask him on a date.
                            Your job is not to take over the masculine role.
                            Your job is to be an invitation!
                            Whether it's a smile.  A lingering glance.  A compliment on his clothes (or better on something kind or impressive that he's done) - you are now making a move to bring the kind of man YOU want into your world.
                            Why the heck not! You've not nothing lose and a whole lot to gain.
       <strong>
        Step #5:
       </strong>
       How to approach men - It's not just enough to attend a class or hang out at a wine bar. You've got to make a move. A simple smile (held for 3-5 seconds) and a glimmer of the eyes will often be enough of an invitation to get some men to approach you.
                            Other times more action is required. Men love to help women and be of service, which means you can ask him to assist you in some way or get a man's advice.  You can ask a bout something if you're in the same shop, ordering coffee...
                            Or... if you're in a bar or somewhere social - ask his opinion as a man.
                            Men are more than happy to share their opinions!  Have you noticed?
                            Finally - yes, compliment him.  Men love compliments because so few women compliment men.   And I show you so many ways to do this in my program

       </a>
       <strong>
        Step #6:
       </strong>
       Be confident and develop self-love
                            Confidence is sexy to the right men.
                            Self-belief, self-esteem shows that you are a "prize catch" for the right man.
                            Remember - only low esteem men seek low esteem women.
                            Respectful, high-esteem men seek women who value themselves - and who especially value self-growth, openness, communication and getting better all the time.
                            The way I teach women, you bring your best, happiest self to the world and stand tall.  When I coach women, I first get you in touch with what makes you a magnificent catch for men  and then also to forget about outcome and just get out there and meet men.
                            And not just any men - but the right men.  Quality men who appreciate a woman like you with confidence
       <strong>
        Step #7:
       </strong>
       Dealing with "rejection"
                            What is rejection anyway? We can paint a story in our minds as to what it means if a man doesn't respond how we would like. These are stories. The reality is you are worthy of love and not getting the attention you desire cannot change your worth.
                            So what do you do if a man doesn't encourage conversation, he tells you he's in a relationship or he's just not that interested? S imple - you just don't care.  You move on.  No one man defines your future until you DECIDE to make him your one man.
                            I always remind my students of this lovely fact: it just takes ONE man to bring you a lifetime of happiness.  All the other guys?  White noise.
                            Keep at it. You are worthy of great love and great love requires a good dose of resilience to get you there.
                            It's crucial that you don't let losers, whiners, flakes and boy-men get you down. Don't give up - There is someone out there for everyone. In fact there are multiple people in the world who could be a love match for you.
                            You've just got to meet ONE of them, that's all. And to do this you've got to meet lots of men and filter them out for the best one of all.
                            You've got to drop lots of hankies (so to speak) while maintaining your innate sense of worth. The Queen would not be rattled by what does not work out. The Queen stands true, fortified with faith, heart and love.
                            Leave your ego at the door and start communicating and striking conversation with as many men as you can with no attachment to outcome. Practice approaching people anywhere and everywhere...
                            To start building your confidence in making the first move chat to both women and men. Chat to strangers in the elevator, people sitting next to you on the train, at a caf, the guy/girl waiting to place their coffee order at Starbucks, ask them if they've tried a certain flavor or ask them for directions? It can be that simple.
                            Be proactive. Keep your heart open and never give up on finding real authentic love.
