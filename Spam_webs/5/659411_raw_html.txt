     FUTURE TV LINEUP
    </h1>
    <h3>
     By DAVE WHITNEY
     <br/>
     I doubt if many of us who have reached our Golden Years had to worry too much about giving up our virginity to vote for any particular party but for one I am more than glad to see the long, long blitz of political television ads finally come to an end.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After a couple of years of wall-to-wall political ads - many of which simply became white noise in the background - that poured as much as $100 million a week into the coffers of television networks its time to take a look at what the future may look like on The Tube.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For sure, there is no way non-political advertisers can make up for the loss of revenue faced by those who produce television programs. Right-sizing will be the new norm for all networks  commercial and cable  as we enter into the late fall and winter television seasons.

     Sinking &amp; Swimming
    </h1>
    <h3>
     By DAVE WHITNEY
     <br/>
     A decade ago I was a millionaire  on paper at least  and today I have to keep an eye on every dollar to get by from month to month. It has been an exercise in sinking and swimming, an ode to our time, a symphony of economic scales that occurs at least once in all lifetimes based on the history of our country.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I am one of those seniors who got caught in the real estate collapse and watched a whole lot of equity in a home and a couple of businesses evaporate and blow away in fistful of hurricanes helpless to do anything about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It was a big adventure; a life lived to the fullest in one of the most beautiful places in the world - the Florida Keys for a quarter of a century. I left with about what I started with and no regrets.
     <br/>
     Im just another statistic making up some of the bad news about The Great Recession, one of the seniors who have felt, or are beginning to feel the hammer falling on their real estate values and dreams of a grand retirement lifestyle.

    TIME &amp; TALENTS
   </h1>
   <h3>
    By DAVE WHITNEY
    <br/>
    As we age we definitely have a couple of secret weapons in our time and talents. While many of us have kept up with modern technology, we retain the Talent to write letters, something younger generations rarely, if ever, stoop from their high-tech platforms to do. And, we have the time to do it. Last spring I stopped by my local Staples store and one of the clerks handed me a certificate offering a PC Tune Up + For a just-like-new Computer. I bit! A Staples technician ran a diagnostic program on my PC laptop and said it would cost nearly $100 to complete the software tune-up.

     NAPPING WITHOUT GUILT
    </h1>
    <h3>
     While napping on the job is widely considered unacceptable in the USA, many cultures (especially those in hot climates) serve their largest meals at midday, with an official allowance for a nap period (siesta) afterwards before returning to work. The ability to nod off for a while, wake up rejuvenated and ready to tackle the remainder of the day seems very civilized. Frank Kaiser initially resisted napping, but has discovered that napping is Cool.

     WHAT'S NEXT?

    <br/>
    Lawmakers gone wild? History shows, the age of Prohibition (1920- 1933) was a failure. Today liquor is more widely available than ever. Yet this has not stopped those sworn to protect us from evil. Smoking is banned in office buildings and public places. Fair enough, it does bother many people, myself included. Now Mayor Bloomberg has banned sodas larger than 16oz in New York City. Yes, sodas, that evil over-priced carbonated sugary water! "What's Next" to be banned, ask our resident pundit Dave Whitney. Hamburgers?

     WHEN DID YOU START TALKING TO YOURSELF?

    Nowadays, it's common to see people walking down the street, apparently talking to themselves. Only when you get close do you realize they are having a phone conversation with some unseen person on their Bluetooth headset! In this week's classic Kaiser column, Frank muses on yet another sign of aging... Talking to yourself, without even realizing!

     TRICK or TRUTH?
    </span>
    <br/>
    Dave Whitney remembers men coming to the back door of his old house in Ohio, looking for odd jobs to do. "They didnt have to make up any story to get a little help. All they needed to do was show up and ask for some work." And his grandmother always had a little something for them to do while she made them a meal. She served it to them on the back step on real plates complete with proper silverware and a cloth napkin. Not today...

     READY TO THROW IN THE TOWEL?

    <br/>
    So, you're retiring, or retired. Are you going to disappear into that rocking chair? Or stand up and be counted? About 10 years ago Frank Kaiser wrote about Granny D, then 89, who went on a one-woman crusade for campaign finance reform. Thanks to our Supreme Court's misguided Citizens United decision allowing "big money" to flood our TV screens with ever more political ads, we are now further from Campaign Finance Reform and allowing "the People" to speak than ever. Granny D passed on at the age of 100. Are there some others out there ready to pick up the baton?
