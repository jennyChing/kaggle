    WW2 began in September 1939, and
food rationing began in January 1940 just about the time my Grandfather
reached retiring age. He had always been a knowledgeable gardener and
grown vegetables and fruit for his family. Through frugality and good
domestic economy he and my grandmother succeeded in buying a home of their
own. Now they carefully planned their personal wartime campaign -  a
Victory Garden.

    They moved to a new house, in the same quiet
cul-de-sac where their son, who had been retained in London (England) on essential
services, lived with his wife and family. Both houses had very large sunny
backyards  as well as sizeable front gardens. Only the rear fences,
which separated the gardens from a back lane, and the portions of side
fence immediately alongside the dwellings were the standard 6 feet in
height. The rest of the side fences separating the gardens in the
cul-de-sac, and the front fences, were about 3 feet 6 inches high and of an
attractive wooden lattice. This allowed maximum light and air to reach the
gardens.  Before the houses were built in the early 1930's, the land had
been used for market gardens, so the soil was excellent. The undeveloped
portion of land at the rear of the estate had been divided into
allotments, and Grandpa rented one of these.

   <p>
    From the summer of 1940,
Grandpa brought us produce at least once, sometimes twice a week, which
meant a long walk and a bus journey. There were vegetables and fruit in
season, a few eggs, and sometimes a dressed (or should I say 'undressed'?)
rabbit. But it was only when we were bombed out in 1944 and went to live
with Gran and Grandpa that I began to understand the full extent of   his
'Victory Garden'.
   </p>
   <p>
    The next 18 months laid the foundations
of my knowledge and lifelong love of sustainable self-reliance. I was
nearly seven years old when we first moved there, so I was old enough and
interested enough to want to be deeply involved. I was also just the
right size for jobs that required an adult to spend long periods bent
double! So I learned to weed, sow seeds, plant and transplant seedlings, 
chit and plant potatoes, and about crop rotation; also to harvest peas, broad
and bush beans, brussels sprouts, potatoes, gooseberries, raspberries,
strawberries and currants. I also helped with the preparation of food,
with jam making, and with preserving. Everything I was not thought old
enough or nimble-fingered enough to attempt I watched closely. What I
learnt from my extended family during those months remains a treasure
beyond price.
   </p>
   <p>
    Both gardens had beautifully laid out formal front
gardens, with crazy paving paths, bird baths and sundials. There were rose
bushes, flowers for cutting, for perfume, and for pleasure. Grandpa had a
lavender hedge right at the front, and he was very proud of his bearded
irises, which he and Gran called 'flags'. The portion of the back garden
immediately behind the house had a small central lawn, with a rockery to
the left which gave extra blast cover to the front of the Anderson
Shelter. The entrance to the shelter was hidden by trellis and a Paul's
Scarlet climbing rose.
   </p>
   <p>
    In summer marrows grew splendidly on the 2 feet
of earth that covered the upper portion of the shelter. To the right of
the lawn was the greenhouse, and the greenhouse roof supplied a huge water
butt. The mint bed was kept under control by being imprisoned between
the greenhouse and the path between it and the lawn. This portion comprised
about one third of the back garden. The remainder had deciduous fruit
trees scattered throughout, several varieties each of apples and plums, and
a greengage.
   </p>
   <p>
    The people next door had a large pear tree, so Grandpa
arranged to swap fruit in season. Early rhubarb had it's special warm
spot behind the greenhouse, and behind that was the strawberry bed. The
raspberry canes and currant bushes were up near the back fence, as were
the compost heaps. The remaining space was used for vegetables of all
kinds, according to the season: parsnips, turnips, swedes, carrots,
cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, peas, broad, bush and
climbing beans. The only thing Grandpa didn't grow was onions. Uncle
grew these for both families, while Grandpa grew the potatoes. Uncle
also had a greenhouse, and grew cucumbers and lettuce, while Grandpa's was
entirely given over to tomatoes. Aunty kept a big herb garden, and she and
Uncle also grew vegetables, though they hadn't as much space as we had,
because Aunty kept hens for eggs and meat, and raised her own chicks. But
they had two cherry trees, and a crabapple.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a lean-to at the side of
their house was a wall stacked with rabbit hutches. These rabbits were
not kept just for meat. My Aunt had beeen a milliner, and she cured the
skins and made gloves, hats and scarves from the fur.
   </p>

   <p>
    On the allotment were
gooseberries, more potatoes, summer rhubarb, and more vegetables.
Surprisingly there was little pilfering from the allotment - maybe
because it was immediately across the lane from Uncle's back gate, or
could people really have believed, as some of my school-mates claimed,
that Gran was a witch?! Certainly they asked me often if it were true -
their families couldn't work out why Grandpa's gardens were so
productive. But I knew it wasn't due to magic, but to knowledge, skill,
and hard work.
   </p>
   <p>
    You couldn't buy artificial fertilisers in those days.
But Grandpa kept his plants well-nourished. He swept our chimneys
himself and kept the soot for the garden, and he collected lime mortar from
bomb sites. Any wood ash was carefully kept, also the lawn mowings, and of
course he had the manure and old bedding from the chook and rabbit pens. He
made a small wooden cart which he pulled behind his bicycle. He rode
round behind the baker, the milkman and the coalman, all of whom made
their deliveries by horse and cart, collecting the droppings. Of course
the local kids called out after him in the street, and teased me about my
'dirty Grandpa'. But he ignored them, and I learnt to do the same. He
collected leaf-mould in the Autumn to add to the compost pile, which
regularly received every scrap of organic waste he could garner. Bones
were broken up with a hammer, (but not before they had spent hours in
Gran's stockpot) and fish bones cut up with old scissors. The vacuum
cleaner and the dustpans were always emptied on the heap, as were the
teapot and the chamberpots we used at night. All tiny scraps of wool,
thread and fabric also went in.
   </p>
   <p>
    One job I really enjoyed was collecting
dandelions and other suitable plants for the chickens and rabbits. Even in
winter, I often managed to get a handful or two on my way home from
school, and fossicking in the back lane. Grandpa sometimes took me out
down to the river, or to the watermeads, where we would gather
watercress, and greens for the livestock, and he taught me to identify every
plant, shrub and tree we encountered, and told me how to use them.

    We
bottled all the fruit that we couldn't eat fresh or stewed, using plain
water, or a little Golden Syrup or honey when we could get it. Sugar was
rationed, but extra sugar was available in the summer for jam making, and
we made enough to last the year, mainly from the plums, blackcurrants and
gooseberries. But we made just a few pots of greengage, strawberry,
raspberry, rhubarb and apple,  wild blackberry and apple, and redcurrant
jelly, to keep for Christmas, and for gifts.  Any windfall or damaged
fruit, and the green tomatoes left at the end of the season, were used for
chutney, using onions, treacle and vinegar, and just a sprinkling of the
spices kept carefully sealed and used sparingly since before the war.
These spices also went into the Christmas puddings and cakes, which
consisted mainly of apples, carrots, prunes, suet, and treacle, with eggs
and flour. But they tasted fine to me!
   </p>
   <p>
    Potatoes and root vegetables were
dug as late in the year as possible and then stored in clamps on the
surface of the soil. Parsnips and  Brussels Sprouts were left until after
the first frosts, because the frost sweetened them. Any surplus peas
were dried, and the runner beans sliced and salted down in a huge crock. The
Cox's Orange Pippins (a variety of apple, now sadly seldom grown) would
keep at least until Christmas, if picked just before fully ripe and placed
in shallow boxes and stored in the loft. The Bramley's Seedlings, a huge
tart green cooking apple, also kept well, and were used in winter for pies
and my favourite dessert - baked apple!
   </p>
   <p>
    Altogether the produce from the
Victory Garden supplied 6 families from the summer of 1941 onwards - my
Uncle's family, Grandma and Grandpa, our family, my aunt's sister's
family, and my other grandparents (they had no garden) and another elderly
couple who lived nearby. All of these families saved every scrap that
wasn't eaten, and gave it to Aunty. Anything suitable was cooked, minced and
mixed with the hot bran mash fed to the chickens and the rabbits, and
everything else went into the compost heaps.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was only much later
in life that I realised just how wisely Grandpa had planned for those he
loved.  He died in April 1945, in the room next to the one in which I
was sleeping, from cancer. As was the custom, he was laid in a open
coffin in the back room umtil the funeral. When he died, his beloved
'flags' were still in bud. But as the closed coffin was at last carried
to the hearse, Gran was able to lay a huge sheaf of the fully open
bronze and purple blooms upon it.
   </p>
   <p>
    For two days late in March 1945,
Grandpa had kept me out in the garden, planting the whole of one side
with potatoes. Although food shortages became worse that year, even
after the end of the war, Grandpa had seen to it that we had enough
potatoes to keep us going until the following spring.  For Grandpa work
was truly "Love made visible!"

      This rare  book
(1919), about the USA food gardening program during World War I, is
being republished chapter by chapter  on the Internet.  "The United
States government strongly encouraged everyone to plant a garden to
provide their own food so that food, transportation and other resources
could be freed up for the war effort." -  "The sole aim of the National
War Garden Commission was to arouse the patriots of America to the
importance of putting all idle land to work, to teach them how to do it,
and to educate them to conserve by canning and drying all food they
could not use while fresh. The idea of the 'city farmer' came into
being."
