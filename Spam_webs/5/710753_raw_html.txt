   October 2010
  </p>
  <p>
   The world lost a brilliant scholar, researcher, historian, and author this month, when Zecharia Sitchin died on October 9, 2010.
  </p>
  <p>
   I met
   <a href="sitchin.html">
    Zecharia Sitchen
   </a>
   in 1989 when we both appeared on the Bill Knell TV show dealing with
   <a href="ancientastronauts.html">
    ancient astronauts.
   </a>
   As Mr. Sitchin shared a limo from the city to the studio out in Long Island, we got to talk about his work, and our connection to Sumerian Gods and creational forces.  He had brought along some of his Sumerian artifacts, that spoke to me of ancient times and creation. The next time Zecharia Sitchin and I met was in 1993 at NYU where we lectured together on ancient astronauts and related information.

   His concept of the Anunnaki, always rang true for me, at the very least as a metaphor for ancient astronauts, giants if you will, who created a biogenetic experiment here on Earth.  The reference to the quest for gold was a metaphor for the return to consciousness and light in the golden alchemy of time when the experiment ended. Some believe that Giants still visit the planet as consciousness prepares to evolve.  I, for one, had
   <a href="sequencedream910.htm">
    a lucid dream experience
   </a>
   about the return of the Sumerian gods, just weeks before Zecharia Sitchin died, when the god below appeared. As with all pantheon of gods and goddesses, one soul played all the roles.

   Reality is myth,
   <a href="sg.html">
    math,
   </a>
   and metaphor, with a sprinkle of magic.  Zecharia Sitchin's theories, as with all others, are laced with metaphoric content from

    3,600
   </a>
   years to Sumerian Gods creating a Biogenetic Program. It's all part of the golden alchemy of time and consciousness through which we experience and now evolve.

    Zecharia Sitchin's Biography
   </b>
  </center>
  <p>
   <br/>
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zecharia_Sitchin">
    Zecharia Sitchin
   </a>
   (July 11, 1920 - October 9, 2010) was born in Russia and raised in Palestine, where he acquired a knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. Sitchin attended and graduated from the University of London, majoring in economic history.
  </p>
  <p>
   A journalist and editor in Israel for many years, he now lives and writes in New York. His books have been widely translated, converted to Braille for the blind, and featured on radio and television. Sitchin claims that his research coincides with many biblical texts and that the biblical texts come originally from the Sumerian writings of their history.
  </p>
  <p>
   He was an author of books promoting an explanation for human origins involving ancient astronauts. Sitchin attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Anunnaki, which he claims to be a race of extra-terrestrials from a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru. He believed this hypothetical planet of
   <a href="nibiru.html">
    Nibiru
   </a>
   to be in an elongated, elliptical orbit in the Earth's own Solar System, asserting that Sumerian mythology reflects this view.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sitchin's speculations have been ridiculed by professional scientists, historians, and archaeologists, who note many problems with his translations of ancient texts and categorize his work as pseudohistory and pseudoscience.
  </p>
  <p>
   Similarly to earlier authors such as Immanuel Velikovsky and Erich von Daniken, Sitchin advocated theories in which extraterrestrial events supposedly played a significant role in ancient human history.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to Sitchin's interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbology, outlined in his 1976 book The 12th Planet and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune which follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>

  </center>
  <p>
   This planet is called
   <a href="nibiru.html">
    Nibiru
   </a>
   (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology). According to Sitchin, Nibiru, (whose name was replaced with Marduk in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the Enuma Elis), who he considers to be another planet located between Mars and Jupiter.
  </p>
  <p>
   This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin claims that when struck by one of planet Nibiru's moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru's moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today's planet Earth.
  </p>
  <p>
   According to Sitchin, Nibiru (called "the twelfth planet" because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians' gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the Anunnaki in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the Nephilim in Genesis. He claims they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system and first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these "gods" were the rank and file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru.
  </p>
  <p>
   Sitchin believes the Anunnaki genetically engineered Homo sapiens as slave creatures to work their gold mines by crossing extraterrestrial genes with those of Homo erectus. Sitchin claims ancient inscriptions report that human civilization in Sumer of Mesopotamia was set up under the guidance of these "gods", and human kingship was inaugurated to provide intermediaries between mankind and the Anunnaki (creating the Divine right of kings doctrine).
  </p>
  <p>
   Sitchin believes that fallout from nuclear weapons, used during a war between factions of the extraterrestrials, is the "evil wind" described in the Lament for Ur that destroyed Ur around 2000 BC. Sitchin claims the exact year is 2024 BC. Sitchin claims that his research coincides with many biblical texts, and that biblical texts come originally from

   Sitchin put forth his own date for the next passage of Nibiru in the year 2085, but the date most talked about is
   <a href="2012.html">
    2012
   </a>
   which marks the end of a cycle of time on the Maya calendar.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nibiru (the planet associated with Marduk in Babylonian cosmology) is a central element of Sitchin's theory. He claims it was a tenth planet (twelfth to those who included the Sun and Moon) which followed a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system every
   <a href="36around1.html">
    3600 years
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   According to his theories of Sumerian cosmology, Nibiru was the twelfth member in the solar system family of planets (which includes 10 planets, the Sun, and the Moon). Its catastrophic collision with Tiamat, a planet that was between Mars and Jupiter, would have formed the planet Earth and the asteroid belt and comets.
