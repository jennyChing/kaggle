  <meta content='In this long-awaited sequel to our series, get the insider details on China&#39;s military operations against the NWO. The fight for Disclosure is getting more and more blatant -- and we&#39;re definitely seeing some powerful events!

	

	CLICK HERE FOR PART ONE
	

	CLICK HERE FOR PART TWO
	

	

	VERY EXCITING EVENTS

	If you are still freaking out about the Old World Order and their diabolical plans, try to relax!

	The evidence is becoming overwhelming that there is an extreme, multi-faceted worldwide effort being made to bring them down.

	Multiple sources now confirm China has made a bold leap into the fray by using EMP technology -- in conjunction with alleged ET allies -- to force these power brokers to stand down. And the war is not over yet.

	You are about to read all the evidence, link by link, in chronological order. It has taken a great deal of time and energy to put this together and I am sorry for the wait.

	I have been posting intuitive information online since 1996, including many prophecies -- both in &#39;readings&#39; and in dreams -- that have come true.

	The insider data and intuitive data isn&#39;t provable. Insiders can be right about one thing but wrong about something else. I also would put them -- and me -- at risk if I were to even hint at who exactly has told me what.

	That&#39;s why I do all the research -- and show you tangible proof that what I am hearing is probably true.

	

	DON&#39;T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT -- STUDY THE EVIDENCE
	

	My intuitive data has been very, very consistent in telling me the "negative elite" will not succeed. Any apparent victory they may expect to have is not part of the grander script this planet is being led through -- by high-level angelic beings, for lack of a better term.

	During the last three years I have had at least 200 different dreams all saying the Old World Order will be defeated in a very obvious and dramatic fashion. These dreams continue right up to the present and have not changed -- only gotten more intense.

	I have had many years of experience in how accurate this guidance can be, particularly when you get &#39;clusters&#39; of data that all point in the same direction.

	The dreams have always said that Disclosure won&#39;t happen until we see a clear and spectacular defeat of the Powers that Were on the world stage first. The two must work in conjunction.

	This is exactly what&#39;s happening right now. Open your eyes and take a look at what you see.' name="og:description"/>

                     <p>
                      The evidence is becoming overwhelming that there is an extreme, multi-faceted
                      <strong>
                       worldwide
                      </strong>
                      effort being made to bring them down.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Multiple sources now confirm China has made a bold leap into the fray by using EMP technology -- in conjunction with alleged ET allies -- to force these power brokers to stand down. And the war is not over yet.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You are about to read all the evidence, link by link, in chronological order. It has taken a great deal of time and energy to put this together and I am sorry for the wait.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I have been posting intuitive information online since 1996, including many prophecies -- both in 'readings' and in dreams -- that have come true.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The insider data and intuitive data isn't provable. Insiders can be right about one thing but wrong about something else. I also would put them -- and me -- at risk if I were to even hint at who exactly has told me what.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That's why I do all the research -- and show you tangible proof that what I am hearing is probably true.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                      My intuitive data has been very, very consistent in telling me the "negative elite" will not succeed. Any apparent victory they may expect to have is not part of the grander script this planet is being led through -- by high-level angelic beings, for lack of a better term.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      During the last three years I have had at least 200 different dreams all saying the Old World Order will be defeated in a very obvious and dramatic fashion. These dreams continue right up to the present and have not changed -- only gotten more intense.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I have had many years of experience in how accurate this guidance can be, particularly when you get 'clusters' of data that all point in the same direction.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The dreams have always said that Disclosure won't happen until we see a clear and spectacular defeat of the Powers that Were on the world stage first. The two must work in conjunction.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This is exactly what's happening right now. Open your eyes and take a look at what you see.

                      Washington, D.C., November 21, 2010: Although it is not a matter of public knowledge, the facts surrounding the so-called WikiLeaks are such that perhaps a little publicity would do no harm.
                     </p>
                     <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                      This concept is a

                       government disinformation site, designed to leak information to the public that cannot be published in the mainline media.
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                      The tens of thousands of vital messages dealing with Afghanistan have been
                      <strong>
                       tailor-made to give Obama the excuse to exit from Afghanistan.
                      </strong>
                     </p>
                     <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                      Unfortunately, the Republican gains in the House have made this policy null and void.
                     </p>
                     <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                      The new Republicans do not want to stop war, they want even more -- and so Obamas plans to get out have been scrapped.
                     </p>
                     <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                      The earlier WikiLeaks stories were all low-level, not important to U.S. national security and, aside from the Administration, of interest only to inane bloggers and their readers...

                      The CIA loves to use people like Julian the Apostate because if they get caught, Langley always looks the other way and murmurs, Julian who?

                      [DW: A 'gadfly' is a persistently annoying person, like a fly buzzing in your face] -- but two weeks ago, a friend, name unknown, sent me eight discs containing much, if not all, of the so-called DoS cables -- and much on certain American banks that he is in the process of releasing to the public.

                     <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                      Reading this over was a revelation, because it would be an impossibility to fake so much material -- and some of the material I have seen elsewhere.

                       Tens of millions of personal computers were hijacked last week in an act of sabotage that crippled the WikiLeaks website.

                      WikiLeaks revealed that a denial of service attack that temporarily shut down the website used a network of zombie computers, which were infiltrated by the hackers.

                      WikiLeaks is now battling for its survival. Amazon, which hosted the website, refused further access to its servers last week. A site that provided WikiLeaks with its domain name, EveryDNS.net, also cut off its service because it said it was being inundated with sabotage attacks.

                      It hasn't gotten into UFOs just yet, but we're already seeing the signs of what true Disclosure will be like -- an explosive burst of new information that the insiders do not want you to know, all coming out at once.

                       "THE EVENT" IS TRUTH MIXED WITH FICTION

                     <p>
                      In Part One I discussed "The Event" -- the most blatant attempt at Disclosure with 'plausible deniability,' as a seemingly fictional television show, that the world has ever seen.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The plot is remarkably similar to a plan for Disclosure I told you about last year, from insider sources. Obviously I do not believe NBC got it from our website.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      No one can deny that I am on public record -- in writing and in audio and video -- telling you almost the exact same story as "The Event" in 2009.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The story was that Obama was planning a formal Disclsoure to the public that UFOs exist, and are piloted by remarkably human ETs -- who he was going to introduce us to on live television.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Furtherore, he was going to say that five groups of human ETs have been working with the US government for the last century, that we need their help now to save the planet, and "please don't shoot them" as they are mortal.

                     <p>
                      We also found out, after the fact, that five different insider groups worked to stop this announcement before it ever got started -- all with the most dire threats.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This does not mean the announcement has been canceled -- merely postponed. We will probably never know when it is coming until the minute it happens.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      However, the Wikileaks explosion could force it to the surface faster than many insiders think.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Another window for an Obama-led Disclosure announcement was chosen this year -- just a few months back.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I didn't hear about it until after it came and went, but was aware of other rumors from Benjamin Fulford that such a plan was very much in the works.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Think about it. In less than one month, it will be less than a year before 2012. If you believe there is any credence to these prophecies whatsoever, then obviously many things will need to happen in the next year.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And believe me, that's exactly what they're planning -- based on every insider source I'm in contact with.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It is also important to remember that the power groups do believe 2012 is significant, and will
                      <strong>
                       create
                      </strong>

                     <p>
                      This was emphatically described to me by a high-level insider recently.
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This insider said there was a "2010 Window," which was for "Full Disclosure with Plausible Deniability," to prepare us for a much bigger "2012 Window" -- which would include "Full Disclosure
                      <strong>
                       without
                      </strong>
                      Plausible Deniability" if it hadn't already happened by then.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Obviously Disclosure is going to happen somehow -- and soon. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when.

                     <p>
                      These are the Last Days before The Announcement. I would be very surprised if we make it through 2011 without the whole cover-up crumbling apart -- in the midst of a spectacular defeat for the power brokers.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Yes -- many plans have been made and thwarted, but all it takes is one 'winner' in this game and the whole thing breaks open.

                      The plot of "The Event" only goes back to the 1940s, and only involves one group of human ETs -- maybe two if you count the head Illuminati guy, Dempsey, shape-shifting into a younger version of himself in the mirror at the end of Episode 8.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In this show, Obama (as Elias Martinez) wanted to hold a big press conference and announce that human ETs have been here since the 1940s, and introduce us to their female leader.

                      Right before he made the announcement, a hijacked airliner threatened his life -- only to be warped through a 'portal' at the last second.

                      This past Monday night's show, Episode 10, is the last one of this half-season. In it, the Vice President says the following very striking lines, directly to the character representing President Obama:

                      This show appears to be genuinely trying to inform the public about what is going on -- including the fact that there are highly powerful groups manipulating events behind the scenes for their own benefit.

                      Highly reliable insiders have told me this show is financed by the Pentagon -- by about 60 percent. I do feel those who paid for this show represent one faction within an increasingly 'hot' insider war over Disclosure.

                      As I suggested on the phone with Richard C. Hoagland last night -- and he agreed with me -- part of the reason why the actors in "The Event" are not told any plot points in advance is because the show itself is being written as they go, dynamically responding to world events as they happen.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I saw this last year with 'V' as well, where emerging things like the swine flu vaccine controversy suddenly manifested in the episodes -- with very little change.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I do not believe in coincidence and in this case there is a very plausible explanation. You have a general outline and structure for the plot, and you also do rewrites on the fly to work in current events -- and change your episodes at the last minute.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Richard also pointed out that the executive producer of this major hit TV series has no prior credits whatsoever. It is therefore very likely that he is just a figurehead for others who are writing and producing the show.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Episode 10 just featured a missile that went off, severely upsetting the President and his insiders, who watched helplessly as it went up into space -- not knowing if it would wipe out the West Coast in a nuclear blast.
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                      This very likely seems to have been a real-time television response to the alleged missile incident off the coast of Los Angeles -- which definitely was not a jet contrail.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Fulford is now on record saying three different Asian high-level sources told him the Chinese actually launched this missile -- as part of an ongoing show of force demanding the Old World Order folks stand down, just as I was independently told.

                      One clue that this new plot point was worked in at the last minute was how unfinished the CG animation looked -- more like a video game than a finished product for a big-budget hit TV show.

                      Having worked with our own CG crews, I know that what takes the most time is getting the right procedural textures and lighting effects to get things looking photo-realistic.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     </p>

                     <p style="text-align: center;">
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Some of the shots -- particularly as the missile shed its booster -- looked very, very rushed. No one took time to do the proper surfacing or lighting to get photorealism.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If you don't surface your CG, the objects usually start out as just being gray in color. The satellite in this effects sequence is predominantly all gray until the end -- as if they just didn't have time to do a whole lot more.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The particle animations, such as you see in the above frame, also seemed really rushed and did not help it look convincing. Nor did they put anything around the rocket to simulate atmospheric haze or debris.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The final shot, as the ET satellite expanded into its full size, looked better -- but they do have the budget to have made the whole sequence look much more realistic. It's really a question of the
                      <strong>
                       time
                      </strong>
                      they had to do it.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The missile launch was on November 9th, and this episode aired 20 days later. With actors, writers and existing sets on hand, they may well have had just enough time to squeak this last-minute rewrite in to the final episode of the season.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The 'radial' patterns you see on the top of this satellite are really easy to create in CG -- all you have to do is model one fin on the satellite and start cloning it around a central axis.

                      This satellite became a "cliffhanger" plot point to carry us into the next season. The negative faction of the ETs are now calling out into space -- apparently for reinforcements.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There was no prior precedent in the show to suggest they were going to use a rocket or a satellite, or that anything like this would happen.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In earlier 'writes' it could easily have been something here on the ground that was helping ET phone home.

                     <p>
                      Their goal? They want to terraform the Earth so they can colonize it -- and in the process effectively destroy it for everyone else.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Given that China's October Surprise may very well become public knowledge, including their use of a missile, this plot point in 'The Event' could easily be part of the 'spin control' to create a healthy fear around the whole thing.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      If China is working with their own group of ETs, even the white hats in the Pentagon don't want them to come out as the shining stars of Disclosure.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      It's a much better idea to cloud the legitimacy of any effort China is making by embedding the 'spin' directly into popular fiction -- to help shape and mold what people think about real-world events.

                      There are other very similar efforts I'm seeing as well -- particularly since the China story I started telling you about in October has been leaked in certain online UFO forums.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I was utterly shocked at how many specific details were in this online 'leak' -- much more than I had been willing to say here. The online 'leaks' were loaded with remarkably specific points I had already heard independently.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The similarities caught my attention. Very much.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The even bigger surprise, though, was in seeing the things that were
                      <em>
                       different.
                      </em>

                     <p>
                      In these forum 'leaks', we are told that China's ETs are trying to terraform the Earth so they can colonize it.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Conveniently, we are also expected to blame the Chinese and their friends for deliberately creating the BP oil volcano as well -- when they had nothing to do with it.

                      In the 'spin' version, the BP oil disaster was created to deliberately release a microbe into the Gulf that is intelligent and self-organizing -- and will quickly terraform the world, so China's ET allies can comfortably move in.
                     </p>

                      While nothing can ever be completely ruled out, I am certain that this is a classic case of disinformation in action.

                     <p>
                      If China is actually doing a good thing for humanity -- or even just protecting their own faction in the global game -- and could utterly defeat the Old World Order in the process, the Powers that Were need to flood the online information market with counterfeit 'currency' about China's real intentions.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      They then force these paranoid, negative interpretations of current events to become part of the public discussion. If I didn't raise them here, others would then think I was doing my own 'cover-up' of China's "real intentions."
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      New Agers on the same UFO forum then started saying they were having telepathic contact with the group mind of the microbes -- and said it was actually a positive thing to help us Ascend.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      More and more people have an intuitive 'knowing' that this is all working out -- so even crafty disinfo programs are not achieving their desired objective.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Nonetheless, there is a hard fight going on. When the forum leaks didn't catch on and get traction, the same point was apparently established much more prominently in 'The Event' -- complete with the missile launch added in.

                      I highly, highly doubt the ET allies of the Chinese want to terraform the Earth and take over. The whole concept that this would even be necessary is mythical once you understand that the human form is a Galactic design.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The vast majority of habitable worlds have the same atmospheric composition -- the same sort of microbes, plants, insects, birds, animals and fish, et cetera. It's a great design and it has gotten us a lot of mileage here in the Milky Way.

                     <p>
                      The high-level 'Management' ETs have set up and maintained a Galaxy-wide stargate network -- specifically to encourage peaceful exploration of these mutually compatible worlds, inhabited by human beings.

                     <p>
                      It is interesting to see two different sources -- the UFO forum insiders and "The Event" -- both trying to put the same 'spin' on these extremely significant current events, which the mass public may soon know are the handiwork of China.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I believe this is all part of a last-minute effort to make people fear China's plan -- knowing very well that it could go public soon.

                      In Part One, I also said China's move could very well have been the result of Divine timing -- coming at the last possible minute. The world's economy is under direct attack -- and this time the Powers that Were want to destroy everything.

                      In Part One I 'leaked' some of this new information -- namely that the Old World Order feels they have run out of time, and are trying to create a financial disaster that would lead to the deaths of 4.5 billion people.

                      As you can now find out from other sources already online, China's big counter-move against the Powers that Were began in October.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Packages that had been hand-delivered, by courier, in July were ordered to be opened on October 13th.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      These packages were given to every head of state of every country in the world. Little did they know they had just received a time bomb -- literally.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      They were all told if they tried to open them before the 13th, an explosive in the package would completely destroy everything within a six-mile radius.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I assume that if they tried to move them, this would also create the same problem. I can also assume that if they failed to open them within a fairly limited window of time after October 13th, the same disaster would occur.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      They could have abandoned their official buildings, and maybe some did -- but any such actions would arouse great suspicion.

                     <p>
                      This is why I described China's move as so skillfully and brilliantly crafted, and compared it to Sun Tzu's "The Art of War". They effectively scared the living crap out of leaders all over the world by doing this.

                      The clear message is "Stand down and let us get free energy out to the world. We want Disclosure, we want peace, we want an end to poverty and hunger and we want it now."

                      Before, during and especially after the time the packages were opened, when the Old World Order did not readily surrender, China engaged in a form of warfare we've never seen before on Earth -- at least never on this scale, with this many events in such a short time.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      China -- with a little help from their friends -- used EMP technology to disable a wide array of corporate and military assets held by the Old World Order.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I was the first person to tell Fulford about this, and he later got independent confirmation from his own insiders that I was right.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The proof is redunantly visible in the news headlines once you know what you're looking for.

                      I'm going to show you all the links to these stories so you can decide for yourself if there was, indeed, a highly bizarre number of 'random accidents' that all happened at the same time.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      China's message clearly was "You can't stop us. Stand down. Let us do this. Disclosure must be allowed to proceed. Otherwise we can completely shut down everything you've got."
                     </p>

                     <p>
                      Terrified leaders rushed over to China and literally begged them not to do this -- but they did not bend.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Everything I just told you appeared in these same online forums I've been mentioning. The only difference in what I heard was the genuine contents of the containers -- and what China's actual goal was.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I do not think so many specific details would have been given by the alleged insiders in these forums unless the people they work for expect it's all going to go public -- perhaps very soon.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I was shocked to see so many specifics -- but now that it's all out in the open, there's no harm in discussing it anymore.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Imagine what happens when any one of these leaders around the world decides to get the entire treasure trove of China documents into the hands of Julian Assange.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      As I said, Wikileaks may not be a "random burst of good luck" here -- it may all be part of the same, orchestrated plan.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You deliver the documents to world leaders, educate them, and also provide a mechanism that allows them to get those documents out into the mainstream -- without getting any one leader in trouble for having leaked them.

                      In the next update, hopefully in about a week, I will go through and carry excerpts and detailed analyses of each of these events. Fulford's disclosures about China being in touch with ETs since the 1940s will also be revealed.

                      So, in the meantime, here's a single, mass list of what our investigation has been able to find so far.

                     </div>
                     <div>
                      I can't guarantee that every single thing on this list was caused by China or her allies, but I got direct insider confirmation on many of them -- and the others fit an overall pattern, straining the idea of 'coincidence' way past the breaking point.

                      The Stuxnet virus, I was told, was designed by ETs and is much more sophisticated than we can do on our own. An article recently emerged that said the same thing.

                         They've also gone after Iran -- so this is not merely a campaign against Western nations. It's a campaign to stabilize the Earth and nullify negative and destructive influences.

                         There has been very little, if any loss of life caused by these events. They have the technology to kill large numbers of people -- obviously -- but that's not what we're seeing here.

                         Yes -- they did show they could threaten airplanes in flight -- but the planes were not actually damaged to the point where the passangers were harmed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         [Unfortunately, by my publicizing this, I am aware that other events may be created that will be blamed on China and will involve fatalities. That is part of why I waited so long -- I wanted enough time to pass so you could see the current trend.]

                         Also, notice how many of the equipment failures are of oil or nuclear power systems. The vast majority of these events have targeted the US, and the people making money from the sale of oil. This is a clear and consistent sign.

                         Nonetheless, this whole scenario raises a lot of problematic questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         One major concern -- first raised by my mother when I briefed her about this early along -- is that this obviously upsets the existing balance of power in the world. If this faction of Chinese does not have the best intentions, how would we be able to stop them?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         My dream data consistently has been saying this is a war between rivaling factions. No one is 100-percent 'good' or 100-percent 'evil.' The fight will look very intense, but the 'animals' I saw in one particular dream were going after each other -- leaving everyone else alone as they went at it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I wrote Part Two primarily to set the stage for this discussion so you would understand that there are positive beings, at a very highly evolved level, overseeing and managing what happens on Earth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Should China and her allies get too cocky, or try to abuse what they have been given, this newfound power can very easily and quickly be taken away from them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         However, by that point they will probably have so fundamentally altered the balance of power in the world that we can barely even imagine what that post-Disclosure, post-tyrannical civilization will actualy be like.

                         Another big question is this: If China has ET allies that could have ganged up on the Old World Order and stopped the madness at any time, then what the hell took them so long?

                        <p>
                         The answer is that they could
                         <strong>
                          not

                          at all

                         suggests that something monumental and totally shocking has happened:

                        <p>
                         Ultimately, that would not have happened unless the collective will of humanity has shifted towards the positive strongly enough that we are no longer

                         This 'invitation' involves a form of voting, on a collective level.

                         </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Each time we shame someone, manipulate them, control them, hurt them, defeat them, and then try to hide it all behind a cloak of secrecy, we are voting for the 'negative elite' to continue doing this to us on a planetary level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The more we 'vote' to be humble, listen to other people, consider other people's needs as well as our own, be flexible, be open to changing our minds, and treat others with love, compassion and forgiveness, the more the negative elite's grip is loosened.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Furthermore, as you see in the Law of One series, we have the added benefit of the "Law of Squares".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Each person consistently 'voting' for the positive will double the number of total 'votes'. It adds up very, very fast. One person counts as one, two counts as two, three counts as four, four counts as eight, five counts as sixteen, six counts as 32, seven counts as 64, et cetera.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         That means even seven people voting for the positive will have as much 'pull,' in Universal terms, as 64 people voting for the negative. The voting is rigged!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This is due to the fact that the One Infinite Creator itself is ultimately positive, in the sense that the negative has been fully integrated. The Creator has therefore biased Universal Law --
                         <strong>
                          THE RULES
                         </strong>
                         -- to favor the positive, while still preserving free will.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The highly-evolved 'Management' ETs -- or angelic beings, if you will -- are responsible for insuring that the events on our planet are a reflection of how far we have evolved in this progress towards love, acceptance and forgiveness -- which is our true Identity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         These 'Management' entities function at a much higher and more sophisticated level than ETs in UFOs. They actually represent entire planets of beings like us that have since evolved into a collective consciousness with a single identity.

                         In Part Two, I explained what
                         <strong>
                          THE RULES
                         </strong>
                         mean to the insider world. They have to work within these restrictions but do not know where they came from or why they exist. They are seen as unchanging natural laws.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I also gave you a comprehensive disclosure regarding the 'Quarantine' -- which is one working aspect of
                         <strong>
                          THE RULES.
                         </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The Quarantine is a seemingly-impenetrable shield that keeps ETs out and Earth humans in. There are, of course, many ETs who come and go anyway, but this traffic is much more limited than it would be without the Quarantine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Non-living debris, like meteors and asteroids, can get through. Non-living technology, that could be used to hurt us, would be identified and blocked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The Quarantine is far enough above the Earth's surface, in the Van Allen belts, that it does not disrupt our normal usage of satellites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         My contact Henry Deacon said all the missions that leave Earth orbit have required special technology to open a hole in the Quarantine -- and this is why all the lunar astronauts said their missions were followed by UFOs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         According to Deacon, those UFOs were our guys, making sure these astronauts would be safe as they crossed through the barrier.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The single most important guiding principle is that the ETs have never been allowed to interfere with Earth's history in any substantial way -- even when they did come and go through the Quarantine.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                         and always have been, for at least the last thousand years or more. There is remarkable similarity between what insiders told me and what was written about all this in the Law of One series.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Prior to the last thousand years, there are written records of open contact with ETs, as angels, 'Gods' or otherwise, and archeological sites to go along with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In the Law of One series it is explained that the Quarantine is a managed gateway into the Earth, and if a particular plan to help us is approved, then the visitation will be allowed to occur.

                        <p>

                         The insiders were led to believe the Old World Order could do whatever they wanted, collapse the world's economy, take over the financial system, set up a global dictatorship, whatever -- and no ETs would ever be allowed to do anything to stop them.

                        <p>
                         They were led to believe they had complete free will to do whatever the hell they wanted, with no interference, for millions of years to come. No one would ever come and do anything to stop them. Nothing whatsoever.

                         Therefore, this suggests that epic shifts have been made to systems that no one ever thought would change, or even

                         This article went up about 12:30 AM California time -- and Benjamin Fulford had not yet posted his update when I went to sleep.

                        <p>
                         However, when I got up just now I was blown away by what he said.

                         Ben defined who his insider group is in an earlier post:

                         the Black Dragon Society. This group is capable of mobilizing the British Empire, the Vatican, many of the oil producing states, at least half of the Pentagon, the Japanese military/police establishment and the over 50 million people studying martial arts worldwide

                         Some people have scoffed at this, but there have been many, many times where Ben's sources independently confirm what my own insider sources have told me -- before anyone else knows about it.

                        <p>
                         This week, Ben says his group was contacted by a man they're calling "Mr. X", who claimed to represent the Chinese government. Mr. X gave certain statements and documents showing that he did indeed have very high insider connections.

                         Mr. X was unable to answer any of the questions he was supposed to be able to confirm if he were a genuine representative of who he claimed to represent...
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                         He has been asked to arrange a meeting between a representative of the White and Black Dragon societies and Chinese President Hu Jintao. If he can manage this, it will be a good indicator he is a genuine high level Chinese government representative as he claims...

                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                         Despite the high level introduction, we have reason to suspect Mr. X may have been a representative of a Chinese faction that is working with Satanists -- although we hope to be proven wrong.

                         It seems clear that Mr. X is not who he claims to be, and Ben's people are correct in their suspicions. That's not the part that captured my attention. This, obviously, is what did (emphasis added):

                         The Chinese official, who we will call Mr. X, made many startling claims, some of which we can disclose but others we have promised to keep secret in order to protect the lives of key individuals.

                         I emphatically do not support Luciferianism. Furthermore, if we inaccurately label and categorize people, this does not help anyone -- particularly since everyone in this group was born into it, and would be hunted down and killed if they tried to leave.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         A variety of your favorite A-list actors are a part of this group. If you want blood, do you feel they should all be killed too? Think about it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         There are tremendous signs of a mass exodus away from this group that will happen once they get the chance. As our new allies, these people will be extremely beneficial and influential for humanity's collective future.

                        <p>
                         However, the mass public probably will not share my sentiment, hence these people are desperately trying to find sanctuary. Fulford has reported extensively on their ongoing effort to find a save haven here on Earth -- but no country will accept them.

                         In the most recent update, Mr. X is saying that some aspect of China may finally be working out an amnesty / protection deal for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Anyway, certain power brokers, trying to maintain the agenda of the Luciferian group, obviously want to make China's sudden, bold actions... including launching a missile in LA's backyard... appear to be utterly genocidal.

                         If you want to terraform the world and get rid of 70 percent of the people, and you have all the technology to start killing them now, then why not get down to business?

                         I had already strongly rejected the concept that these ETs allied with China are trying to terraform the Earth -- and said it was blatant disinformation.

                         Mere hours later, Ben then independently revealed his group was told the same thing about China's ET allies. Ben's group also rejected the whole idea as disinformation.

                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                         Hey Ben, Forum Members,
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         I am truly astonished by your latest post. I just put up my long-awaited "master list" of all the equipment failures that can be attributed to China through the use of EMP technology -- apparently with the help of their ET allies.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         Ben's sources have also told him China is doing this, and claimed it was done to a US aircraft carrier as well -- but there is no public record of that.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         Nonetheless I have 20 different examples -- any one of which is big news by itself. To see all this in just over two months' time is quite shocking:
                         <br/>
                         <br/>

                         </a>
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         However, the part I really find interesting is that I directly isolated and pinpointed a disinformation campaign to make China's actions appear to be negative.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         There has been disinfo on a major UFO discussion forum website -- unbeknownst to the people receiving it -- saying the Chinese created the BP oil spill to release an "intelligent, self-organizing" microbe into the Gulf.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         The purpose, we are told, was to terraform the Earth into something more habitable for these ETs allied with China.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         A very similar 'spin' can be found in the tenth episode of "The Event", which came out 20 days after the missile launch. Ben's sources have said China was behind this launch and they made it obvious -- such as by doing it on the three-year anniversary date of when they surprised the US with a nuclear sub.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         I believe this episode was rewritten at the last minute to 'spin' the China story. There is no absolute proof of this, but the cast admit they are not told anything about the story, or see any future scripts, until right before they shoot. And in this case the CG of the missile seems significantly lower in realism than could have been accomplished if they'd had more time.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         Anyway, the missile was launched by a negative ET faction who is now saying they want to colonize the Earth and take it over. So this TV show can be used to get people to think this is what China wants to do -- as they eventually hear about everything that's going on behind the scenes.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         Now we have a THIRD person attempting to pass the same disinformation along. So Ben, I would tell you not to be angry at this guy, as he's just doing his job, but I'd already written and posted my article identifying two other examples of this same disinfo before you posted yours.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         China is definitely not trying to make the world unlivable. Part of the ridiculousness of this story is the idea that some sort of ET technology is going to make all Asians able to survive through these climate changes but everyone else will die off.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         This is how the Old World Order thinks, but not the Chinese. Granted, there is a small clique that has seized power and runs things with oppressive force, but there is a huge gap between an over-protective, hyper-sensitive government and a desire to kill everyone on Earth but your own people.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         This is a fascinating and encouraging development and it's definitely going into my article as an update.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>
                         My interview with Ben will be released shortly -- and we may also want to do an update to cover all this new stuff. I also go into the Wikileaks situation and how it may have started as 'controlled opposition' from the insiders themselves, but has already turned into a nightmare for everyone struggling to maintain the old system.

                         At the time, officials announced the new bills would incorporate sophisticated high-tech security features, including a 3-D security strip and a color-shifting image of a bell designed to foil counterfeiters.

                          1.1 billion of the new bills have been printed, but they are unusable because of a creasing problem

                         in which paper folds over during production, revealing a blank unlinked portion of the bill face.

                         A second person familiar with the situation said that
                         <strong>
                          at the height of the problem, as many as 30 percent of the bills rolling off the printing press included the flaw, leading to the production shut down.

                          Officials dont know exactly what caused the problem. "There is something drastically wrong here,"

                         a person familiar with the situation said.

                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                         Because officials dont know how many of the 1.1 billion bills include the flaw, they have to hold them in the massive vaults until they are able to develop a mechanized system that can sort out the usable bills from the defects.

                         <strong>
                          Sorting such a huge quantity of bills by hand, the officials estimate, could take between 20 and 30 years.
                         </strong>
                         Using a mechanized system, they think they could sort the massive pile of bills, each of which features the familiar image of Benjamin Franklin on the face, in about one year.

                         The defective billswhich could number into the tens of millions, potentially representing billions of dollars in face valuewill have to be shredded. American taxpayers have already spent an enormous amount of money to print the bills...

                         <strong>
                          press release issued by the Federal Reserve on October 1
                         </strong>
                         that announced "a delay in the issue date" of the new bills and cited
                         <strong>
                          "a problem with sporadic creasing of the paper."

                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Realistically, there is no way to know if this is part of China's campaign, but the problem was not announced until October 1st -- right at the same time that the Stuxnet virus was reaching critical mass after several months of deployment. The Stuxnet articles I referenced you to had come out within 24 hours of this initial Federal Reserve notification.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This may also be a virus of some kind -- particularly since the Stuxnet virus was designed to affect the speed of a rolling part in Iran's reactor just enough to cause problems that were not immediately detectable, if you read the third link I gave you on that topic in the September section of the timeline.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I've heard from insiders that the Stuxnet virus uses exotic 'quantum' technology that allows it to be able to be updated once it's already in play. It sounded a little fishy to me but yet Dr. Robert Mueller did invent a technology that allows for quantum communication with existing computer circuitry -- so it may well be possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This dynamic updating could account for how weird and exotic this virus has been -- updating itself to the needs it faces, and realistically doing things no one ever thought it should do. There has been real alarm in the insider community over this virus.

                        <p>
                         I would put this one up as another possible contender for China's October Surprise.

                         The attempt to frame Assange is already going very badly. Every insider I've spoken to directly about this has now told me the documents from Wikileaks have created all sorts of problems.

                          STEEL-EATING MICROBES
                          <br/>
                         </strong>

                        <p>
                         Part of the reason why I always felt the "intelligent, self-organizing microbe" story was disinformation was that it seemed tangentially related to something I did hear about for some time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Specifically, there has been great concern within the insider world about a microbe that can eat its way through steel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The Gulf Stream has been carrying this microbe up into the Northern European coast. Apparently it's been causing all sorts of problems -- eating through the hulls of ships, et cetera.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Apparently some strains of this microbe actually take certain metals and transform them into gold. Supposedly there were cannonballs found on the Gulf seafloor that were solid gold -- though I've never been able to find anything to back this up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It does appear that this microbe breeds in the hot areas below the crust -- and the BP oil spill did release a lot more of it than was already there. I've heard that part of what this might do is create more gold that can then be collected and used.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I also heard the whole seafloor around that area was buckling up and cracking, and part of why the oil spill was created was to release the pressure. There were fears that a far more catastrophic explosion of the seafloor would occur otherwise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I was quite shocked today to see all this talk of steel-eating microbes suddenly make it into the mainstream media. The timing of this announcement may be to further support the disinformation that this is an "intelligent, self-organizing microbe" transforming the Earth to be habitable for ETs:

                         Microorganisms collected from a "rusticle"  a structure that looks like an icicle but consists of rust  are slowly destroying the iron hull of the liner on the seabed 3.8km (2.36 miles) below the Atlantic waves where it plummeted, killing 1,517 people, in April 1912.

                         The newly identified species, while potentially dangerous to vital underwater installations such as offshore oil and gas pipelines, could also offer a new way to recycle iron from old ships and marine structures, according to the researchers from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, and Seville University in Spain.

                         on Wednesday. When the researchers tested its rusting ability in the lab, they found that it was able to adhere to steel surfaces, creating knob-like mounds of corrosion products.

                         A similar process is thought to be responsible for the formation of the rusticles on the hull of the Titanic. They appear to be solid structures but are highly porous and support a complex variety of bacteria, suggesting that

                         I know. I was there. I learned about all this conspiracy stuff in a remarkable college class I took in 1992, which hid behind the boring-sounding title "Contemporary Social Issues."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         For me there was no turning back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         When I graduated in 1995 I did not want to get a job. At all. I knew who was behind the scenes and what their goals were. I did not want to feed the Beast.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         My mother kicked me out of her house that same summer after graduation, and at first I utterly despised her for it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I felt she had become Pure Evil for not letting me live indefinitely with her and have her take care of almost all the bills, except for the 200 dollars a month she was asking me for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Now I understand -- and am grateful for her giving me my freedom. I can barely even imagine living with my parents as an adult... because you don't feel like an adult at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Nonetheless, at the time it was the most powerful journey into fear I had ever experienced in my life.

                         Sure enough, I did find a way to make it work -- a cheap room in a share house, and a job delivering pizzas. I quickly tried to find something better. Jobs wouldn't work out and I'd find myself unemployed, having bills to pay, and needing money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         There could be no greater humiliation than to sit there under cold, craven fluorescent lights and again wrestle with the dreaded "Prior Work History" section of a job application. All those painful memories would have to be dredged up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I always seemed to forget the names, addresses and telephone numbers of former "$#!+ jobs," and had to struggle to remember it all again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         At home, I invariably found ways to blow off making any calls until 4:30, knowing everything closes at 5. Then at 5:01, I suddenly felt a million times better until I had to wake up the next day -- late -- and start all over again.

                         During one particularly rough period of my life after I had become self-employed, I started reading powerful material that revealed just how abusive life really is for a person born into the Illuminati.

                        <p>
                         I felt like the whole world was falling in on me and I became too depressed to work. Everything I saw, everything I thought, everything I felt seemed to be crawling with darkness.

                        <p>
                         During this time, I had someone reliably sending me 500 bucks a month to keep me on life support -- and that situation ended up turning out very badly.

                         In the case I am referring to, this friend from another state finally wanted to "call in the favor" he had been building me up to after well over a year's time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This happened while I was staying as a guest at his house, trying to get work done. He told me I could visit him there if I wanted to. Things were going very badly with my girlfriend at the time, so it seemed like a good option.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I was utterly stunned when he sat me down one morning and completely eviscerated me for 20 minutes -- with no prior warning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         He strung together every single negative thing he had ever observed in me, at relentless speed, with a savagely sarcastic smile on his face the entire time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Up until this moment, he had always been 100-percent loving and supportive -- like a truly benevolent father figure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Now he was dumping this load of shame and hate on me that was so complex, so unfair, so one-sided and negative that I knew he would accept nothing less than utter and complete submission to his will.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Right then I realized why I'd had so many inexplicable visions of him screaming at me in my mind -- even though he never raised his voice as he committed the most savage verbal assault I'd ever experienced from anyone in my life.

                         I honestly did not see this coming. I was horrified. Humiliated. Financially it traumatized me. At least he let me keep the car he had given me when I immediately packed up my stuff and fled his house after this happened.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I ended up going back to work doing readings for others. This occurred within the timeframe of 1998 to 2005, while I did this as a business -- but at the time, my own overwhelming emotional and personal issues had made it almost impossible to work.

                         However, when someone uses money to try to mess with your life like this, it's much easier to dump all this shame onto the 'Illuminati', and blame them for your predicament, than to see how you could have chosen freedom instead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         A job is an opportunity to provide a needed service that helps people and makes money at the same time. 'Society' is not evil. You are 'society' too. Everyone needs things to live, and everyone needs to make a living.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                         In my own journey, 1996 was the year I finally broke through. I got major signals that ETs wanted to contact me in 1995, and even more signals beginning in January 1996.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                         What finally put me over the top was when I decided to take a "$#!+ job", rather than continue to try to bum money off of my parents, grandparents and friends to stay alive. Asking others for money is a very good way to become "damaged goods" and lose all your friends.

                         The very day I pulled into the parking lot to do that job interview, I had a bank of four 8's on my car odometer -- down to one tenth of a mile. It was incredible!

                        <p>
                         Just two days after I "sucked it up" and said yes, I had the epic call with Joe Mason that changed everything I'd ever known, felt and believed in my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In that call, he gave me all the information I needed to do the Dream Voice practice -- which is all featured in one section of
                         <a>
                          Access Your Higher Self
                         </a>
                         -- and the very next day I woke up and started getting clear, audible messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Later, the guidance clearly explained to me that personal responsibility is very, very important. Until I was willing to take care of myself, and not expect others to support me, I would not be allowed to access my Higher Self.

                        <p>
                         It was a lesson that has always stayed with me. Yet, if you're addicted to 'fear porn,' it can be very, very difficult to see the idea of taking a job as a good thing.

                         I refer to the typical conspiracy media news article as 'fear porn' because it does create a sudden, massive stimulation to the nervous system -- and has the same addictive and negative qualities as pornography.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I know about 15 different insiders. Greer knows nearly 600 -- who are ready to come forward and testify before Congress if subpoenaed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You can attend my Sunday by itself for less money, or pay a package price to see the whole weekend. All these details should be available on their

                         Again, thank you for your support. Let's raise a glass and toast to the Disclosure now in progress!

                         I forgot to mention that I'm also going to have a telephone conference with Project Camelot about Disclosure, featuring Richard C. Hoagland, on Sunday, December 19th.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Hoagland is always a fascinating character and I've wished for a long time that you could listen in on one of our conversations where we share information with each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         He has some fascinating perspectives on "The Event" and is in touch with other insiders who I don't get to speak with personally. Things are really heating up around this issue and we're saving the best of our discussions for the live chat!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Bill and Kerry will both be on the line and I expect it will be a provocative discussion! We're scheduling three hours but it may go on even longer than that!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You can be part of the action for significantly less than the video conference cost, at 39 dollars (19.5 x 2, of course!) for the live event. I believe we're going to offer a post-conference stream as well.

                         I also am doing a free radio show on Myth or Logic Radio this Wednesday with Tom Murasso. Part of why I continue to work with him is he is a great host -- understanding the value of letting the guest speak, coming up with thoughtful questions and feedback when appropriate, and energetically holding space for the words to come through.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You can listen in for the live show or access the free MP3 archive after it's over. The time will be this Wednesday at 2PM Eastern, 11AM Pacific:

                               Rogue states and terror groups could launch nuclear attacks in space to cripple Britains electronic networks and jeopardise national security, a report warns today.

                               Weapons detonated up to 500 miles above the Earth would generate a massive electromagnetic pulse, knocking out satellites, radar and the National Grid with devastating results.

                               Key military installations, transport systems, power and water supplies would be hit, wreaking havoc, claims the Commons Defence Select Committee.

                             Thank you David, for all the information I got from you for the past 4 years.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             I haven't thought about balance, that I have to give back energy in return for what I received. This is the first time I heard you ask for payment.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             My first reaction was to "opt out" and just listen to the free information you put out there.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             But what I didn't realize immediately was that this is a wonderful opportunity for me to give back, take responsibility for what you're wonderfully doing for me, that is helping me do what I don't have much time or opportunity to do for myself: research and connecting the dots of not just knowledge but enlightenment.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             THANK YOU!
                             <br/>

                             *Sigh* The "ETs" don't make "The Rules". They have to follow "The Rules". They just get so wrapped up in protocol, that "The Rules" had to be changed, for them to be able to preserve "free will".

                             It's a wonder they get anything done at all. Also, they're not the only ones out there. There's various other factions, and I don't believe "management" is the right term.

                             At least, by calling them that you give them that kind of power and become completely  reliant on them. Remember to be self-sufficient

                             <br/>
                             It all boils down your own perception of "good and evil", where in reality there is no such thing. Each of us has the equal ability to get out there and make a big change.

                             It's all coming together, seemingly. But my heart goes out to all the suicides in India due to Monsanto etc.

                             Oh yes, higher selves. I'm sure some here are aware of the mystery schools that claim only half the planet's population has higher selves.

                             US town puzzled as 1000 birds drop dead
                             <br/>
                             Sunday, January 02, 2011  07:45pm
                             <br/>
                             Wildlife officials are trying to determine what caused more than 1000 black birds to die and fall from the sky over an Arkansas town.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said on Saturday that it began receiving reports about the dead birds about 11:30pm the previous night.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             The birds fell over a 2-kilometre area, and an aerial survey indicated that no other dead birds were found outside of that area.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Commission ornithologist Karen Rowe said the birds showed physical trauma, and she speculated that 'the flock could have been hit by lightning or high-altitude hail'.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             The commission said that New Year's Eve revellers shooting off fireworks in the area could have startled the birds from their roost and caused them to die from stress.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Robby King, a wildlife officer for the agency, collected about 65 dead birds, which will be sent for testing to the state Livestock and Poultry Commission lab and the National Wildlife Health Center lab in Wisconsin.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             Rowe said that similar events have occurred elsewhere and that test results 'usually were inconclusive'.
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             She said she doubted the birds were poisoned.

                             what about the police. they get paid to enforce rules that are made for everything but to protect common people.
                             <br/>
                             should they continue to perform such a "job" for what?  to keep on carrying weapons and then remain that primitive?
                             <br/>
                             or because they would do it anyway, since they choosed that "job" first. it really puzzles me.

                             I really believe that 12/21/2012 is the wrong date.  I believe it has already happened 12/21/2010.

                             The Mayan calendar does not use the same system that we have today.  It also coincides with the total eclipse of the moon AND on Winter Solstice.

                             I thought you'd enjoy this version of the Russian sub-hunter planes 'snooping' on naval exercises btwn US and Japan.  Data, views and perspectives laid out by both articles are informative.  Don't you think?
                             <br/>
                             <br/>
                             "Over the last month, Russian and Japanese politicians have made dueling visits to islands claimed by both countries. Russias interruption of the exercise was likely intended as a reminder that it still feels a bit strongly about its claims to the disputed islands."

                             At the risk of being considered one of those who post in a negative way, how on earth can it be credible that China is going to come to the rescue and clear away the dark ones, when China itself is a country known for brutal oppression.  If China can't clean up its own backyard, how is it going to clean up the rest of the world, and why should anyone with a modicum of common sense believe this?

And this is an issue on your planet now that has to do with exchange of information and the idea of connection to money.  Many people on your planet are going through transformations having to do with the concept of information.

                             Many people on your planet are hungry for information.  There have been expressions on your planet that all information ought to be free.  The great secret is that all information is already free.

                             As we have said, information, like fruit, is already free if YOU pluck it directly from the tree.  But, if you ask another to perform the service of plucking it for you, there is nothing negative about those individuals asking for the idea of money in exchange for the service.  Money is not evil...

                        Is there a "consciousness field" of "radiant mind energy" that we all share? Could this be causing the changes we are now witnessing on the Earth and throughout the solar system? Does it have any effect on DNA, including complete species transformation?
