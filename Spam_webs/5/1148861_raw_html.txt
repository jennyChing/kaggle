   Although the ancient astronomers could determine the positions and
brightness of stars, they had no understanding of what stars were.  This is
because they lacked a framework of physics in which to understand how
stars worked.  They lacked what we call today modern physics.  Physics
includes a wide variety of fields that are used to understand the origin
and evolution of stars, mechanics, thermodynamics, light, matter, energy
and the forces of Nature.  The first physical laws dealt with motion,
which we call classical mechanics.

Plato, Aristotle's hand level to the Earth symbolizing his realism view of
Nature; Plato's hand pointed towards the heaven symbolizing the mystical
nature to his view of the Universe. This image symbols the sharp change in the
meaning of how `natural philosophy' or physics will be done for the 2,200 years.

   <a href="../../glossary/aristotle.html">
    Aristotle
   </a>
   stands in the
Greek philosophical tradition which asserts that nature is
understandable. This tradition, opposed to the idea that nature is
under the control of capricious deities which are to be appeased
rather than understood, is one of the roots of science.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aristotle constructed his view of the Universe based on a intuitive
felling of holistic harmony. Central to this philosophy was the
concept of teleology or final causation. He supposed that individual
objects (e.g. a falling rock) and systems (e.g. the motion of the
planets) subordinate their behavior to an overall plan or destiny.
This was especially apparent in living systems where the component
parts function in a cooperative way to achieve a final purpose or end
product.

  <p>
   Aristotle also provides a good example of the way in which what one
knows or believes influences the way one understands new information.
His theory of motion flows from his understanding of matter as
constituted of four elements: air, earth, fire, and water.  Each element exists in its own
sphere around the Earth. Objects,
being solid like earth, would tend to clump together with other
solids (earth), so objects tend to fall to earth, their natural
place. Thus, falling is a natural motion.  Hot objects, like a hot air balloon, would rise
towards its sphere of Fire.

   Think of a spear being thrown. At first, it is not in motion, but
then the thrower's arm provides an impetus which accelerates it (our
vocabulary, not Aristotle's). But then, what
keeps it going after it leaves the thrower's hand? It should fall to
earth immediately since there's nothing obvious pushing it!
  </p>
  <p>
   Aristotle's answer was that as the spear flies through the air, it
leaves a vacuum behind it. Air rushing in pushes the spear forward
until its natural motion (falling) eventually brings it to earth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aristotle also thought about the causes which start things moving. In
the spear scenario, it's easy to say that the thrower's arm moves the
spear, but what moves the thrower's arm?  Aristotle said that another
motion moved the arm (muscle contraction?) but he also realized that
some earlier motion must cause the muscle to contract and that
earlier motion must also have its own initiator.
  </p>
  <p>
   To avoid the idea that there is an infinite chain of causes, Aristotle
argued that there must be an "unmoved mover," something which can initiate
motion without itself being set in motion. This view was preserved by
medieval Church during the Dark Ages and became the ruling paradigm.

    Galileo's laws of Motion
   </u>
   :
  </p>
  <p>
   Aside from his numerous inventions,
   <a href="../../glossary/galileo.html">
    Galileo
   </a>
   also laid down the first
accurate laws of motion for masses since the time of Aristotle.  Galileo
realized that all bodies accelerate at the same rate regardless of their
size or mass.  Everyday experience (as stated by Aristotle) tells you
differently because a feather falls slower than a cannonball.  Galileo's
genius lay in spotting that the differences that occur in the everyday
world are in incidental complication (in this case, air friction) and are
irrelevant to the real underlying properties (that is, gravity).  He was
able to abstract from the complexity of real-life situations the
simplicity of an idealized law of gravity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Key among his investigations are:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    developed the concept of motion in terms of
    <a href="../../glossary/velocity.html">
     velocity
    </a>
    (speed
and direction) through the use of inclined planes.
   </li>
   <li>
    developed the idea of
    <a href="../../glossary/force.html">
     force
    </a>
    , as a cause for motion.
   </li>
   <li>
    determined that the natural state of an object is rest or uniform
motion, i.e. objects always have a velocity, sometimes that velocity has
a magnitude of zero = rest.
   </li>
   <li>
    objects resist change in motion, which is called
    <a href="../../glossary/inertia.html">
     inertia
    </a>
    .
   </li>
  </ul>
  Galileo also showed that objects fall with the same speed regardless of
their mass.  The fact that a feather falls slowly than a steel ball is
due to amount of air resistance that a feather experiences versus
the steel ball (very little).

   The current understanding of the motion of objects, both macroscopic (such
as stars and planets) and microscopic (such as atoms) was developed by
Isaac Newton over 300 years ago.
   <a href="../../glossary/newton.html">
    Newton

   defined the relationship of

  </ul>
  <p>
   With respect to the energy of motion we follow

    momentum
   </a>
   .  A quantity that is used to
describe the energy of motion and is expressed as the mass of an object times its
velocity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Newton also found that there is a law of the conservation of momentum
that states the total momentum of a system is conserved.  In other
words, the sum of the momentum before must equal the sum of the
momentums afterword.  Conservation laws are extremely powerful in physics since
they allow one to derive the future from the present conditions.

   can not be created or destroyed,
only transfered from place to place.  Energy is defined to be force times
distance and is expressed in units of ergs (grams centimeter per second).
  </p>
  <p>
   <a href="../../glossary/huygens.html">
    Huygens
   </a>
   (1650's) was the first to develop
the terminology, stating that:

  <ul>
   <li>
    energy is not like matter
   </li>
   <li>
    energy does not have size, shape or occupy space
   </li>
   <li>
    energy does not have inertia
   </li>

  Instead, it was defined that energy is a measure of the ability of a
physical system to perform work (i.e. to change the system) and is
measured in ergs.
  <p>

  <center>
   <img src="../../images/work_temp.gif"/>
   <p>

  The law of the conservation of energy means that energy can neither
be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.
  <p>
   Normally, we speak of the energy of motion, called
   <a href="../../glossary/energy.html">
    kinetic energy
   </a>
   , or stored energy, called
   <a href="../../glossary/energy.html">
    potential energy
   </a>
   .
Potential energy as stored
energy, for example as spring, also has a source from the gravitational field
of a star or planet.  A hammer held above the ground has the potential energy
associated with its distance from the ground.  This energy is released into
kinetic energy when the hammer is dropped.
  </p>
  <p>
   Energy also exists in chemical, nuclear, and electrical form.  But these are
mostly variations on kinetic and potential energies.  For example, a chemical
explosive is in potential form until the fuse is lite, then it converts to
kinetic (the explosion).  Electrical energy is the kinetic energy of the
electrons in the wire.

   performed
early experiments of shooting alpha particles (helium nuclei) at sheets of gold

   The quantized orbits of the electrons allows for a simple explanation
of the origin of photons, and the spectrum of light.  Photons are
produced by the transition of electrons downward in their orbits.  A
downward transition releases potential energy in the form of a light
particle, a photon (as seen in an emission line).  Likewise, photons
could be absorbed by electrons (causing an absorption feature), and
they move upward in their orbits.

   Modern physics speaks of fundamental building blocks of Nature, where
fundamental takes on a reductionist meaning of simple and
structureless.  Many of the particles we have discussed so far appear
simple in their properties.  All electrons have the exact same
characteristics (mass, charge, etc.), so is an electron fundamental
because they are all non-unique.

  </p>
  <p>
   The study of particles begins with the search for the primary
constituent. More than 200 subatomic particles have been discovered so
far, however most are not fundamental, most are composed of other,
simpler particles.  For example, Rutherford showed that the atom was
composed of a nucleus and orbiting electrons.  Later physicists showed
that the nucleus was composed of neutrons and protons. More recent work
has shown that protons and neutrons are composed of quarks.

Baryons are made of three quarks and are found everywhere, they are
the protons and neutrons of atomic nuclei (and also anti-protons and
anti-neutrons).  Mesons, made of quark pairs, are usually found in
cosmic rays.  Notice that a rule for quark combinations is that the sum
of the charges must be an integer; -1, 0, or +1. We do not see
fractional charges in Nature, thus there are no free quarks, they are
only found in pairs or triplets.

  Thus, our current understanding of the structure of the atom is such
that the atom contains a nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively
charged electrons bound to the nucleus by electromagnetic forces.
The nucleus is composed of neutral neutrons and positively charged
protons bound together by the strong nuclear force.  The protons and
neutrons are composed of up and down quarks whose fractional charges
(2/3 and -1/3) which combine to produce the 0 or +1 charge of the
proton and neutron.
