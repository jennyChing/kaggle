            This week's
            <em>
             New England Journal of Medicine
            </em>
            has a landmark paper from a group of obesity researchers in Melbourne. It shows for the first time just why losing weight is the easy bit, while maintaining weight loss can be a nightmare. Joe Proietto is Professor of Medicine at the University of Melbourne and the Austin Hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            I've been treating obesity for some 15 years and what I've noticed is that it is such a hard battle for people to maintain weight loss. We have a very high failure rate if you look at them a few years down the track. It never made sense to me that it was just a simple going back to old habits because these people are very motivated. No one wants to be obese, so we decided to look at the various hormones that had been discovered over the years that can control hunger because it has already been shown that following weight loss leptin levels fall and another group has shown that ghrelin levels rise. Ghrelin is the hormone that makes us hungry. It goes up after weight loss.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            And leptin is the satiety hormone, it makes you feel satisfied.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Yes, it's an appetite suppressing hormone. What the science had shown was that we have something like nine different hormones in the blood that can influence hunger and out of these only ghrelin seems to be appetite stimulating. The others which include cholecystokinin from the upper gut, PYY, GLP1 or glucagon-like peptide-1, and oxyntomodulin from the lower gut, leptin from fat and then insulin, amylin and pancreatic polypeptide from the pancreas.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            This is like an alphabet soup of names. Essentially what you're describing is a set of hormones that are produced in our gut from the mouth through to the large bowel and the organs that hang off that so unsurprisingly our appetite in one way or another is controlled by chemical messengers that come from our intestines.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Not surprising at all because it's telling the brain that we've eaten and there's no need to go and look for food you've already got some here sort of thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            So tell me what you did in this study?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Well in this study we took 50 obese volunteers and the average body mass index was 34 so these were mildly obese people and we helped them lose weight using a very low energy diet and they lost about 13 kilograms over a ten week period. Prior to weight loss, immediately after the weight loss and again a year later we did a breakfast study where we took blood to measure most of these hormones before breakfast and then every half hour for the next four hours after breakfast.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            What did you find?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            What we found was that following weight loss ghrelin levels increased, confirming what had been shown before. The leptin decreased, again confirming what had been shown before but we also found that PYY decreased, CCK decreased, insulin decreased, amylin decreased.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            So this is basically, just to go back over what we said a moment ago, these are basically all the hormones that in one way or another help us to feel full and tell the brain we don't need to eat anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Correct. Except for ghrelin, which tells us to go and eat.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            Yes.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            So the ghrelin went up but the others went down, so this is a co-ordinated change.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            Which is not a surprise for anybody who's on a diet, because they feel hungry for quite some time. What happened after a year?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Well after a year these subjects had regained about 5 kilograms and the hormones were still changed essentially. The only one that seemed to be heading towards base line was the ghrelin, but the other hormones were still changed and that's the point of the paper, that is the main point of the paper that we showed that these changes are persisting even a year later.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            So in a sense all credit to them for persisting with the weight loss because their biology was fighting against them?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Correct and these people struggle and struggle and most of them as I said are motivated not to regain, nobody wants to be fat and they struggled and by 5 years most people had regained all the weight. And I think the reason is because it grinds them down, eventually it gets to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            It's almost as if the body was trying to force you back to that previous weight. What's going on here, are we talking about years of obesity, locking in a certain chemical messenger, hormone profile in our bodies? Or this is genetic, what's the story here?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Well my view is that what this shows is further evidence for a set point for a genetically determined set point. Now in some people this is genetics in the classical sense with mutations in genes etc. But in other people, and perhaps the majority the genetic change is actually an epigenetic change.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            In other words our lifestyle has changed our genes?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Correct, the expression of our genes, not the sequence of the genes.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            So like it's turned up the volume switch on your television set?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Correct, it's turned up the volume or turned down the volume depending on which hormone it is that has then reset the set point higher. And so the body then - its job is to defend that new set point.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            So we've got to a level of fat and the body wants to return to it and it may be locked in genetically in a sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Yes.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            So what insight does this give you to solving this problem? I mean the first question I'd ask is do you get a different effect in terms of weight loss? You're saying there's a set point. Do we know how long it takes for the set point to actually develop? I've been obese for a year, or I've been over a BMI of 30 for ten years?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Look we don't really know. We know that the set point can be altered through life, there could be other mechanisms for resetting the set point including stress for example, including what we feed our children.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            And is there any evidence that eventually if you keep up your low energy diet and high exercise that you can reset your set point eventually?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            That would be wonderful if we could but there is not a lot of evidence for that and let me tell you what the evidence is that you don't. The first one is in the old days they used to do gastric stapling but eventually the staples came off, most of those people even though they kept weight off for some years regained the weight. There was a study in which they used the Fen-Phen combination which turned out to be problematic.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            This was the diet drug which caused heart valve problems?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Yes, but before they knew that they did a study where these people were on it for I think five years, as soon as they stopped the drug most of them regained all the weight. Now that's with pharmacotherapy and surgery, can you reset the set point if you do 5 years of vigorous exercise, dieting etc? We don't know the answer to that.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            And given that you're describing I don't know how many hormones there are here 7, 8, 9, 10 hormones that you measured over this period of a time, given that they're all involved in this process it doesn't look as if a weight loss drug is on the horizon really.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Well no, I think if we can combine two or three of them I think we would have a good chance of adequate appetite suppression and at the moment there are trials in the US of the combination of leptin and amylin and there are trials of the replacement of GLP1, glucagon-like peptide-1 for appetite suppression. So in the future I'm hopeful that two or three combinations of these hormones will control the hunger.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            And watch what you give your children because the set point is going to live with them for the rest of their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Well, let me tell you about a model that we set up in rodents where we can induce obesity with a high energy diet that is then defended.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Norman Swan:
            </strong>
            Defended?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Joe Proietto:
            </strong>
            Defended in the sense that once the animals become obese and we then put them on a diet and get them to lose weight and then expose them just to a healthy diet they overeat the healthy diet and become fat again. So what we feed our children resetting the set point. I think what the study shows is that first of all we need to switch the emphasis in obesity management from losing the weight to maintaining the weight because losing the weight is relatively easy compared to maintaining it. And the other thing this shows because it's the long term persistence of these changes that we published it shows that any agents that we develop have to be trialled to ensure that they are safe when used long term because they are going to have to be used long term.

             Why do scientists, who are given the opportunity to do wonderful research, waste it on examining defencless animals, which have nothing do do with how humans behave and operate? Why would a rat,who was put on a high calorie diet and then reduced to a more appropriately nutritonally balance diet behave the same as a human? 'The rats went into defending behaviour', or what ever the phraseology was. Surely, we know by now,how much the psycology of the human mind effects the way our bodies perfrom? (the plasticity of the mind - the relationship between each cell and our mind, is this not the territory for research??? Leave the defensless animals alone!!!!! Concentrate on how as humans 'we' 'wish' to live. That is,the ability, to move and enoy our minds and bodies to their full potential.The 'privilaged' of our planet (those with access to food), become obsessed with rich and unhealthy foods because there is something missing or inappropriate in their lives and food is often 'used' to satisfy misdirected urges.  The processed/junk food, which is so readily accessible and generally the cheapest option, does nothing for us to create a healthy life style.  Bring back the Common (you know that piece of natural habitat),where  burgeoning trees and bushes with juicy berries and nuts exploading with flavour,can abound.  At all costs discount gentic engineering!! Direct the planet's resources in creating a holistic lifestyle for all. Stop marginalising the poor and creating deep pockets for the privilaged few, to appropriate and exploite the planet to their own gains/ends.  Good nutrition and a healthy and happy lifestyle could be available to all,and arguably can be everybody's 'birth righ't.... We have the 'science'...... - if we allow it..... - and it isn't rocket!!... Just a bit of tweaking of Capitalism.....

                I will only address why scientists use animals as test subjects, but not the rest of you post because it is unrelated to the topic and directed towards no person or entity hence serves no purpose except your own self-satisfaction.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Animals are chosen because:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                1. they are cheap and plentiful so you can use many to get an accurate and reproducible result.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                2. they are fast to test, see and measure effects, dissect out mechanisms and thoroughly investigate.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                3. you can control all other variables involved so specific mechanisms can be isolated.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                4. selecting an appropriate model can enable you to make implications about what may happen in humans, so effects can be translated into human interventions ie. drugs, without carelessly putting human lives at risk. This is why clinical trials must show above all else safety first. Humans are prioritised over test animals although they are still subject to ethical procedures. This is strictly and directly regulated by independent bodies and indirectly or in broader terms by public sentiment.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I encourage you to read primary research articles and hopefully you will appreciate what animal testing has already and continues to provide to you and to the ones you care about, and to our race as a whole. (look at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)

             "Joe Proietto: Well in this study we took 50 obese volunteers and the average body mass index was 34 so these were mildly obese people and we helped them lose weight using a very low energy diet and they lost about 13 kilograms over a ten week period. Prior to weight loss, immediately after the weight loss and again a year later we did a breakfast study where we took blood to measure most of these hormones before breakfast and then every half hour for the next four hours after breakfast."

             Obviously this would depend on WHAT the participants had for breakfast.  If they had a fat and protein rich breakfast - ie plenty of bacon and eggs cooked with fats, the results would have been quite different to those eating the usual carb + sugar loaded breakfast of cereal and toast which sends the insulin levels into the stratosphere.  Was this ever tested?  If not, why not?

                In this study, the breakfast was standardised for all participants. To quote from the original paper:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                "Testing was performed after an overnight fast at baseline (week 0), week 10, and week 62... A standardized breakfast was then provided, which consisted of a boiled egg, toast, margarine, orange juice, cereal biscuits (Weet-Bix, Sanitarium), and whole milk. This meal contained 2.3 MJ (550 kcal), with approximately 51% of the energy from carbohydrate, 33% from fat, and 16% from protein."

             Having become a compulsive eater at boarding school and always being a slightly overweight child and young adult despite exercise I finally decided to eat nothing other than a good diet to get and remain slim forever.  I did that from my thirties for four to five years and thereafter suddenly found that my compulsive eating scourge was gone so I considered when I listened to your program that I must have reprogrammed my hormones and now at 65 and still slim I can confirm that this is possible with willpower at the beginning for long enough.

             I think reasons for being overweight can be sourced largely to feeling that one must adhere to social food customs. I have been various degrees overweight since puberty and especially after pregnancies. In my late 60s I have taken off about 20K in about two or three years. I finally realised that those (hitherto unknown) hormones  stayed quiescent until I ate breakfast. After breakfast I wasn't hungry so much as constantly thinking about food. So now I have only tea/coffee/juice etc and yogurt concoction for lunch. This makes me a social oddity but is essential. The rest of the day is pretty normal but I never feel like eating anything like as much as I used to. I prefer more vegies and less meat and carbs. I feel extremely well and will not be putting the weight back on.

                Further to my (Christine) comment...I need to add (1) the hormones are "quiescent" after overnight sleep. A solid breakfast wakes them up! This might not be the same for everyone. (2) My lunch is a CEREAL and yogurt concoction, all unprocessed. Tastes great. My point is I think I have found a way to quell that hormone that keeps you thinking about eating. This feeling was attrbuted to Insulin Resistance but maybe it's something else. Finally, my observation is that the hunger you feel when you really need food is completely different
                <br/>
                from the aroused appetite you feel when you can't stop thinking about food!

                Christine said: "After breakfast I wasn't hungry so much as constantly thinking about food." Exactly my response too--it's as if breakfast INFLAMES my appetite, and I just keep snacking for a couple of hours after a physically filling meal. (My stomach is in fact overfull.) The key trigger for me is bread (toast in the morning) or in fact anything starchy, which I crave but which sets off that eat/eat/eat response (or incessant thinking about food if I try to not respond to the impulse to eat). Then I get groggy and want to nap. Then, when that passes, I start thinking about my next meal, truly a vicious circle! Now if I have breakfast I keep it low-carb (specifically, wheat-free) but even better if I skip breakfast altogether. This goes against all the conventional wisdom, but the conventional wisdom doesn't work for me. Definitely one size does not fit all!

             I wonder what would happen if the researchers said to the obese patients ok you can eat as much fat as you want and as much energy as you want, in the style of Mediterranean diet, as long as you dont eat more than 30grams of carbohydrate. They would get fat &amp; sick, right?
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Oh, how about that. It has already been done. Google "Spanish Ketogenic Mediterranean diet: a healthy cardiovascular diet for weight loss"
             <br/>
             <br/>
             The results were beyond belief.

             I find these sorts of studies fascinating. It goes to show how little we still understand about the mechanisms of weight loss &amp; weight gain, and how much more complex it all is than originally thought.
