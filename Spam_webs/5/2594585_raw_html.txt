          Probably due to cultural and biological
    factors, verbally abusive people tend to be male, though there are plenty of abusive women
    out there as well. These people are often hard to spot in therapy - even when they are
    dragged into treatment by a spouse or partner.They are likeable and present
    themselves well. They will also offer plausible explanations to counter their spouse's
    seemingly irrational complaints against them.

           Appearances
    aside, the verbally abusive individual is broken internally. The identity they present to
    the world, and often to themselves, is a facade. Abusers tend to have little or no clue
    that they have a problem. Although they may admit to occasionally losing their cool or
    getting loud, they are very, very good at defending their misbehavior and adept at
    pointing out how they were provoked to behave in an angry way. For example, when Dana
    confronted Bob* about ignoring the family and angrily snapping at her, Bob calmly let me
    know that Dana was right: he locked himself up in the study trying to figure out how he
    would pay her excessive bills. The poor fellow would rather agonize over how to afford
    Dana's spending than deny her--despite the family's financial crisis. Unable to contain
    herself, Dana exploded into a loud defense of how her self-esteem depended on coifed hair
    and manicured nails. On the surface, Dana appeared to be the errant, spendthrift wife.
    Bob, the devoted husband, was right!

         <p>
          <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
           What is wrong is that verbal abusers are "always
    right!" The pattern is typical: abusers justify their displays of anger or
    disrespect by blaming the partner. The spouse, usually over-responsible, emotional,
    andcodependent, has, in fact, acted out--and is likely to concede. In this case, Danas
    defense appears frivolous and disrespectful of Bob. She appears to be the verbal abuser!
    Bob's emotional and verbal abuse becomes lost in the process and is somehow excused or
    forgiven. Dana, ashamed of her outburst, may, in fact, believe that if Bob is truly
    "verbally abusive," then so is she.

           It is easy to miss or misinterpret the abusive partner's
    subtle provocation. Yet, it is this silent provocation that characterizes the abusive
    element of the relationship. To the casual observer, as well as to the therapist who may
    be unfamiliar with the abuse phenomena, abusers appear "innocent"or
    justified in their behavior. The abuser's provocation is transparent, while the
    "hysterical" partner's reaction is all too visible.

           The verbally abusive relationship differs from normal
    relationship patterns in distinct ways. There is an imbalance. In normal relationships,
    partners take turns poking at each other. In the abusive relationship, the abuser almost
    always provokes, and the abused partner almost always defends. The provocation is always
    offensive, and it is virtually transparent. The retort, by comparison, is always defensive
    and highly visible, with the abused partner appearing to be at fault! ("Poor
    Bob, I'd lock myself up in a closet too if I had to put up with her")

          <font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">
           Another characteristic unique to the abusive relationship is
    that while partners in a normal relationship offensively provoke each other during
    difficult periods, in abusive relationships, the abuser provokes the partner when things
    are going well! The goal is to push the partner away because it is too scary to be too
    close, or to retaliate against the partner for a perceived slight.

           The partner cannot come too close because they can hurt you.
    The reason the partner may hurt the abusive person, even when not retaliating, is because
    of their own imperfection. Every person has emotional needs! No matter self-sacrificing
    and understanding (i.e., codependent) the partner may be, nobody is
           <em>
            always
           </em>
           selfless! The partner may also hurt when they fail to mind-read well enough to provide the
    necessary emotional stuff.

            <strong>

           The abuser's self-absorption and expectations spawn
    imbalance: The relationship is one-sided and is exclusively focused on meeting the
    emotional needs of the angry person. The abused partner's emotional needs are are seldom
    met -- and are often actively thwarted. The active thwarting of the abused partner's
    emotional needs is often the provocation. In Bob and Dana's case, Bob was willing to give
    Dana anything but what she really wanted, his emotional partnership. Partnership is
    something he is unable to give.

           A healthy relationship is reciprocal. Each partner must
    possess a measure of healthy self-acceptance and acceptance of the other. It is mutually
    understood that there is a constant give and take, with ongoing sacrifice and concession,
    each partner knowing that their giving will eventually be returned.

           By comparison, the abusive relationship is one-sided. The
    abusive partner, who denies vulnerability and human imperfection, is unable to participate
    reciprocally. The partner's imperfections are experienced as a personal assault.

           This broken individual desperately needs to feel invincible,
    to win, and be in control. Being wrong, having to "give in," give up, or to
    place anothers needs before their own is unacceptable. The only thing left, that
    feels somewhat OK, is to "win." If that's
           <em>
            all there is
           </em>
           , there is

           Emotional closeness and reciprocity threaten the little
    power angry people have.Closeness and reciprocity imply the ability to honestly
    accept one's own imperfections; to be wrong, lose, give up, give in. Clinging to rigid
    standards of perfection, the abusive individual cannot operate honestly. Honest reality is
    dangerous. It threatens the little emotional stuff being right affords. Therefore,
    what-really-happened-in-the-world has to be bent. The angry person must "be
    right" to feel ok -- even if reality has to be
           <em>
            reinvented
           </em>
           to justify
    the angry persons perspective. This manipulation ensures that the abuser is
    "right," and gets the partner to "agree." With this agreement
    comes the short-lived satisfaction of having won. Too often, the codependent partner,
    lacking a strong sense of self, gives up his or her own reality in favor of the distorted
    reality of the abuser! Dana's guilt and shame over her outburst caused her to accept
    Bobs blame and table her initial outrage.

           In sum: The angry person pushes away their partner whenever
    the partner is perceived to violate rigid and implicitly-held beliefs: the partner must
           <em>
            always
    be there and never disappoint
           </em>
           . Since partners are imperfect, they will disappoint.
    The angry person will retaliate or defend against the partner by provoking, pushing away,
    and/or blaming. Reality may be distorted to justify whatever it takes to be right. The
    angry person will come to
           <em>
            believe
           </em>
           the reality they invented! With little
    self-acceptance and its inherent sense of OK-ness, the angry person can only simulate
    OK-ness, by winning, being right, controlling what is by manipulating it to make it so.

           The abusive individual's problem is rooted in

    isobliterated by the absorption with perceived attack, self-defense, etc. The goals
    of treatment are to increase non-judgmental self-awareness, to expose underlying beliefs,
