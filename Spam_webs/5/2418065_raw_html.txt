           It's a golden age for planet hunters: NASA's Kepler mission has identified more than 3,500 potential planets orbiting stars beyond our Sun. Some of them, like a planet called Kepler-22b, might even be able to harbor life. How did we come upon this distant planet? Combining startling animation with input from expert astrophysicists and astrobiologists, "Alien Planets Revealed" takes viewers on a journey along with the Kepler telescope. How does the telescope look for planets? How many of these planets are like our Earth? Will any of these planets be suitable for life as we know it? Bringing the creative power of veteran animators together with the latest discoveries in planet-hunting, "Alien Planets Revealed" shows the successes of the Kepler mission, taking us to planets beyond our solar system and providing a glimpse of creatures we might one day encounter.

           Hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy, and yet, we know of only one that shines on a life-filled planet. Is Earth unique, or are there other solar systems and planets like ours out there? Now, scientists are finding the answer, thanks to this: the Kepler Space Telescope, the most powerful planet hunter ever built. It is making astonishing discoveries...

           Meet the Kepler Space Telescope. Its mission: to detect alien worlds orbiting distant stars and to discover if any of them could be a suitable home for life as we know it.

           Of the 3,500 potential planets that Kepler has spotted, some seem familiar: huge gas giants, similar to Jupiter or Saturn, or smaller, rocky worlds that could be like Earth, Venus, Mars or Mercury.
  But others are straight out of science fiction, like Kepler 16b, which orbits a double star, just like Luke Skywalker's home planet in Star Wars.
 Even more bizarre is Kepler 10b. It orbits so closely to its sun that the surface is a vision of hell.

          <p>
           <em>
            NATALIE BATALHA:
           </em>
           Kepler 10b is a scorched world. It's got an ocean bigger than the Pacific Ocean, but it's an ocean, not of water, but of molten lava. That star-facing side, as it orbits, has surface temperatures in excess of that required to melt iron. So this is a blow-torched world.

           But for Kepler, these oddities are just a sideshow, because its primary mission is to find a planet that might have the right conditions for alien life, a planet like Earth.
 Now, Kepler might be closing in on just such a world. The Kepler data suggests that potentially habitable planets are out there. And, applying the principles of biology and evolution, scientists are even beginning to guess how extraterrestrials could have adapted to their environments.

           Kepler is unique among space telescopes. Unlike the Hubble, which turned its gaze far and wide and sent back stunning images of the cosmos, Kepler is designed to stare fixedly at one small patch of sky, taking the same snapshot day in and day out for years on end.
  It began, as with any new telescope, with what astronomers call "first light."
          </p>

           Kepler's first light image came down to us, at NASA Ames, about 24 hours after we ejected the disk cover.
 As it filled my computer screen, the image that came to my mind was like champagne filling a glass, with all of these stars being the little bubbles. It was very exciting. Every single tiny dot that you see is a star that is in the field of view of Kepler.

           Kepler is focused on a small patch of the sky near the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan.

           <em>
            NATALIE BATALHA:

           In that area of sky are four-and-a-half-million stars, in our galaxy, alone.

           But Kepler isn't looking for stars. It's looking for planets that orbit the stars. But that's a problem, because Kepler can't directly see planets. Planets are much smaller and dimmer than stars, so they get lost in the glare.
 So Kepler is looking for something called a transit, which occurs when a planet passes in front of the star. As it does so, it dims the light by a fraction. That dimming is what Kepler is designed to detect. 
  It's a principle that can be illustrated with a distant tower and a spotlight.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            DAVID CHARBONNEAU (Harvard University):
           </em>
           Okay, let's imagine there's a moth flying around that spotlight. Could we ever hope to see the moth? No way. The moth, although it does reflect a tiny bit of the spotlight's light, it's far too feeble for us to see that.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            NARRATOR:
           </em>
           Since the light reflected off a planet is typically 10-billion times fainter than the light emitted by its star, detecting a planet might seem impossible.
  But Kepler has a way around that problem.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            DAVE CHARBONNEAU:
           </em>
           If the moth passes in front of the bright light, a little bit of the light that was going to reach us obviously gets blocked by the moth. Then we are able to detect the moth by measuring very carefully that very subtle change in the total brightness of the spotlight.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            NARRATOR:
           </em>
           The bigger the moth, the more light it blocks, and the more the light dims.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            DAVE CHARBONNEAU:
           </em>
           In exactly the same fashion, that's how we can detect small planets orbiting other stars and even measure their sizes.
          </p>

           <em>
            NARRATOR:

           That's Kepler's primary mission: to watch thousands of stars for signs of a transit. Scientists plot the brightness of each star in Kepler's view on a graph, to see how it changes over time. 
 This is an actual plot of one star over two weeks. Sure enough, every three days there's a tiny dip in brightness, revealing a planet orbiting this star once every three days. 
  Just like the moth, the bigger the planet, the more light it blocks. In this plot, a huge planet transits in front of its star, causing a much larger dip.
 Right from the start, Kepler saw stars dimming. By June, 2010, 15 months after launch, Kepler had found over 700 potential planets.

           Extrapolating from the Kepler data, some estimates put the number of planets in the universe in the trillions. But what everyone really wants to know is, "Do any of these planets have life?"
 To answer that, we have to go back to the basics and ask, "Is the universe full of the same stuff everywhere? Are the elements needed for life, as we know it, commonplace?"
  The lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, were made in the moments after the Big Bang. Other elements are made in stars, a product of nuclear fusion during the star's normal life cycle or produced when some stars explode as supernovas, scattering these essential building blocks into space.

           Among the most common are the elements that are essential to all living things on Earth: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen.
  Life could be anywhere or everywhere in our galaxy, but where should we look? Because planets are proving to be so abundant, Chris McKay thinks we might as well search for life that follows rules we already understand.

           Earth, as we know, is teeming with life. Organisms have evolved to exploit every niche, from beneath the waves to the highest mountains. So what's so special about our pale blue world? For most scientists, the key feature of Earth is the presence of liquid water on its surface.

           The microorganisms have solved the problem of the lack of water in a very ingenious way. The organisms secrete organic materials, which help to hold water. They make little super-sponges, and so, the rare moisture that's there, they can hold it. They can hold it longer than the normal sand. These organisms have created a little tiny micro-habitat in which they live.

           So life, as we know it, needs liquid water. Fortunately, water is made of two of the most abundant elements in the universe: hydrogen and oxygen. We've even detected water vapor in the clouds of gas in outer space. 
 What's harder to find is a planet that could have liquid water, where the temperature is warm enough to melt ice, yet below the point where water boils to steam.

           <em>
            CHRIS MCKAY:
           </em>
           The sun is like a fire, it provides light and through that light, warmth. And that warmth is what keeps a planet warm enough to support liquid water. If it's too far from the sun, the water will be ice. If it's too close, the water will be steam. So it needs to be right in that zone where the water can be liquid. Sometimes we call it the Goldilocks zone: it's not too hot; it's not too cold; it's just right.

           Kepler's core mission is to find Earth-sized planets in the Goldilocks zone. Remarkably, this data, that shows the timing of each transit, is also the key to finding out how hot a planet might be. The more frequent the planet transits, the hotter it is.
          </p>

           <em>

           When a planet is very close to the star, it's going around quite rapidly. The period is very shortit can go around in weeks evenaround the central star. As a planet is further away, it takes much longer.
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            NARRATOR:
           </em>
           A planet that orbits once a week will be close to its star and very hot; a planet that orbits every 10 years will be very far away and too cold.
   So scientists were looking for a planet orbiting a Sun-like star roughly once a year, like Earth. On May 12, 2009, just three days after the spacecraft started collecting data, it saw the light from the star Kepler 22-b dim ever so slightly. Ten months later it dimmed again. If it happened once more in another 10 months, it would confirm Kepler was seeing a transit.
 Sure enough, on December 15, 2010, the star dimmed once more. Kepler had discovered its first planet in the habitable zone: Kepler 22-b, over 600 light-years away.

           Kepler 22-b was the first confirmation of a planet that was just the right temperature. So it's in the Goldilocks zone, and it's orbiting a star very much like our own sun.

           The researchers can use the amount of dimming to measure the size of the planet. It works out at about 2.4 times the radius of the earth. So, now comes the next mystery: what kind of planet is Kepler 22-b? What is it made of? 
  The key to a planet's composition is its size. When planets form, they start off solid, made of rock and ice. If they become big enough, they're able to hold on to huge amounts of gashydrogen and helium, the most abundantthese become the gas giants, like Jupiter and Neptune.
 Smaller planets, like Earth, are primarily rocky, and can only hold onto a thin atmosphere. Kepler 22-b is in the middle: bigger than all the rocky planets in our system, but smaller than the gas giants. 
 So is it mainly gas or rock? Astronomer Geoff Marcy is attempting to find out.
 Tonight, he's using the Keck Telescope, in Hawaii, which he's operating via video link from Berkeley, California, over 2,000 miles away.

           To answer this question, Geoff is using a very different way of detecting planets. Nicknamed the "wobble method," this technique was used to find some of the first exoplanets, and it's also used to find out more about the planets discovered by Kepler.

           We can detect planets around other stars, even without seeing the planets, by watching the star.
 Let's create a star and, of course, we'd like a planet orbiting that star. Now, what's interesting is that the planet not only orbits the star, but the star is yanked on, gravitationally, by the planet. So, we see the star wobble around, and we can detect this with our telescopes, here on Earth.

           When I was a kid, I was told in school that the sun is an average star, which is a complete lie. The sun is not an average star. Most stars in the galaxy are much less massive and put out much less energy than the sun. And we call these very-low-mass stars "M dwarfs." Our sun is yellow in color, very massive, very large, and compared to it, these low-mass M dwarf stars are tiny. They are only about 10 or 20 percent the size, 10 or 20 percent the mass, and they only put out one 1,000th the amount of energy.

           M dwarf stars, also known as red dwarfs, make up over three-quarters of all stars in the universe. Because the star is so small, it's easier to spot a small planet orbiting one. Even though an Earth-sized planet covers only about zero-point-one percent of a red dwarf, it typically dims the light by an easy-to-see one percent.
 Dave Charbonneau and his team have searched through the Kepler data, and they've found that more than half of all such stars have planets Earth-sized or a little larger. But could a planet orbiting such a dim star be warm enough to have oceans of water and even life?

           KOI-2626.01 orbits its red dwarf star once every 38 days. But being so near to a star can create a strange situation. Gravity from the star pulls more strongly on the closest side of the planet, a slight drag that can cause one side to always face the star. Astronomers call this "tidal locking."
 This alien world would have a light side, on which the sun never sets, and a dark side on which the sun never rises. At first, scientists thought that this would make the planet impossible for life, because it wouldn't have an atmosphere.

All the carbon dioxide that would normally be in the atmosphere would be present as ice, forming a giant polar cap on the dark side. Ice like this; this is a chunk of carbon dioxide.

           And this temperature difference between the hot side and cold side has a profound effect on the atmosphere. Here, on the dark side, the air cools and sinks, spreading out around the planet. That creates a wind that blows along the surface to the hot side. Here, the air heats up and rises, before returning to the cold side. So, if this planet has an atmosphere, it would have a permanent, planet-wide wind system.
  This reduces the temperature difference and keeps the atmosphere from freezing, which means that the planet might be habitable after all, with a stable atmosphere and, in some places, a pleasant climate.

But on a red dwarf planet, with its red light, an alien plant-like species might adapt to produce different pigments.

           <em>

           The bacteria in the top layer are green. They use the same chlorophyll that plants do, because they receive the full spectrum of sunlight. But many of those frequencies get absorbed, leaving the lower layers with a different color of light. So, they have evolved new photosynthesizing molecules, adapted to that different spectrum. 
 Studying these different molecules allows Nancy to imagine what sort of pigments would work best on alien worlds, bathed in the dim red light of a red dwarf. It leads to an intriguing suggestion.

But one of the other features of a tidally-locked planet would be the fearsome winds blowing constantly in the same direction.
 So, maybe a flat panel wouldn't actually end up being the optimal design, and you want to be a bit more flexible and giving to allow the wind to, kind of, blow through your, perhaps, fan-like shape.

           Based on what we know about life in our world, and from what we know about the environment on this distant planet, scientists are beginning to imagine what alien animal life might look like.

           On Earth, we find filter-feeders, life that filters particles or little grains of food out of the water as it wafts past them. On a planet like this, we might find a similar strategy on the land.
 So, maybe we'd find something like land whales that aren't filtering out plankton from the sea, like the whales in our oceans, but are great big static animals that try to filter out particle matter from the wind to feed off.

           Even though scientists speculate about how life might survive on truly alien worlds like this, most still believe that our best hope of finding life that we might recognize lies in finding a rocky planet, a similar size to Earth, that orbits a sun more like our own.
 It's a challenge of astronomical proportions.

           A planet as tiny as an earth, transiting across the disk of its star, is going produce a change in brightness of just one part per 10,000. Imagine the tallest hotel in New York City, and everybody has their light on, and one person in this hotel lowers the blinds by about two centimeters. That's the change in brightness that we are trying to detect from the transit of a planet as small as an earth passing in front of a star the size of our sun.

           So Kepler scientists scour the data for signs of a truly tiny dip, evidence of an Earth-like planet. And they find something promising around star KOI-701, 1,200 light-years away.
 The Keck Telescope confirms that there are at least three planets orbiting the star.

           What we might expect is for the aquatic or marine life to be actually pretty similar, pretty familiar to what we know on Earth, because the main consideration is being able to move through the water as efficiently as possible. So you want to be hydrodynamic, you want to be streamlined in your shape. And a very good streamlined shape is known as fusiform. You'd be kind of bullet shaped, just like most fish on Earth.

           On Earth, all vertebrates have a maximum of four legs, because all animals with a backbone evolved from a fish that had four fleshy, lobed fins. But could aliens have more legs?
   That's what Bill Sellers wants to find out. He usually looks at extinct species, like dinosaurs, by recreating their structure in a computer. The same technique can be applied to an alien body plan.

           When we have an alien life form, we treat the shape of the animal as the framework of the robot. We add motors to actually drive the creature, and then the trick is we get the computer to learn how to be the most effective driver for this particular shaped animal.

           Bill is investigating how life might move in a high-gravity environment. The computer model he's using is called a genetic algorithm. First, he creates an eight-legged alien. Then, the computer generates hundreds of random movement patterns and tests them out.

           <em>
            BILL SELLERS:

           This is a moving forward start, but, as you can see, what happens if it gets the pattern wrong? Then although it's still moving its legs, it's lost all forward velocity, and, actually, it's starting to go backwards in a very unstable way.
 Other examples of failures, for example, this one, what happens is the front pair of legs trip over, and then the whole thing nosedives, and because of where the weight is, the back legs are up in the air and spinning round. 
 So, again, this is a complete failure and we wouldn't work from those.

           After the evolutionary process is finished, we end up with these very stable, very efficient gaits. 
 What the work has shown is that this eight-legged creature mechanically could cope with higher gravity.

           Sharks, like the ones we see here, have ruled the seas for 400-million years, and yet their brains are, are no larger than peas. How could it be that after 400-million years sharks have not developed a higher intelligence? And of course the answer must be that high-I.Q. sharks compete no more successfully than the less intelligent sharks among us. And that tells us something frightening about life elsewhere in the universe: perhaps the intelligence of which we humans are so proud is not an attribute that is strongly favored in Darwinian evolution.

 Kepler continued to collect data until May, 2013, when the guidance system failed and it lost its steady lock on the stars it had watched so keenly. But the hunt for alien planets is far from over: Kepler may have a second life, using pressure from sunlight to keep it oriented.
 And in coming years, new planet hunters will take up the quest, exploring the age-old question, "Are we alone?"
