        Astrology:
       </h2>
       <p class="main">
        Astrology is the group study of the movement of planets and stars that influence the mind, body, and life of individuals. The right information of their movement can help the person in improving his personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters.
       </p>
       <p class="main">
        People have charted and tracked the positions of planets, stars and other objects visible in the night sky for thousands of years. Until relatively modern times, they were essential tools for navigating and keeping track of time, and their changing positions were thoroughly studied and recorded for these purposes. While observing celestial bodies very closely, however, people started to notice patterns in behaviors and events on Earth that seemed to correspond with patterns observed in the sky. This laid the foundation for the study of astrology and the practice of using celestial bodies to help predict and understand events of humankind.
       </p>
       <p class="main">
        We know that stars emit large amounts of electromagnetic radiation, and we know that they are constantly in motion and constantly fluctuating. We know that their changing positions and characteristics have an effect on everything nearby, as we can directly observe the effects of our own sun's gravity and fluctuating electromagnetic energy on our planet. Stars, planets and other objects all interact with each other in our galaxy, and galaxies interact with each other to form a vast, ever-changing network of energy and matter that we call our universe. It follows, then, that changes in the positions of these objects can have far-reaching effects on objects and organisms in their celestial environment.
       </p>
       <p class="main">
        Astrology seeks to understand and apply these principles to explain and predict patterns in human life. While jyotish is a complex and imperfect study, it is based on theories that have been developed by observing patterns over thousands of years. The universe is an extremely complex system which scientists are only beginning to understand and the more we study it, the more it appears that everything is connected and the forces that affect life on Earth are more complicated than we could ever imagine.
       </p>
       <p class="main">
        The art of astrology helps future tellers acquire information about a person's personality, strength and weaknesses. There are many well known versions of astrology like Indian Astrology, Chinese Astrology, Egyptian Astrology and Western Astrology. Indian and western future tellers create and study an astrological chart popularly known as the `horoscope' for an event based on the position of the stars at the moment of the event. Indian future tellers have a firm belief that there exists a meaningful link between the time someone is born and the qualities that are inherent to his/her personality. The birth chart reveals a lot about the person and his destiny and predictions can be made by studying the person's stars. By seeking help from an future teller, people can make meaningful choices about the direction of their future.

       <p class="main">
        Vedic Astrology is based on an ancient Hindu technique of reading the stars, the moon and the planets to understand their influence on the body, mind and spirit of human beings. The Vedic astrological system or Jyotisha delves into the tradition of ancient wisdom, beginning with texts that are 5000 years old. Vedic Astrology uses this knowledge to provide a meaningful spiritual understanding of the events in your life.
