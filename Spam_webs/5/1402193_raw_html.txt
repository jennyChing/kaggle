  <meta content="Living in the city doesnt have to mean you lose your greenie side! Here are a few ways you can green your life, even if you are living in the big smoke.


Enjoying the health benefits of Low Tox Living


Alexx Stuart is a foodie, former award winning bartender and all round nice gal who is on a mission to encourage lowering our exposure to harmful toxins around the home and in the food we eat. From practical and simple recipes based on real food, to alternatives for common household items that contain harmful toxins, and a dash of myth busting on marketing claims, Alexx is providing the tools needed to live as low tox as possible. 


Greening the home with Green Renters


Originally a Melbourne based project, Green Renters is also offering workshops, tips and tricks for the renters of Sydney to green their homes. Balancing the idea of not owning a property and therefore not wanting to jeopardise a bond or good relationship with a real estate agent can be hard, and this is where Green Renters comes in.


From running workshops on how to green your rental to reduce both cost and environmental impact, to providing tips and advice through the Green Renters blog, and building community and giving information via the Green Renters Facebook page, Green Renters is helping renters lose that sense of powerlessness and green their lifestyle. Green Renters also work together with community groups, social housing and run campaigns to support a sustainable future. 


Composting, Worms and Chicken Rental


Many councils are now getting with the programme and offering renters and owners free worm farms, compost and access to other fun green stuff. We know that Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, North Sydney and Hornsby Councils all run some kind of programme to support using compost and/or worm farms to reduce waste, as do many others. Hit your local council website and see what they have to offer- you may be surprised!


You can also reduce your scraps and get fresh eggs to boot by participating in Rent-a-Chook. Yes folks, you can check out a chook on a short term basis to see if it fits with your lifestyle. Bgurk!


Getting closer to nature with Community Gardening


Feel like pitching in to help or perhaps starting your own community garden? Or trying to start a veggie garden of your own on a balcony, in a rental or simply with limited space? You can grow your own veggies and fruit with a little bit of advice from Milkwood Permaculture and Transition Sydney.


Getting a fix on the Bike Repair Cafe


On Abercrombie Street in Redfern (on the Chippendale side) is an amazing little cafe called The Town Bike Pit Stop. More than simply a bike friendly place to stop for a coffee, the Town Bike Pit Stop operates as a City of Sydney assisted bike repair cafe. You can make use of tools and advice to fix your bike in a friendly and positive cycling environment.



Loving Bicycling in Sydney


Be green and get fit while you are doing it by bicycling in Sydney! With new cycle lanes being added all the time, plus a supportive community via Facebook page I love Sydney Bike Lanes and Cycle Ways, you can turn your commute frown upside down and enjoy a wheelie good way to get to work!


Talking the green talk at GreenUps


Held monthly on the first Tuesday of each month, GreenUps is Sydneys sustainability networking drinks for people who want to see green and sustainable change. Each month tackles a different topic- and its a great way to meet like minded people to get your green on.


Finding inspiration via Think, Act, Change


Not just about greening up your life, Think, Act, Change is an amazing group that is pushing for social change and education of all kinds. From hosting movie nights to panel discussions, special events and TEDx dinners, this little group will give you the giant injection of inspiration, plus some friends to aid the perspiration, that is required when you want to make lasting change!


Learning whats new at Eco Expo


Want to learn how you can live a sustainable lifestyle in the city? Head to Rosehill Gardens Racecourse on September 20th to 22nd 2013 and find out all you need to know during the Eco Expo. A mix of information, education and trade stands for people, communities and businesses who want to go green, the Eco Expo is held each year to bring new products and solutions to greenies of all kinds. This year also includes the always inspiring David Suzuki sharing his vast knowledge. Tickets are essential.


Reducing your impact with Collaborative Consumption


Looking to be more active and share in more ways than via Open Shed? Join the Sydney Collaborative Consumption Meetup. Here you can meet the founders, friends and supporters of Sydneys collaborative consumption scene, or find the support you need to start you own collaborative consumption idea. The group meets roughly every 3 months to touch base, talk, share ideas and work out new ways to help promote the wonderful world of collaborative consumption.



These are our Sydney tips for getting your green on. What other places, groups and associations are you participating in to get your little bit of sustainability happening?

        Living in the city doesnt have to mean you lose your greenie side! Here are a few ways you can green your life, even if you are living in the big smoke.

         Greening the home with

          Green Renters
         </a>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="MsoNormal">
        Originally a Melbourne based project,
        <a href="http://greenrenters.org/">
         Green Renters
        </a>
        is also offering workshops, tips and tricks for the renters of Sydney to green their homes. Balancing the idea of not owning a property and therefore not wanting to jeopardise a bond or good relationship with a real estate agent can be hard, and this is where Green Renters comes in.
       </p>
       <p class="MsoNormal">
        From running workshops on how to green your rental to reduce both cost and environmental impact, to providing tips and advice through the
        <a href="http://greenrenters.org/opinion">
         Green Renters blog
        </a>
        , and building community and giving information via the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/greenrenters">
         Green Renters Facebook page
        </a>
        , Green Renters is helping renters lose that sense of powerlessness and green their lifestyle. Green Renters also work together with community groups, social housing and run campaigns to support a sustainable future.

         Composting, Worms and Chicken Rental
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p class="MsoNormal">
        Many councils are now getting with the programme and offering renters and owners free worm farms, compost and access to other fun green stuff. We know that Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, North Sydney and Hornsby Councils all run some kind of programme to support using compost and/or worm farms to reduce waste, as do many others. Hit your local council website and see what they have to offer- you may be surprised!
