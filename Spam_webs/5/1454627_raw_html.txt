         You dont have to be the boss to take on a leadership role.
        </p>
        <p>
         I learned that quite quickly while working with
         <a href="https://www.helpscout.net/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.helpscout.net']);">
          my startup
         </a>
         in many instances,
         <img alt="Nice Guys Finish Last" class="alignright" height="252" src="https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Nice-Guys-Finish-Poorest.png" width="250"/>
         if you have the most experience within a certain skill, youll have to become the leader during some key moments and guide the rest of the team.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I happen to find fascinating is that numerous psychology studies tend to make a connection between this
         <em>
          ability to lead
         </em>
         when necessary and the achievement of professional successespecially for men.
        </p>
        <p>
         The connection lead me to a question that guys have been asking themselves forever:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          Do nice guys really finish last in life?
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Its hard to say for sure, but a new study shows that nice guys typically earn less than their more aggressive peers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Fortunately, the research doesnt suggest that you need to be a
         <em>
          jerk
         </em>
         to get ahead in life, but that highly agreeable men need to be careful about how assertive they are when it comes their work. This assertiveness, as youll see, relates more closely to taking on the role of leader than you might think.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lets take a look at why this phenomenon happens and what nice guys can do about it.

        <h1>
         The Problem with Nice Guys
        </h1>
        <p>
         According to a recent
         <a href="http://research.nd.edu/research-stories/mendoza-college-of-business/do-nice-guys-and-gals-finish-last-in-business/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://research.nd.edu']);">
          study
         </a>
         by the University of Notre Dame, nice guys, at least statistically speaking, are not as likely earn the big bucks as their less agreeable peers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ladies are probably wondering, What about us?, but the study notes that this variable trait of agreeableness only seems to detrimentally affect men:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          The study shows a strong negative relationship between agreeableness and earnings for men. The more agreeable a man is, the less he will earn. For women, there is essentially no relationship at all.
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Why?
        </p>
        <p>
         Outside of the workplace, Agreeableness, one of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_five_personality_traits" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">
          the big 5 personality traits
         </a>
         , is generally associated with positive characteristics, such as beingwarm, sympathetic, kind and cooperative.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its also the most commonly cited trait (of the big 5) when people describe an ideal person to spend time with, and most psychological research associates the trait with a slew of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness#NEO_PI_facets" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://en.wikipedia.org']);">
          other positive behaviors
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          So how do men benefit in the workplace by being the opposite?
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         According to the researchers, this double-standard exists because disagreeable men (at least in competitive, work-related scenarios) are
         <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2022817/Behaving-disagreeably-way-ahead-work-youre-man.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.dailymail.co.uk']);">
          viewed as
          <em>
           tough negotiators
          </em>
         </a>
         and willing to stick to their vision, whereas women dont gain the same benefit in terms of how they are viewed.
        </p>
        <p>
         It seems that being disagreeable isnt really the ideal behavior, but rather that being
         <em>
          too
         </em>
         agreeable is viewed as a sign of weakness in men, or as a characteristic of a flaky personality that is lacking in confidence and conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
         And yet, weve seen that being an agreeable person is a highly desirable trait in general, so how can a balance be found? Is there any correlation between assertiveness and other psychological traits that are associated with higher earnings and more work-related success?
        </p>
        <p>
         I feel the answer lies in analyzing
         <strong>
          what makes a greatleader
         </strong>
         , as leaders are quite likely to fill up high-earning positions, even if they arent the boss.
        </p>
        <p>
         Examining leadership qualities also allows us to look past gender discrepancies, as leaders can be men or women and the traits are more universally applicable in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, what makes a great leader?
        </p>
        <h1>
         The Traits of Great Leaders
        </h1>
        <p>
         A lot has been written on being a great leader, but today well take a look at two studies and their findings on what characteristics are
         <img alt="Nice guys finish last - Marcus Aurelius" class="alignright" height="267" src="https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Marcus-Aurelius.png" width="250"/>
         most important for those who wish to lead others.
        </p>

          from Jim Collins
         </a>
         on what traits are most often associated with a great manager (a positionregularlyassociated with leadership).
        </p>
        <p>
         By examining the traits that have strong connections with leadership, we can see where nice guys may be going wrong, and find out what it really takes to lead others and advance in a competitive environment that isnt entirely accepting of overly agreeable people.
        </p>
        <p>
         Lets dig in
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1.) Decisiveness
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The #1 trait across both sources, this characteristic is also the most at odds with being too agreeable.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we watch others make decisions frequently and stick to those decisions, wesubconsciouslyassociate them with responsibility, and thus we are more likely to view them as leaders (especially when other people follow suite).
        </p>
        <p>
         One
         <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.5.821" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://psycnet.apa.org']);">
          study
         </a>
         even found that first-movers often have the advantage in many decision making situations, as it only takes a few other people before the majority of the group will view the decision as valid. In essence, the person with the most conviction can create an

          availability cascade
         </a>
         where others will agree with their opinions simply because they are presented so convincingly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Its easy to see why being too agreeable can hurt a mans perceived qualities as a leader, as more agreeable men may look for a consensus to be formed first before they state their opinion, whereas more assertive men are likely to put their opinion forward immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2.) Vision
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         A natural complement of decisiveness, as we know that a truly great leader does more than just shout his/her opinion the loudestthey back it up with a convincing explanation of how things are going to pan out.
        </p>
        <p>
         Have you ever spoken with someone who was able to brilliantly articulate their idea to you one-on-one but fell apart when they had to share it with a group? Sometimes this is the result
         <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/what-happens-to-our-brains-when-we-have-stage-fright-the-science-of-public-speaking" target="_blank">
          of a fear of public speaking
         </a>
         , and other times the person is just too
         <em>
          agreeable
         </em>
         to push for their vision in the face of opposing opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact,
         <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/busr/2000/00000011/00000004/art00003" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.ingentaconnect.com']);">
          research
         </a>
         in the realm of
         <a href="http://www.sparringmind.com/creative-thinking/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.sparringmind.com']);" target="_blank">
          creative thinking
         </a>
         (often a fundamental aspect of leadership) has shown that brainstorming is often an ineffective method for coming up with ideas because participants can suffer from
         <strong>
          evaluation apprehension
         </strong>
         and
         <strong>
          social loafing
         </strong>
         , where they decide to rely on the rest of the group for ideas instead of putting forth their own. Most people are apprehensive about having their thoughts judged by others, which is why thisoccurrenceis so common in group brainstorming sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
         So skilled creative workers need to realize that what they plan out in their head doesnt mean a thing unless they are willing to practice being able to present their idea persuasively (and confidently) to their peers and superiors.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3.) Persistence
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         While beingpersistentdoesnt necessarily mean being inflexible, there are certainly some differences between the stereotypical agreeable personality and apersistentone.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the most interesting pieces of research I came across in this area is the denouncement of a tactic that I see many nice guys trying to useplaying devils advocate when they want to disagree.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately, although being the devils advocate allows nice guys to keep pushing for their opinion without hurting any feelings, an
         <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.58/abstract" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com']);" target="_blank">
          insightful study
         </a>
         conducted by Charles Namath shows that the tactic generally
         <em>
          backfires
         </em>
         using a devils advocate argument generally
         <span style="color: #000000;">
          <b>
           strengthens
          </b>
         </span>
         the groups opinion on the
         <em>
          original
         </em>
         argument!
        </p>
        <p>
         Conversely, true dissent was actually listened to much more closely and evaluated for much longer, as a majority of people will at least seek to understand the opposing argument of someone in the room before they dismiss it (that generally doesnt happen when dealing with arguments between groups, but thats for another day!).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nice guys should therefore not only bepersistentin their efforts towards greatness, but they also need to realize that when to hold em and when to fold em applies to the workplace as well, and if they are confident in their stance/idea/argument, they need to push for it without trying to appeal to everyone.

        <h1>
         The Case for Moderation
        </h1>
        <p>
         It should be noted that the other 3 big traits associated with great leaders (there were 6 in all) included things like
         <em>
          Modesty
         </em>
         ,
         <em>
          Competence
         </em>
         , and
         <em>
          Integrity
         </em>
         , meaning its not always about conviction and confidence on the path to leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
         That being said, before you close out this post and begin embracing some new Machiavellian lifestyle, you should know that the key trait weve thrown around,
         <em>
          assertiveness
         </em>
         , does have to be used in moderation.
        </p>

         What are the potentially negative impacts of being overly assertive?

          Ames &amp; Flynn (2007)
         </a>
         sought to find that very answer. They gathered 3 groups of MBA students who were instructed to fill out questionnaires about their peers and the respective managers for whom theyd worked with in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
         The mainobservationsmade examined
         <em>
          social
         </em>
         outcomes and
         <em>
          instrumental
         </em>
         outcomesin other words, how well were the managers liked by the students and how much were they able to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
         The results (as published
         <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2011/10/can-you-get-things-done-without-making-people-hate-you.php" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.spring.org.uk']);" target="_blank">

         ) were quite revealing:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <strong>
           <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/simple-productivity-tips-science">
            Productivity
           </a>
           :
          </strong>
          higher and higher levels of assertiveness produced diminishing returns. So in terms of results its not much better to be highly assertive than moderately assertive, but it was definitely better to be moderately assertive than not assertive.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>
           Social outcomes:
          </strong>
          higher and higher levels of assertiveness lead to increasingly poor social outcomes. It was definitely better to be moderately assertive than highly assertive.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         When you put both of the outcomes together you get an inverted U-shape (below; from Ames &amp; Flynn, 2007). So that people who are low in assertiveness get less things done but people very high in assertiveness are socially insufferable.

        </p>
        <p>
         In other words, forceful leadership doesnt result in a rapid increase in productivity and can make the person in charge socially insufferable, a bad trait for long term leadership.
        </p>
        <p>
         There seems to be a sweet spot where a leaders presence is felt and their guidance listened to, but without the overbearing presence that tends to be detrimental to others in the group.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
         <p>
          A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled,they will say:we did it ourselves.
         </p>

           Lao Tzu
         </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
         Its the seamless integration into the group with the clear understanding that one person is taking charge that creates an effective chemistry and allows for a great leader to thrive.

              hi Gregory
             </p>
             <p>
              I always enjoy your articles as theyre highly researched and insightful. Congrats! This saying gets redundant overtime, I know
              <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="https://bufferblog-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/>

             <p>
              Anyway, a true lead I can say was my first affiliate coach he taught me everything I know about the business of making money with associate programs. He was a leader because he did what he preached; his actions were genuine, so I believed in his methods right from the bat
             </p>
             <p>
              He was there with me, day and night, guiding me along, not just telling me what to do or what not to do. I felt like he was walking me through the path, up and down, as he was there with me

              Nice! Extremely thorough. Just stumbled across this via HN, sad to see this didnt get much discussion on it as its a cool topic.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, I actually disagree with relevance of the first studys research, which seems to be foundational to your argument. Correct me if Im wrong, but it seems to be referring to employee data, rather than data relevant to executives/founders.
             </p>
             <p>
              Successful start-ups (defined by an exit/long-term profitability) are almost by definition outliers, and retroactively picking data points that seem to fit within whats assumed to be desirable personality traits of its leaders (or even employees) will probably involve some degree of curve-fitting. Maybe not the case for more established professions, but I question such datas relevance to your argument.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, enjoyed the read. Can always count on Buffers blog for thorough content, thats for sure!

                Actually, my point was only that nice guys are susceptible to earning less by being too agreeable, I just used the phrase nice guys finish last because its a trite debate that everyone loves to argue about.

              Beautiful insights.
             </p>
             <p>
              Theres a lot to be said for confidence, especially when people are looking for who to follow.
             </p>
             <p>
              Confidence, with a lack of competence is easy to sniff out.
             </p>
             <p>
              The best leaders Ive worked with have a great balance of connection + conviction.  They maintain connection and rapport (the key to influence), while demonstrating conviction (the rule we use is to operate in an open and respectful way.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Experience and credentials can often play a bigger role in shaping how a group will perceive your leadership ability.  I underestimated this in a few settings, and was surprised by how just revealing a few things quickly put me at the top of the totem pole.  (Of course, the experience and credentials need to be relevant to the situation at hand.)

              Great Article, Thanks for writing that. I believe that nice guys are not really nice, they are just afraid to voice their opinions and they is why they finish last because of fear and if you have fear you wont be first in anything.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am a nice guy in many ways but I wont back down from leading or sharing my ideals because that is what being a leader is all about. Even though I am nice, I am never labeled a nice Guy Interesting I think people use the label nice because they dont want to come right out and call them weak.

              I have been told Im too nice as an employer. I decided if that goes on my gravestone, Here lies Mardra, she was too nice. Thats OK.

              That said, its no small surprise that I chose to change professions because managing a business  ethically is stressful to the senses.
              <br/>
              And, as a side-note, women still average less income than even a nice guy on the payment stick scale, which may be a factor in why its not a factor. Thats a whole other discussion, of course.

              This blog post has left this nice guy here stunned.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was just told that Im too nice by my boss during his evaluation review of my performance.  And of course a paltry 1% raise in my salary as a possible result of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I now see the wisdom of your words.  I guess its too late to change my perception at my current employment, but for the next one Ill definitely keep these words as meditation.
             </p>

              F&amp;%k you all very much and have a nice day

              I have found that assholes have two thing going for them.fear and admiration.people either submit to them out of fear of consequences for not submitting or they admire and want to be like them and consider it a form of training for future successfor me if they all dropped off into outer space I would sleep better at night.

                This is what I dont get about these studies. They all assume that the world is some great place where we made it by the skin of our teeth thanks to our terrific leaders. The world is a cesspool with a history of repeated fuckups by everyone at all levels of society, and if were here because of some Hail Mary, then like most things it would be the result of individual accomplishments by exceptional individuals that everyone else quickly latches onto the successes of. I think the willingness to villify nice guys is a deep-seated hatred of the world and a last attempt by people who have otherwise discovered they are in no way special or even really beneficial (lets face it, plenty of guys in suits accomplish nothing with their lives and waste a lot of resources doing it) and so they lash out against what is basically social evolution in an attempt to drag everyone down to their level, not unlike a child who wont join a game without pre-existing advantages. People have this habit of dismissing everything and reverting when theyre faced with challenges, and thats an understandable response to some things. Everyone wants to feel relevant, but the reality is that not everyone can or will be, and while there is room for differing opinion, most peoples entire worldviews are encapsulated in a mere subsection of other peoples, a truth theyll vehemently dismiss. The gap between Nietzsche and the average person is far greater than the gap between a chimpanzee and the average person. Im a nice guy, and Ill tell you that I do get a lot of hate just for it, but having real backbone and a real understanding of purpose, Ive always been able to effectively articulate my position and as a result I can thumb my nose at the exact same people most would look at as socially aggressive because they all know Ive made a fool of them at one time or another. I can also clearly see that Im the exception for that, and most nice guys really wont say a bad word even to the people picking on them. What I also see however is that despite my demonstrated competence, I tend to get pushed to the back of the line no matter how vehemently Im fighting it, not because Im not standing up for myself but because I make these types of people feel uncomfortable. You cant really espouse the virtue of selfishness and then extrapolate on it when youre around someone who can destroy it at the first mention of it. If theres one piece of advice I have for nice guys it would be this: the world is yours, not theirs. You have souls, they dont. Consider them as such and do what you will with them, and dont let them tell you they wouldnt do the same thing to you, as theyre doing it currently. I dont think Im the only person here whos noticed a correlation between nice and intelligent. If we let goofs run things forever they will continue to get worse, as they have been, and our culture will become even more exploitative, as it has been, while it continues to remove the narrative that even allows you to understand that youre a victim, as it has been. They want to kill you, make no bones about it. They dont understand it themselves but that doesnt mean you should let them. If you run a business and see this attitude in an employee, make them your work-horse. If youre a teacher and see this attitude in a student, single them out and make them an example. If youre just an employee at a large firm and find yourself beset upon by overly-competitive people (who will accomplish precisely lots of lip service with all that zeal) frame them, and do it guiltlessly. I can absolutely promise you they would do the same thing to you, and I think most of you know what Im talking about when I say that these were the people that were always wrong about everything, and whose motives were outwardly profit-oriented. Yet at some point were to assume their neurotic behaviour went from being totally erratic to the proper way forward. I think we all know that despite a lot of vocal opponents saying the contrary, we could run this place a million times better than they could. Hell they dont even know that theyre not running it very well, so how fucking hard is it really to put more effort into this and make something more than the sloppy incoherent mess it is now? Dont let them tell you they know better, test them and youll find out pretty quickly they dont. If youre a nice guy, and you arent getting anywhere because nice isnt accepted in your environment, well then be a nice guy while you put the knife in their back. They wont even see it coming from you. Guys like caseystubbs down there will tell you youre not voicing your opinions, while youre voicing your opinions, and then write you off for it, and its all done out of self-importance. If its actually costing you, just gut him.

              I never looked up to managers and leaders who were bossy. They werent pushovers, either. When leaders are perceived as being decisive, visionary, and persistent, it doesnt mean that they are being tough. They are considered trustworthy. To lead a team to high performance, the best leaders interpret social interactions, react appropriately, relate naturally, and communicate effectively. Align4profit.com calls this Feel. Think. Act. Talk. This keeps their team motivated to exceed company goals.
