  <h2>
   Come Back
  </h2>
  Come back often and take hold of me,
  <br/>
  sensation that I love, come back and take hold of me --
  <br/>
  when the body's memory revives
  <br/>
  and an old longing again passes through the blood,
  <br/>
  when lips and skin remember
  <br/>
  and hands feel as though they touch again.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Come back often, take hold of me in the night
  <br/>
  when lips and skin remember...
  <br/>
