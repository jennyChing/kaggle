            There are challenges keeping women in developing countries from getting the care they need, the services that should be easily accessible to them. It is urgent that they be addressedand Doctors Without Borders/Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) has seen from our own work that it can be done.
            <em>
             Because Tomorrow Needs Her
            </em>
            explores these challenges through the experiences of MSF field workers: doctors, midwives, nurses and counsellors.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In
            <a href="/#stories">
             seven chapters
            </a>

            <a href="/chapters/journal/">
             journal
            </a>
            that documents six months working in an MSF maternity hospital in Sierra Leone, these field workers share stories of especially memorable patients and describe how field teams have often managed to overcome difficult issues, times when they havent, and what still needs to be done.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In first-hand testimonies, patients and patients relatives also share the challenges they face in getting care. And through striking photo stories and videos, we see what those challenges mean for individual women.

Of this project, where she used video, documentary and participatory photography, Smith says: I am intrigued by how people who are a minority, such as African migrants in Barcelona, navigate the city. What is their experience of it? What happens after one survives the treacherous crossing by boat, or how has the experience changed after living here for twenty years Smith is currently completing her Masters of Science in African Studies at Oxford University through St. Antonys College.
