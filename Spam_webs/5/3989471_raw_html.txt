        Introduction:

      <p>
       <font face="Arial" size="2">
        If you havent ever played or even heard of blank white cards you're missing a whole load of fun. It is a game that you make up the rules for as you play, and can be whatever you want it to be.
        <p>
         If you like games but are bored as hell trying to remember complicated rules and regulations, or working out strategy untill your brain sweats, this is the game for you.
        </p>
        <p>
         When there are no rules, fun ensues. Trust me.
        </p>
        <p>
         This site has a set of rules that me and a few friends follow when we play, as well as the best cards we've come up with during games.
        </p>
        <p>
         This should at least give you a starting point to figure out a game that suits you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Enjoy!

          + It can be any size
         </b>
         in total, 50-100 should be good. If you get a lot of players then maybe increase it.

        <p>
         <b>
          + Each player should
         </b>

        The important bit:
       </b>
      </font>
      <p>
       <font face="Arial" size="2">
        The game can and will change as you go through. Any of the above rules can and will change, cards can literally do anything you want, can be played pretty much any way you want, and the win conditions often don't interest the players or even govern the style of play.
        <p>
         Sometimes everybody will win, sometimes nobody will win, sometimes maths or sweden will win, or sometimes you will win and lose at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The important and underlying aim of blank white cards is to have fun and be creative. If your games are filled with boring rules lawyers, bad sports, power gamers, bad losers, or un-imaginitive players i suggest you make a card to force creativitiy, switch win conditions, or otherwise annoy them and have some fun at their expense.
        </p>
        <p>
         The real "winner" of blank white cards is the person who made the most fun cards, got the most laughs, or got a bad player to leave in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Happy gaming!
