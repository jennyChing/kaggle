   <p>
    A lot of people, like police officers and gamblers, think they can tell when a person is lying. But what we've always longed for is hard data; testable, mechanical proof that a subject is telling the truth or lying. For a long time, the standard has been the polygraph machine. Unfortunately it's also widely believed to be unreliable and to be inadmissible in a court of law, so today we're going to look at the hard data to see what polygraphs can and cannot do, and what other lie detection techniques may be on the immediate horizon, and how they fare in comparison. So put out that fire on your pants, and sit back.
   </p>
   <p>
    Polygraph machines haven't changed much since the earliest versions were introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century. They combine readings of blood pressure, respiration, pulse rate, and skin conductance, graphing these out with moving needles on a paper scroll. The idea is that these readings will change based on your stress level as you tell a lie. While that basic concept is sound, the problem  and it's a big one  is that any real effect is lost under a sea of other variables. Not only can the subject manipulate all of those readings with simple actions (biting the tongue, poking oneself with a hidden sharp object or fingernail, or even clinching the anal sphincter muscle), but the results are highly dependent upon the interaction between the subject and the polygrapher.
   </p>
   <p>
    A large part of a polygraph test consists of the presentation. The machine is intended to be intimidating, as are all the wires and sensors attached to the subject's body; as are actions by the polygrapher such as marking with a pen on the scroll at mysterious intervals. The polygrapher always begins by making you feel that you are very easy to read; for example, by asking you to lie to an innocent question like whether you're wearing blue jeans, and then looking at the results and reacting as if you are the most comically easiest person to read ever. The whole show is designed to make you anxious about lying; so that if you
    <em>
     do
    </em>
    lie during the test, your stress will hopefully rise high enough above the noise level to actually give a useful reading. If you go in knowing all of this, knowing that you're not overmatched and that this is a fair fight, you've got a great chance of yielding no useful results, whether you have anything to hide or not.
   </p>
   <p>
    But more than that, the reading of polygraph results is completely subjective. There was a famous case in 1978 of a man named Floyd "Buzz" Fay, arrested for a murder he had nothing to do with, and who was convicted based on a polygrapher's analysis of a lie detector test. Fay's appeal included reports from four other polygraphers who examined the same charts and concluded there was no evidence of any deception. Fay was ultimately released when other investigations found the true killer, and he then became a keystone of the fight against the use of polygraph tests in courts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Fay was not the only data point. In 1983, soon after Fay was released, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment published
    <em>
     Scientific Validity of Polygraph Testing: A Research Review and Evaluation.
    </em>
    This technical memorandum found:
   </p>
   <div class="noprint">
   </div>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      ...There is at present only limited scientific evidence for establishing the validity of polygraph testing. Even where the evidence seems to indicate that polygraph testing detects deceptive subjects better than chance, significant error rates are possible, and examiner and examinee differences and the use of countermeasures may further affect validity.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    As of 1993, the United State Federal Rules of Evidence follow what's called the
    <a href="http://www.daubertontheweb.com/polygraph.htm" target="_blank">
     Daubert standard
    </a>
    , which requires a judge to accept data based only on proven science. The fallout from this allowed polygrapher testimony on a case-by-case basis. Whereas lie detector tests had been virtually unheard of in courtrooms since 1923, the 1983 case
    <em>
     United States v. Scheffer
    </em>
    used Daubert to allow a defendant to present polygraph data based on his Sixth Amendment rights in cases where the court could not conclusively disprove this
    <em>
     particular
    </em>
    polygraph test to have been unscientific! In short, the Scheffer decision allows the Daubert standard to be used in exactly the opposite way it was intended; somewhat along the lines of Mark Twain's comment that "The first and last aim and object of the law and lawyers was to defeat justice."
   </p>
   <p>
    But in other cases, the government stood firm on the science. In 1998, the
    <a href="http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-eppa.htm" target="_blank">
     Employee Polygraph Protection Act
    </a>
    was established to prevent most private employers from requiring employees and potential employees to take lie detector tests for any reason. And in 2003, the National Research Council published
    <em>
     The Polygraph and Lie Detection,
    </em>
    416 pages of research analysis pertaining to the use of polygraphy in security screening, which concluded:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      Almost a century of research in scientific psychology and physiology provides little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy. Although psychological states often associated with deception do tend to affect the physiological responses that the polygraph measures, these same states can arise in the absence of deception. Moreover, many other psychological and physiological factors  also affect those responses. Such phenomena make polygraph testing intrinsically susceptible to producing erroneous results.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    In response to such blows, the lie detection industry has turned to other technologies. Perhaps the worst is voice pitch analysis, used over the telephone by some insurance companies. Software looks for changes in the voice pitch of the customer on the other end of the line, variously called "Layered Voice Analysis" or "Voice Risk Analysis". The vendors of such software point to reductions in fraudulent claims. But in a 2009 paper,
    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/12/voice-analysis-system-vra" target="_blank">
     researchers determined
    </a>
    that any benefit realized was simply the result of the customers being informed that lie detection technology was in place. Said one of its authors, any reduction in fraud  "is no proof of validity, just a demonstration that it is possible to take advantage of a bluff." Social psychologists refer to this tendency for people to be more honest when they believe they are being monitored as the "
    <a href="http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Bogus_Pipeline" target="_blank">
     bogus pipeline
    </a>
    ."
   </p>
   <p>
    With existing methodologies for detecting lies essentially all discredited, an arms race began, with the lie detection industry (and all who might benefit from it) hot in pursuit of a reliable technology. Tracking of eye movements and pupil dilation has been studied for a number of years now, based on the theory that your brain has to work harder when it's lying. This workload, called cognitive load, keeps the brain busy and results in a subsequent reduction in the number of random eye movements. In
    <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/254082374_LIE_Detection_by_Inducing_Cognitive_Load_Eye_Movements_and_Other_Cues_to_the_False_Answers_of_Witnesses_to_Crimes" target="_blank">
     one 2012 study
    </a>
    , researchers assigned test subjects to watch a video of a crime and then either answer questions about it truthfully, or make up an unrehearsed lie about it, or retell a rehearsed lie. They used discriminant analysis, which is a statistical method for separating objects into two or more classes, and achieved 69% accuracy at which of the three groups a given subject belonged to. This is double what random chance would predict, but still wrong a third of the time; not reliable enough for most real-world applications.
   </p>
   <div class="noprint">
   </div>
   <p>
    But the Holy Grail for lie detection is to look directly into the subject's brain to see definitively whether they're telling the truth or not. For many, this suggests the use of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) which can show where blood oxygen usage is most active within the brain in real time. The hope is that lies and truths will show different areas of the brain being used, but this is a  complex prospect. First, we don't understand the brain well enough to make any predictions about what we'd expect to see; second, everyone's brain is different; and third, there's no reason to suspect that fMRI lie detection would be any more immune to countermeasures than would polygraphs. Nevertheless, neuroscientists have been working with this idea for nearly as long as we've had magnetic resonance technology.

     2013 review
    </a>
    published in
    <em>
     Frontiers in Human Neuroscience
    </em>
    sought to determine whether we might reasonably expect answers to these questions, including broader questions such as whether it will ever be politically or socially acceptable to allow direct intrusion into our brains  the ultimate loss of privacy. But it seems we might not even get to that point, as even the underlying science, at least so far, has been shaky. The authors wrote:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      ...Following our assessments of the science underpinning fMRI as a lie detector and how this relates to the law, we must conclude that the current state of this technology, and potentially the technology per se, fails to meet either acceptable scientific or legal standards.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    In particular, they noted
    <a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/8/830.long" target="_blank">
     a 2003 paper
    </a>
    published in
    <em>
     Cerebral Cortex
    </em>
    in which investigators found initially encouraging results, that rehearsed lies registered quite differently from spontaneous lies:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      fMRI revealed that well-rehearsed lies that fit into a coherent story elicit more activation in right anterior frontal cortices than spontaneous lies that do not fit into a story, whereas the opposite pattern occurs in the anterior cingulate and in posterior visual cortex... At least in part, distinct neural networks support different types of deception.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    But then they went on to note some discouraging qualifications to this apparent success:

    <p>
     <em>

     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And the more research done, the more disheartening the results have been.
    <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910014552" target="_blank">
     A study published
    </a>
    in
    <em>
     NeuroImage
    </em>
    in 2011 gave participants the task of trying to defeat the fMRI lie detection using techniques as simple as wiggling a finger or toe in association with a given stimulus. Without the countermeasures and with cooperating subjects, the researchers were able to discriminate between lies and truths up to 100% of the time after practice on any given single subject; but once the subjects used these simple countermeasures, accuracy dropped to 33%, significantly below random chance. The authors made three concluding points:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     <em>
      Activation in prefrontal cortex distinguishes lies from truth in single subjects.
      <br/>
      Countermeasures can disrupt single subject FMRI-based deception detection.
      <br/>
      Caution needs to be used in applying these methods in real-world settings.
     </em>
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    An understatement, it would seem. This is never going to be an easy problem. We can measure a heart rate. We can tell whether a bone is broken or not. But determining deception is not a binary question, and never will be; because lies cover spectrums in multiple directions. As Greek statesman Demosthenes said, "A man is his own easiest dupe, for what he wishes to be true he generally believes to be true." The gradations among deceptions will always be as complex as every human mind, augmented with the subtleties of every situation and every story. It seems that for the foreseeable future of our understanding of the mind, reliable lie detection will always remain a fool's errand.

      @Arcane: There have been some catastrophic failures in government polygraph tests, such as Aldrich Ames, who was examined several times when suspected of espionage and passed. I imagine that the government still uses the polygraph because a majority of people are not actually spies armed with countermeasures, but easily intimidated.

      Michael,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      That is correct.  The polygraphers did miss Aldrich Ames.  Just so you know, the polygraph community went through a pretty thorough rethinking of everything that occurred, and this specific issue is addressed by John Sullivan in his book, Gatekeeper.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In that book, Sullivan actually discusses that the individual who conducted Ames' polygraph indicated deception with regards to questions regarding financial concerns and contact with foreign nationals, although he disagreed with him on this.  He goes into much more detail about those tests in his book.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The polygraph also has many successes.  Sullivan discusses many of them in his book, but three of the most notable that I remember was a  member of the Vietcong, another was a Cuban agent, and another Czech.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Indeed, one of the authors of the NAS report cited here, Dr. Kathryn Laskey, admits that the polygraph can be effective.  Initially, she made sweeping statements to the press that, "No spy has ever been caught as a result of polygraph testing."  However, the next say she retracted this statement, saying that, "As soon as those words were out of my mouth, I wanted to take them back."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So, yes, the polygraph process missed Aldrich Ames.  But if you're going to bring him up, you can't ignore the polygraph processes' success stories, either.

      How does one determine that elevated heart rate, galvanic skin response, etc. are sings of deception rather than merely nervousness? Do they have ways of dealing with the countermeasures?

      Michael,
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Good question.  Based upon what I know, there are a few approaches to this subject.  Generally, polygraphers such as Sullivan usually establish a good rapport with the subject and try to calm them down from the get go and keep them calm throughout.  Very adversarial polygraph operators seem to make mistakes, so my understanding is that this approach is generally opposed by folks in the APA and the leading polygraph schools.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Regarding countermeasures, some of the citations in this podcast discuss them.  There are also anti-polygraph activists who work with people to teach them techniques that may help them beat the polygraph, such as Doug Williams, who you may be interested in looking up.  He has published a book on this subject that you can probably find online somewhere.  Michael Shermer interviewed him at some point in the past.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As far as what new techniques the community has implemented to tackle countermeasures since the 2002 NAS report came out, I think you'd have to contact them to ask what they have done.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I think it's important to note that the polygraph community is generally very open to criticism, and they actually released a fairly kind statement about the NAS report.  The Reid Institute's courses on the subject are almost nine months long now.  Back in the 60s, polygraph schools only had courses a few weeks long because they did not have a good understanding of the pros and cons of it like they do now.

      Something else that I think is very important to note is that replicability is a very big concern in the various studies discussing different polygraph techniques in various polygraph journals.  Also, in the real world, for example, Sullivan notes that it is not at all uncommon for an individual to be called back in to have the polygraph re-administered, and complaints by subjects about specific polygraphers will generally result in the test being re-administered by a different polygrapher.  The results are always compared.  Additionally, the polygraph is not a "pass-fail" test--"inconclusive" is also a result of some polygraph tests, although this is not a desirable outcome.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Being that I have discussed Sullivan a great deal, I would also point you to a book: Forensic Psychophysiology Using the Polygraph.  There is an edition published in 1996 and two supplements in 2002 and 2012.  Countermeasures are discussed and it contains a whole slew of studies regarding different polygraph techniques and methodologies, totaling some 1,000-something pages (apparently page count is important, since this podcast explicitly mentions the NAS report's count).
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Also, here's a study of "Validated Polygraph Techniques" by Donald Krapohl that discusses some of the different techniques used:

      It seems to me that the core of the polygraph test is to find a culprit rather than to find "the" culprit.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The number of falsely imprisoned persons - some even on death row - grows daily - as incompetent trials in the past are recognised, fudged evidence files, inaccurate forensics and biased judges and juries are exposed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      What is in part responsible for all this is the existence of an almost total adversarial system in court jurisprudence. Juries cannot submit questions to be asked of witnesses, and judges often have no searching and questioning role
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The polygraph belongs to the nonsense of a totally adversarial system of trial and inquiry
      <br/>
      <br/>
      So what if it doesn't work? - so long as it supplies convictions, closes files, and is good for the solved crime figures.  So what if the innocent rot in jails for years on end? - there are plenty of people, and mothers will breed more to keep up supply for the jail big business.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Polygraphs need one thing more than anything else - They need whistleblowers so that this electronic crap can be cast where it belongs - on a midden heap of failed witchcraft that includes electric treatment of asthma and "neurasthenia", magnetic underpants to improve erections and medicines composed of a dilution of about one drop to several swimming pools
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Bosh I say - all bosh.  Witchity-poo nonsense bordering on fraud.

      Having been processed through the US government security program, I can say that polygraph tests are not about detecting the lies.  It's all about  trying to evaluate how you act under pressure.  At least that is the clear takeaway that I got; anecdotal as it may be.  If you are easily stressed under pressure, you are a greater risk of being coerced by somebody that is trying to access government secrets.  It is completely subjective as is the myriad of other parts of the process, like interviewing your high school teachers and neighbors.  It is just another tool in large chest that is used to decide if you pass.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      As far as the police, anything that they can do to get a suspect to open up and start talking/answering questions may yield useful information that may help guide the investigation later on down the line.  The questioning technique (skill) of the tester, can guide a subject to unwittingly reveal information that although not submittable, may be used as a background to develop questions that are asked in followup interviews.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The value of a polygraph has little to do with detecting lies.

      The McCarthy era demonstrated that it is very easy for authority to paint a person in the colours it chooses.  By the time McCarthy had been ridiculed careers and lives of innocent people had been ruined
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I am interested in Nabber's suggestion that the Polygraph is about evaluating how one acts under pressure - If so every case where the Polygraph played a role in court should be retried under new parameters and new juries
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Reaction to stress is dependent on what you believe your circumstances to be.  In the case of the Polygraph it is quite easy to ascertain.  Just tell the Polygraph operator to take his piece of witchety-poo crap and shove it up his MFA
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I'm sure you'll find out.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One of the disasters in present intelligence gathering is the delusion that mental or physical torture will get you the information you want to know in a reliable and accurate form that will be a shape-changer for the situation on the ground
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Why then is it American Foreign policy that uses force has failed again and again?  Could it just be that the bullying method just does not work in the long term, and rather what is required is persuasion? - which could start with absolutely rigid adherence to Human Rights.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Could it also be that the great American, gun happy, market capitalist, user pays, administratively corrupted  society, dominated by billionaires and evangelical Right Wing religious nutters is less attractive than Americans like to think?  It sure as hell ain't Democracy

      Some interesting comments here from Arcane, thanks for posting.  But in response, I must say that I'm inclined to agree with a point hinted at by some of the other posters - that the successes of polygraphs probably come from "bluffing" (applying intense psychological pressure in a highly disconcerting and stressful environment) to the subject until they "crack" and betray themselves rather than any inherent lie-detecting quality of the technology itself.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I think the point that Brian fairly made in this episode is that there does not seem to be any scientific, quantitative body of data for lie-detector technology consistently and reliably identifying liars (and conversely, never falsely accusing truth-tellers). What's needed here is a statistically significant data set with a large sample size of observations... Selective anecdotes about the times lie-detectors have "worked" is not compelling evidence in this case.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I also think Brian fairly made the point that if you are going to use this technology in ways that potentially have hugely damaging impacts on peoples lives, then you have to be confident that the technology is very close to 100% reliable... even being right, say, two thirds of the time is nowhere near good enough for use in fields such as law enforcement or courts of law.

      Having listened to the episode, I have a followup question. Several years ago, I heard about a technique (I forget where) which allegedly took advantage of the tendency of the brain to react differently to images it had seen before versus those that it hadn't seen before. The source in question argued that this brain reaction was "automatic" and so couldn't be fooled by the traditional lie detector tactics.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In order to use this approach as a lie detector, the source suggested that a subject would be hooked up to a brain scanner of some sort and then shown a series of images, some neutral and some associated with a crime scene. If the scan results revealed that the person recognized the images of the crime scene (especially if they had testified that they had never been there before) then that might implicate them in the crime.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Now, I'm skeptical about this technique because obviously there's a lot of problems with it, even if it does exist. (For example, if the person had been to the crime scene before, or had seen images of the crime scene in the media, then their brain would indicate that they had seen those images before.) But, regardless of those issues, I was wondering if anyone had heard anything about this approach before.
