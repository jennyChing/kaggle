        Download the Trademan package
       </a>
       to the 
directory where you want to install
it. This means that you should "
       <u>
        Save this program to disk
       </u>
       "
or whatever similar option is offered by your browser. If you choose
the "Open it" or "Run this program form its current location," you will
not know where the file is after downloading.
      </li>
      <li>
       Click the download link to get started. Choose a convenient folder
or create a new one to store the download. Avoid downloading to your
\windows\desktop folder, since this will put shortcuts for the downloaded
file and anything it expands to onto your desktop.
      </li>
      <li>
       The download should result in a file named "wtrade.zip" sitting in the
directory you chose for the download.
      </li>
      <li>
       Unzip "wtrade.zip" in the folder you want to install Trademan into.
      </li>
      <li>
       If you want a shortcut to Trademan on your desktop, find the icon in the folder
and copy it to the desktop.
      </li>
      <li>
       Look over the Readme.txt file for some helpful suggestions on how to get
started.
      </li>
      <li>
       Use your browser to view the "READ ME FIRST.html" file.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      After you have installed Trademan, execute trademan.exe from your
desktop icon or from Windows Explorer. A license agreement will pop up
before you get the Control Panel. Please read the license agreement carefully.
Once you have the Control Panel up, just click the Plot button and see
what happens.
