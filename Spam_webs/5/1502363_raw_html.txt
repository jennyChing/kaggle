            Features of the 2010 version of SharePoint
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           SharePoint 2010 offers businesses a platform to build websites and control all the business needs. This version of SharePoint prides itself on being a Business Collaboration Platform and a one-stop shop for all business needs. It will have what you need to make sure the job is done. Whether you are technological savvy or still dabbling, 2010 has the means to be able to help you improve your online resources.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Management Control
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           SharePoint 2010 has a keyword support system that helps with metatagging. You can track all of your records through a content organizer and eDiscovery for searching. You can also manage your audio, image, and video files through the management of digital assets. Finally, you can use content farms to define the type of content you are using.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Application Integration
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           The Business Data Connectivity Service on SharePoint 2007 was overhauled in 2010. It is now known as Application Integration and is designed to help create Web 2.0 blogs and more. You do not need a developer to help you with the keywords and you have the ability to update external data.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Social Computing Ability
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           SharePoint 2010 has really pushed the social computing abilities further than what 2007 had to offer. There are more features available to allow interactive networking to take place. Along with the blogs, you can create tagging, comments, and activity feeds for users to use. There is also the ability to search for people and work spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Greater Business Intelligence
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           With SharePoint 2010, you do not have to be well versed in the technology field to be able to use the software. While analysts may find it easier, regular users will be able to understand what is going on within their business in all the various departments. There is also the addition of Performance Point Services that allow users to create dashboards to serve their needs and wizards will walk them through creating SQL servers.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Enterprise Search
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           With this version, you will have an extensive search feature that puts 2007 to shame. You will be able to install solutions and use the fastest search feature on the market. The search is also more interactive and offers related searches to assist in finding exactly what you need. You can also tag for easier finds.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are many more differences between the 2007 and 2010, but these are the key features. The improvements help businesses with content management and venturing into social computing. The intelligence offered with 2010 is also a lot higher, allowing non-technical executives the ability to manage their own online information. You will be able to

           , both online and off. You will also see a boost in company morale with the ability to bring in better business.
