Your ancestors couldn't. It is only in the last 9,000 years that human adults have gained that ability without becoming ill. Children could manage it, but it was only when we turned to dairy farming that adults acquired the ability to properly digest milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that cultures with a history of dairy farming and milk drinking have a much higher frequency of lactose tolerance &ndash; and its associated gene &ndash; than those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking milk is just one of example of the way that traditions and cultural practices can influence the path of our evolution. Culture and genetics are traditionally thought of as two separate processes, but researchers are increasingly realising that they are intimately connected, each influencing the natural progression of the other. Scientists call it \"gene-culture co-evolution.\" Why does it matter? If we can pin down how culture influences our genetic makeup &ndash; and how the same processes apply to other creatures too &ndash; then we can be better understand how the way we act as a society today could influence our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example of how culture influences our genes is the relationship between yam farming and malaria resistance. Throughout much of Africa, people are in constant battle with malaria. &lt;a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/\"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, in 2010 there were some 219 million cases of malaria reported worldwide, and 660,000 were fatal. More than 90% of those who died lived in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01x5ctz\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are some people who seem to have a natural defense force. Their red blood cells, normally shaped like flattened disks, are shaped instead like a crescent or sickle. Because of the odd shaped blood cells, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sca/\"&gt;sickle-cell disease can lead to blockages in blood vessels&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn cause pain and organ damage. Under normal circumstances, evolution keeps sickle-cell disease to a minimum because it can be so harmful and can reduce life expectancy. But because of a biological quirk, the sickle-cell gene can actually protect against malaria. So in parts of the world where malaria infection rates are extremely high, like Africa, natural selection may actually favour the sickle-shaped cells. In the gamble of life, protection against malaria may be preferable, even at the potential cost of suffering from sickle-cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's interesting: those communities that farm yams have much higher rates of the sickle-cell gene than nearby communities with different agricultural practices. In order to cultivate yams, trees had to be chopped down. \"The removal of trees had the effect of inadvertently increasing the amount of standing water when it rained, which provided better breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes,\" writes biologist Kevin Laland of the University of St Andrews in &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v11/n2/abs/nrg2734.html\"&gt;Nature Reviews Genetics&lt;/a&gt;. More mosquitos mean more malaria, creating the conditions for sickle-shaped cells to become adaptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while it's sickle-cell disease that's protective against malaria, it was a uniquely human behavior &ndash; yam farming &ndash; that allowed evolution to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all examples of gene-culture co-evolution are quite as beneficial. Polynesians, for example, have a uniquely high prevalence of type II diabetes. It's among the highest worldwide, and is higher even than among neighbouring human populations. One group of researchers has discovered that the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n5/abs/5201793a.html\"&gt;Polynesians have a particularly high frequency of a variant of a gene called &lt;em&gt;PPARGC1A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that may be responsible for their high frequency of type II diabetes, at least in part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01x5d72\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are they so uniquely afflicted by this disease? The researchers think it may have something to do with their ancestors' &lt;a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/restless-genes/dobbs-text\"&gt;culture of exploration&lt;/a&gt;. As the Polynesians settled the islands of the Pacific, they endured long voyages across the open ocean, and faced the stresses of cold and starvation. Those conditions may have encouraged \"thrifty metabolism\", which allows people to build up fat deposits more quickly when food is available. Natural selection may have increased the frequency of associated gene variants among them. However the sort of metabolism that would have been useful to explorers can lead to obesity and type II diabetes for individuals in modern cultures with consistent sources of nourishment. So modern Polynesians may have inherited a susceptibility to type II diabetes not because they lead a sedentary lifestyle, but because their ancestors decided to climb into some canoes and explore their planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these examples are perhaps the best understood examples of gene-culture co-evolution, researchers have identified scores of others. Our domestication of plants may have given a leg up to the genes that allow us to detoxify certain chemical compounds found in the plants we eat. Our history of exploring new territories and unfamiliar climates may have acted upon genes that allow us to tolerate more extreme heat or cold than our ancestors. The invention of cooking may have altered the evolution of our jaw muscles and our tooth enamel. The emergence of language and complex social cognition may have prompted natural selection to further guide the development of our brains and nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01x5dd0\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to assume that cultural influences are unique to humans. Yet some animal species have at least rudimentary cultures, and it would be silly to think that this couldn't influence their genetics just as ours does. It might be happening among the &lt;a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1782/20133245.short\"&gt;dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers led by University of New South Wales biologist Anna Kopps has been studying the bottlenose dolphins of the western part of the bay. A well known form of foraging among these dolphins is \"sponging,\" a behavior that involves carrying a conical sponge to protect their faces as they root around the seafloor looking for food. It's not just an exciting example of tool use; it's also evidence of cultural transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior, as Kopps points out, is \"almost exclusively transmitted from mothers to their offspring through social learning\". That means there's a tight correlation between it and the parts of the young dolphins' genomes that are passed on from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This link does not necessarily provide us with evidence that a cultural behavior has caused alterations in the genetic material, unlike the lactose tolerance, malaria resistance, and thrifty metabolism examples in humans. Still, it's a clue that there could be something more, a hint at a way in which cultural practices in dolphins might create an opportunity for natural selection to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01x5ddp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural influence on our own evolution continues apace, but it is currently nearly impossible to predict just how it will happen. What sorts of genetic adaptations will we see as a result of our technological culture? Will those adaptations apply universally, or only among some of us? How will human-machine interfaces, such as robotic prostheses or neural implants, affect our gene pools? Will the propensity for violent sports in some cultures lead to adaptations to protect against head trauma? And what are the questions we don't even yet realise we should be asking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It no longer makes sense to think of genetics and culture as two separate uninteracting monoliths. The difficulty is identifying how and if one is influencing the other. \"This is the great challenge for the field of gene-culture co-evolution, and it is a formidable challenge,\" Laland writes. \"Nonetheless, the best-researched examples, such as the lactose-tolerance case, not only show that gene-culture co-evolution occurs but also illustrate the means to establish this.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":833850,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SourceHeight":576,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/0y/r9/p00yr909.jpg","SourceWidth":1024,"SynopsisLong":"Uniquely human column - Jason Goldman","SynopsisMedium":"Uniquely human column - Jason Goldman","SynopsisShort":"Uniquely human column - Jason Goldman","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/0y/r9/p00yr909.jpg","Title":"uniquelyHuman-final.jpg","CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00yr909","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00yr909","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p00yr909","_id":"559a674882f2d2dbf7bcd154"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Our animal behaviour uncovered.

If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasas cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

So why are parents and police so nervous about children going out on their own? One reason may be the sense that there are &ldquo;fewer eyes&rdquo; watching over them: &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t entirely be an accident that fears about child safety have risen in tandem with women&rsquo;s workforce participation&rdquo;.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

But when we&rsquo;re exhorted to drink &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120903-is-drinking-water-good-for-skin\"&gt;six or eight glasses of water a day&lt;/a&gt; (a disputed figure that I&rsquo;ve discussed previously), it&rsquo;s usually emphasised that drinks like coffee and tea don&rsquo;t count towards your daily liquid total because they&rsquo;re dehydrating. Or so we&rsquo;re told. What&rsquo;s the evidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although tea and coffee contain many different substances the one on which most research focuses is caffeine. Even then there is so little research on the topic, that one of the most frequently mentioned studies was &lt;a href=\"http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/33/2/167.full.pdf+html\"&gt;conducted way back in 1928&lt;/a&gt; with a sample of just three people. The three men were studied over the course of two winters. Sometimes they were required to drink four cups of coffee a day; sometimes they drank mainly tea and at other times they abstained or drank water laced with pure caffeine. Meanwhile the volume of their urine was measured regularly. The authors concluded that if the men consumed caffeine-laced water after a two month period of abstinence from both coffee and tea, the volume of their urine increased by 50%, but when they drank coffee regularly again they became inured to its diuretic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very large doses of caffeine are known to increase the blood flow to the kidneys and to inhibit the absorption of sodium which explains why it could act as a diuretic, dealing with the sodium which hasn&rsquo;t been absorbed. But the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wp8bk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you look at the studies of more realistic quantities of caffeine, the diuretic effect is not nearly so clear. A review of 10 studies by Lawrence Armstrong from the University of Connecticut concluded that &lt;a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12187618/reload=0;jsessionid=4JJ2WCAlb24kzKm0E3ce.4\"&gt;caffeine is a mild diuretic at most&lt;/a&gt;, with 12 out of 15 comparisons showing that people urinated the same amount, regardless of whether the water they drank contained added caffeine or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do so many people think they need the loo more often when they&rsquo;ve been drinking tea or coffee? As the review indicates, most studies give people pure caffeine added to water, rather than cups of actual tea or coffee as you might drink at home. Is there something about the combination of substances contained in coffee and tea that make the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare study where &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21450118\"&gt;people drank nothing but tea for the 12 hour duration of the trial&lt;/a&gt;, there was no difference in hydration levels between them and the people who drank the same quantity of boiled water. When it comes to the consumption of coffee, one study did find a 41% increase in urine, along with a rise in the excretion of sodium and potassium. But these participants had abstained from caffeine before the study, so this doesn&rsquo;t tell us what would happen in &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9194998\"&gt;people who are accustomed to drinking coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wp8jz\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second study found &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11022872\"&gt;no difference in hydration&lt;/a&gt; between those drinking water or coffee, leaving us with conflicting findings. Then came new research earlier this year from Sophie Killer at Birmingham University in the UK, who not only measured the volume of urine, but &lt;a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0084154%20and%20twice%20as%20many%20cups%20of%20tea\"&gt;tested their blood for signs of kidney function as well&lt;/a&gt; as calculating the total amount of water in the body. The men in the study drank four cups of coffee a day, far more than the average coffee-drinker. Yet there was no evidence they were any more dehydrated than those who drank water alone. This research was funded by the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee, whose members are coffee companies, but it has been published in a peer-reviewed journal and the authors confirm that the Institute played no role in gathering or analysing the data or writing up the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So although we might notice needing the loo more when we&rsquo;ve been drinking coffee, the mistake is basing our observations on a comparison with the time we&rsquo;ve drunk nothing, not with a similar amount of water. If you chose a glass of water instead of a cup of tea, you&rsquo;d probably see the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Google+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can hear more Medical Myths on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health Check on the BBC World Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

I remember looking down and seeing purple nail polish on the thumb,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and I was suddenly even more aware of the fact that these belong to somebody who just passed away.&rdquo; Now, two-and-a-half years later, the hands are very much her own. But it hasn&rsquo;t been easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess, who lost her hands to an infection, is the beneficiary of a futuristic surgical procedure. Only 70 people around the world have received a full new replacement hand. Ess is one of the few to have two. &ldquo;This is the first time in the history of body parts that we&rsquo;ve been able to restore body parts rather than reconstruct them,&rdquo; says Dr Scott Levin, Ess&rsquo;s surgeon and the director of the Penn Hand Transplant Program. So what&rsquo;s it like to be a recipient?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand transplants are rare, and not everybody is a good candidate. Candidates have to go through a battery of tests to make sure that they&rsquo;re healthy enough to not only go through with the procedure, but stay on immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives to ensure their body doesn&rsquo;t reject their new body parts. &ldquo;I can't even explain all the tests they did to me,&rdquo; Ess says, &ldquo;it was days and days.&rdquo; After a year of testing and preparing, Ess was cleared to go ahead with the transplant &ndash; and then she waited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, in late September, a donor set of hands became available. Ess entered the operating room, and with the help of 12 surgeons emerged with a new pair of hands. The procedure requires doctors to reconnect bones, muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries and veins layer by layer, using microscopes to reattach the tiny pieces. First the bones are reattached, and then blood flow is established to the replacement limb by recoupling arteries and veins. After that, the tendons, nerves and skin are all reconnected. Microsurgery of this kind has been used for years to reattach fingers in emergency situations, but now doctors are using it in more controlled scenarios to reattach a whole arm. Twelve hours of delicate reattachment later, and Ess had two new hands. &ldquo;And then the hard work started,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w8h95\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess spent months in therapy &ndash; five hours a day of stretching, bending, reaching, and trying to encourage her own nerves and muscles to fuse and grow into the new hands. At first, her hand therapist simply moved her hands for her, as she tried to remember what it was like to move her own fingers. &ldquo;A lot of it is mental,&rdquo; Ess says, &ldquo;because your nerves have to regenerate, but your mind also has to regenerate the thought of moving your finger.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&rsquo;t until three months after her surgery that Ess could move her new hands at all. &ldquo;I raised my arms up, just to stretch, and I looked up and them and my right pointer finger and right middle finger moved a little bit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I kind of freaked out. I thought it was a freak thing that one time, but I could do it again, and again. That might have been my first time when I was like &lsquo;wow, these are my hands&rsquo;.&rdquo; Today, two-and-a-half years after her transplant, Ess still goes to therapy once or twice a week for an hour-and-a-half. She&rsquo;ll probably go to therapy forever, she says, but it&rsquo;s worth it to regain control over her life. &ldquo;It takes a lot of persistence and diligence,&rdquo; to make this procedure successful, Ess says. &ldquo;You need a good fight inside of you.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w8h6z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the hands has transformed her life. &ldquo;I live by myself, I have a dog, I drive, I have normal stuff that I do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;These transplants may not be life saving, they are certainly quality-of-life altering,&rdquo; says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still things Ess can&rsquo;t quite do with her hands, like put her hair up behind her back, or rummage around in a full purse and pull something out without looking. &ldquo;Say I want to get a chip out of a bag, I can do that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chex_Mix\"&gt;Chex Mix&lt;/a&gt; I can&rsquo;t pick out my favourite, the pretzels.&rdquo; That will come with practice and therapy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess says she now sees the hands as her own. Some of that has to do with re-growing the crucial nerves from her body into her hands that allow her to bend and flex her fingers. And some of it is simply the time it takes for a body to adjust to a new addition, whether it&rsquo;s prosthetic or transplanted. Research has shown that the brain can integrate apparently foreign objects into our perceived body image. Perhaps the most famous example of this is the &lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21729052.500-the-self-trick-yourself-into-an-outofbody-experience.html#.UzL83c4Yvms\"&gt;rubber hand illusion&lt;/a&gt;, where researchers manipulate an able-bodied person&rsquo;s sense of touch and perception to induce the feeling that a fake hand is their own (see video, below). For those with the new hand actually transplanted onto them, that feeling is even more convincing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"The-Rubber-Hand-Illusion-Horizo\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand transplants are probably never going to be the go-to option for everybody, says Levin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a trade-off. You have prostheses that break, or you have hand transplants that look and can feel normal, but you&rsquo;re taking medicine for the rest of your life to keep them from being rejected.&rdquo; Prosthetic technology is advancing alongside transplants too, and some day amputees will be able to choose between really good options to replace their lost limbs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the patient&rsquo;s choice,&rdquo; says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ess says she still thinks about whoever donated their body parts and helped her live her life again. But apart from that hint of nail varnish when she woke up, Ess doesn&rsquo;t know anything about that person, and it&rsquo;s likely to stay that way. &ldquo;We are very cautious about not revealing the donor to the recipient,&rdquo; Levin says. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know anything, nor is it fair for a recipient to know anything.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than anything, Ess is grateful to her donor. She says her second thought after waking up from surgery was &ldquo;just being utterly thankful, that I survived and that somebody gave me such a gift,&rdquo; she says. And even though it&rsquo;s been hard, she&rsquo;s happy she did it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any regrets at all, not even one.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-27T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"I had a double hand transplant","HeadlineShort":"I had a double hand transplant","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Imagine looking down at your hands and seeing fingers that arent your own.

February 1935, the year of King George V&rsquo;s Silver Jubilee, a chimpanzee at London Zoo called Boo-Boo &lt;a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/just-boo-boos-baby\"&gt;gave birth to a baby daughter&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of months later, a little blonde-haired girl was given a soft-toy replica of the zoo&rsquo;s new arrival to mark her first birthday. This was Jane Goodall&rsquo;s first recorded encounter with a chimp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall turns 80 this week&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;In the intervening years, her research on a community of chimpanzees in Tanzania revolutionised our understanding of these primates, our closest living relatives, and challenged deepset ideas of what it means to be human. She then packed in her fieldwork to become an activist, campaigning tirelessly for a more enlightened attitude towards animals and the environment. Along the way she has &lt;a href=\"http://www.janegoodall.org/sites/default/files/images/Jane%20Goodall%27s%20Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf\"&gt;received nearly 50 honorary degrees&lt;/a&gt;, and became a UN Messenger of Peace in 2002 and Dame Jane in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though I have only crossed London to meet her, I am struck by the sudden feeling that I have reached the end of some epic, Henry Stanley-like quest&hellip; &ldquo;Dr Goodall?&rdquo; As I reach out to shake a slender hand, the words &ldquo;I presume&rdquo; pop into my head. I suppress them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I follow her into the front room and she politely offers me tea or coffee. There is a sofa beneath the bay window and next to it &ndash; as if only just put aside &ndash; a large book. I pick up &lt;a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-28/books/bk-741_1_jane-goodall\"&gt;The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior&lt;/a&gt;, Goodall&rsquo;s magnum opus published in 1986. I flip through its characterful portraits of the Gombe chimps, many of them &ndash; like David Greybeard &ndash; now household names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall sits down neatly on the sofa with her back to the bright sun. This is a brief pause in her whirlwind travel schedule of more than 300 days a year, but she displays few signs of weariness &ndash; worldly or otherwise. She has just been going through proofs of her updated book Seeds of Hope, the first edition of which was troubled by allegations of plagiarism. I don&rsquo;t want to broach the subject so early in the interview; I ask instead about her childhood, which I sense is of great importance to understanding Goodall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having seen a photograph of that doting little girl clutching &lt;a href=\"http://www.lessonsforhope.org/scrapbook1.asp?sec=2&amp;pgid=21\"&gt;Jubilee&lt;/a&gt;, her somewhat scruffy birthday chimp, I love the idea that this fluffy character influenced what Goodall would go on to achieve. On this, however, she sets me straight. When she first ventured to Africa in 1957, Goodall says, it had never occurred to her to work with chimpanzees. Rather, she had a far less specific and more romantic dream inspired by fictional characters from the books she had read as a child, notably Dr Dolittle and Tarzan. &ldquo;I never wanted to be a scientist per se,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I wanted to be a naturalist.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0hp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall tells a story from her childhood that demonstrates how fixated she was by the Africa of her imagination. As a special treat, her mother, Vanne, had taken her to the cinema to see her first Tarzan film. When the curtains drew back to reveal Johnny Weissmuller in the starring role, however, the young Goodall burst into a fit of hysterical tears. In the quiet of the foyer, she composed herself and told her mother firmly: &ldquo;That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Tarzan.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she describes her earliest experiences of Africa, however, they don&rsquo;t sound all that different from the jungles of her dreams. Not long after arriving in Kenya, Goodall captured the attention of &lt;a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990619,00.html\"&gt;Louis Leakey&lt;/a&gt;, the eminent palaeoanthropologist and curator of the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi. Within hours of meeting, she had so impressed him with her knowledge of natural history that he had offered her a job. Within months, Leakey and his wife, Mary, set out on an expedition to Olduvai Gorge in what is now northern Tanzania, and Goodall went too. The place was teeming with wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There were lions and rhinos and giraffes &ndash; I mean, &lt;em&gt;everything &lt;/em&gt;was there,&rdquo; she recalls with a flash of excitement. &ldquo;I often think that&rsquo;s one of the most magical times of my whole life.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was while scouring this ancient landscape for evidence of early humans and other hominids that Leakey first mentioned the idea of establishing a complementary study on wild chimpanzees to the west, at the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve on the edge of Lake Tanganyika. Three years later, in 1960, Goodall entered the reserve to begin her research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had only ever been one concerted attempt to study chimps in the wild &ndash; and that scientist &ldquo;had a trail of 22 porters&rdquo;, Goodall says with a hint of pride in her voice. For the first few months in Gombe, it was just her, her mother and a single hired assistant. &ldquo;I wanted to be alone,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but I wasn't allowed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall pauses, revisiting that period in her mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget going along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika, then looking up&hellip;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0jp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up there, in the densely forested valleys that funnel streams off steep hills to the water&rsquo;s edge, were the chimpanzees she had come to study. With the assistance of a game warden who acted as escort, Goodall and her mother put up their ex-army tent. &ldquo;If you wanted air to come in, you just rolled up the sides and tied them with tape,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Well, the air came in, but the spiders, scorpions and snakes came in as well.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although her mother was terrified &ndash; &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m afraid of spiders!&rdquo; &ndash; Goodall was apparently fearless, setting off up the slopes to explore her new home. &ldquo;I sat up there and just couldn&rsquo;t imagine I was there. It seemed absolutely unreal.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture Goodall paints &ndash; a folding camp bed beside a palm tree in a forest clearing beneath a bright moon, the sound of baboons barking in the distance &ndash; could have come straight from an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. I wonder if the realisation of so fantastical a childhood dream has helped her stay connected to her youth &ndash; but again she sets me straight. Rather it is The Birches, the home near Bournemouth in which she grew up: when not travelling, this is where Goodall still returns, to &ldquo;all my childhood books, the trees I climbed as a child, the cliffs where I walked&hellip; I am blessed in this way.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her first stint in the field, Goodall struggled to get close to the chimps. However, the individual she named David Greybeard proved a particular inspiration, showing her a side to chimpanzees nobody had ever documented before. In late October 1960, she watched David from a distance as he gnawed away at the freshly killed corpse of what was probably a baby bush pig &ndash; an observation that ran counter to the then-widespread assumption that chimps were strict vegetarians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Goodall witnessed David making and using a tool to feed on ants. I ask her to describe this moment in detail: &ldquo;There was vegetation in the way and David had his back to me&hellip; so what I saw was the hand picking up the tool. I saw the movements. And I saw it was obvious he was eating&hellip;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once David had moved off, Goodall went to investigate and discovered long stalks of grass lying around. Picking a stalk up, she pushed it into one of the narrow entrance holes to the ant colony. The disturbance caused ants to emerge. The chimps, presumably, would then lick them off the grass. After subsequent, clearer sightings of this behaviour, Goodall went to Leakey with the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I knew it was very important because I&rsquo;d been around Leakey long enough,&rdquo; she says. At that point, most people believed humans were the only species capable of making and using tools. In response to Goodall&rsquo;s observations of David and others, Leakey famously declared: &ldquo;Now we must redefine &lsquo;tool&rsquo;, redefine &lsquo;man&rsquo;, or accept chimpanzees as humans.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0lf\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am suddenly aware that Goodall is watching me, back perfectly upright, hands in her lap. She keeps very still, her soft green eyes studying my face as she waits patiently for my next question. I feel a peculiar, strangely comforting empathy with David Greybeard and the other Gombe chimps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Leakey&rsquo;s excitement over Goodall&rsquo;s early findings, not everyone was ready to embrace them. In late 1961, she arrived in Cambridge, where Leakey had used his connections to enrol her for a doctorate &ndash; not something Goodall wanted to do. &ldquo;I was only doing this thesis for Leakey&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;d never had an ambition to be a scientist and be part of academia.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patronising treatment Goodall received at the hands of her mainly male colleagues can hardly have endeared her to the academic lifestyle. She was criticised for giving her study-animals names and personalities. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give them personalities, I merely described their personalities,&rdquo; she counters. As for Goodall&rsquo;s reported discovery that chimps used tools: &ldquo;Some scientists actually said I must have taught them.&rdquo; She laughs. &ldquo;That would have been fabulous if I could have done that.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I try to imagine receiving this kind of dismissive treatment, and suspect I would have been infuriated, then crushed. Not Goodall. She says she simply knew that she was right and her critics were wrong. I ask where this conviction came from and, as an explanation, she returns to her youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;My mother always taught us that if people don&rsquo;t agree with you, the important thing is to listen to them. But if you&rsquo;ve listened to them carefully and you still think that you&rsquo;re right, then you must have the courage of your convictions.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when her Cambridge colleagues told her she couldn&rsquo;t talk about chimps having personality, mind and emotion, she begged to differ &ndash; because of Rusty the black mongrel. &ldquo;Rusty had taught me otherwise. If you spend time with animals, you&rsquo;re not going to betray them by taking away something which is theirs.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rusty, I discover, was one of two dogs with whom Goodall became friendly in her early teens at The Birches. The other, Budleigh, was a beautiful long-haired collie belonging to the owner of the local sweetshop. &ldquo;Collies are meant to be bright but he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Goodall says, recalling how Budleigh proved incapable of learning to shake hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, though, as Goodall continued her efforts to train &ldquo;Buds&rdquo;, Rusty the mongrel (watching at a distance) raised his paw. &ldquo;From that moment I realised Rusty was brilliantly intelligent because, even though I wasn&rsquo;t teaching him, he&rsquo;d learned by observing my teaching of Buds.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am struck by what Goodall did next. The young teenager imagined herself inside Rusty&rsquo;s mind, she says, in an effort to see the world from his perspective and relive the intellectual feat he&rsquo;d just performed. There are not many children I know who&rsquo;d do this, I suggest. She considers for a moment: &ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If her Cambridge colleagues had been patronising, it was nothing compared to the treatment she received at a symposium on primates held at the Zoological Society of London in April 1962. &ldquo;I gave my first scientific presentation and was terrified, says Goodall. &ldquo;I practised for hours,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was determined not to read and not to say &lsquo;er&rsquo; or &lsquo;um&rsquo;. I have remained true to that ever since.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0qd\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three days of talks, the meeting came to a close with a speech by Sir Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist who had studied monkeys in Africa, and gone on to become secretary of the Society and chief science adviser to the Ministry of Defence. Although Goodall had been well received, Zuckerman took the opportunity to fire a volley of pointed comments at the twentysomething newcomer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There are those who are here and who prefer anecdote &ndash; and what I must confess I regard as sometimes unbounded speculation,&rdquo; he told his audience, as recounted in Dale Peterson&rsquo;s biography of Goodall, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/books/Blum.t.html?pagewanted=all\"&gt;The Woman Who Redefined Man&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;In scientific work it is far safer to base one&rsquo;s major conclusions and generalisations on a concordant and large body of data than on a few contradictory and isolated observations, the explanation of which sometimes leaves a little to be desired.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the mention of Zuckerman, Goodall&rsquo;s features sharpen slightly, and the pace of her speech quickens. She dismisses his monkey work as &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;. It is the only bad word she has to say about anyone, and even then she controls the emotion almost before it has appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not Goodall&rsquo;s first run-in with Zuckerman. At the end of 1961, there had been a press conference at London Zoo to announce her preliminary findings &ndash; and she had hatched a plan to use this public platform to call for an improvement in the conditions of the captive chimps at the zoo. &ldquo;There was a bare cage with a cement floor,&rdquo; she explains. During the summer months, the chimps had no shade: &ldquo;It got boiling hot and there was only one platform, the other had broken, so the male got that and the female had to sit on the floor. It was horrible.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the meeting, over dinner with the diplomat Malcolm MacDonald (who had visited her briefly in Gombe and would become Governor-General of Kenya in 1963), Goodall shared her intention to champion the welfare of the captive chimps: &ldquo;I was really excited.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But MacDonald, with his experience as a politician, could see a flaw. Speaking out on behalf of the chimps to a packed auditorium would be a direct criticism of Zuckerman&rsquo;s leadership of the zoo. &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s going to allow a little whipper-snapper who doesn&rsquo;t even have a degree to tell him he&rsquo;s in the wrong?&rdquo; Goodall recalls MacDonald telling her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make an enemy for life, and you don&rsquo;t want an enemy like that.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0r0\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Goodall suggested several simple changes to the chimps&rsquo; enclosure that would improve their welfare, and MacDonald worked behind the scenes to see them implemented. &ldquo;What I learned then is: don&rsquo;t let people lose face, don&rsquo;t try to do something publicly until you&rsquo;ve tried every which way to do it quietly. I&rsquo;ve found that so helpful to me,&rdquo; she says, particularly in places like Africa and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Zuckerman took the credit for the improvements to the chimps&rsquo; enclosure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind two hoots as long as it gets done,&rdquo; Goodall says. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A capacity for seeing the bigger picture may go some way to explaining her success as an activist. She pinpoints her transformation to 1986, and a chimpanzee conference organised by the Chicago Academy of Sciences to coincide with the publication of The Chimpanzees of Gombe. By then, she&rsquo;d spent more than 25 years in the field, completed her PhD, established the Gombe Stream Research Center, got married, raised a son and made further groundbreaking observations on chimpanzee society &ndash; including insights into chimp communication, sex, mother&ndash;infant bonding, inter-community warfare and cannibalism. But at the age of 52, she walked away from the field and turned to a life on the road. &ldquo;How ridiculous, really, when you think about it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What did I think I could do, trotting around Africa with an exhibit of old pictures blown up, and bits of rock and stick?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her initial focus &ndash; facilitated by the Jane Goodall Institute she&rsquo;d established almost a decade earlier to support her chimp research at Gombe &ndash; was to draw attention to the plight of chimpanzees more generally. In the wild, habitat destruction, the bushmeat trade and animal trafficking all posed significant threats to the species&rsquo; future &ndash; and they still do. &ldquo;It is horrendous.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, China is asking African governments for chimpanzees and gorillas for entertainment, Goodall tells me. &ldquo;We feel our sanctuaries, which cost us so much money, aren&rsquo;t safe any more.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find myself being sucked into a vortex of gloom, but Goodall is always ready to offer a reason for hope &ndash; a word that crops up time and again in the titles of her many books. One reason is what she calls &ldquo;the resilience of nature&rdquo;; by way of illustration, she tells me about land reforms in Tanzania in the 1970s that resulted in widespread deforestation around the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0s2\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When I looked down,&rdquo; she recalls of one visit, &ldquo;it was so totally shocking to see our little oasis of Gombe&hellip; It looked like a dust bowl: completely bare hills, overfarmed, more people living there than the land could support.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, as a result of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ehproject.org/phe/jgi-tanzania_final.html\"&gt;Lake Tanganyika Catchment, Reforestation and Education Project&lt;/a&gt;, which her Institute began in 1994, the Gombe chimps now have &ldquo;three to four times more forest than they had ten years ago. It&rsquo;s regenerated so quickly. So we have 30-foot-high trees.&rdquo; I feel better already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half a century since she first engineered improvements to the conditions of the chimpanzees at London Zoo, Goodall is still fighting hard on behalf of captive chimps too. In the 1980s, she raised ethical concerns about their use in xenotransplanation, which led the medical community to steer away from this practice. More recently, she has worked with Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health in the US, to phase out their use of captive chimpanzees in medical research; she is delighted the US Senate voted to increase the budget available for retirement of these chimps. &ldquo;We are beginning to win,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask Goodall if she is in favour of a blanket ban on the use of chimpanzees in medical research. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite say that. But what I can say is that, ethically and morally, I feel it's wrong to use them, and it&rsquo;s absolutely wrong to put them in five-foot by five-foot cages.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall puts chimps at the forefront of the wider debate about the use of experimental animals. &ldquo;At one time, the scientists said we&rsquo;ll always need animals for this &ndash; and now we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If science really puts its mind to getting alternatives&hellip; once they do, they&rsquo;re cheaper and usually safer.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our time almost up, I realise I haven&rsquo;t asked after Mr H, the toy monkey who famously travels with her from one venue to the next. Somehow Goodall the activist doesn&rsquo;t seem complete without him, and I wonder if he might join us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr H stands for Mr Gary Haun, a US marine who lost his eyesight in a helicopter crash at the age of 21, then went on to became a professional magician, climb Mount Kilimanjaro, scuba, sky-dive, and much else besides. &ldquo;He thought he was giving me a stuffed chimp for my birthday,&rdquo; Goodall recalls &ndash; but the soft toy has a tail, so is clearly a monkey. &ldquo;Gary,&rdquo; she told him, as she guided his hand towards the evidence of his mistake, &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t see it&hellip; but you have no excuse.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, Goodall has kept Mr H close as a reminder of another of her reasons for hope: &ldquo;The indomitable human spirit&hellip; He&rsquo;s been to at least 60 countries with me, he&rsquo;s been touched by at least four million people. I say that when you touch him, the inspiration rubs off.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall invites me to touch Mr H &ndash; but instead of inspiration, I have a sudden, parental panic that he might one day go missing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nearly lost him several times but that&rsquo;s the original,&rdquo; she says, stroking him gently. Once, she left him on the top of a telephone kiosk in an airport and had boarded her plane before she realised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get off the plane,&rdquo; she explained to the attendant, adding: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to bolt me in to keep me because I&rsquo;ve left my most precious object outside.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still clutching Mr H, Goodall reaches into her bag and another soft toy peeps out. &ldquo;This is Cow&rdquo; &ndash; a gift handed to her during a recent visit to the dairyland state of Wisconsin. &ldquo;I was going to give Cow to the next deserving child,&rdquo; she explains, but instead she has turned her into &ldquo;a spokesperson&rdquo; for abused farm animals. She looks at the toy and then talks about it as if she&rsquo;s giving it praise. &ldquo;Cow has worked really hard &ndash; she has created I don&rsquo;t know how many vegetarians, even in places like Argentina where they live on meat.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of something I&rsquo;ve read: how Goodall, as a child, loved to arrange tea parties for her soft toys. I wonder if there are others who would like to join us &ndash; but it turns out that Jubilee, her childhood chimpanzee, is in Germany, being fitted for a jumpsuit to hold his failing stitching in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall herself is flying to Germany in a few hours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to D&uuml;sseldorf, then Vienna, then back to Munich&hellip; It still amazes me. Children write to me and say, &lsquo;You taught me, you did it, I can do it too.&rsquo; So this is why I have to go on going around. Because it&rsquo;s making a difference.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0x7\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When not on the move, she concentrates on her writing. In her latest book, Seeds of Hope, she and journalist Gail Hudson champion plants. But the first edition, published last year, was troubled by allegations of plagiarism, with the Washington Post identifying &ldquo;at least a dozen passages borrowed without attribution, or footnotes, from a variety of websites&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall accounts for these lapses by citing her hectic work schedule and her chaotic method of note-taking: &ldquo;I am not methodical enough, I guess,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;In some cases, you look at my notebooks, there&rsquo;s no way you can tell whether this is from talking to somebody or whether it was something I read on the internet.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask if there was any naivety on her part. &ldquo;Yes, there must be&hellip; I have learned. In the future, I shall be more organised even if I don&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I shall certainly make sure I know who said something or what I read or where I read it.&rdquo; Goodall, though, is adamant that she did not intentionally try to pass off anyone else&rsquo;s words as her own. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody who knows me would accuse me of deliberate plagiarism.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a revised edition of Seeds of Hope, to be published this month, Goodall and Hudson have made minor changes to the text to address their critics and added a lengthy notes section. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a book has ever been more researched than this one. The notes at the end are about as long as the book.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask if she&rsquo;s concerned that attention will focus on what she&rsquo;s changed, rather than on the subject matter. &ldquo;Looking back, it has been a godsend,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I am really happy for the sake of the plants that we&rsquo;ve got it right now. I feel this is a book we can really be proud of now.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then she adds, &ldquo;Honestly, Henry, who is going to deliberately go out to give me a bad time?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I go, Goodall wants to show me some drawings she made as a child. They are reproduced in &lt;a href=\"http://childrensbooks.about.com/od/awardwinners/ss/Best-Illustrated-Childrens-Books-of-the-Year-2011_8.htm\"&gt;Me&hellip; Jane&lt;/a&gt;, a children&rsquo;s book by Patrick McDonnell. She finds a copy amid piles of books by or about her, and flips to the relevant page. There, across a double spread, are several meticulous sketches of animals. The wing of a pterodactyl above the wing of an eagle; profiles of a cat, horse, crocodile, dog, chimpanzee and human &ndash; all to scale with their brains neatly coloured in pink pencil. &ldquo;They are not very good,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last two hours in the polite, inspiring company of a woman precisely twice my age. But as she shows me her drawings, I get the feeling I am talking to the 12-year-old Goodall. Finally, when I hold out my hand for her to shake, she spurns it and offers me something far more rewarding: a chimpanzee embrace. Her delicate arms envelop me, slowly, widely, deliberately. There is something categorically different about this hug; something that will stay with me for ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Chimpanzees don&rsquo;t say goodbye,&rdquo; she says. I walk to the door, trying to fathom what to make of this. I turn and call out another farewell, but Goodall doesn&rsquo;t reply.

Its muddy waters are at their fullest, but Fran&ccedil;ois Nosten still crosses them in just a minute, aboard a narrow, wooden boat. In the dry season, he could wade across. As he steps onto the western riverbank, in Myanmar, he passes no checkpoint and presents no passport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air is cool. After months of rain, the surrounding jungle pops with vivid lime and emerald hues. Nosten climbs a set of wooden slats that wind away from the bank, up a muddy slope. His pace, as ever, seems relaxed and out of kilter with his almost permanently grave expression and urgent purpose. Nosten, a rangy Frenchman with tousled brown hair and glasses, is one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on malaria. He is here to avert a looming disaster. At the top of the slope, he reaches a small village of simple wooden buildings with tin and thatch roofs. This is Hka Naw Tah, home to around 400 people and a testing ground for Nosten&rsquo;s bold plan to completely stamp out malaria from this critical corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria is the work of the single-celled &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; parasites, with &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/em&gt; being chief among them. They spread between people through the bites of mosquitoes, invading first the liver, then the red blood cells. The first symptoms are generic and flu-like: fever, headache, sweats and chills, vomiting. At that point, the immune system usually curtails the infection. But if the parasites spread to the kidneys, lungs and brain, things go downhill quickly. Organs start failing. Infected red blood cells clog the brain&rsquo;s blood vessels, depriving it of oxygen and leading to seizures, unconsciousness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w62tp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nosten first arrived in south-east Asia almost 30 years ago, malaria was the biggest killer in the region. Artemisinin changed everything. Spectacularly fast and effective, the drug arrived on the scene in 1994, when options for treating malaria were running out. Since then, &ldquo;cases have just gone down, down, down,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen so few in the rainy season &ndash; a few hundred this year compared to tens of thousands before.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has no time for celebration. Artemisinin used to clear &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;in a day; now it can take several. The parasite has started to become resistant. The wonder drug is failing. It is the latest reprise of a decades-long theme: we attack malaria with a new drug, it mounts an evolutionary riposte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in his office, Nosten pulls up a map showing the current whereabouts of the resistant parasites. Three coloured bands highlight the borders between Cambodia and Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, and Thailand and Myanmar (Burma). Borders. Bold lines on maps, but invisible in reality. A river that can be crossed in a rickety boat is no barrier to a parasite that rides in the salivary glands of mosquitoes or the red blood cells of humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History tells us what happens next. Over the last century, almost every frontline antimalarial drug &ndash; chloroquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine &ndash; has become obsolete because of defiant parasites that emerged from western Cambodia. From this cradle of resistance, the parasites gradually spread west to Africa, causing the deaths of millions. Malaria already kills around 660,000 people every year, and most of them are African kids. If artemisinin resistance reached that continent, it would be catastrophic, especially since there are no good replacement drugs on the immediate horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w632f\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosten thinks that without radical measures, resistance will spread to India and Bangladesh. Once that happens, it will be too late. Those countries are too big, too populous, too uneven in their health services to even dream about containing the resistant parasites. Once there, they will inevitably spread further. He thinks it will happen in three years, maybe four. &ldquo;Look at the speed of change on this border. It&rsquo;s exponential. It&rsquo;s not going to take 10 or 15 years to reach Bangladesh. It&rsquo;ll take just a few. We have to do something before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of scientists are developing innovative new ways of dealing with malaria, from potential vaccines to new drugs, genetically modified mosquitoes to lethal fungi. As Nosten sees it, none of these will be ready in time. The only way of stopping artemisinin resistance, he says, is to completely remove malaria from its cradle of resistance. &ldquo;If you want to eliminate artemisinin resistance, you have to eliminate malaria,&rdquo; says Nosten. Not control it, not contain it. Eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the Moei river more than a border between nations. It&rsquo;s Stalingrad. It&rsquo;s Thermopylae. It&rsquo;s the last chance for halting the creeping obsolescence of our best remaining drug. What happens here will decide the fate of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapon failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The world tried to eliminate malaria 60 years ago. Malaria was a global affliction back then, infecting hundreds of thousands of troops during World War II. This helped motivate a swell of postwar research. To fight the disease, in 1946 the United States created what is now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country&rsquo;s premier public health institute. After a decisive national eradication programme, the nation became malaria-free in 1951. Brazil had also controlled a burgeoning malaria epidemic with insecticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, new weapons had emerged. The long-lasting insecticide DDT was already being widely used and killed mosquitoes easily. A new drug called chloroquine did the same to Plasmodium. Armed with these tools and buoyed by earlier successes, the World Health Organization formally launched the Global Malaria Eradication Programme in 1955. DDT was sprayed in countless homes. Chloroquine was even added to table salt in some countries. It was as ambitious a public health initiative as has ever been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w63qc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked to a point. Malaria fell dramatically in Taiwan, Sri Lanka, India, the Caribbean, the Balkans, and parts of the south Pacific. But ultimately the problem was too big, the plan too ambitious. It barely made a dent in sub-Saharan Africa, where public health infrastructure was poor and malaria was most prevalent. And its twin pillars soon crumbled as &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;evolved resistance to chloroquine and mosquitoes evolved resistance to DDT. The disease bounced back across much of Asia and the western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the eradication programme was finally abandoned. Despite several successes, its overall failure had a chilling impact on malaria research. Investments from richer (and now unaffected) countries dwindled, save for a spike of interest during the Vietnam War. The best minds in the field left for fresher challenges. Malaria, now a tropical disease of poor people, became unfashionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Rosbif and the frog&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fran&ccedil;ois Nosten always wanted to travel. His father, a sailor on merchant ships, returned home with stories of far-flung adventures and instilled a deep wanderlust. Nosten&rsquo;s original plan was to work on overseas development projects, but one of his teachers pushed him down a different path. &ldquo;He said the best thing you can do if you want to travel anywhere is to be a doctor. That&rsquo;s why I started medical school.&rdquo; As soon as he graduated, he joined M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and started living the dream. He flew off to Africa and South-east Asia, before arriving in Thailand in 1983. There, he started treating refugees from Myanmar in camps along the Thai border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1985, an English visitor arrived at the camps and Nosten took him for a random tourist until he started asking insightful questions about malaria. That man was Nick White. A British clinician, he was drawn to Bangkok in 1980 by the allure of the tropics and a perverse desire to study something unfashionable. The University of Oxford had just set up a new tropical medicine research unit in collaboration with Bangkok&rsquo;s Mahidol University, and White was the third to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The rosbif and the frog&rdquo;, as Nosten puts it, bonded over an interest in malaria, a desire to knuckle down and get things done, and a similar grouchy conviviality. They formed a close friendship and started working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6cjn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, they set up a field station for White&rsquo;s Bangkok research unit: little more than a centrifuge and microscope within Nosten&rsquo;s rickety house. Three years later, Nosten moved to Shoklo, the largest refugee camp along the Thai&ndash;Myanmar border and home to around 9,000 people. Most were Karen &ndash; the third largest of Myanmar&rsquo;s 130 or so ethnic groups &ndash; who were fleeing persecution from the majority Bamar government. Nosten worked out of a bamboo hospital &ndash; the first Shoklo Malaria Research Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria was rife. Floods were regular. Military leaders from both Thailand and Myanmar occasionally ordered Nosten to leave. Without any electricity, he often had to use a mirror to angle sunlight into his microscope. He loved it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a city person,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t survive in Bangkok very well. I wasn&rsquo;t alone in Shoklo but it was sufficiently remote.&rdquo; The immediacy of the job and the lack of bureaucracy also appealed. He could try out new treatments and see their impact right away. He trained local people to detect &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; under a microscope and help with research. He even met his future wife &ndash; a Karen teacher named Colley Paw, who is now one of his right-hand researchers (White was the best man at their wedding). These were the best years of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shoklo years ended in 1995 after a splinter faction of Karen started regularly attacking the camps, in a bid to force the refugees back into Myanmar. &ldquo;They came in and started shooting,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;We once had to hide in a hole for the night, with bullets flying around.&rdquo; The Thai military, unable to defend the scattered camps, consolidated them into a single site called Mae La &ndash; a dense lattice of thatch-roofed houses built on stilts, which now contains almost 50,000 people. Nosten went with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6chb\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has since expanded the Shoklo Unit into a huge hand that stretches across the region. Its palm is a central laboratory in the town of Mae Sot, where Nosten lives, and the fingers are clinics situated in border settlements, each with trained personnel and sophisticated facilities. The one in Mae La has a $250,000 neonatal care machine, and can cope with everything short of major surgery. Nosten has also set up small &lsquo;malaria posts&rsquo; along the border. These are typically just volunteer farmers with a box of diagnostic tests and medicine in their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody else who could have done what Fran&ccedil;ois has done,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll underplay the difficulties but between the physical dangers, politics, logistical nightmares, and the fraught conditions of the refugees, it&rsquo;s not been easy. He&rsquo;s not a shrinking violet.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Nosten&rsquo;s network, locals know where to go if they feel unwell, and they are never far from treatments. That is vital. If infected people are treated within 48 hours of their first symptoms, their parasites die before they get a chance to enter another mosquito and the cycle of malaria breaks. &ldquo;You deploy early identification and treatment, and malaria goes away,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;Everywhere we&rsquo;ve done this, it&rsquo;s worked.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New hope?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Nosten and White teamed up in the 1980s, their first success was showing that a new drug called mefloquine was excellent at curing malaria, and at preventing it in pregnant women. Most drugs had fallen to resistant parasites and the last effective one &ndash; quinine &ndash; involved a week of nasty side-effects. Mefloquine was a godsend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within five years, &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;had started to resist it too. &ldquo;We tried different things like increasing the dose, but we were clearly losing the drug,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;We saw more and more treatment failures, patients coming back weeks later with the same malaria. We were really worried that we wouldn&rsquo;t have any more options.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvation came from China. In 1967, Chairman Mao Zedong launched a covert military initiative to discover new antimalarial drugs, partly to help his North Vietnamese allies, who were losing troops to the disease. It was called Project 523. A team of some 600 scientists scoured 200 herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine for possible antimalarial chemicals. They found a clear winner in 1971 &ndash; a common herb called qing hao (Artemisia annua or sweet wormwood). Using hints from a 2,000-year-old recipe for treating haemorrhoids, they isolated the herb&rsquo;s active ingredient, characterised it, tested it in humans and animals, and created synthetic versions. &ldquo;This was in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;Society had been ripped apart, there was still a lot of oppression, and facilities were poor. But they did some extremely good chemistry.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were miraculous. The new drug annihilated even severe forms of chloroquine-resistant malaria, and did so with unparalleled speed and no side-effects. The team named it Qinghaosu. The West would know it as artemisinin. Or, at least, they would when they found out about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6795\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project 523 was shrouded in secrecy, and few results were published. Qinghaosu was already being widely used in China and Vietnam when the first English description appeared in the Chinese Medical Journal in 1979. Western scientists, suspicious about Chinese journals and traditional medicine, greeted it with scepticism and wasted time trying to develop their own less effective versions. The Chinese, meanwhile, were reluctant to share their new drug with Cold War enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this political stalemate, White saw a tattered copy of the 1979 paper. He travelled to China in 1981, and returned with a vial of the drug, which he still keeps in a drawer in his office. He and Nosten began studying it, working out the right doses, and testing the various derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They realised that artemisinin&rsquo;s only shortcoming was a lack of stamina. People clear it so quickly from their bodies that they need seven daily doses to completely cure themselves. Few complete the full course. White&rsquo;s ingenious solution was to pair the new drug with mefloquine &ndash; a slower-acting but longer-lasting partner. Artemisinin would land a brutal shock-and-awe strike that destroyed the majority of parasites, mefloquine would mop up the survivors. If any parasites resisted the artemisinin assault, mefloquine would finish them off. &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; would need to resist both drugs to survive the double whammy, and White deemed that unlikely. Just three days of this artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) was enough to treat virtually every case of malaria. In theory, ACTs should have been resistance-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosten started using them along the Thai&ndash;Myanmar border in 1994 and immediately saw results. Quinine took days to clear the parasites and left people bed-ridden for a week with dizzy spells. ACTs had them returning to work after 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w689n\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But victories in malaria are often short-lived. In the early 2000s, the team started hearing rumours from western Cambodia that ACTs were becoming less effective. White tried to stay calm. He had heard plenty of false alarms about incurable Cambodian patients, but it always turned out that they were taking counterfeit drugs. &ldquo;I was just hoping it was another of those,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not. In 2006, Harald Noedl from the Medical University of Vienna started checking out the rumours for himself. In the Cambodian village of Ta Sanh, he treated 60 malaria patients with artesunate (an artemisinin derivative) and found that two of them carried exceptionally stubborn parasites. These infections cleared in four to six days, rather than the usual two. And even though the patients stayed in a clinic outside any malaria hotspots, their parasites returned a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I first presented those data in November 2007 and as expected, people were very sceptical,&rdquo; says Noedl. After all, a pair of patients is an epidemiological blip. Still, this was worrying enough to prompt White&rsquo;s team to run their own study in another nearby village. They got even worse news. The 40 people they treated with artesunate took an average of 3.5 days to clear their parasites, and six of them suffered from rebounding infections within a month. &ldquo;Rapid parasite clearance is the hallmark of artemisinins,&rdquo; says Arjen Dondorp, one of White&rsquo;s colleagues based in Bangkok. &ldquo;That property suddenly disappeared.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the hopes that ACTs would forestall artemisinin&rsquo;s expiry, resistance had arrived, just as it had done for other antimalarials. And, as if to rub salt in the wound, it had come from the same damn place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyper mutators&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why has a small corner of western Cambodia, no bigger than Wales or New Jersey, repeatedly given rise to drug-beating parasites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White thinks that the most likely explanation is the region&rsquo;s unregulated use of antimalarial drugs. China supplied artemisinin to the tyrannical Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s, giving Cambodians access to it almost two decades before White conceived of ACTs. Few used it correctly. Some got ineffective doses from counterfeit pills. Others took a couple of tablets and stopped once their fever disappeared. &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;was regularly exposed to artemisinin without being completely wiped out, and the most resistant parasites survived to spread to new hosts. There is a saying among malariologists: &ldquo;The last man standing is the most resistant.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies hint at other explanations. Early last year, Dominic Kwiatkowski from the University of Oxford showed that some &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;strains from west Cambodia have mutations in genes that repair faults in their DNA, much like some cancer cells or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In other words, they have mutations that make them prone to mutating. This might also explain why, in lab experiments, they develop drug resistance more quickly than strains from other parts of the world. Evolution is malaria&rsquo;s greatest weapon, and these &lsquo;hypermutators&rsquo; evolve in fifth gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s team also found that &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;is spookily diverse in west Cambodia. It is home to three artemisinin-resistant populations that are genetically distinct, despite living in the same small area. That is bizarre. Without obvious barriers between them, the strains ought to regularly mate and share their genes. Instead, they seem to shun each other&rsquo;s company. They are so inbred that they consist almost entirely of clones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6984\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwiatkowski suspects that these parasites descended from some lucky genetic lottery winners that accumulated the right sets of mutations for evading artemisinin. When they mate with other strains, their winning tickets break up and their offspring are wiped out by the drug. Only their inbred progeny, which keep the right combinations, survive and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It undoubtedly helps that south-east Asia does not have much malaria. In West Africa, where transmission is high, a child might be infected with three to five &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;strains at any time, giving them many opportunities to mate and shuffle their genes. A Cambodian child, however, usually sees one strain at a time, and is a poor hook-up spot for the parasite. The region&rsquo;s infrastructure may also have helped to enforce the parasites&rsquo; isolation: local roads are poor, and people&rsquo;s movements were long constrained by the Khmer Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Cambodia, then, could be rife with &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;strains that are especially prone to evolving resistance, that get many opportunities to do so because antimalarial drugs are abused, and that easily hold on to their drug-beating mutations once they get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are plausible ideas, but hard to verify since we still know very little about how exactly the parasites resist a drug. Earlier cases of resistance were largely due to mutations in single genes &ndash; trump cards that immediately made for invincible parasites. A small tweak in the crt gene, and &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;can suddenly pump chloroquine out of its cells. A few tweaks to dhps and dhfr, the genes targeted by sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, and the drug can no longer stick to its targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w67qd\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artemisinin seems to be a trickier enemy. Curiously, &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;takes a long time to evolve resistance to artemisinin in lab experiments, much longer than in the wild. Those strains that do tend to be weak and unstable. &ldquo;I suspect you need a complicated series of genetic changes to make a parasite that&rsquo;s not lethally unfit in the presence of these drugs,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;It would be unusual if this was a single mutation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practices such as unregulated drug use and misuse may help encourage and accelerate the rate of such changes out in the field. Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s study suggests that the parasites may have evolved artemisinin resistance several times over, perhaps through a different route each time. Several groups are racing to find the responsible mutations, with news of the first few breaking in December 2013. That&rsquo;s the key to quickly identifying resistant parasites and treating patients more efficiently. (Currently, you can only tell if someone has artemisinin-resistant malaria by treating them and seeing how long they take to get better.) &ldquo;We want to be able to track resistance using blood spots on filter paper,&rdquo; says Chris Plowe at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, whose group is one of those in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time is running out. From its origins in Cambodia, resistance has reached the Thai&ndash;Myanmar border. Nosten has shown that the proportion of patients who are still infected after three days of ACT has increased from zero in 2000 to 28% in 2011. Most are still being cured, but as artemisinin becomes less effective, its partner drug will have to mop up more surviving parasites. Plasmodium will evolve resistance to the partner more quickly, driving both drugs towards uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is already happening in western Cambodia, where ACTs are failing up to a quarter of the time and many people are still infected a month later. Long-lasting infections will provide parasites with more chances to jump into mosquitoes, and then into healthy humans. Malaria cases will rise. Deaths will follow. &ldquo;This is the silence before the storm,&rdquo; says Arjen Dondorp. &ldquo;The threat is still slightly abstract and there&rsquo;s still not that much malaria, which doesn&rsquo;t help with a sense of urgency. If we suddenly see malaria exploding, then it&rsquo;ll be a clear emergency, but it&rsquo;ll also be too late.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical change&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his office at Mahidol University, Nick White is surrounded by yellowing monographs of old malaria research and overlooked by a wall-mounted mosaic of drug packets made by his daughter. He is now the chairman of the Mahidol&ndash;Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit and a mentor to the dozens of researchers within. He is gently ranting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Everything to do with change in malaria meets with huge resistance,&rdquo; he says. He means political resistance, not the drug kind. He means the decade it took for the international community to endorse ACTs despite the evidence that they worked. He means the &ldquo;treacle of bureaucracy&rdquo; that he and Nosten swim through in their push to eliminate malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The global response to artemisinin resistance has been a bit pathetic. Everyone will tell you how important it is and there have been any number of bloody meetings. But there is little appetite for radical change.&rdquo; He misses the old days when &ldquo;you could drive a Land Rover across borders in your khaki shorts and spray things and do stuff&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside, things look rosier. Malaria is fashionable again, and international funding has gone up by 15 times in the last decade. Big organisations seem to be rallying behind the banner of elimination. In April, the World Health Organisation published a strategy called The Emergency Response to Artemisinin Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvellous plan,&rdquo; White says drily. &ldquo;It says all the right things, but we haven&rsquo;t done anything.&rdquo; It follows two other strategies that were published in 2011 and 2012, neither of which slowed the spread of artemisinin resistance. Elimination became a dirty word after the noisy failures of the 1950s and 60s, and the new strategies look like the same old tactics for controlling malaria, presented under the guise of eradicating it. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re prescriptions for inertia,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6bs4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, they are channelling funds into ineffective measures. Take insecticide-treated bednets, a mainstay of malaria control. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had meetings with WHO consultants who said, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to hear a word against bednets. They always work.&rsquo; But how cost-effective are they, and what&rsquo;s the evidence they work in this region? The mosquitoes here bite early in the evening. And who&rsquo;s getting malaria? Young men. Are they all tucked up in their bednets by 6 o&rsquo;clock? No. They&rsquo;re in the fields and forests. Come on! It&rsquo;s obvious.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that resources could be better devoted to getting rid of fake drugs and monotherapies where artemisinin is not paired with a partner. That would preserve ACTs for as long as possible. The world also needs better surveillance for resistant parasites. White is helping with that by chairing the World-Wide Anti-Malarial Resistance Network &ndash; a global community of scientists who are rapidly collecting data on how quickly patients respond to drugs, the presence of resistance genes, the numbers of fake drugs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White also wants to know if artemisinin-resistant parasites from south-east Asia can spread in African mosquitoes. Hundreds of mosquito species can transmit malaria, but &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;is picky about its hosts. If resistant strains need time to adapt to new carriers, they might be slow to spread westwards. If they can immediately jump into far-off species, they are a plane ride away from Africa. &ldquo;That changes your containment strategy,&rdquo; says White, &ldquo;but stupidly, it&rsquo;s cut out of every research application we&rsquo;ve ever made.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is pessimistic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty confident we won&rsquo;t win but I think we should try a lot harder than we have been. If we didn&rsquo;t pull out all the stops and kids start dying of artemisinin-resistant malaria, and we can trace the genetic origins of those parasites to south-east Asia, we shouldn&rsquo;t sleep easy in our beds.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination plan&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Nosten&rsquo;s team first arrived at Hka Naw Tah in February, they slept and worked from the village&rsquo;s unassuming temple. Using development funds from their grant, they put up a water tower and supplied electricity for the local school. In return, the villagers built them a clinic &ndash; a spacious, open-sided hut with a sloping tin roof, benches sitting on a dirt floor, a couple of tables holding boxes of drugs and diagnostic kits, treatment rooms, and a computer station. It took just two days to erect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Karen respect strong leadership but there is an easy-going camaraderie in the clinic. When we arrive, one of the research assistants is napping across a bench. Nosten walks over and sits on him. &ldquo;You see, and I think this is a good sign, that it&rsquo;s hard to tell who&rsquo;s the boss and who&rsquo;s the patient,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the villagers don&rsquo;t seem sick, but many of them have malaria nonetheless. Until recently, Nosten&rsquo;s team had always searched for the parasites by examining a drop of blood under a microscope. If someone is sick, you can see and count the Plasmodium in their red blood cells. But in 2010, they started collecting millilitres of blood &ndash; a thousand times more than the usual drops &ndash; and searching for Plasmodium&rsquo;s DNA. Suddenly, the proportion of infected people shot up from 10&ndash;20% to 60&ndash;80%. There are three, four, maybe six times as many infected people as he thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6c33\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t believe it at first,&rdquo; says Nosten, &ldquo;but we confirmed it and re-confirmed it.&rdquo; Perhaps the tests were giving false positives, or picking up floating DNA from dead parasites? No such luck &ndash; when the team treated people with ACTs, the hidden parasites disappeared. They were real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lsquo;sub-microscopic infections&rsquo; completely change the game for elimination. Treating the sick is no longer good enough because the disease could bounce back from the hordes of symptomless carriers. The strike will have to be swift and decisive. If it&rsquo;s half-hearted, the most resistant parasites will survive and start afresh. In malarial zones, you need to treat almost everyone, clearing the parasites they didn&rsquo;t even know they had. This is Nosten&rsquo;s goal in the border villages like Hka Naw Tah. He has support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the few large funders to have truly grasped the urgency of the situation and who are &ldquo;very much in the mood for elimination&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Killing the parasites is easy: it just involves three days of ACTs. Getting healthy people to turn up to a clinic and take their medicine is much harder. The team have spent months on engagement and education. The clinic is dotted with posters explaining the symptoms of malaria and the biology of mosquitoes. Earlier this morning, Honey Moon, a Karen woman who is one of Nosten&rsquo;s oldest colleagues, knocked on the doors of all the absentees from the last round to persuade them to come for tests. As a result, 16 newcomers turned up for treatments, bringing the team closer to the full 393. Nosten is pleased. &ldquo;In this village, I&rsquo;m quite optimistic that most people will be free of the parasite,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another village down the river is proving more difficult. They are more socially conservative and have a poorer understanding of healthcare. There are two factions of Karen there, one of which is refusing to take part to spite their rivals. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good lesson for us,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;These situations will be elsewhere.&rdquo; Eliminating malaria is not just about having the right drug, the deadliest insecticide, or the most sensitive diagnostic test. It is about knowing people, from funders to villagers. &ldquo;The most important component is getting people to agree and participate,&rdquo; says Nosten. It matters that he has been working in the region for 30 years, that the Shoklo unit is a familiar and trusted name in these parts, that virtually all his team are Karen. These are the reasons that give Nosten hope, despite the lack of political will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the strategy looks like it is working after a year, they will start scaling up. Eventually, they hope to cover the entire sinuous border. I ask Nosten if he would ever consider leaving. He pauses. &ldquo;Even if I wanted to go somewhere else, I&rsquo;m more or less a prisoner of my own making,&rdquo; he says. He would need to find a replacement first &ndash; a leader who would command respect among both the Karen and malaria researchers, and would be willing to relocate to a place as remote as Mae Sot. It is hard to imagine a second person who would tick all those boxes. Surrounded by airborne parasites, spreading resistance, and border-hopping refugees, Fran&ccedil;ois Nosten is stuck. He would not have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was fist appeared in &lt;a href=\"http://www.mosaicscience.com/\"&gt;Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;is dedicated to exploring the science of life,&lt;em&gt; and reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

If you were taking a cold evolutionary perspective, it would appear to be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For foster parents, there are huge costs involved, with no promise of passing on genes. Scientists have long been interested in adoption, because it seems to be wholly altruistic. But this makes it especially perplexing in animals, who do not have the cultural influences we do. So could taking a closer look at adoption in non-humans shed any light on why it&rsquo;s so common?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more striking places to see adoption in the animal kingdom is Ano Nuevo Island, rising from the sea less than one kilometre off the rocky California coast. Once a year, it is host to the breeding of hundreds of northern elephant seals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1976 onwards, marine scientist Marianne Riedman, together with her colleague Burney Le Boeuf, studied adoption among the seals &ndash; and why it was happening. It's a crowded beach, with bad weather, high tides and rough surf, which perhaps explains why one-quarter to two-thirds of pups each year were separated from their mothers at least once &ndash; some permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqlkp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers counted a total of 572 orphaned pups over the course of the four consecutive breeding seasons. Riedman charmingly &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00300063\"&gt;referred to the ones that were adopted as \"alien young\"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, some adult seals were more likely than others to become foster parents. For one thing, all the foster parents were female. That's perhaps unsurprising, since part of what drives orphans to seek out care is the need to nurse. Yet among females, the most common foster seal was a mother who had lost her own pup. Why might this be? One possible reason is that fostering helped these females reproduce later on. Regular nursing may induce ovulation, which in turn could make a female more likely to give birth to her own pup the following season. The evidence supporting this explanation is tenuous, but the hypothesis is at least reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that mothers are behaviourally and physiologically prepared to care for their pups immediately following birth. Given the absence of their own young, the motivation towards maternal care may be so great that they redirect their attention onto other, unrelated pups. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Williams\"&gt;Biologist George C Williams&lt;/a&gt; called this phenomenon \"misplaced reproductive function&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other common form of adoption occurred when a female who had never given birth still cared for an unrelated infant. Riedman speculated that those females might gain valuable maternal experience, increasing their own parenting competence. So perhaps there is something in it for foster parents after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqlts\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elephant seal pups aren't the only ones to win adoptive parents either. It's actually fairly common among birds. Many chicks intentionally abandon the nests in which they hatched to seek out temporary or full adoption by foster parents. This \"nest switching\" has been seen in seabirds like gulls and terns, as well as storks, raptors, egrets and herons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take white storks. In one breeding season, biologists from Spain's Universidad de Cordoba found nest switching in 40% of broods across three distinct white-stork breeding colonies. That &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347285701388\"&gt;infant birds seek out new digs&lt;/a&gt; actually makes sense, since they could benefit from a longer period of parental care. If they moved into nests containing fewer or younger chicks than their previous homes, then they could also receive more food by more easily outcompeting smaller adoptive siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why would the adoptive parents allow the intruder into their nest, especially to the detriment of their own young? It could simply be that evolution has not endowed the parents with the ability to discriminate their own chicks from strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of discriminatory ability is seen particularly starkly in &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347298909137\"&gt;Lake Erie's ring-billed gulls&lt;/a&gt;. Nest invasions are common, but unlike for white storks, there is a significant cost incurred by the foster parents: half as many of their own chicks grow to fledging age than the gulls that did not adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqn19\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given such high risks for adoption, why hasn't evolution endowed these birds with a better ability to identify &ndash; and reject &ndash; intruders? Biologist Kevin Brown of York University thinks that the costs of better chick discrimination could be even higher. \"If the cost of rejecting one&rsquo;s own offspring is greater than accepting an alien chick,\" he writes &lt;a href=\"ftp://psyftp.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Papers/infanticide/gullAdopt.pdf\"&gt;in the journal Animal Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, \"selection will favour universal acceptance of young in the nest.\" In other words, it may be better to needlessly waste resources on alien infiltrators than to accidentally reject one of your own hatchlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption is also fairly common among non-human primates. It's been seen in &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02381155\"&gt;red howler monkeys in Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-007-0066-x\"&gt;black-fronted titi monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-007-0066-x\"&gt;woolly spider monkeys&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil, and even among chimpanzees. But in all of those cases the adoption has always been within species. Storks adopt stork chicks, howler monkeys adopt infant howlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In captivity, there are occasionally cross-species adoptions, such as between rhesus and Japanese macaques or among &lt;a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-71081998000400014&amp;script=sci_arttext\"&gt;different types of marmoset&lt;/a&gt;. But these species are closely related, and have similar behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that, perhaps &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.20259/abstract\"&gt;the most striking instance of adoption in the wild&lt;/a&gt; was between completely different types of monkeys. In 2004, researchers noticed an infant marmoset travelling with a group of capuchin monkeys at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.greenwingvalley.com/\"&gt;Green Wing Valley&lt;/a&gt; wildlife reserve in Brazil. For at least 14 months, the marmoset was raised by its adoptive capuchin group, alternating between two primary female foster mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqp6z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the adoption was so surprising is because marmosets and capuchins are so different. For one thing, a fully-grown capuchin weighs perhaps 3-4kg (7-8lbs), but a fully-grown marmoset maxes out at less than 500g (1lb). The two species also have different feeding patterns and different parenting styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those differences, the juvenile marmoset became wholly integrated into its adoptive social group. \"It travelled and fed with the group, responded to alarm vocalisations given by members of the group, and played,\" the researchers &lt;a href=\"http://www.ip.usp.br/ethocebus/arquivos/AJP_Izar&amp;al_2006.pdf\"&gt;wrote in the American Journal of Primatology&lt;/a&gt;. During social play with their unlikely friend, the juvenile capuchins actually adjusted the force of their movements to account for the puny marmoset's size and strength. And the adult capuchins, including the dominant male, were extremely tolerant of the impostor. The marmoset would patiently watch the adults crack nuts between two rocks and sneak an occasional snack, much as a young capuchin would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he (or she) wasn't simply a marmoset in a capuchin suit. Capuchins travel by leaping from tree to tree. Given its size, the marmoset often struggled to keep up. The capuchins all but ignored the marmoset's distress cries, despite being within hearing distance. Like many human adoptions, the match wasn't always perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it happen? It's likely that the adult capuchins were simply predisposed to care for young primates. They're also extremely tolerant of infants in the first place. In addition, given how small the marmoset is compared to the capuchins, they didn't need to give up too much of their own food so that it might survive. A female capuchin would barely notice a tiny marmoset clinging to her fur, making it reasonable to assume that the infant didn't slow her down at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems as if the drive to care for helpless infants is fairly universal among species that care for their own young &ndash; and even between different animals.

The more we consume as a society, the more we hear about how vital ores and minerals are dwindling, so it seems logical to assume that a few may be about to disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet that may be entirely the wrong way of looking at the problem. According to natural resources experts, many of the materials we rely upon in modern life won&rsquo;t &ldquo;run out&rdquo; at all. Unfortunately, the scenario they paint about what will happen instead in the near future is hardly rosy either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of our most cherished devices &ndash; smartphones, computers and medical equipment, for instance &ndash; rely on a rich list of elemental ingredients. Mobile phones alone contain a whopping 60 to 64 elements. &ldquo;Many of these metals are present in only minute amounts, a milligramme or less,&rdquo; says Armin Reller, a chemist and the chair of resource strategy at Augsburg University in Germany. &ldquo;But they are very important for the function of the device.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes things like copper, aluminum and iron, but also less well-known materials, like the &ldquo;rare earth elements&rdquo;, what the &lt;a href=\"http://www.rareelementresources.com/rare-earth-elements#.UyG2dEJdW5I\"&gt;Japanese refer to&lt;/a&gt; as &ldquo;the seeds of technology&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01v2zbs\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latter class of materials has come under particular scrutiny because they&rsquo;re a vital ingredient in smartphones, hybrid cars, wind turbines, computers and more. China &ndash; which produces around 90% of the world&rsquo;s rare earth metals &ndash; claims that its &lt;a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-16/china-says-its-medium-heavy-rare-earth-reserves-may-last-only-15-20-years.html\"&gt;mines might run dry in just 15-20 years&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, if demand continues for &lt;a href=\"http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/ns_diagrams/027ns_005image2.jpg\"&gt;indium&lt;/a&gt;, some say it will be gone in about 10 years; platinum in 15 years; and silver in 20 years. Looking farther into the future, other sources claim that things like aluminum might run dry &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120618-global-resources-stock-check\"&gt;in about 80 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/rst/downloads/Materials_Handbook_Rev_2012.pdf\"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; indicate that rhodium, followed by gold, platinum and tellurium, are some of the rarest elements in terms of their percentage in the planet&rsquo;s crust and their importance to society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As startling as these figures sound, however, the complete loss of silver, platinum, aluminum or any other mineral resource will likely never come to pass, according to Thomas Graedel, director of the Center for Industrial Ecology at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. We have never completely run out of a natural resource, he says, and we almost certainly never will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply and demand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking in terms of &ldquo;running out&rdquo; is not the right way to approach this problem. For starters, it&rsquo;s impossible to prove a negative. Scientists could never definitively say &ldquo;The world has no more silver reserves&rdquo; without checking every last subterranean nook and cranny on the planet. The more practical reason, however, is that by the time we reached the point that running out is even a consideration, the price tag for those last remnants would be prohibitively expensive, and manufacturers would not be able to turn a profit on any products made from them. They already would have moved on to a substitute resource &ndash; even an inferior one. &ldquo;As supply and demand change, prices change and people adapt what they need and how they use it,&rdquo; says Lawrence Meinert, program coordinator of the US Geological Survey&rsquo;s Mineral Resources Program. &ldquo;This means that you can never consume everything because the price gets so high you stop using it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, &lt;a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/10/has_the_earth_run_out_of_any_natural_resources.html\"&gt;mining for cryolite&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; used in processing aluminum ore &ndash; stopped because remaining reserves were too small to justify the expense of mining. We simply moved on to using a synthetic substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s not really possible to put a label on what the world&rsquo;s rarest resource is, either. Instead of thinking in terms of how many tonnes of element X or mineral Y are left in the earth, Meinert says, rarity depends on how easy it is to get our hands on that resource, and also on the market&rsquo;s demand for that commodity. Rarity, thus, becomes more a question of availability than of actual physical reserves, and that availability can be influenced by a variety of forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01v2xzz\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, some resources such as indium &ndash; found in computer and smartphone display screens &ndash; are byproducts of other mining operations. Almost all of the world&rsquo;s indium comes from zinc mines; there are no dedicated indium mines, because it occurs in such small amounts mining for it is impractical. So if demand for zinc declines &ndash; say, because car manufacturers switch from steel to aluminum bodies, as they have been doing recently &ndash; then this would have an impact on indium. &ldquo;Nature puts deposits where it feels like, without worrying about whether we have the energy or water handy to deal with it,&rdquo; says Graedel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other cases, demand might surpass supply, even if there are dedicated mines for the material. Certain resources are sometimes referred to by the German term Gew&uuml;rzmetall &ndash; &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oekom/gaia/2009/00000018/00000002/art00010\"&gt;spice metal&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; because, like a dash of cinnamon or saffron tying a dish&rsquo;s flavour together, these materials compose only a small proportion of an electronic device&rsquo;s makeup but are essential for that device to function. Palladium, which is &lt;a href=\"http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/pd.htm\"&gt;used as a capacitor&lt;/a&gt; in cell phones, makes up just 0.015% of those devices&rsquo; composition, but the cell phone industry goes through about 15 tonnes of that rare metal each year. Given that palladium is also used by the automotive, jewellery, dental, health and electronics industries, eventually, competition could drive up prices, and supply could fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics can come into play, too. Most of &lt;a href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1042/\"&gt;the rare-earth-metals supply&lt;/a&gt; comes from mines in China. Several years ago, China decided to &lt;a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/16944034\"&gt;cut down on its export&lt;/a&gt; of those elements. As a result, the price of rare earth metals &ndash; and the goods they are used to make &ndash; &lt;a href=\"https://theconversation.com/metals-in-your-smartphone-have-no-substitutes-21142\"&gt;has increased&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that the rest of the world does not have rare earth metals,&rdquo; Meinert says. The US, for example, holds around 38% of the world&rsquo;s deposits, but &lt;a href=\"http://minerals.cr.usgs.gov/projects/Mountain_Pass_carbonatite/index.html\"&gt;only one mine&lt;/a&gt; in southern California (which was closed for several years due to competition from China) is currently producing them. &ldquo;It takes a long time to put a mine into production,&rdquo; Meinert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to countries setting their own embargoes on exports, conflicts have an impact on resource availability. Fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could affect the world&rsquo;s supply of coltan, for example, a metallic ore used to make capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No substitute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should we worry about dwindling resources? Historically, the argument that, if one element or another runs dry, the world will find alternatives has worked pretty well. Unfortunately, however, in today&rsquo;s increasingly complex world, good substitutes are hard to come by. In &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/27/1312752110\"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt;, Graedel and his colleagues tried to identify the best substitutes for 62 metals. Twelve of those metals, they found, had no substitute at all for their major uses, and none of the 62 they studied had a substitute available to cover all of their uses. &ldquo;Because we chose what&rsquo;s almost always the best from a long list of materials, performance is likely to decrease &ndash; computers will get slower, engines will be less efficient and so on &ndash; if we start making substitutions,&rdquo; Graedel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the next several years Graedel hopes to have a better idea of which metals might soon be in short supply. Product development teams could begin thinking of possible substitutes, and to focus on developing devices using materials with more reliable supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01v2ysq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, it would help if consumers found responsible ways of &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140218-why-your-old-tech-holds-treasure\"&gt;recycling their used electronics&lt;/a&gt;. In 2009, &lt;a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/materials/ecycling/faq.htm\"&gt;US citizens recycled&lt;/a&gt; just 25% of their used TVs and computers, while as little as 8% of mobile phones were recycled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a tragedy that we spend all this time and effort getting gold and platinum and other things we use in our electronics, but then we use them once and don&rsquo;t worry about what happens to them after that,&rdquo; Graedel says. &ldquo;Recycling won&rsquo;t solve the problem [of scarcity], but it certainly would help.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the world began recycling in full force and combined those efforts with new technologies for efficiently finding, extracting and sharing the resources we need, it could be possible that the materials integral to modern life will last for generations to come, Reller says. &ldquo;But that hope might be a little bit dream-like,&rdquo; he admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The balance of supply and demand does affect us, especially when it comes to the price and availability of the technology in our lives. So while no material is so scarce that it is about to disappear entirely &ndash; we should worry that many could soon become out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"What is the worlds scarcest material?","HeadlineShort":"The worlds scarcest material","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Should we worry about natural resources running out?

It is one of the driest places in the world, and some sections of the Mars-like expanse can go 50 years without feeling a drop of rain. As poet Alonso de Ercilla put it in 1569: &ldquo;Towards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Atacama is not devoid of life. Microorganisms called endoliths have found a way to cling on, by hiding themselves inside the pores of rocks, where there&rsquo;s just enough water to survive. &ldquo;They support a whole community of organisms that eat the byproducts of their metabolism,&rdquo; says Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re all just sitting right there in the rocks &ndash; it&rsquo;s quite fascinating.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life, it seems, has an incredible knack for finding ways to persist. Indeed, microorganisms have been around for nearly four billion years, giving them ample time to adapt to some of the most extreme conditions in the natural world. But are there places left on Earth so harsh that they are rendered sterile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23kc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat is a good starting point for answering this question. The record for heat tolerance is currently held by a group of organisms called hyperthermophile methanogens, which thrive around the edges of hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. Some of these organisms can grow at &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10949.full.pdf\"&gt;temperatures of up to 122C&lt;/a&gt; (252F).&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most researchers believe that around 150C (302F) is the theoretical cut-off point for life, however. At that temperature proteins fall apart and chemical reactions cannot occur &ndash; a quirk of the biochemistry that life on Earth (so far as we know) abides by. This means that microorganisms can thrive around hydrothermal vents, but not directly within them, where temperatures can reach up to 464C (867F). The same is true for the interior of an active volcano on land. &ldquo;I really think temperature is the most hostile parameter,&rdquo; says Helena Santos, a microbial physiologist at the New University of Lisbon and president of the &lt;a href=\"http://extremophiles.org/\"&gt;International Society for Extremophiles&lt;/a&gt;. When things get hot enough, she says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible &ndash; everything is destroyed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23bt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure, by contrast, appears to be less of a problem for life. This means that heat rather than depth probably limits how far below the surface of the Earth life occurs. The centre of the Earth&rsquo;s 6,000C (10,800F) temperature certainly precludes all life, although the depth at which the cut-off occurs is still under investigation. One microorganism called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5899/275\"&gt;Desulforudis audaxviator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was discovered nearly two miles (3.2km) below the Earth&rsquo;s surface, in a South African gold mine. It has not been in contact with the surface for potentially millions of years, and survives by siphoning nutrients from rocks undergoing radioactive decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life exists at the other extreme, too, in subfreezing conditions. Bacteria in the genus &lt;em&gt;Psychrobacter &lt;/em&gt;can happily live below -10C (14F) in Siberian permafrost and Antarctic glacier mud. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html?_r=0\"&gt;Living cells recently turned up&lt;/a&gt; in a subglacial lake below the Antarctic ice. And Antarctica&rsquo;s hypersaline Deep Lake hosts unique &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/25/1307090110.abstract\"&gt;salt-loving species&lt;/a&gt;, even at -20C (-4F). To survive in these environments, microrganisms possess features such as specially adapted membranes and protein structures, and anti-freeze molecules within their cells. Given that the Earth has been covered in ice multiple times since life first evolved, &ldquo;an ice-covered lake in Antarctica does not seem all that extreme,&rdquo; says Jill Mikucki, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23nt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation typically does not deter microorganisms, either. So long as they are not in the direct pathway of an atomic blast &ndash; which would likely burn them up &ndash; they can thrive in containers of radioactive waste or near the epicentre of the Chernobyl disaster, for example. &lt;em&gt;Deinococcus radiodurans&lt;/em&gt;, one of the hardiest of the radio-resistant microorganisms, has &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109702009539\"&gt;survived trips into space&lt;/a&gt; and can endure radiation doses of up to 15,000 gray (the standard measure of the absorbed dose of radiation). For humans, just 5 gray causes death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, what we register as deadly chemical environments, some extremophiles call home sweet home. Various organisms depend on arsenic, mercury or other heavy metals for their growth and survival, while others prefer cyanide. In &lt;a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/kamchatka/\"&gt;the hot springs of Kamchatka in Russia&lt;/a&gt;, menageries of microorganisms metabolise using sulphur or carbon monoxide. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find a chemical that can kill all life,&rdquo; says Frank Robb, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might be isolated exceptions, however. Don Juan Pond in Antarctica is the saltiest known body of water on the planet, with salinity levels topping 40%. (The Dead Sea is around 33%). Researchers have recovered traces of microbial life from the pond, but they are still trying to determine whether it is actively growing and replicating there, or just blowing in from other locations. Don Juan counts as &ldquo;an example of a place on the surface of Earth where we might expect life, but cannot verify the presence of active life,&rdquo; says Corien Bakermans, a microbiologist at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, extreme heat and some synthetic laboratory environments might be the only sterile conditions on the planet&rsquo;s surface that it&rsquo;s possible to find zero traces of life. New organisms are regularly discovered that push the boundaries of life as we understand it, although where that line will ultimately be drawn remains unknown. As Santos says, &ldquo;What does not exist is more difficult to prove than what does exist.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there are some lone holdouts of sterility in the natural world, however, the environment exists in a constant state of flux &ndash; and if extremophiles teach us anything, it is that organisms are always capable of adapting. &ldquo;Give them enough time and they will find a way,&rdquo; says DiRuggiero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The last place on Earth without life","HeadlineShort":"Last place on Earth without life","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Weird and wonderful creatures can thrive in the most hostile parts on the planet, but there are a few places too harsh for even the hardiest, discovers Rachel Nuwer.

Widespread use of a drug to treat livestock ended up poisoning the birds. &ldquo;We think we&rsquo;ve lost somewhere around 40 million birds in the space of two decades, it&rsquo;s probably the biggest population crash that has ever happened,&rdquo; says Jemima Parry-Jones, director of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.icbp.org/index/\"&gt;International Centre for Birds of Prey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this film, Parry Jones, Dr Ananya Mukherjee of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.save-vultures.org/\"&gt;Saving Asian Vultures from Extinction&lt;/a&gt; (Save), Dr M Sanjayan of &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.org/\"&gt;The Nature Conservancy&lt;/a&gt; and environmental economist Pavan Sukhdev reveal what happened next. Without the vultures, carcasses rotted, creating a breeding ground for diseases and leaving a terrible stench. Feral dogs thrived, bringing with them a rise in rabies; India now has the highest number of rabies cases in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now livestock are being treated with a drug that doesn&rsquo;t harm vultures, in the hope that the population will recover so that they can return to their vitally important role.

If you were taking a cold evolutionary perspective, it would appear to be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For foster parents, there are huge costs involved, with no promise of passing on genes. Scientists have long been interested in adoption, because it seems to be wholly altruistic. But this makes it especially perplexing in animals, who do not have the cultural influences we do. So could taking a closer look at adoption in non-humans shed any light on why it&rsquo;s so common?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more striking places to see adoption in the animal kingdom is Ano Nuevo Island, rising from the sea less than one kilometre off the rocky California coast. Once a year, it is host to the breeding of hundreds of northern elephant seals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1976 onwards, marine scientist Marianne Riedman, together with her colleague Burney Le Boeuf, studied adoption among the seals &ndash; and why it was happening. It's a crowded beach, with bad weather, high tides and rough surf, which perhaps explains why one-quarter to two-thirds of pups each year were separated from their mothers at least once &ndash; some permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqlkp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers counted a total of 572 orphaned pups over the course of the four consecutive breeding seasons. Riedman charmingly &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00300063\"&gt;referred to the ones that were adopted as \"alien young\"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, some adult seals were more likely than others to become foster parents. For one thing, all the foster parents were female. That's perhaps unsurprising, since part of what drives orphans to seek out care is the need to nurse. Yet among females, the most common foster seal was a mother who had lost her own pup. Why might this be? One possible reason is that fostering helped these females reproduce later on. Regular nursing may induce ovulation, which in turn could make a female more likely to give birth to her own pup the following season. The evidence supporting this explanation is tenuous, but the hypothesis is at least reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that mothers are behaviourally and physiologically prepared to care for their pups immediately following birth. Given the absence of their own young, the motivation towards maternal care may be so great that they redirect their attention onto other, unrelated pups. &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Williams\"&gt;Biologist George C Williams&lt;/a&gt; called this phenomenon \"misplaced reproductive function&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other common form of adoption occurred when a female who had never given birth still cared for an unrelated infant. Riedman speculated that those females might gain valuable maternal experience, increasing their own parenting competence. So perhaps there is something in it for foster parents after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqlts\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elephant seal pups aren't the only ones to win adoptive parents either. It's actually fairly common among birds. Many chicks intentionally abandon the nests in which they hatched to seek out temporary or full adoption by foster parents. This \"nest switching\" has been seen in seabirds like gulls and terns, as well as storks, raptors, egrets and herons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take white storks. In one breeding season, biologists from Spain's Universidad de Cordoba found nest switching in 40% of broods across three distinct white-stork breeding colonies. That &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347285701388\"&gt;infant birds seek out new digs&lt;/a&gt; actually makes sense, since they could benefit from a longer period of parental care. If they moved into nests containing fewer or younger chicks than their previous homes, then they could also receive more food by more easily outcompeting smaller adoptive siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why would the adoptive parents allow the intruder into their nest, especially to the detriment of their own young? It could simply be that evolution has not endowed the parents with the ability to discriminate their own chicks from strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of discriminatory ability is seen particularly starkly in &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347298909137\"&gt;Lake Erie's ring-billed gulls&lt;/a&gt;. Nest invasions are common, but unlike for white storks, there is a significant cost incurred by the foster parents: half as many of their own chicks grow to fledging age than the gulls that did not adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqn19\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given such high risks for adoption, why hasn't evolution endowed these birds with a better ability to identify &ndash; and reject &ndash; intruders? Biologist Kevin Brown of York University thinks that the costs of better chick discrimination could be even higher. \"If the cost of rejecting one&rsquo;s own offspring is greater than accepting an alien chick,\" he writes &lt;a href=\"ftp://psyftp.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/Papers/infanticide/gullAdopt.pdf\"&gt;in the journal Animal Behaviour&lt;/a&gt;, \"selection will favour universal acceptance of young in the nest.\" In other words, it may be better to needlessly waste resources on alien infiltrators than to accidentally reject one of your own hatchlings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption is also fairly common among non-human primates. It's been seen in &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02381155\"&gt;red howler monkeys in Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-007-0066-x\"&gt;black-fronted titi monkeys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-007-0066-x\"&gt;woolly spider monkeys&lt;/a&gt; in Brazil, and even among chimpanzees. But in all of those cases the adoption has always been within species. Storks adopt stork chicks, howler monkeys adopt infant howlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In captivity, there are occasionally cross-species adoptions, such as between rhesus and Japanese macaques or among &lt;a href=\"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-71081998000400014&amp;script=sci_arttext\"&gt;different types of marmoset&lt;/a&gt;. But these species are closely related, and have similar behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that, perhaps &lt;a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.20259/abstract\"&gt;the most striking instance of adoption in the wild&lt;/a&gt; was between completely different types of monkeys. In 2004, researchers noticed an infant marmoset travelling with a group of capuchin monkeys at the &lt;a href=\"http://www.greenwingvalley.com/\"&gt;Green Wing Valley&lt;/a&gt; wildlife reserve in Brazil. For at least 14 months, the marmoset was raised by its adoptive capuchin group, alternating between two primary female foster mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01tqp6z\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the adoption was so surprising is because marmosets and capuchins are so different. For one thing, a fully-grown capuchin weighs perhaps 3-4kg (7-8lbs), but a fully-grown marmoset maxes out at less than 500g (1lb). The two species also have different feeding patterns and different parenting styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those differences, the juvenile marmoset became wholly integrated into its adoptive social group. \"It travelled and fed with the group, responded to alarm vocalisations given by members of the group, and played,\" the researchers &lt;a href=\"http://www.ip.usp.br/ethocebus/arquivos/AJP_Izar&amp;al_2006.pdf\"&gt;wrote in the American Journal of Primatology&lt;/a&gt;. During social play with their unlikely friend, the juvenile capuchins actually adjusted the force of their movements to account for the puny marmoset's size and strength. And the adult capuchins, including the dominant male, were extremely tolerant of the impostor. The marmoset would patiently watch the adults crack nuts between two rocks and sneak an occasional snack, much as a young capuchin would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he (or she) wasn't simply a marmoset in a capuchin suit. Capuchins travel by leaping from tree to tree. Given its size, the marmoset often struggled to keep up. The capuchins all but ignored the marmoset's distress cries, despite being within hearing distance. Like many human adoptions, the match wasn't always perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it happen? It's likely that the adult capuchins were simply predisposed to care for young primates. They're also extremely tolerant of infants in the first place. In addition, given how small the marmoset is compared to the capuchins, they didn't need to give up too much of their own food so that it might survive. A female capuchin would barely notice a tiny marmoset clinging to her fur, making it reasonable to assume that the infant didn't slow her down at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems as if the drive to care for helpless infants is fairly universal among species that care for their own young &ndash; and even between different animals.

Its muddy waters are at their fullest, but Fran&ccedil;ois Nosten still crosses them in just a minute, aboard a narrow, wooden boat. In the dry season, he could wade across. As he steps onto the western riverbank, in Myanmar, he passes no checkpoint and presents no passport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The air is cool. After months of rain, the surrounding jungle pops with vivid lime and emerald hues. Nosten climbs a set of wooden slats that wind away from the bank, up a muddy slope. His pace, as ever, seems relaxed and out of kilter with his almost permanently grave expression and urgent purpose. Nosten, a rangy Frenchman with tousled brown hair and glasses, is one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on malaria. He is here to avert a looming disaster. At the top of the slope, he reaches a small village of simple wooden buildings with tin and thatch roofs. This is Hka Naw Tah, home to around 400 people and a testing ground for Nosten&rsquo;s bold plan to completely stamp out malaria from this critical corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria is the work of the single-celled &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; parasites, with &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/em&gt; being chief among them. They spread between people through the bites of mosquitoes, invading first the liver, then the red blood cells. The first symptoms are generic and flu-like: fever, headache, sweats and chills, vomiting. At that point, the immune system usually curtails the infection. But if the parasites spread to the kidneys, lungs and brain, things go downhill quickly. Organs start failing. Infected red blood cells clog the brain&rsquo;s blood vessels, depriving it of oxygen and leading to seizures, unconsciousness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w62tp\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Nosten first arrived in south-east Asia almost 30 years ago, malaria was the biggest killer in the region. Artemisinin changed everything. Spectacularly fast and effective, the drug arrived on the scene in 1994, when options for treating malaria were running out. Since then, &ldquo;cases have just gone down, down, down,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen so few in the rainy season &ndash; a few hundred this year compared to tens of thousands before.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he has no time for celebration. Artemisinin used to clear &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;in a day; now it can take several. The parasite has started to become resistant. The wonder drug is failing. It is the latest reprise of a decades-long theme: we attack malaria with a new drug, it mounts an evolutionary riposte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in his office, Nosten pulls up a map showing the current whereabouts of the resistant parasites. Three coloured bands highlight the borders between Cambodia and Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, and Thailand and Myanmar (Burma). Borders. Bold lines on maps, but invisible in reality. A river that can be crossed in a rickety boat is no barrier to a parasite that rides in the salivary glands of mosquitoes or the red blood cells of humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History tells us what happens next. Over the last century, almost every frontline antimalarial drug &ndash; chloroquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine &ndash; has become obsolete because of defiant parasites that emerged from western Cambodia. From this cradle of resistance, the parasites gradually spread west to Africa, causing the deaths of millions. Malaria already kills around 660,000 people every year, and most of them are African kids. If artemisinin resistance reached that continent, it would be catastrophic, especially since there are no good replacement drugs on the immediate horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w632f\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosten thinks that without radical measures, resistance will spread to India and Bangladesh. Once that happens, it will be too late. Those countries are too big, too populous, too uneven in their health services to even dream about containing the resistant parasites. Once there, they will inevitably spread further. He thinks it will happen in three years, maybe four. &ldquo;Look at the speed of change on this border. It&rsquo;s exponential. It&rsquo;s not going to take 10 or 15 years to reach Bangladesh. It&rsquo;ll take just a few. We have to do something before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of scientists are developing innovative new ways of dealing with malaria, from potential vaccines to new drugs, genetically modified mosquitoes to lethal fungi. As Nosten sees it, none of these will be ready in time. The only way of stopping artemisinin resistance, he says, is to completely remove malaria from its cradle of resistance. &ldquo;If you want to eliminate artemisinin resistance, you have to eliminate malaria,&rdquo; says Nosten. Not control it, not contain it. Eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes the Moei river more than a border between nations. It&rsquo;s Stalingrad. It&rsquo;s Thermopylae. It&rsquo;s the last chance for halting the creeping obsolescence of our best remaining drug. What happens here will decide the fate of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapon failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The world tried to eliminate malaria 60 years ago. Malaria was a global affliction back then, infecting hundreds of thousands of troops during World War II. This helped motivate a swell of postwar research. To fight the disease, in 1946 the United States created what is now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country&rsquo;s premier public health institute. After a decisive national eradication programme, the nation became malaria-free in 1951. Brazil had also controlled a burgeoning malaria epidemic with insecticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, new weapons had emerged. The long-lasting insecticide DDT was already being widely used and killed mosquitoes easily. A new drug called chloroquine did the same to Plasmodium. Armed with these tools and buoyed by earlier successes, the World Health Organization formally launched the Global Malaria Eradication Programme in 1955. DDT was sprayed in countless homes. Chloroquine was even added to table salt in some countries. It was as ambitious a public health initiative as has ever been attempted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w63qc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked to a point. Malaria fell dramatically in Taiwan, Sri Lanka, India, the Caribbean, the Balkans, and parts of the south Pacific. But ultimately the problem was too big, the plan too ambitious. It barely made a dent in sub-Saharan Africa, where public health infrastructure was poor and malaria was most prevalent. And its twin pillars soon crumbled as &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;evolved resistance to chloroquine and mosquitoes evolved resistance to DDT. The disease bounced back across much of Asia and the western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, the eradication programme was finally abandoned. Despite several successes, its overall failure had a chilling impact on malaria research. Investments from richer (and now unaffected) countries dwindled, save for a spike of interest during the Vietnam War. The best minds in the field left for fresher challenges. Malaria, now a tropical disease of poor people, became unfashionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Rosbif and the frog&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fran&ccedil;ois Nosten always wanted to travel. His father, a sailor on merchant ships, returned home with stories of far-flung adventures and instilled a deep wanderlust. Nosten&rsquo;s original plan was to work on overseas development projects, but one of his teachers pushed him down a different path. &ldquo;He said the best thing you can do if you want to travel anywhere is to be a doctor. That&rsquo;s why I started medical school.&rdquo; As soon as he graduated, he joined M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and started living the dream. He flew off to Africa and South-east Asia, before arriving in Thailand in 1983. There, he started treating refugees from Myanmar in camps along the Thai border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1985, an English visitor arrived at the camps and Nosten took him for a random tourist until he started asking insightful questions about malaria. That man was Nick White. A British clinician, he was drawn to Bangkok in 1980 by the allure of the tropics and a perverse desire to study something unfashionable. The University of Oxford had just set up a new tropical medicine research unit in collaboration with Bangkok&rsquo;s Mahidol University, and White was the third to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The rosbif and the frog&rdquo;, as Nosten puts it, bonded over an interest in malaria, a desire to knuckle down and get things done, and a similar grouchy conviviality. They formed a close friendship and started working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6cjn\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, they set up a field station for White&rsquo;s Bangkok research unit: little more than a centrifuge and microscope within Nosten&rsquo;s rickety house. Three years later, Nosten moved to Shoklo, the largest refugee camp along the Thai&ndash;Myanmar border and home to around 9,000 people. Most were Karen &ndash; the third largest of Myanmar&rsquo;s 130 or so ethnic groups &ndash; who were fleeing persecution from the majority Bamar government. Nosten worked out of a bamboo hospital &ndash; the first Shoklo Malaria Research Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malaria was rife. Floods were regular. Military leaders from both Thailand and Myanmar occasionally ordered Nosten to leave. Without any electricity, he often had to use a mirror to angle sunlight into his microscope. He loved it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a city person,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t survive in Bangkok very well. I wasn&rsquo;t alone in Shoklo but it was sufficiently remote.&rdquo; The immediacy of the job and the lack of bureaucracy also appealed. He could try out new treatments and see their impact right away. He trained local people to detect &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; under a microscope and help with research. He even met his future wife &ndash; a Karen teacher named Colley Paw, who is now one of his right-hand researchers (White was the best man at their wedding). These were the best years of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shoklo years ended in 1995 after a splinter faction of Karen started regularly attacking the camps, in a bid to force the refugees back into Myanmar. &ldquo;They came in and started shooting,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;We once had to hide in a hole for the night, with bullets flying around.&rdquo; The Thai military, unable to defend the scattered camps, consolidated them into a single site called Mae La &ndash; a dense lattice of thatch-roofed houses built on stilts, which now contains almost 50,000 people. Nosten went with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6chb\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has since expanded the Shoklo Unit into a huge hand that stretches across the region. Its palm is a central laboratory in the town of Mae Sot, where Nosten lives, and the fingers are clinics situated in border settlements, each with trained personnel and sophisticated facilities. The one in Mae La has a $250,000 neonatal care machine, and can cope with everything short of major surgery. Nosten has also set up small &lsquo;malaria posts&rsquo; along the border. These are typically just volunteer farmers with a box of diagnostic tests and medicine in their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody else who could have done what Fran&ccedil;ois has done,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll underplay the difficulties but between the physical dangers, politics, logistical nightmares, and the fraught conditions of the refugees, it&rsquo;s not been easy. He&rsquo;s not a shrinking violet.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Nosten&rsquo;s network, locals know where to go if they feel unwell, and they are never far from treatments. That is vital. If infected people are treated within 48 hours of their first symptoms, their parasites die before they get a chance to enter another mosquito and the cycle of malaria breaks. &ldquo;You deploy early identification and treatment, and malaria goes away,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;Everywhere we&rsquo;ve done this, it&rsquo;s worked.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New hope?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Nosten and White teamed up in the 1980s, their first success was showing that a new drug called mefloquine was excellent at curing malaria, and at preventing it in pregnant women. Most drugs had fallen to resistant parasites and the last effective one &ndash; quinine &ndash; involved a week of nasty side-effects. Mefloquine was a godsend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within five years, &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;had started to resist it too. &ldquo;We tried different things like increasing the dose, but we were clearly losing the drug,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;We saw more and more treatment failures, patients coming back weeks later with the same malaria. We were really worried that we wouldn&rsquo;t have any more options.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salvation came from China. In 1967, Chairman Mao Zedong launched a covert military initiative to discover new antimalarial drugs, partly to help his North Vietnamese allies, who were losing troops to the disease. It was called Project 523. A team of some 600 scientists scoured 200 herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine for possible antimalarial chemicals. They found a clear winner in 1971 &ndash; a common herb called qing hao (Artemisia annua or sweet wormwood). Using hints from a 2,000-year-old recipe for treating haemorrhoids, they isolated the herb&rsquo;s active ingredient, characterised it, tested it in humans and animals, and created synthetic versions. &ldquo;This was in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;Society had been ripped apart, there was still a lot of oppression, and facilities were poor. But they did some extremely good chemistry.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were miraculous. The new drug annihilated even severe forms of chloroquine-resistant malaria, and did so with unparalleled speed and no side-effects. The team named it Qinghaosu. The West would know it as artemisinin. Or, at least, they would when they found out about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6795\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project 523 was shrouded in secrecy, and few results were published. Qinghaosu was already being widely used in China and Vietnam when the first English description appeared in the Chinese Medical Journal in 1979. Western scientists, suspicious about Chinese journals and traditional medicine, greeted it with scepticism and wasted time trying to develop their own less effective versions. The Chinese, meanwhile, were reluctant to share their new drug with Cold War enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this political stalemate, White saw a tattered copy of the 1979 paper. He travelled to China in 1981, and returned with a vial of the drug, which he still keeps in a drawer in his office. He and Nosten began studying it, working out the right doses, and testing the various derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They realised that artemisinin&rsquo;s only shortcoming was a lack of stamina. People clear it so quickly from their bodies that they need seven daily doses to completely cure themselves. Few complete the full course. White&rsquo;s ingenious solution was to pair the new drug with mefloquine &ndash; a slower-acting but longer-lasting partner. Artemisinin would land a brutal shock-and-awe strike that destroyed the majority of parasites, mefloquine would mop up the survivors. If any parasites resisted the artemisinin assault, mefloquine would finish them off. &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; would need to resist both drugs to survive the double whammy, and White deemed that unlikely. Just three days of this artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) was enough to treat virtually every case of malaria. In theory, ACTs should have been resistance-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nosten started using them along the Thai&ndash;Myanmar border in 1994 and immediately saw results. Quinine took days to clear the parasites and left people bed-ridden for a week with dizzy spells. ACTs had them returning to work after 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w689n\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But victories in malaria are often short-lived. In the early 2000s, the team started hearing rumours from western Cambodia that ACTs were becoming less effective. White tried to stay calm. He had heard plenty of false alarms about incurable Cambodian patients, but it always turned out that they were taking counterfeit drugs. &ldquo;I was just hoping it was another of those,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not. In 2006, Harald Noedl from the Medical University of Vienna started checking out the rumours for himself. In the Cambodian village of Ta Sanh, he treated 60 malaria patients with artesunate (an artemisinin derivative) and found that two of them carried exceptionally stubborn parasites. These infections cleared in four to six days, rather than the usual two. And even though the patients stayed in a clinic outside any malaria hotspots, their parasites returned a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I first presented those data in November 2007 and as expected, people were very sceptical,&rdquo; says Noedl. After all, a pair of patients is an epidemiological blip. Still, this was worrying enough to prompt White&rsquo;s team to run their own study in another nearby village. They got even worse news. The 40 people they treated with artesunate took an average of 3.5 days to clear their parasites, and six of them suffered from rebounding infections within a month. &ldquo;Rapid parasite clearance is the hallmark of artemisinins,&rdquo; says Arjen Dondorp, one of White&rsquo;s colleagues based in Bangkok. &ldquo;That property suddenly disappeared.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the hopes that ACTs would forestall artemisinin&rsquo;s expiry, resistance had arrived, just as it had done for other antimalarials. And, as if to rub salt in the wound, it had come from the same damn place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyper mutators&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Why has a small corner of western Cambodia, no bigger than Wales or New Jersey, repeatedly given rise to drug-beating parasites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White thinks that the most likely explanation is the region&rsquo;s unregulated use of antimalarial drugs. China supplied artemisinin to the tyrannical Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s, giving Cambodians access to it almost two decades before White conceived of ACTs. Few used it correctly. Some got ineffective doses from counterfeit pills. Others took a couple of tablets and stopped once their fever disappeared. &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;was regularly exposed to artemisinin without being completely wiped out, and the most resistant parasites survived to spread to new hosts. There is a saying among malariologists: &ldquo;The last man standing is the most resistant.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies hint at other explanations. Early last year, Dominic Kwiatkowski from the University of Oxford showed that some &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;strains from west Cambodia have mutations in genes that repair faults in their DNA, much like some cancer cells or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In other words, they have mutations that make them prone to mutating. This might also explain why, in lab experiments, they develop drug resistance more quickly than strains from other parts of the world. Evolution is malaria&rsquo;s greatest weapon, and these &lsquo;hypermutators&rsquo; evolve in fifth gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s team also found that &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;is spookily diverse in west Cambodia. It is home to three artemisinin-resistant populations that are genetically distinct, despite living in the same small area. That is bizarre. Without obvious barriers between them, the strains ought to regularly mate and share their genes. Instead, they seem to shun each other&rsquo;s company. They are so inbred that they consist almost entirely of clones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6984\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kwiatkowski suspects that these parasites descended from some lucky genetic lottery winners that accumulated the right sets of mutations for evading artemisinin. When they mate with other strains, their winning tickets break up and their offspring are wiped out by the drug. Only their inbred progeny, which keep the right combinations, survive and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It undoubtedly helps that south-east Asia does not have much malaria. In West Africa, where transmission is high, a child might be infected with three to five &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;strains at any time, giving them many opportunities to mate and shuffle their genes. A Cambodian child, however, usually sees one strain at a time, and is a poor hook-up spot for the parasite. The region&rsquo;s infrastructure may also have helped to enforce the parasites&rsquo; isolation: local roads are poor, and people&rsquo;s movements were long constrained by the Khmer Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Cambodia, then, could be rife with &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;strains that are especially prone to evolving resistance, that get many opportunities to do so because antimalarial drugs are abused, and that easily hold on to their drug-beating mutations once they get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are plausible ideas, but hard to verify since we still know very little about how exactly the parasites resist a drug. Earlier cases of resistance were largely due to mutations in single genes &ndash; trump cards that immediately made for invincible parasites. A small tweak in the crt gene, and &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;can suddenly pump chloroquine out of its cells. A few tweaks to dhps and dhfr, the genes targeted by sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, and the drug can no longer stick to its targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w67qd\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artemisinin seems to be a trickier enemy. Curiously, &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;takes a long time to evolve resistance to artemisinin in lab experiments, much longer than in the wild. Those strains that do tend to be weak and unstable. &ldquo;I suspect you need a complicated series of genetic changes to make a parasite that&rsquo;s not lethally unfit in the presence of these drugs,&rdquo; says White. &ldquo;It would be unusual if this was a single mutation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practices such as unregulated drug use and misuse may help encourage and accelerate the rate of such changes out in the field. Kwiatkowski&rsquo;s study suggests that the parasites may have evolved artemisinin resistance several times over, perhaps through a different route each time. Several groups are racing to find the responsible mutations, with news of the first few breaking in December 2013. That&rsquo;s the key to quickly identifying resistant parasites and treating patients more efficiently. (Currently, you can only tell if someone has artemisinin-resistant malaria by treating them and seeing how long they take to get better.) &ldquo;We want to be able to track resistance using blood spots on filter paper,&rdquo; says Chris Plowe at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, whose group is one of those in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time is running out. From its origins in Cambodia, resistance has reached the Thai&ndash;Myanmar border. Nosten has shown that the proportion of patients who are still infected after three days of ACT has increased from zero in 2000 to 28% in 2011. Most are still being cured, but as artemisinin becomes less effective, its partner drug will have to mop up more surviving parasites. Plasmodium will evolve resistance to the partner more quickly, driving both drugs towards uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is already happening in western Cambodia, where ACTs are failing up to a quarter of the time and many people are still infected a month later. Long-lasting infections will provide parasites with more chances to jump into mosquitoes, and then into healthy humans. Malaria cases will rise. Deaths will follow. &ldquo;This is the silence before the storm,&rdquo; says Arjen Dondorp. &ldquo;The threat is still slightly abstract and there&rsquo;s still not that much malaria, which doesn&rsquo;t help with a sense of urgency. If we suddenly see malaria exploding, then it&rsquo;ll be a clear emergency, but it&rsquo;ll also be too late.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical change&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In his office at Mahidol University, Nick White is surrounded by yellowing monographs of old malaria research and overlooked by a wall-mounted mosaic of drug packets made by his daughter. He is now the chairman of the Mahidol&ndash;Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit and a mentor to the dozens of researchers within. He is gently ranting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Everything to do with change in malaria meets with huge resistance,&rdquo; he says. He means political resistance, not the drug kind. He means the decade it took for the international community to endorse ACTs despite the evidence that they worked. He means the &ldquo;treacle of bureaucracy&rdquo; that he and Nosten swim through in their push to eliminate malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The global response to artemisinin resistance has been a bit pathetic. Everyone will tell you how important it is and there have been any number of bloody meetings. But there is little appetite for radical change.&rdquo; He misses the old days when &ldquo;you could drive a Land Rover across borders in your khaki shorts and spray things and do stuff&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the outside, things look rosier. Malaria is fashionable again, and international funding has gone up by 15 times in the last decade. Big organisations seem to be rallying behind the banner of elimination. In April, the World Health Organisation published a strategy called The Emergency Response to Artemisinin Resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvellous plan,&rdquo; White says drily. &ldquo;It says all the right things, but we haven&rsquo;t done anything.&rdquo; It follows two other strategies that were published in 2011 and 2012, neither of which slowed the spread of artemisinin resistance. Elimination became a dirty word after the noisy failures of the 1950s and 60s, and the new strategies look like the same old tactics for controlling malaria, presented under the guise of eradicating it. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re prescriptions for inertia,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6bs4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse, they are channelling funds into ineffective measures. Take insecticide-treated bednets, a mainstay of malaria control. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had meetings with WHO consultants who said, &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want to hear a word against bednets. They always work.&rsquo; But how cost-effective are they, and what&rsquo;s the evidence they work in this region? The mosquitoes here bite early in the evening. And who&rsquo;s getting malaria? Young men. Are they all tucked up in their bednets by 6 o&rsquo;clock? No. They&rsquo;re in the fields and forests. Come on! It&rsquo;s obvious.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that resources could be better devoted to getting rid of fake drugs and monotherapies where artemisinin is not paired with a partner. That would preserve ACTs for as long as possible. The world also needs better surveillance for resistant parasites. White is helping with that by chairing the World-Wide Anti-Malarial Resistance Network &ndash; a global community of scientists who are rapidly collecting data on how quickly patients respond to drugs, the presence of resistance genes, the numbers of fake drugs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White also wants to know if artemisinin-resistant parasites from south-east Asia can spread in African mosquitoes. Hundreds of mosquito species can transmit malaria, but &lt;em&gt;P. falciparum &lt;/em&gt;is picky about its hosts. If resistant strains need time to adapt to new carriers, they might be slow to spread westwards. If they can immediately jump into far-off species, they are a plane ride away from Africa. &ldquo;That changes your containment strategy,&rdquo; says White, &ldquo;but stupidly, it&rsquo;s cut out of every research application we&rsquo;ve ever made.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is pessimistic. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty confident we won&rsquo;t win but I think we should try a lot harder than we have been. If we didn&rsquo;t pull out all the stops and kids start dying of artemisinin-resistant malaria, and we can trace the genetic origins of those parasites to south-east Asia, we shouldn&rsquo;t sleep easy in our beds.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination plan&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Nosten&rsquo;s team first arrived at Hka Naw Tah in February, they slept and worked from the village&rsquo;s unassuming temple. Using development funds from their grant, they put up a water tower and supplied electricity for the local school. In return, the villagers built them a clinic &ndash; a spacious, open-sided hut with a sloping tin roof, benches sitting on a dirt floor, a couple of tables holding boxes of drugs and diagnostic kits, treatment rooms, and a computer station. It took just two days to erect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Karen respect strong leadership but there is an easy-going camaraderie in the clinic. When we arrive, one of the research assistants is napping across a bench. Nosten walks over and sits on him. &ldquo;You see, and I think this is a good sign, that it&rsquo;s hard to tell who&rsquo;s the boss and who&rsquo;s the patient,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the villagers don&rsquo;t seem sick, but many of them have malaria nonetheless. Until recently, Nosten&rsquo;s team had always searched for the parasites by examining a drop of blood under a microscope. If someone is sick, you can see and count the Plasmodium in their red blood cells. But in 2010, they started collecting millilitres of blood &ndash; a thousand times more than the usual drops &ndash; and searching for Plasmodium&rsquo;s DNA. Suddenly, the proportion of infected people shot up from 10&ndash;20% to 60&ndash;80%. There are three, four, maybe six times as many infected people as he thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01w6c33\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t believe it at first,&rdquo; says Nosten, &ldquo;but we confirmed it and re-confirmed it.&rdquo; Perhaps the tests were giving false positives, or picking up floating DNA from dead parasites? No such luck &ndash; when the team treated people with ACTs, the hidden parasites disappeared. They were real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lsquo;sub-microscopic infections&rsquo; completely change the game for elimination. Treating the sick is no longer good enough because the disease could bounce back from the hordes of symptomless carriers. The strike will have to be swift and decisive. If it&rsquo;s half-hearted, the most resistant parasites will survive and start afresh. In malarial zones, you need to treat almost everyone, clearing the parasites they didn&rsquo;t even know they had. This is Nosten&rsquo;s goal in the border villages like Hka Naw Tah. He has support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the few large funders to have truly grasped the urgency of the situation and who are &ldquo;very much in the mood for elimination&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Killing the parasites is easy: it just involves three days of ACTs. Getting healthy people to turn up to a clinic and take their medicine is much harder. The team have spent months on engagement and education. The clinic is dotted with posters explaining the symptoms of malaria and the biology of mosquitoes. Earlier this morning, Honey Moon, a Karen woman who is one of Nosten&rsquo;s oldest colleagues, knocked on the doors of all the absentees from the last round to persuade them to come for tests. As a result, 16 newcomers turned up for treatments, bringing the team closer to the full 393. Nosten is pleased. &ldquo;In this village, I&rsquo;m quite optimistic that most people will be free of the parasite,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another village down the river is proving more difficult. They are more socially conservative and have a poorer understanding of healthcare. There are two factions of Karen there, one of which is refusing to take part to spite their rivals. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good lesson for us,&rdquo; says Nosten. &ldquo;These situations will be elsewhere.&rdquo; Eliminating malaria is not just about having the right drug, the deadliest insecticide, or the most sensitive diagnostic test. It is about knowing people, from funders to villagers. &ldquo;The most important component is getting people to agree and participate,&rdquo; says Nosten. It matters that he has been working in the region for 30 years, that the Shoklo unit is a familiar and trusted name in these parts, that virtually all his team are Karen. These are the reasons that give Nosten hope, despite the lack of political will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the strategy looks like it is working after a year, they will start scaling up. Eventually, they hope to cover the entire sinuous border. I ask Nosten if he would ever consider leaving. He pauses. &ldquo;Even if I wanted to go somewhere else, I&rsquo;m more or less a prisoner of my own making,&rdquo; he says. He would need to find a replacement first &ndash; a leader who would command respect among both the Karen and malaria researchers, and would be willing to relocate to a place as remote as Mae Sot. It is hard to imagine a second person who would tick all those boxes. Surrounded by airborne parasites, spreading resistance, and border-hopping refugees, Fran&ccedil;ois Nosten is stuck. He would not have it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was fist appeared in &lt;a href=\"http://www.mosaicscience.com/\"&gt;Mosaic&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;is dedicated to exploring the science of life,&lt;em&gt; and reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

She didn&rsquo;t expect to find it tucked away inside an old cigar box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she arrived at the old farmhouse owned by Danish doctor and inventor Lasse Hessel, he opened the door with a cigar in his mouth. Then he fetched the box. &ldquo;Inside were all these bits and pieces &ndash; metal, plastic, all different kinds of stuff,&rdquo; Leeper recalls. &ldquo;I took a deep breath and thought, &lsquo;Holy mother &ndash; what have I gotten myself into?&rsquo;&rdquo; Somehow, these bits and pieces fit together to form a contraption that women could wear during sex to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first female condom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation may have been unconventional, but Leeper and her colleagues at Wisconsin Pharmacal had high hopes for Hesse&rsquo;s invention. &ldquo;The Aids crisis in the United States was just fully being recognised, and it was clear to us that for women to have a product that they could use to help protect themselves would be a good thing,&rdquo; Leeper says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, when Wisconsin Pharmacal finally introduced the female condom to the US in 1993, public health experts hailed it as a game-changer. The condom, a polyurethane pouch inserted into the vagina before sex, would protect women from sexually transmitted infections even if their male partners refused to wear condoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the female condom works. When used correctly, it reduces a woman&rsquo;s risk of contracting HIV by around 94&ndash;97% each time she had sex, according to estimates. Studies show that making female condoms available alongside the male version increases the percentage of sexual acts that are protected, and decreases the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, two decades after its much-celebrated introduction, the female condom still isn&rsquo;t living up to its potential. Less intuitive and familiar than the male condom, the device simply never caught on. Journalists mocked it, clinicians ignored it, and women shunned it, claiming that the condom was aesthetically unappealing and technically difficult to master. Today, only 1.6% of all condoms distributed worldwide are female condoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may finally be an opening to change the female condom&rsquo;s fate. For years, a handful of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs have been quietly tinkering with the device. Their efforts are now maturing and an assortment of redesigned and reinvented female condoms are beginning to make their way onto the market. The introduction of new, more user-friendly products &ndash; coupled with renewed efforts to promote the technology around the globe &ndash; may finally be positioning the female condom for a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barrier protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the start, the female condom was a difficult project &ndash; far more difficult than Leeper had bargained for. After buying the rights to the technology, Leeper and her colleagues at Wisconsin Pharmacal needed to turn Hessel&rsquo;s prototype into a marketable product. After some tweaking, they ended up with a thin polyurethane pouch with a flexible ring at each end. A woman would insert the device by squeezing the ring that sits in the closed end of the pouch and pushing it into her vagina. Once expanded inside the vagina, this inner ring would keep the condom in place. The larger ring at the open end of the pouch would sit outside the vagina, covering the external genitalia. When a man ejaculated, the internal condom pouch would trap his semen, preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before Wisconsin Pharmacal could put the condom on the market, they needed approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because the female condom was an utterly new kind of product, the FDA decided to regulate it as a Class III medical device, a category that is generally reserved for &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; medical equipment &ndash; such as pacemakers and certain lasers &ndash; and that requires the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. (The FDA classifies male condoms as Class II medical devices, so they are subject to fewer controls and don't require pre-market approval.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7yhv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took six years for the female condom to wind its way through the regulatory system, and when the government finally approved it, in 1993, Leeper breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I thought that the hardest part was going to be getting it through FDA because it was really difficult and they kept changing the specifications, the requirements, the clinical studies,&rdquo; she says. But she was wrong. The hard part was just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Wisconsin Pharmacal prepared to launch the Reality female condom in the US (it would go by other brand names in other countries), they made all the standard arrangements, hiring sales reps to visit medical practices and commissioning a big advertising firm to market the product directly to consumers. &ldquo;We did all the checklist things that you&rsquo;re supposed to do,&rdquo; Leeper says. &ldquo;And we fell flat on our face.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge, in part, was the era, and the public&rsquo;s squeamishness about a sex-related product. &ldquo;In those days, you couldn&rsquo;t talk &lsquo;condom&rsquo; out loud,&rdquo; Leeper recalls. &ldquo;Male condoms were referred to as &lsquo;rubbers&rsquo;. You said them in a whisper and they were held behind the counter by the pharmacist.&rdquo; And although the Aids crisis was raging, for many American women, the risk of contracting HIV was abstract, something that happened to other people and not to them. While women in focus groups had said they liked the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of the condom, according to Leeper, &ldquo;when push came to shove, when they were in that bedroom, the female condom was out on the dining-room table&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were other barriers, too. The condoms cost as much as $5 a piece, compared to male condoms, which can typically be had for $1 or less. Krissy Ferris recalls hearing about female condoms when she was a student at Oberlin College in Ohio, but the price was a deterrent. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t actually try one until I got free samples,&rdquo; recalls Ferris, who now works at a medical practice in Cleveland, Ohio. &ldquo;Am I going to buy $6 worth of condoms to try this out a couple times? It seems like maybe not. You&rsquo;re getting male condoms for free everywhere when you&rsquo;re in your 20s.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scream test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the female condom was, frankly, strange. Unlike the male condom, which is sold rolled up and compressed, the female condom came fully open. Women and men alike were turned off by the unfamiliar, big, plastic-bag-like device they found when they undid the packet. Though some women did eventually come to like the condoms, there was a definite learning curve and as many as one-third to one-half of women had difficulty inserting them. Once in place, the condom had a tendency to squeak or rustle during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media pounced on these complaints, and utterly skewered the female condom. They ridiculed its aesthetics with seemingly limitless creativity. As sociologist Amy Kaler recounts in her 2004 paper on the condom&rsquo;s introduction, journalists compared the product to: &ldquo;a jellyfish, a windsock, a fire hose, a colostomy bag, a Baggie, gumboots, a concertina, a plastic freezer bag, something to line Boston&rsquo;s Inner Harbor with, a cross between a test tube and a rubber glove, Edvard Munch&rsquo;s The Scream, something designed for a female elephant, something out of the science-fiction cartoon The Jetsons, a raincoat for a Slinky toy, or a &lsquo;contraption used to punish fallen virgins in the Dark Ages.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t8n6l\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the media treatment was especially harsh, journalists &ldquo;were picking up on what were genuine design issues of the first generation of the female condom,&rdquo; says Kaler, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the most beautiful thing in the world. It was easy to make fun of. It was kind of laughed out of existence before it really got a chance to take off.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there were signs that Wisconsin Pharmacal was onto something. In 1995, two years after bringing the condom to market, Leeper got a call from an official at Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. The health worker had received a petition demanding that the government of Zimbabwe bring the female condom into the country. It had been signed by 30,000 women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Leeper had initially envisioned selling the female condom in America&rsquo;s private sector, the call from Zimbabwe, coupled with the condom&rsquo;s poor reception in the US, prompted the company to shift course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International nonprofit groups and aid organisations have long been big buyers of male condoms. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the US Agency for International Development, Population Service International and others regularly purchase male condoms in bulk and then donate them &ndash; or sell them at a deeply subsidised price &ndash; to clinics and programmes that serve particularly high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1996, Wisconsin Pharmacal changed its name to the Female Health Company and began to focus on this global public sector, working with governments, global health organisations and aid agencies to get the condoms into the hands of at-risk women in low-income countries. The female condom became a particularly important tool in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where, in the early 2000s, 60% of new HIV diagnoses were made in women, who often contracted the virus through their long-term partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual revolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patience Kunaka, who was teaching nursing and midwifery students in Zimbabwe when she first heard about female condoms, knew these risks all too well. Two of her cousins had died of Aids-related causes, and three additional family members were infected with HIV. Like many other women, she was not initially impressed by the female condom. &ldquo;When I first saw one my immediate reaction was, &lsquo;Wow! How does it remain inside with penile movement?&rsquo;&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;I thought it would be sliding in and out and what a messy act! I also thought the plastic would crumble inside me causing discomfort.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7ynk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kunaka suspected her partner at the time of being unfaithful and was &ndash; in her own words &ndash; &ldquo;obsessed about sexual hygiene&rdquo;, so she decided to give the female condom a shot. It didn&rsquo;t go well at first. &ldquo;I had problems inserting it and felt discomfort from the inner ring,&rdquo; she says. Slowly, after some practice, she got the hang of it. Kunaka even came to like the device, especially &ldquo;the fact that I don&rsquo;t have to beg my partner to use a condom&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became a female-condom convert. &ldquo;In my African context, where men are at liberty to have as many partners as they can have, they give me power to negotiate for safer sex,&rdquo; she says. She even went on to get a job as the condoms and training manager for Population Service International Zimbabwe, and now spends her days spreading the word about female condoms to men and women throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female condom received a better reception in Africa than it had in the US, and as the Female Health Company sought to expand its global reach, it tweaked its original product, switching from a polyurethane condom to one made of nitrile, the same material used in many medical gloves. The nitrile condom, called the FC2, is significantly cheaper than its polyurethane predecessor, now commonly referred to as the FC1, and also less noisy during sex. In 2007, the UNFPA &lsquo;pre-qualified&rsquo; the FC2, making it eligible for bulk purchasing by public-sector agencies, and between 2007 and 2010, the number of female condoms distributed globally doubled from 25 million to 50 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not bad for a contraceptive device that&rsquo;s been likened to The Scream&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;but it&rsquo;s still a drop in the ocean compared to male condoms. For every female condom that the major donor organisations purchase, they buy 71 male condoms. And although female condoms have got cheaper, price remains a limiting factor. An aid agency purchasing the FC2 in bulk will pay anywhere from $0.55 to $0.88 per condom but can get male condoms for as little as $0.02 a piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many clinics in low-income countries, the supply of female condoms can be inconsistent, and the situation&rsquo;s not much better in the private sector. While pharmacy shelves overflow with male condoms of every imaginable kind &ndash; ribbed, studded, ultrathin, warming, aloe-enriched, neon pink, glow-in-the-dark, bubblegum-flavoured &ndash; it can be difficult to find female condoms for sale at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some places, the condoms are stigmatised, thanks to clinical trials and distribution programmes that initially focused on sex workers. Elsewhere, the devices are still saddled with the baggage of the product&rsquo;s first, failed introduction. In March 2013, for instance, a writer for Jezebel, a popular feminist blog and news site, published a post titled &ldquo;Stop Trying to Make Female Condoms Happen&rdquo;. She expressed scepticism that &ldquo;women will change their minds about wanting to line their vaginas like a waste paper basket&rdquo;, and concluded by noting that &ldquo;female condoms are just ew&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two decades after the first female condom hit the shelves, this is not exactly the revolution that public health experts had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Painful experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly 40 years, Path, a global health nonprofit based in Seattle, Washington, has been radically reinventing basic medical technologies. The group&rsquo;s designers and engineers, for instance, created the Uniject: a disposable syringe pre-loaded with a single dose of vaccine. They built a one-size-fits-all diaphragm, removing the need for women to visit a doctor to have one specially fitted. And they invented a portable, handheld scale that health workers can bring to home deliveries. The scale requires no electricity, can be read in the dark, and is decipherable even to birth attendants with low literacy, making it easy to identify underweight infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1990s, Path turned its attention to the female condom. &ldquo;The Female Health Company did an incredible thing,&rdquo; says Maggie Kilbourne-Brook, a programme officer at Path. &ldquo;They created a product that had never existed, and they got it approved, and they got it registered and marketed in more than 100 countries. They actually changed people&rsquo;s perceptions of what barrier protection could be.&rdquo; But as it became apparent that the condoms weren&rsquo;t quite living up to their potential, some experts began to think that perhaps a radical makeover was in order. &ldquo;In product development,&rdquo; says Kilbourne-Brook, &ldquo;We always expect first-generation devices will need to be improved.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Path prides itself on its user-centred design process, and so, in an effort to create a female condom that women would want to use, those at Path decided to do something both radical and obvious: consult actual women. In 1998, Path began convening focus groups in four countries &ndash; South Africa, Thailand, Mexico and the US &ndash; asking women and men what they thought about female condoms and what they wanted from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Durban to Seattle, it turns out that users&rsquo; desires were pretty basic: &ldquo;a product that was going to be easy to use, easy to insert, stable during use\", says Kilbourne-Brook. Plus, &ldquo;if it was possible, they wanted something that was more aesthetically pleasing&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7ykw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These requests became the guiding principles for the designers and engineers working at Path&rsquo;s product development laboratory in Seattle. The team ran an iterative, multi-step design process, building prototypes of potential new condoms in the lab and then sending them out to heterosexual volunteers in each of the four countries. These women and men handled and examined each model, sharing their impressions with researchers, and couples received samples of some of the more advanced prototypes to try out in their bedrooms. The product designers used the feedback to refine &ndash; and sometimes utterly rethink &ndash; their designs and then sent new, tweaked models back for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early generations of female condoms had relied on a ring-based design. One of Path&rsquo;s first prototypes was similar, with a polyurethane pouch anchored between two fixed rings. But some women reported that it was difficult to push the inner ring into the vagina &ndash; the same complaint often made about the FC1 and FC2 &ndash; and that it was painful once inside. &ldquo;Device is stable but uncomfortable,&rdquo; one Mexican tester reported. So Path decided to scrap the rings entirely. They briefly tested a prototype that could be inserted using a tampon tube applicator, but the condom didn&rsquo;t deploy reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They spent a lot of time talking about how to improve insertion. &ldquo;We know from a user perspective, if you have a difficult time the very first time you try to use a device, a woman may never come back,&rdquo; says Kilbourne-Brook. &ldquo;We wanted this to be not only easy to use, but it needed to be easy to use for someone who&rsquo;s never used it before.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kilbourne-Brook, the ultimate breakthrough was inspired by feedback from testers and researchers in Thailand, who said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if you had some kind of insertion device that helped you insert it and then it got out of the way?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical redesign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2003, they had hit on the solution: a dissolving applicator. The engineers created a condom that looked like a funnel, with a thin sheet of polyurethane that narrowed into a rounded tip. This tip contained the main pouch of the condom, collapsed inside a dissolving capsule. To insert the condom, women would simply push the capsule inside, much the same way they&rsquo;d insert a tampon. Once it came into contact with the moisture of the vagina, the capsule would melt away &ndash; often within 30-60 seconds &ndash; releasing the full condom pouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product designers gave the condom stability by attaching four small, thin pieces of polyurethane foam to the outside of the condom. Once the pouch expanded, these foam pieces nestled up against the vaginal wall, keeping the condom in place. Like other female condoms, the model also featured a flexible outer ring to cover the external genitalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between November 2003 and January 2004, 60 couples received samples of this prototype to try at home. They were impressed. Eighty-eight per cent of the women said it was easy to insert and 97% said the pouch was stable during sex. The vast majority of men and women asked said the condom was comfortable, and 98% of women and 100% of men said it allowed for satisfactory sensation during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had taken six years and more than 300 unique prototypes, but by early 2004, Path had found its female condom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final product, which Path named the Woman&rsquo;s Condom, is &ldquo;just a brilliant design,&rdquo; says Kaler, who was not involved in its creation. &ldquo;When you look at it visually, it isn&rsquo;t huge. It&rsquo;s clear what you do with it. And the way that it&rsquo;s been designed with these foam pads means that it doesn&rsquo;t move around.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of larger clinical trials &ndash; conducted in Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, China and the US &ndash; has reinforced what Path found in its initial testing, with users reporting that the Woman&rsquo;s Condom is comfortable, stable and easy to insert. Several studies have found that both men and women tend to like the Woman&rsquo;s Condom better than the FC1 and FC2. Users&rsquo; main complaint was that it does not come pre-lubricated, as the FC2 does. Instead, each condom comes with a packet of lubricant that users can apply themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the Woman&rsquo;s Condom received the stamp of approval from the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration and is currently under review by the UNFPA; approval is expected in 2014. In the meantime, limited quantities are already being sold in China and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&ldquo;Low-stress solution&rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Woman&rsquo;s Condom isn&rsquo;t the only new female condom on the scene. In 2012, the UNFPA pre-qualified the Cupid, which is manufactured by an Indian condom company. The Cupid relies on a ring-shaped foam sponge tucked into the closed end of the condom pouch for internal stability. Made of natural latex, the Cupid may be the cheapest female condom yet, and is now available for purchase in both the public and private sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other condoms, each slightly different in design, are currently under UNFPA review. For instance, the Phoenurse, which is currently sold in China, comes with an optional insertion stick. Then there&rsquo;s the panty condom, in which a condom pouch is affixed to a pair of reusable panties with an opening over the vagina. Before sex, a woman can push the condom inside with her finger &ndash; or a man can with his penis &ndash; without her having to take off the undergarment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7zc4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are still more designs in the early stages of development. Origami Condoms, based in Los Angeles, California, has developed a silicone female condom that unfolds like an accordion as it&rsquo;s pushed into the vagina. The company just completed a small phase I acceptability study &ndash; overall, participants preferred the Origami condom to the FC2, though they said the FC2 felt more stable during sex. The company plans to conduct a larger clinical trial this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every product will be right for every woman or couple, but that&rsquo;s precisely the point. &ldquo;In the studies we&rsquo;ve done, we&rsquo;ve found that some women will say, &lsquo;I really love this one and I don&rsquo;t like this one at all&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Mags Beksinska, research director at the division of maternal, adolescent and child health at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. &ldquo;There are different aspects that appeal to different women in the different designs. So it would be good if there was a wider choice.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krissy Ferris, the woman who was initially turned off by the cost of female condoms, came to see their advantages while dating a man who had trouble maintaining an erection with a male condom. &ldquo;It was definitely a barrier to male condom use, and I was not ready to compromise on using a barrier method,&rdquo; she says. The female condom was a &ldquo;low-stress&rdquo; solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Ferris has tried several different products, including the FC1, the FC2 and the VA w.o.w., which, like the Cupid, uses an internal sponge to hold the condom pouch in place. Ferris found that she preferred the VA w.o.w. because the sponge made it feel more secure during sex. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re using something with this desire for safety, having this extra measure of security was definitely a positive for me,&rdquo; she says. But the FC1 and FC2 felt more natural, she acknowledged, and for some women, that may be more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some evidence to suggest that women are more likely to have safe sex &ndash; and less likely to become pregnant or contract sexually transmitted infections &ndash; when a larger selection of contraceptive and barrier products is available. Giving women a greater choice in female condoms may increase the odds that they choose any female condom at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, male condoms are also getting a redesign. In November 2013, the Gates Foundation awarded 11 grants of $100,000 to designers, engineers and scientists with ideas for a &ldquo;next-generation condom&rsquo;&rdquo;&ndash; male or female &ndash; that would be easier and more pleasurable to use. The winning proposals include a male condom that is packaged with a built-in applicator, allowing the condom to be removed from its foil wrapper and donned in a single smooth motion, and a one-size-fits-all male condom designed to tighten during sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice makes perfect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, upgrading a product is merely a first step. While the FC1 certainly had its flaws, they weren&rsquo;t the only reason that female condoms didn&rsquo;t take off. &ldquo;Some technologies are harder than others,&rdquo; says Laura Frost, a partner at Global Health Insights, a research and consulting firm. &ldquo;Compared to other products where there&rsquo;s one huge issue, like affordability or awareness, this one had those barriers at every stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s why, for the female condom to truly break through, advocates will need to invest in comprehensive marketing and education campaigns at the local, national and global levels. &ldquo;It takes more than just putting it on the shelf,&rdquo; says Susie Hoffman, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t8mzm\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female condoms remain less straightforward than male condoms, and one of the major lessons of the last two decades is that women often need a little bit of training to use them correctly. That means that clinicians and counsellors may have to do more than simply tell women that female condoms exist &ndash; they&rsquo;ll need to give them the opportunity to practise inserting one, either on a pelvic model or on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, women may need help figuring out how to broach the subject with their male partners. Though the condoms have won praise for being female-initiated, they&rsquo;re not entirely invisible, and most men will notice if their partners are wearing them. &ldquo;In many cases, she&rsquo;s probably going to want to mention to her partner before having sex that this is a new product that she&rsquo;s going to try,&rdquo; Hoffman says. &ldquo;Ideally there&rsquo;s going to be some kind of a conversation about it, and women need help in figuring out how to do that.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male partners are also a potential market. &ldquo;Men probably feel, when it&rsquo;s called the &lsquo;female condom&rsquo;, that it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s for them,&rdquo; Mags Beksinska says. But &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no reason that a man shouldn&rsquo;t take one and bring it home and introduce it to his partner&rdquo;. In fact, she adds, once men get used to the female condom, they often prefer it to the more constricting male version. Female condoms even enhance sex for some people: the outer ring can be used to stimulate the clitoris, while the inner ring of some designs can bump up pleasurably against the tip of the penis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female condom may remain a tough sell, but the good news, experts say, is that there are now more organisations trying to make the pitch. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re seeing a much bigger coalition of advocates, which is what we need,&rdquo; Frost says. Some existing agencies, most notably the UNFPA, have stepped up their support, while champions have created a variety of new advocacy and awareness groups, including the National Female Condom Coalition in the US, and the Universal Access to Female Condoms Joint Programme, based in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, the condom&rsquo;s supporters are getting more creative in their promotion efforts, establishing Global Female Condom Day &ndash; the first one was held on 12 September 2012 &ndash; and holding female-condom-themed fashion shows and film festivals. Several organisations have turned salons and barbershops in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Cameroon and elsewhere into female condom distribution centres, training hairdressers to promote and sell the product to both male and female clients. And all-out media blitzes in Africa &ndash; in which the condoms are promoted on billboards, television and the radio &ndash; have fed a sharp increase in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;I think people had kind of written off the female condom,&rdquo; says Beth Skorochod, a senior technical adviser at Population Service International. &ldquo;But now people are beginning to say, &lsquo;Ok, with more competition and more interest, maybe this deserves another look&rsquo;.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may even be hope for the hard-to-crack private sector in higher-income countries. After winning FDA approval for the FC2 in 2009, the Female Health Company relaunched the female condom in the US, creating female condom campaigns and programmes in a handful of major American cities, including New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7zlj\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some local US groups are also beginning to lay the groundwork for the future. Staff members at the Chicago Female Condom Campaign now show off samples of some of the newest products &ndash; including the Cupid and the Woman&rsquo;s Condom &ndash; in their training and education sessions. The goal is to make sure that healthcare providers and consumers will be familiar with the products if and when they appear in the US. But there&rsquo;s an added benefit. &ldquo;Frankly what this also does is it helps to cultivate new female condom advocates,&rdquo; says Jessica Terlikowski, who coordinates the Chicago Female Condom Campaign and the National Female Condom Coalition. Seeing other products, she says, can prompt women to ask, &ldquo;&lsquo;How can I get that?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have that here?&rsquo; People can&rsquo;t ask for or demand what they don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women may soon have choices beyond the conventional condom. Scientists have been developing interventions that would be truly invisible to women&rsquo;s partners: oral antiretroviral pills and vaginal gels that prevent HIV. Despite the enormous excitement surrounding these drugs, they won&rsquo;t be magic bullets either, and the public-health community will still have to grapple with the thorny issues of education, access and adherence. Earlier this year, for instance, researchers announced that a clinical trial of two different HIV prevention pills and one vaginal gel, conducted among women in three African nations, failed because women weren&rsquo;t using the medications regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such outcomes are making it increasingly obvious that the global fight against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is unlikely to be won with any one technology, no matter how elegantly designed. Instead, it will require an arsenal of weapons, a diverse array of tools that allow women and men to protect themselves. The female condom may never be as cheap or as popular as the male condom, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has no role to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those optimistic about the female condom&rsquo;s future is Lasse Hessel, the Danish doctor who started it all. The condom&rsquo;s champions made some mistakes in the early years, Hessel says, but he&rsquo;s encouraged by the recent resurgence of interest and the new products that are hitting the shelves.

Fever, headache, vomiting and intense body aches leave you too sick to function. At this point, however, there&rsquo;s still hope: perhaps you&rsquo;ve just contracted the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around day 17, however, those prayers are dashed. The first telltale spots begin to break out on your tongue and inside your mouth. These quickly spread across your body, concentrating in the extremities. The pea-sized bumps soon fill with a thick liquid &ndash; the detritus of your ravaged tissues &ndash; and develop a donut-like indentation. For those who dare touch them, they feel like small pebbles embedded under the skin. If you survive &ndash; and 30% of people do not &ndash; the papules will form a crust, eventually falling off as scabs and leaving you with life-long pitted scars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s what happens when you are infected by Variola major virus &ndash; better known as &lt;a href=\"http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th Century alone, making it one of history&rsquo;s biggest ever viral killers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, however, smallpox was stamped out more than three decades ago, and now there are only a few samples of smallpox left on Earth. Where are they? Why are they there? And could 2014 be the year that we finally destroy the last of this killer virus once and for all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the last naturally occurring case of Variola major turned up in a two-year old girl in Bangladesh. Finally, after three decades of eradication efforts, on 8 May&nbsp; 1980, the World Health Organization pronounced success, writing: &ldquo;The world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox, which was a most devastating disease sweeping in epidemic form through many countries since earliest time, leaving death, blindness and disfigurement in its wake.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was possible because unlike most deadly viruses &ndash; such as Ebola, yellow fever, HIV, or influenza &ndash; smallpox has no animal reservoir. Without human incubators, the virus cannot naturally exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also doesn&rsquo;t stay alive on its own for long. In the past, some researchers and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/295/5562/2002\"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt; speculated that smallpox in the frozen graves of former victims might remain in suspended animation, ready to begin a new cycle of infection should those bodies ever be dug up and thawed. Scientists have attempted to excavate corpses in frozen graves in Alaska and Siberia that contain the remains of smallpox victims, however none of the bodies contained viable viruses. &ldquo;No one feels there&rsquo;s a serious chance that global warming will melt the permafrost and unleash an epidemic,&rdquo; says Michael Lane, who served as director of the Centers for Disease Control&rsquo;s (CDC) smallpox eradication programme from 1970 until 1981, when it was declared a success and shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chilling case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After smallpox was eradicated from the environment, a handful of labs across the world kept live samples of the disease for research purposes, such as developing treatments and vaccines. In 1978, however, the dangers became clear. Janet Parker, a photographer working at the University of Birmingham Medical School, began complaining about headache and muscle pains. Days later, red spots appeared on her body, which medical workers wrote off as a harmless rash. Two weeks after her symptoms began, however, doctors correctly diagnosed smallpox. She was quarantined and treated for her illness, but died around two weeks later. Her mother also fell ill but survived, while her father suffered a fatal heart attack during a visit to see his daughter in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parker had somehow been exposed to the virus, which had likely traveled through air ducts to her office from a lab downstairs where researchers kept samples of smallpox. Henry Bedson, the head of the university&rsquo;s medical microbiology department, blamed himself for Parker&rsquo;s death and &lt;a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19780909&amp;id=PwI-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cUkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5226,1912288\"&gt;cut his throat&lt;/a&gt; several days before Parker passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distressing series of events triggered a complete rethink about keeping stores of the smallpox virus for research. &ldquo;Although we all had in the back of our minds that we needed to extirpate the virus &ndash; not just the disease &ndash; that incident made us realise that the repository of smallpox in test tubes and screw-top vials in various labs was a major problem,&rdquo; Lane says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization quietly put out a call for all samples of the virus to be either destroyed or sent to one of two official repositories: a CDC lab near Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Siberia. A handful of samples quickly came in, arriving from India, Japan, the UK and other locations. &ldquo;It very quickly became obvious that nobody wanted the virus in their lab anyway,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;They were delighted to give this stuff up.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral tomb&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Currently, smallpox is known to be kept only at those two locations. (While previously unknown vials were &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28221185\"&gt;discovered in a Washington lab in July 2014&lt;/a&gt;, they were soon transported to Atlanta.) Both house the virus in biosafety level four (BSL-4) facilities. This level of safety &ndash; the highest possible &ndash; requires researchers to wear a positive pressure suit that resembles those worn in space and includes a tethered air supply. All manipulation with the virus, which is stored in liquid nitrogen tanks, is done in bio-safety cabinets. When exiting the lab, researchers spend seven minutes in a chemical shower to disinfect themselves, followed by a water rinse. No air escapes from within the BSL-4&rsquo;s rooms, and each year the CDC lab is shut down for a month to undergo preventative maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC is located on the fringes of bustling Atlanta, the Russian smallpox repository, Vector, has an additional safety measure &ndash; it is in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security at both locations is formidable. &ldquo;I was director of smallpox programmes for many years, and I live one mile from the CDC,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even get into the building &ndash; not just the lab &ndash; where smallpox virus is kept.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of researchers are permitted to enter these chambers. For some, it&rsquo;s just another day on the job. &ldquo;I cut my teeth working on BSL-4 viruses,&rdquo; says Peter Jahrling, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease&rsquo;s Integrated Research Facility, and chief of the Emerging Viral Pathogens Section. &ldquo;I work with Ebola, Lassa and Marburg, so smallpox is a walk in the park.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, however, maintain a sense of reverence for the disease. &ldquo;This is a virus that wreaked terrible havoc on the human population, and efforts to control and eradicate that disease were heroic,&rdquo; says Inger Damon, chief of the poxvirus and rabies branch at the CDC&rsquo;s Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ever become immune to that sense of awe.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nowhere else?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So how do we know that additional smallpox samples are not also hoarded away in some terrorist hideout, or stuck in an old vial in the back of a forgotten freezer? &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to prove a negative.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, things look good for the disease&rsquo;s confinement to the CDC and Vector. Since the late 1970s, as far as experts know, no one has contracted smallpox. At the same time, no terrorists have come forward claiming they have the virus and no rumours have circulated of it being kept in some secret lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, that is, for one suspicious case. In 1992, Ken Alibek &ndash; formerly Colonel Kanatzhan Alibekov &ndash; defected from Russia to the US. Alibek served as the first deputy director of Biopreparat, the Soviet Union&rsquo;s biological warfare agency, founded in 1973. After arriving in the US, Alibek began &lt;a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/esmallpox/biohazard_alibek.pdf\"&gt;making allegations&lt;/a&gt; against his former nation, claiming that the Soviet Union had produced 50 tons of smallpox. Biopreparat, he claimed, had employed a scientific army of 30,000 people who worked on smallpox and other pathogenic weapons, such as Ebola, anthrax and plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could this be true? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that smallpox virus was developed as a biological weapon and produced on an industrial scale,&rdquo; Jahrling says. &ldquo;Is it possible that someone kept a little retirement package in his freezer? It&rsquo;s not impossible.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some &ndash; including Lane &ndash; doubt Alibek&rsquo;s claims, and point out there&rsquo;s no evidence. &ldquo;The fact that nobody knows for sure whether this happened is the major factor that makes people nervous, even though there&rsquo;s no solid reason to believe it,&rdquo; says Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last to go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the last remaining virus samples in Atlanta and Russia might finally be headed for eradication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, the World Health Assembly &ndash; which acts as a sort of congress for the WHO &ndash; will vote about whether or not to destroy the remaining smallpox samples. The Russian delegation has consistently voted against this path, so there is a chance that Russia would not comply if the vote turned in favour of destroying the virus. For the US, however, &ldquo;it would be extremely embarrassing for us not to go along with the official WHO recommendation,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d basically be thumbing our nose at the UN.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russians are not alone in wanting to keep smallpox. Some scientists say that more research needs to be done on the complex genetics of the virus, which could help devise more effective antivirals, for example. &ldquo;I know many in this country feel there&rsquo;s important research to be done, and that it really doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to acquiesce to some symbolic act,&rdquo; Jahrling says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damon also sees the logic in keeping smallpox around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind many times, and when I first came to this position at CDC, I didn&rsquo;t really see a need to use the live virus,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But I think if we&rsquo;re going to develop a better understanding of the virus, having access to it is critical.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissenters, on the other hand, claim that most of that work can be done with the much less virulent Vaccinia virus or other related viruses. &ldquo;It almost becomes a theological argument: either you believe you need it or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jahrling says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&rsquo;t destroying it make certain once and for all that it&rsquo;d never fall into the wrong hands though? The truth is, even it were destroyed, existing lab techniques could in principle recreate it based on the smallpox genome, which has been sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That begs the question: why hasn&rsquo;t anyone done that already? If a terrorist group, say, did have the means of creating smallpox, the effort may not be worth it compared with other methods of terrorism, such as the use of chemical weapons, says Lane. Vaccines exist to contain smallpox&rsquo;s spread, and it isn&rsquo;t the most contagious of pathogens. A smallpox outbreak would no doubt be a catastrophe, but there are worse things that could be unleashed on a population. We beat smallpox once and we could beat it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, smallpox lives on &ndash; somewhere deep inside two very special labs; the only two places left on Earth where one of history&rsquo;s biggest killers still thrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Smallpox: Last refuge of an ultimate killer","HeadlineShort":"Last refuge of an ultimate killer","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In July 2014, long forgotten vials of smallpox left in a cardboard box were discovered at a research centre near Washington.

They followed similar career paths, working their way up Kenya&rsquo;s health insurance industry until each ran successful brokerage businesses in the sector. Then, a few years ago, they both quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than 10% of Kenyans covered by health insurance, whether by private companies or the mandatory national hospital care scheme for those in formal employment, most of the population potentially faces devastating out-of-pocket expenses if they fall seriously ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oloo and Agutu decided there must be a better way. So in 2008 they launched Changamka Microhealth, a company that helps Kenya&rsquo;s urban poor access and finance healthcare through use of mobile phones, mobile money and smart cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all employers are required by law to enroll their employees into the National Hospital Insurance Fund, membership is voluntary for the 77% of the working population who are self-employed or work in the informal sector. The scheme covers limited hospital care solely, and as of last year, only 800,000 people from the informal sector were enrolled. Other private insurance schemes cost upwards of 50-80,000 KES ($600-900) to cover a family. The average per capita income in Kenya is only $1,800 a year.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;For self-employed Kenyans [and those in the informal economy]&hellip; formal insurance mechanisms do not exist,&rdquo; says Oloo. And they are the ones who need it the most. Even malaria treatment, which costs as little as half a US dollar can cause financial difficulties for someone making just $2-$3 a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. G. Mbugua, who has run a small clinic called Uhuru Prestige in a low-income area of the capital Nairobi for the past seven years, says that most of his patients are uninsured.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;In Kenya, we have a problem with saving for health care,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Most of my patients pay out of pocket. They prefer to tackle health care when someone is sick. They&rsquo;d rather buy food than save for health.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina Synowiec, of the Center for Health Market Innovations in Washington, DC, agrees. &ldquo;There is lack of sensitisation to insurance, and, as part of that, pre-payment is a hard concept,&rdquo; says Synowiec. &ldquo;The notion of paying in advance for access to health services is foreign, but can help in preventing financial catastrophes.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synowiec adds that it can be difficult to identify uninsured individuals and their families, encourage enrollment and collect premiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet while a culture of saving among the poor is lacking because of low wages, fluid employment, and extended family emergencies, &ldquo;saving is better understood than insurance,&rdquo; Oloo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in 2009 Changamka launched a &ldquo;smart card&rdquo; that enabled Kenyans to save small amounts over time to cover the costs of outpatient services, drug prescriptions and consultations. Customers could buy Medi-Save cards in shops, and then add money whenever they liked using M-Pesa, the mobile money service that allows the nearly 75% of adult Kenyans who subscribe to it to use their phones to store money and make payments. Medi-Save users could then transfer extra money into an account linked to their card number simply by sending a text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they attended clinics, hospitals and other healthcare providers, their cards were swiped and their accounts charged at point-of-sale terminals. Changamka pre-contracts prices with medical providers, and takes a 10% cut for services charged. Providers are happy to pay, since the system eliminates time consuming and expensive paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life saver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the company introduced new E-cards, which work the same way as the previous system except now providers bill patients via a secure website, meaning they don't need separate point-of-sale devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the introduction of these cards, says Oloo, many women had no way to securely save for maternity care. &ldquo;They would put their money under their pillow, but something would go wrong after a few months. For example a boyfriend would come and say there&rsquo;s an emergency and give me that money.&rdquo; To help women in this situation, the company launched a separate maternity card, to enable women to save for ante-natal, maternity and post-natal services at set prices. They also have a card for family health care.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hellen Osteno, of Komarock, a low-income area on the edge of Nairobi, bought a family card in April. &ldquo;I chose to get the card because many times I could not save,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s helped me because now I don&rsquo;t have to go to the bank to deposit money or check my balance. I can check it through my handset, even in the night, if I have an emergency.&rdquo; She saves &ldquo;around 100 or 200 KES&rdquo; ($1-2) daily when she can, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new E-card system claims are submitted online, meaning they can be traced and processed more quickly. Changamka is also now able to start digitising the medical records of its clients, as diagnosis and treatment notes are also recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future doctors and other medical professionals could gain access to patients&rsquo; digital medical histories thanks to M-Kadi and other systems like it, although just as similar schemes have provoked debate in some western countries, some Kenyans have expressed fears about privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the company has sold 12,000 family health plans, 3,000 maternity plans.&nbsp;However sometimes saving is not enough. &ldquo;We found catastrophes could not always depend on savings,&rdquo; says Agutu, &ldquo;so we designed an insurance product that would service the lower end of the market.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changamka, in collaboration with one of Kenya&rsquo;s largest insurance companies British American Insurance and telecom provider Safaricom, launched a micro-insurance scheme called Lindi Jamii in November last year. Customers can simply dial *525# on a Safaricom line to sign up. A community health worker then visits to obtain a photo and take down other details such as a national ID number and family information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to their other services, customers save money via M-Pesa transfers. Once their account hits 12,000 KES, ($140), they are immediately enrolled in a family insurance scheme, covering two parents and unlimited children for 180 days.&nbsp;Besides covering typical medical expenses, the insurance also covers add on services such as income replacement during hospitalisation, funeral assistance, and dental coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changamka is doing its best to find new ways to extend coverage and facilitate payments for Kenya&rsquo;s uninsured, however it is still a long way from profiting from these schemes. Their Linda Jamii micro-insurance only has around 8,000 subscribers so far, and is currently still reliant on funding from NGOs and donor agencies. The company has shown it can use novel technologies to help insure the poor, but to be truly successful, and profitable, it will have to find a way to reach hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of uninsured Kenyans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:16:19Z","HeadlineLong":"Smart cards that top-up health ","HeadlineShort":"Smart cards that top-up health ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Most of Kenyas population cant afford the crippling expenses if they fall seriously ill.

We should use the resources, technology and the science we have to make sure that hungry citizens have adequate food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that we don&rsquo;t do this, because we are politically motivated, or because of policy or logistical limitations to get food from point A to point B, is extremely frustrating as this is a solvable problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way d&rsquo;Amato says we can feed the world is by using models that can work in communities &ndash; in one community it might be the water supply to teach farmers how to grow food, in another it might be urban gardening. Whatever it is the community has to be able to sustain it: the political will or the donations come and go, but the hungry child doesn&rsquo;t come and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are able to use data in way we haven&rsquo;t been able to before. We can use software platforms and geo-mapping to measure impact. Thirty years ago, we couldn&rsquo;t do this: we knew we were feeding one hundred people, but we didn&rsquo;t know if we were feeding the right people, or whether to feed them more. Technology allows people to measure where that food went and who ate it, and therefore the impact is even more profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeding people in need allows them to focus their minds on other matters, as their basic needs are taken care of. They can contribute to their communities in ways we haven&rsquo;t thought of, because they have been distracted or having to find their food.

It is one of the driest places in the world, and some sections of the Mars-like expanse can go 50 years without feeling a drop of rain. As poet Alonso de Ercilla put it in 1569: &ldquo;Towards Atacama, near the deserted coast, you see a land without men, where there is not a bird, not a beast, nor a tree, nor any vegetation.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Atacama is not devoid of life. Microorganisms called endoliths have found a way to cling on, by hiding themselves inside the pores of rocks, where there&rsquo;s just enough water to survive. &ldquo;They support a whole community of organisms that eat the byproducts of their metabolism,&rdquo; says Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a microbiologist at Johns Hopkins University. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re all just sitting right there in the rocks &ndash; it&rsquo;s quite fascinating.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life, it seems, has an incredible knack for finding ways to persist. Indeed, microorganisms have been around for nearly four billion years, giving them ample time to adapt to some of the most extreme conditions in the natural world. But are there places left on Earth so harsh that they are rendered sterile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23kc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat is a good starting point for answering this question. The record for heat tolerance is currently held by a group of organisms called hyperthermophile methanogens, which thrive around the edges of hydrothermal vents in the deep sea. Some of these organisms can grow at &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/105/31/10949.full.pdf\"&gt;temperatures of up to 122C&lt;/a&gt; (252F).&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most researchers believe that around 150C (302F) is the theoretical cut-off point for life, however. At that temperature proteins fall apart and chemical reactions cannot occur &ndash; a quirk of the biochemistry that life on Earth (so far as we know) abides by. This means that microorganisms can thrive around hydrothermal vents, but not directly within them, where temperatures can reach up to 464C (867F). The same is true for the interior of an active volcano on land. &ldquo;I really think temperature is the most hostile parameter,&rdquo; says Helena Santos, a microbial physiologist at the New University of Lisbon and president of the &lt;a href=\"http://extremophiles.org/\"&gt;International Society for Extremophiles&lt;/a&gt;. When things get hot enough, she says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible &ndash; everything is destroyed.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23bt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pressure, by contrast, appears to be less of a problem for life. This means that heat rather than depth probably limits how far below the surface of the Earth life occurs. The centre of the Earth&rsquo;s 6,000C (10,800F) temperature certainly precludes all life, although the depth at which the cut-off occurs is still under investigation. One microorganism called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5899/275\"&gt;Desulforudis audaxviator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was discovered nearly two miles (3.2km) below the Earth&rsquo;s surface, in a South African gold mine. It has not been in contact with the surface for potentially millions of years, and survives by siphoning nutrients from rocks undergoing radioactive decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life exists at the other extreme, too, in subfreezing conditions. Bacteria in the genus &lt;em&gt;Psychrobacter &lt;/em&gt;can happily live below -10C (14F) in Siberian permafrost and Antarctic glacier mud. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/science/living-bacteria-found-deep-under-antarctic-ice-scientists-say.html?_r=0\"&gt;Living cells recently turned up&lt;/a&gt; in a subglacial lake below the Antarctic ice. And Antarctica&rsquo;s hypersaline Deep Lake hosts unique &lt;a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/25/1307090110.abstract\"&gt;salt-loving species&lt;/a&gt;, even at -20C (-4F). To survive in these environments, microrganisms possess features such as specially adapted membranes and protein structures, and anti-freeze molecules within their cells. Given that the Earth has been covered in ice multiple times since life first evolved, &ldquo;an ice-covered lake in Antarctica does not seem all that extreme,&rdquo; says Jill Mikucki, a microbiologist at the University of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t23nt\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation typically does not deter microorganisms, either. So long as they are not in the direct pathway of an atomic blast &ndash; which would likely burn them up &ndash; they can thrive in containers of radioactive waste or near the epicentre of the Chernobyl disaster, for example. &lt;em&gt;Deinococcus radiodurans&lt;/em&gt;, one of the hardiest of the radio-resistant microorganisms, has &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378109702009539\"&gt;survived trips into space&lt;/a&gt; and can endure radiation doses of up to 15,000 gray (the standard measure of the absorbed dose of radiation). For humans, just 5 gray causes death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, what we register as deadly chemical environments, some extremophiles call home sweet home. Various organisms depend on arsenic, mercury or other heavy metals for their growth and survival, while others prefer cyanide. In &lt;a href=\"http://www.exploratorium.edu/kamchatka/\"&gt;the hot springs of Kamchatka in Russia&lt;/a&gt;, menageries of microorganisms metabolise using sulphur or carbon monoxide. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find a chemical that can kill all life,&rdquo; says Frank Robb, a microbiologist at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might be isolated exceptions, however. Don Juan Pond in Antarctica is the saltiest known body of water on the planet, with salinity levels topping 40%. (The Dead Sea is around 33%). Researchers have recovered traces of microbial life from the pond, but they are still trying to determine whether it is actively growing and replicating there, or just blowing in from other locations. Don Juan counts as &ldquo;an example of a place on the surface of Earth where we might expect life, but cannot verify the presence of active life,&rdquo; says Corien Bakermans, a microbiologist at Penn State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, extreme heat and some synthetic laboratory environments might be the only sterile conditions on the planet&rsquo;s surface that it&rsquo;s possible to find zero traces of life. New organisms are regularly discovered that push the boundaries of life as we understand it, although where that line will ultimately be drawn remains unknown. As Santos says, &ldquo;What does not exist is more difficult to prove than what does exist.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there are some lone holdouts of sterility in the natural world, however, the environment exists in a constant state of flux &ndash; and if extremophiles teach us anything, it is that organisms are always capable of adapting. &ldquo;Give them enough time and they will find a way,&rdquo; says DiRuggiero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"A grand tour of our planets last outposts.

For many, not a day goes by without checking email, browsing online or consulting Google. Some 1.3 billion people alive today are young enough never to have experienced anything else. Yet has the network of networks underpinning all this activity actually reached every part of the globe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various reasons still stop people accessing the internet where they live, of course. There&rsquo;s censorship, for starters. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get much traffic from North Korea,&rdquo; says John Graham-Cumming of &lt;a href=\"http://www.cloudflare.com/\"&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;, a content delivery network &ndash; the equivalent of a regional parcel distribution centre, but for web traffic. &ldquo;Likewise, early in the Syrian civil war they cut off internet access and we saw a drop in traffic coming from those Syrian connections.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s also a well-established problem that many of the world&rsquo;s poorest people do not have the means or technology to log on, with just &lt;a href=\"http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2013/05.aspx#.Uv0POEKwKm0\"&gt;31% of people&lt;/a&gt; in the developing world using the internet, compared to 77% in the developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01s8j01\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these political and social barriers to access do not necessarily tell us about the physical extent of the internet itself. Assuming you had the right device and the political freedom, is there anywhere left on Earth where the labyrinth of cable and wireless signals does not reach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answering this question begins with an explanation of the various tiers of internet access. The primary mechanisms for getting online are wired connections, mobile networks and satellites. Fibre-optic cables make up the core of the internet, &lt;a href=\"http://www.submarinecablemap.com/\"&gt;criss-crossing oceans&lt;/a&gt; and land. The first of those communications cables were put down in the 1850s for carrying telegraph signals. Today they &lt;a href=\"http://www.submarinecablemap.com/\"&gt;connect all continents&lt;/a&gt; except Antarctica, and include many &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog57/presentations/Tuesday/tues.general.Stronge.Submarine.32.pdf\"&gt;but not all&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; small island nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile connections, meanwhile, rely on cell phone towers. And these can have an impressive reach. &ldquo;Two years ago I was in the Sahara, and for quite a large amount of time I had access,&rdquo; Graham-Cumming says. &ldquo;It was patchy and slow, but it was there.&rdquo; Indeed, many developing countries, especially in Africa, rely predominantly on mobile connections for accessing the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, satellites are the slowest means of getting online, but the only choice for those living far from a cell phone tower or wire. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.iridium.com/default.aspx\"&gt;Iridium&lt;/a&gt; satellite constellation coverage extends over the entire world, and their satellite phones can wire you up in otherwise unconnected places, such as national parks in the US, Antarctica or isolated spots of land like the Cook Islands. &ldquo;If you live out in the sticks somewhere, it makes no sense for your local telecom provider to run a fibre to your house or farm,&rdquo; says David Belson, editor of the quarterly &lt;a href=\"http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/\"&gt;State of the Internet&lt;/a&gt; report at &lt;a href=\"http://www.akamai.com/\"&gt;Akamai&lt;/a&gt;, one of the world&rsquo;s largest content delivery networks. &ldquo;So in many cases satellite is the optimal solution, although it may not be the fastest one.&rdquo; Sheer distance explains that delay: from the equator, for instance, data needs to travel about 22,000 miles (35,000km) between satellite and user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01s8jbc\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet access via satellite is gradually improving, though. A satellite broadband provider called &lt;a href=\"http://www.o3bnetworks.com/\"&gt;O3b Networks&lt;/a&gt; recently launched its first four satellites, which it says orbit around &lt;a href=\"http://www.o3bnetworks.com/welcome-to-o3b/faqs\"&gt;four times closer to Earth&lt;/a&gt; than regular geosynchronous satellites and cover a 400 mile (643km) circumference per satellite. This should speed up data transfer by about four times compared to traditional satellite connections. The Cook Islands in the Pacific signed up as the first trial customers, while places like Somalia and inland Peru are expected to join in six months or so. The company also plans to provide internet to cruise ships and offshore oilrigs, which currently use traditional satellites. &ldquo;There will always be places where it&rsquo;s hard to get either terrestrial or satellite connections, but those pockets will become smaller and smaller,&rdquo; says Steve Collar, O3b&rsquo;s CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Google recently announced plans to tackle remaining internet deserts through its &lt;a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/\"&gt;Loon&lt;/a&gt; project, a group of giant balloons that will fly at about 70,000 feet (21,000 metres) and deliver internet to rural or disaster-stricken areas. Like satellites, people connecting through the balloons would need a special antenna to deliver and receive a signal. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.google.com/loon/where/\"&gt;pilot launch&lt;/a&gt; took place last June, when 30 balloons were deployed above New Zealand&rsquo;s South Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01s8j38\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other technologies also promise to make access easier in the small or temporary black spots still remaining in more developed nations. In underground tunnels, internet can be delivered by creating local hotspots using mobile radios, as is the case on Amtrak and Eurostar trains, and in some city subways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is coverage pretty much ubiquitous then? Not quite. There are a few places left where cable, wireless or satellite signals do not reach. Deep caves like Georgia&rsquo;s Krubera Cave, which reaches 5,610 feet (1,710m) underground, for one, would likely be devoid of service &ndash; it&rsquo;s the deepest cave on Earth. (However, even underground it wouldn&rsquo;t be guaranteed if there&rsquo;s a cell phone tower nearby, for example, or an opening directly overhead that a satellite signal could penetrate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible last place without internet is deep underwater. While many submarines have internet enabled through the same means that they use to keep up radio contact, the signals can be poor or non-existent because the signal can become distorted by water. &ldquo;I bet a nuclear submarine has really rubbish access,&rdquo; Graham-Cumming speculates.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the best way to get offline might be a self-imposed ban. It&rsquo;s possible that internet-free zones might emerge in the future. Some communities may choose to deliberately cut themselves off from the internet, much like the uncontacted tribes in South America, New Guinea and India, who purposefully choose to remain isolated. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some group eventually says, &lsquo;No, we don&rsquo;t want to have internet,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Graham-Cumming.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To truly avoid the internet, then, you have to make a great deal of effort. Even the remotest wilderness now yields a signal of some sort. So if you ever find yourself yearning for a life before emails, LOLcat memes and Facebook, consider this: the tendrils of the ultimate network are so widespread now, it&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-02-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The last places on Earth without the internet","HeadlineShort":"The last places without internet","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Is there anywhere left on Earth where its impossible to access the internet?

Fever, headache, vomiting and intense body aches leave you too sick to function. At this point, however, there&rsquo;s still hope: perhaps you&rsquo;ve just contracted the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around day 17, however, those prayers are dashed. The first telltale spots begin to break out on your tongue and inside your mouth. These quickly spread across your body, concentrating in the extremities. The pea-sized bumps soon fill with a thick liquid &ndash; the detritus of your ravaged tissues &ndash; and develop a donut-like indentation. For those who dare touch them, they feel like small pebbles embedded under the skin. If you survive &ndash; and 30% of people do not &ndash; the papules will form a crust, eventually falling off as scabs and leaving you with life-long pitted scars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s what happens when you are infected by Variola major virus &ndash; better known as &lt;a href=\"http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp\"&gt;smallpox&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 300 million people died from smallpox in the 20th Century alone, making it one of history&rsquo;s biggest ever viral killers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, however, smallpox was stamped out more than three decades ago, and now there are only a few samples of smallpox left on Earth. Where are they? Why are they there? And could 2014 be the year that we finally destroy the last of this killer virus once and for all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975, the last naturally occurring case of Variola major turned up in a two-year old girl in Bangladesh. Finally, after three decades of eradication efforts, on 8 May&nbsp; 1980, the World Health Organization pronounced success, writing: &ldquo;The world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox, which was a most devastating disease sweeping in epidemic form through many countries since earliest time, leaving death, blindness and disfigurement in its wake.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was possible because unlike most deadly viruses &ndash; such as Ebola, yellow fever, HIV, or influenza &ndash; smallpox has no animal reservoir. Without human incubators, the virus cannot naturally exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also doesn&rsquo;t stay alive on its own for long. In the past, some researchers and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/295/5562/2002\"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt; speculated that smallpox in the frozen graves of former victims might remain in suspended animation, ready to begin a new cycle of infection should those bodies ever be dug up and thawed. Scientists have attempted to excavate corpses in frozen graves in Alaska and Siberia that contain the remains of smallpox victims, however none of the bodies contained viable viruses. &ldquo;No one feels there&rsquo;s a serious chance that global warming will melt the permafrost and unleash an epidemic,&rdquo; says Michael Lane, who served as director of the Centers for Disease Control&rsquo;s (CDC) smallpox eradication programme from 1970 until 1981, when it was declared a success and shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chilling case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After smallpox was eradicated from the environment, a handful of labs across the world kept live samples of the disease for research purposes, such as developing treatments and vaccines. In 1978, however, the dangers became clear. Janet Parker, a photographer working at the University of Birmingham Medical School, began complaining about headache and muscle pains. Days later, red spots appeared on her body, which medical workers wrote off as a harmless rash. Two weeks after her symptoms began, however, doctors correctly diagnosed smallpox. She was quarantined and treated for her illness, but died around two weeks later. Her mother also fell ill but survived, while her father suffered a fatal heart attack during a visit to see his daughter in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parker had somehow been exposed to the virus, which had likely traveled through air ducts to her office from a lab downstairs where researchers kept samples of smallpox. Henry Bedson, the head of the university&rsquo;s medical microbiology department, blamed himself for Parker&rsquo;s death and &lt;a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19780909&amp;id=PwI-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cUkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5226,1912288\"&gt;cut his throat&lt;/a&gt; several days before Parker passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distressing series of events triggered a complete rethink about keeping stores of the smallpox virus for research. &ldquo;Although we all had in the back of our minds that we needed to extirpate the virus &ndash; not just the disease &ndash; that incident made us realise that the repository of smallpox in test tubes and screw-top vials in various labs was a major problem,&rdquo; Lane says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization quietly put out a call for all samples of the virus to be either destroyed or sent to one of two official repositories: a CDC lab near Atlanta and the Vector Institute in Koltsovo, Siberia. A handful of samples quickly came in, arriving from India, Japan, the UK and other locations. &ldquo;It very quickly became obvious that nobody wanted the virus in their lab anyway,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;They were delighted to give this stuff up.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral tomb&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Currently, smallpox is known to be kept only at those two locations. (While previously unknown vials were &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-28221185\"&gt;discovered in a Washington lab in July 2014&lt;/a&gt;, they were soon transported to Atlanta.) Both house the virus in biosafety level four (BSL-4) facilities. This level of safety &ndash; the highest possible &ndash; requires researchers to wear a positive pressure suit that resembles those worn in space and includes a tethered air supply. All manipulation with the virus, which is stored in liquid nitrogen tanks, is done in bio-safety cabinets. When exiting the lab, researchers spend seven minutes in a chemical shower to disinfect themselves, followed by a water rinse. No air escapes from within the BSL-4&rsquo;s rooms, and each year the CDC lab is shut down for a month to undergo preventative maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the CDC is located on the fringes of bustling Atlanta, the Russian smallpox repository, Vector, has an additional safety measure &ndash; it is in the middle of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security at both locations is formidable. &ldquo;I was director of smallpox programmes for many years, and I live one mile from the CDC,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even get into the building &ndash; not just the lab &ndash; where smallpox virus is kept.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small number of researchers are permitted to enter these chambers. For some, it&rsquo;s just another day on the job. &ldquo;I cut my teeth working on BSL-4 viruses,&rdquo; says Peter Jahrling, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease&rsquo;s Integrated Research Facility, and chief of the Emerging Viral Pathogens Section. &ldquo;I work with Ebola, Lassa and Marburg, so smallpox is a walk in the park.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others, however, maintain a sense of reverence for the disease. &ldquo;This is a virus that wreaked terrible havoc on the human population, and efforts to control and eradicate that disease were heroic,&rdquo; says Inger Damon, chief of the poxvirus and rabies branch at the CDC&rsquo;s Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ever become immune to that sense of awe.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nowhere else?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So how do we know that additional smallpox samples are not also hoarded away in some terrorist hideout, or stuck in an old vial in the back of a forgotten freezer? &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to prove a negative.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, things look good for the disease&rsquo;s confinement to the CDC and Vector. Since the late 1970s, as far as experts know, no one has contracted smallpox. At the same time, no terrorists have come forward claiming they have the virus and no rumours have circulated of it being kept in some secret lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, that is, for one suspicious case. In 1992, Ken Alibek &ndash; formerly Colonel Kanatzhan Alibekov &ndash; defected from Russia to the US. Alibek served as the first deputy director of Biopreparat, the Soviet Union&rsquo;s biological warfare agency, founded in 1973. After arriving in the US, Alibek began &lt;a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nichsr/esmallpox/biohazard_alibek.pdf\"&gt;making allegations&lt;/a&gt; against his former nation, claiming that the Soviet Union had produced 50 tons of smallpox. Biopreparat, he claimed, had employed a scientific army of 30,000 people who worked on smallpox and other pathogenic weapons, such as Ebola, anthrax and plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could this be true? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret that smallpox virus was developed as a biological weapon and produced on an industrial scale,&rdquo; Jahrling says. &ldquo;Is it possible that someone kept a little retirement package in his freezer? It&rsquo;s not impossible.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some &ndash; including Lane &ndash; doubt Alibek&rsquo;s claims, and point out there&rsquo;s no evidence. &ldquo;The fact that nobody knows for sure whether this happened is the major factor that makes people nervous, even though there&rsquo;s no solid reason to believe it,&rdquo; says Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last to go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the last remaining virus samples in Atlanta and Russia might finally be headed for eradication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, the World Health Assembly &ndash; which acts as a sort of congress for the WHO &ndash; will vote about whether or not to destroy the remaining smallpox samples. The Russian delegation has consistently voted against this path, so there is a chance that Russia would not comply if the vote turned in favour of destroying the virus. For the US, however, &ldquo;it would be extremely embarrassing for us not to go along with the official WHO recommendation,&rdquo; Lane says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d basically be thumbing our nose at the UN.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russians are not alone in wanting to keep smallpox. Some scientists say that more research needs to be done on the complex genetics of the virus, which could help devise more effective antivirals, for example. &ldquo;I know many in this country feel there&rsquo;s important research to be done, and that it really doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to acquiesce to some symbolic act,&rdquo; Jahrling says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damon also sees the logic in keeping smallpox around. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind many times, and when I first came to this position at CDC, I didn&rsquo;t really see a need to use the live virus,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But I think if we&rsquo;re going to develop a better understanding of the virus, having access to it is critical.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissenters, on the other hand, claim that most of that work can be done with the much less virulent Vaccinia virus or other related viruses. &ldquo;It almost becomes a theological argument: either you believe you need it or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jahrling says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&rsquo;t destroying it make certain once and for all that it&rsquo;d never fall into the wrong hands though? The truth is, even it were destroyed, existing lab techniques could in principle recreate it based on the smallpox genome, which has been sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That begs the question: why hasn&rsquo;t anyone done that already? If a terrorist group, say, did have the means of creating smallpox, the effort may not be worth it compared with other methods of terrorism, such as the use of chemical weapons, says Lane. Vaccines exist to contain smallpox&rsquo;s spread, and it isn&rsquo;t the most contagious of pathogens. A smallpox outbreak would no doubt be a catastrophe, but there are worse things that could be unleashed on a population. We beat smallpox once and we could beat it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, smallpox lives on &ndash; somewhere deep inside two very special labs; the only two places left on Earth where one of history&rsquo;s biggest killers still thrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-01-31T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Smallpox: Last refuge of an ultimate killer","HeadlineShort":"Last refuge of an ultimate killer","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"In July 2014, long forgotten vials of smallpox left in a cardboard box were discovered at a research centre near Washington.

Down there, sound levels regularly exceed 100 decibels &ndash; enough to &lt;a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/subway-noise-can-damage-your-ears-say-experts-1.6164286\"&gt;damage a person&rsquo;s hearing over time&lt;/a&gt;. It was on one such platform that George Foy, a journalist and New York University creative writing professor, suddenly found himself losing it one day, when four trains pulled in at once. &ldquo;I kind of went momentarily crazy,&rdquo; he says. He hunched over and stuck his fingers in his ears, desperately trying to block out the cacophony. &ldquo;I started wondering why the hell I was putting up with this,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was then that his obsession to find the quietest place on Earth began. &ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;If this is the craziness of noise, what is the opposite? What is absolute silence, and does it exist?&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foy took it upon himself to seek out the world&rsquo;s quietest place, detailed in his recent book, &lt;a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1416599592\"&gt;Zero Decibels&lt;/a&gt;. He joins many others, ranging from &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120921-give-peace-and-quiet-a-chance\"&gt;health professionals to ecologists to hobbyists&lt;/a&gt;, who have attempted to seek out the quietest corners in the world. Yet it turns out that finding those unsullied locations is more difficult than it might seem. Foy, for one, did find his ultimate silent spot in the end, but it wasn&rsquo;t quite the peaceful refuge he anticipated &ndash; in fact, he discovered there that there&rsquo;s one human noise none of us can ever escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sit still for a moment, and prick up your ears. What can you hear? Even in what seems like silence: you may soon notice the hum of your computer, the ticking of a clock, the electric burr of a refrigerator or an air conditioner, or the faint hum of a car passing by. Humanity&rsquo;s noises are always with us in one form or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you were seeking to escape this background buzz, where would you start? First let&rsquo;s assume that you&rsquo;d want somewhere reasonably pleasant to visit. So while deep underground might be an option, it wouldn&rsquo;t be very hospitable. Similarly, life underwater would be full of hardships &ndash; and in any case, you couldn&rsquo;t escape man-made sounds like scuba regulators or submarine engines because you&rsquo;d need them to stay alive. That&rsquo;s not to mention the underwater rumblings of ships, drilling and explosions that permeate the worlds&rsquo; oceans. In water, sound travels more than &lt;a href=\"http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/sound.html\"&gt;four times faster than in air&lt;/a&gt;, and reaches further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent checklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On land, scratching noisy places off the list of potentials comes easily. Satellite images can be used to exclude all &lt;a href=\"http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/55000/55167/earth_lights.jpg\"&gt;areas with artificial light&lt;/a&gt;. Google Earth further reveals timber operations, mining, agriculture, roads and nautical shipping routes &ndash; all, presumably, rife with noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this logic, Antarctica immediately comes to mind as a promising candidate. It no doubt has silent corners &ndash; but the seasons do make things tricky. In the winter, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to go for a stroll. And in the summer, research planes and tourism boats are prevalent, and resident scientists power their camps with whirring diesel generators, the rumble of which can be heard for 20 miles or more around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other apparently remote regions of Earth might prove no better. Planes are the primary culprits. The rumblings of the largest aircraft can, on a clear day, travel up to 160km (100 miles). There is no altitude that a commercial jet can fly at which it is not audible on the ground, and the sound of any given aircraft can be heard, on average, between three to eight minutes as it passes overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no commercial flights travel across Antarctica, they do cruise over wildernesses such as northern Canada, Siberia or the Sahara. The North Pole is out too, as planes regularly traverse that route on trips between North America and Europe. Even deep in the Amazon rainforest, 1,900 km (1,200 miles) from the nearest city, Gordon Hempton, an acoustic ecologist and founder of the non&ndash;profit &lt;a href=\"http://onesquareinch.org/\"&gt;One Square Inch&lt;/a&gt;, recorded sounds from one or two aircraft per hour. &ldquo;Even if you are far from a road, you are not far from the roads in the sky,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Hempton says that there is absolutely no place on Earth that is completely free from human sound all of the time. A map of the established flight paths over the US, for example, &ldquo;looks like a plate of spaghetti,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hempton is not alone in this pronouncement. &ldquo;There are no places on Earth that I&rsquo;ve been that haven&rsquo;t been affected by human sound,&rdquo; agrees Bernie Krause, an expert in bioacoustics and one of the founders of the field of &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology\"&gt;soundscape ecology&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;All over the Earth, not a day goes by when you don&rsquo;t hear something.&rdquo; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Quiet winners&nbsp; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Given the lack of truly silent places in nature, identifying the quietest place on Earth really boils down to how stringent you are about how long silence should last. Several years ago, the Campaign to Protect Rural England declared &lt;a href=\"http://www.visitalnwick.org.uk/explore/northumberland_national_park.htm\"&gt;a spot in Northumberland&lt;/a&gt; the most tranquil place in the country. One of the reasons that idyllic refuge is so quiet, however, is its location just next to a military training area. Away from all roads and accessible only by foot or mountain bike, that corner of the country is indeed very silent &ndash; except when tanks are rumbling across the base and soldiers are practicing on the firing range. &ldquo;If you go on a training day, it&rsquo;s anything but tranquil,&rdquo; says Trevor Cox, a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past 30 years, Hempton has made it his mission to discover what he calls the last great quiet places, areas that clock in at audible human noise-free intervals of 15 minutes or more. He only counts areas of around 3,100 square kilometres (1,200 square miles) or larger &ndash; enough to create a sound buffer around a central point of absolute quiet. Over the years, his list has shrunk as he returns to a previously quiet spot, only to find it now polluted by noise. Still, he says 12 such quiet places exist in the US, with more found around the world. A spot in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-the-hoh.htm\"&gt;Hoh Rainforest&lt;/a&gt; in Washington is one, as are places in &lt;a href=\"http://www.pc.gc.ca/pn-np/sk/grasslands/index.aspx\"&gt;Grasslands National Park&lt;/a&gt; in Canada, &lt;a href=\"http://www.bwca.com/\"&gt;Boundary Waters Canoe Area&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota and &lt;a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/hale/index.htm\"&gt;Haleakala National Park&lt;/a&gt; in Hawaii (see gallery). The others, however, he keeps confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his search has focused on the US, he has investigated quiet places abroad, too. Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, Austria and most developed parts of Europe and Asia have all been ruled out. On the other hand, he identified a quiet place &lt;a href=\"http://www.cofan.org/\"&gt;deep in the Ecuadorian rainforest&lt;/a&gt;, and there are others in South America. He suspects one might exist in Poland (he&rsquo;s waiting on funding to come through to further investigate this possibility), and also more in Norway, Sweden and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hempton and Krause hope that nations will adopt a quiet area program akin to &lt;a href=\"http://www.darksky.org/\"&gt;dark sky programs&lt;/a&gt;. They are pushing for the US National Park Service to adopt such regulations in 2016, in time for the agency&rsquo;s centennial. &ldquo;I absolutely believe we will have our quiet places,&rdquo; Hempton says. &ldquo;Just like we went through with water quality, things have to get really bad before we recognise them as a basic value and clean them up.&rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yet for those seeking absolute relief from human noise for an indefinite period, the surest bet would finding one of the rooms specifically built for that purpose, called anechoic chambers. They are both sound proof and sound wave-absorbing. That was the conclusion reached by Foy, at least, after he visited such a chamber at Orfield Labs in Minnesota. It measures at &ndash;9.4 decibels, a figure less than zero decibels because any sound that does exist is below what the human ear can detect. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s supposed to be the quietest place on earth,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where others tend to become uncomfortable in the disconcerting silence, Foy relished the chance to be completely cut off. But minutes into his stay in the chamber, he noticed that the silence was in fact broken. His own body, it turned out &ndash; his breathing, his heartbeat, even the scratchy sound his scalp made rubbing against his skull when he frowned &ndash; was betraying his quest for auditory nothingness. &ldquo;The only time you&rsquo;ll hear absolute silence is when you&rsquo;re in no position to hear it, because you&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; he realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quietest places in the world, then, are ones we have built, and yet, so long as we are living, we will never escape the noise of our own bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, given the discomfort that many report experiencing in &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130816-the-sound-of-deafening-silence\"&gt;absolute silence&lt;/a&gt;, it may instead be nature&rsquo;s melodies that our souls are really craving. And for now, it&rsquo;s still possible to find forests, seashores or mountains where you can relax for 15 minutes or more completely free from the clatter of human existence. If you find one of these serene sweet spots, however, it might be best to keep it quietly to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; page, or message us on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-01-17T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The last place on Earth without human noise","HeadlineShort":"Earths last place without noise","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Is there anywhere left utterly free of man-made sound?

                You shouldn't be able to drink milk. Your ancestors couldn't. It is only in the last 9,000 years that human adults have gained that ability without becoming ill. Children could manage it, but it was only when we turned to dairy farming that adults acquired the ability to properly digest milk.
               </p>
               <p>
                It turns out that cultures with a history of dairy farming and milk drinking have a much higher frequency of lactose tolerance  and its associated gene  than those who don't.
               </p>
               <p>
                Drinking milk is just one of example of the way that traditions and cultural practices can influence the path of our evolution. Culture and genetics are traditionally thought of as two separate processes, but researchers are increasingly realising that they are intimately connected, each influencing the natural progression of the other. Scientists call it "gene-culture co-evolution." Why does it matter? If we can pin down how culture influences our genetic makeup  and how the same processes apply to other creatures too  then we can be better understand how the way we act as a society today could influence our future.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another example of how culture influences our genes is the relationship between yam farming and malaria resistance. Throughout much of Africa, people are in constant battle with malaria.
                <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/">
                 According to the CDC
                </a>
                , in 2010 there were some 219 million cases of malaria reported worldwide, and 660,000 were fatal. More than 90% of those who died lived in Africa.

                But there are some people who seem to have a natural defense force. Their red blood cells, normally shaped like flattened disks, are shaped instead like a crescent or sickle. Because of the odd shaped blood cells,
                <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sca/">
                 sickle-cell disease can lead to blockages in blood vessels
                </a>
                , which in turn cause pain and organ damage. Under normal circumstances, evolution keeps sickle-cell disease to a minimum because it can be so harmful and can reduce life expectancy. But because of a biological quirk, the sickle-cell gene can actually protect against malaria. So in parts of the world where malaria infection rates are extremely high, like Africa, natural selection may actually favour the sickle-shaped cells. In the gamble of life, protection against malaria may be preferable, even at the potential cost of suffering from sickle-cell disease.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here's what's interesting: those communities that farm yams have much higher rates of the sickle-cell gene than nearby communities with different agricultural practices. In order to cultivate yams, trees had to be chopped down. "The removal of trees had the effect of inadvertently increasing the amount of standing water when it rained, which provided better breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes," writes biologist Kevin Laland of the University of St Andrews in
                <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v11/n2/abs/nrg2734.html">
                 Nature Reviews Genetics
                </a>
                . More mosquitos mean more malaria, creating the conditions for sickle-shaped cells to become adaptive.
               </p>
               <p>
                So while it's sickle-cell disease that's protective against malaria, it was a uniquely human behavior  yam farming  that allowed evolution to act.
               </p>

                Not all examples of gene-culture co-evolution are quite as beneficial. Polynesians, for example, have a uniquely high prevalence of type II diabetes. It's among the highest worldwide, and is higher even than among neighbouring human populations. One group of researchers has discovered that the
                <a href="http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n5/abs/5201793a.html">
                 Polynesians have a particularly high frequency of a variant of a gene called
                 <em>
                  PPARGC1A
                 </em>

                , and that may be responsible for their high frequency of type II diabetes, at least in part.

                Why are they so uniquely afflicted by this disease? The researchers think it may have something to do with their ancestors'
                <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/restless-genes/dobbs-text">
                 culture of exploration
                </a>
                . As the Polynesians settled the islands of the Pacific, they endured long voyages across the open ocean, and faced the stresses of cold and starvation. Those conditions may have encouraged "thrifty metabolism", which allows people to build up fat deposits more quickly when food is available. Natural selection may have increased the frequency of associated gene variants among them. However the sort of metabolism that would have been useful to explorers can lead to obesity and type II diabetes for individuals in modern cultures with consistent sources of nourishment. So modern Polynesians may have inherited a susceptibility to type II diabetes not because they lead a sedentary lifestyle, but because their ancestors decided to climb into some canoes and explore their planet.

                While these examples are perhaps the best understood examples of gene-culture co-evolution, researchers have identified scores of others. Our domestication of plants may have given a leg up to the genes that allow us to detoxify certain chemical compounds found in the plants we eat. Our history of exploring new territories and unfamiliar climates may have acted upon genes that allow us to tolerate more extreme heat or cold than our ancestors. The invention of cooking may have altered the evolution of our jaw muscles and our tooth enamel. The emergence of language and complex social cognition may have prompted natural selection to further guide the development of our brains and nervous systems.

                It would be easy to assume that cultural influences are unique to humans. Yet some animal species have at least rudimentary cultures, and it would be silly to think that this couldn't influence their genetics just as ours does. It might be happening among the

                 dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia

                .

               <p>
                A group of researchers led by University of New South Wales biologist Anna Kopps has been studying the bottlenose dolphins of the western part of the bay. A well known form of foraging among these dolphins is "sponging," a behavior that involves carrying a conical sponge to protect their faces as they root around the seafloor looking for food. It's not just an exciting example of tool use; it's also evidence of cultural transmission.
               </p>
               <p>
                The behavior, as Kopps points out, is "almost exclusively transmitted from mothers to their offspring through social learning". That means there's a tight correlation between it and the parts of the young dolphins' genomes that are passed on from their mothers.
               </p>
               <p>
                This link does not necessarily provide us with evidence that a cultural behavior has caused alterations in the genetic material, unlike the lactose tolerance, malaria resistance, and thrifty metabolism examples in humans. Still, it's a clue that there could be something more, a hint at a way in which cultural practices in dolphins might create an opportunity for natural selection to occur.

                Cultural influence on our own evolution continues apace, but it is currently nearly impossible to predict just how it will happen. What sorts of genetic adaptations will we see as a result of our technological culture? Will those adaptations apply universally, or only among some of us? How will human-machine interfaces, such as robotic prostheses or neural implants, affect our gene pools? Will the propensity for violent sports in some cultures lead to adaptations to protect against head trauma? And what are the questions we don't even yet realise we should be asking?
               </p>
               <p>
                It no longer makes sense to think of genetics and culture as two separate uninteracting monoliths. The difficulty is identifying how and if one is influencing the other. "This is the great challenge for the field of gene-culture co-evolution, and it is a formidable challenge," Laland writes. "Nonetheless, the best-researched examples, such as the lactose-tolerance case, not only show that gene-culture co-evolution occurs but also illustrate the means to establish this."
