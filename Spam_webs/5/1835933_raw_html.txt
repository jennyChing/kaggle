           Todays post for Blackberry and Sage Infused Water isnt so much a recipe, as it is more of a tip. Infusing water with any of your favorite fruits, veggies, or herbs is a fantastic way to get a boost of light flavor and antioxidants added to your water, without any extra Points Plus or anything artificial. There are tons and tons of water infusion ideas that you can find, and I highly suggest experimenting to create your own favorite. Making standard water a bit more exciting can be really helpful way to get in all those daily water servings. My kids think its SO exciting to look at the pretty waters I make, and so then they are excited to drink it too, which I love! There are a lot of different version I use, but this Blackberry and Sage infusion is one of my favorites. And its perfect for fall! I love to serve this with Thanksgiving dinner.

          are the much healthier and lighter version of store bought fruit leathers, like Fruit Roll-Ups. Now you can enjoy snacking on a tasty treat that is completely void of artificial ingredients, artificial colors, preservatives, and the other garbage that todays foods are sadly filled with. Veggie-Gos are organic, Non-GMO, have no added sugar, are Vegan and are 0 Points Plus each! Oh, and they are delicious. Perfect for kids lunch boxes or after school snacks too. I love stashing a few of these in my purse for when I need a quick, healthy treat. Keep reading to learn more

          If youve got a hankering for apple pie but dont want to blow a days worth of Points Plus on a small little slice, Dunkin Donuts Apple Pie Coffee is a pretty delicious alternative. The coffee itself is practically calorie free, just be careful about what you add into it. But with a bit of reduced fat cream and sweetener, this is one tasty morning pick me up that will have you feeling a LOT less guilty. I love to have a small cup after dinner because I always crave something sweet. This coffee does the trick. And the bonus is that the caffeine gets me energized enough to write a new Weight Watchers Recipe for you all to read :).

          Ok, so this really isnt a recipe as much as it is a public service announcement for an often overlooked squashthe delicata. Although its considered a winter squash, its actually in the same species as all other summer squashes. After a recommendation from the cashier at Trader Joes, I grabbed one of these lovely little delicate squashes and brought it home to add in as quick side dish for dinner that night. I just did a simple roast on it with nothing more than a light misting of olive oil and sea salt, but wow was it good! And SO much easier to work with than butternut squash. I left the skin on when cooking, and then just peeled it very easily right off of the skin as I ate it. It was tender, mildly sweet and absolutely delicious. Next time, I want to try it with topping I used on these
          <a href="http://www.laaloosh.com/2012/12/04/spicy-roasted-acorn-squash-wedges/" target="_blank">
           Spicy Acorn Squash Wedges
          </a>
          . This Roasted Delicata Squash Recipe is simple, delicious and full of nutrients. So the next time you want to try some squash, dont overlook the delicata!

          Ok, folks, as you may know (IF you are an avid reader of LaaLoosh), I ADORE hot sauce. I am always on the lookout for the new, tasty versions to try, and over the many years and many bottles Ive sampled, Ive only found a handful that have really stolen my heart (and taste buds). And todays featured Fabulous Food Find, the new

           Bah BAH Hot Sauce
          </a>
          , is one of them. The makers of this new hot sauce got in touch with me and asked if Id be willing to try their product and give them some feedback. Of course, I was willing and eager! When I read that the makers had Persian roots, I knew Bah BAH (which means Mmmm mmm, btw) was gonna be good, but I honestly had no idea that it was going to be as incredible as it was. And I cannot say enough good things about itits fantastic. Id had it for a week, and the whole bottle was finished.I could NOT stop eating it!  I was literally looking for food, ANY food, that I could use as a vehicle to consume more of this deliciousness. Keep reading to learn more about Bah BAH Hot sauce

          Ok, you guys are going to kill me for all the cauliflower recipes lately, but I just cant help myself. As a Weight Watcher, I am always trying to get my veggies in and they are a great way to bulk up my meals without adding more Points. And this Roasted Chile Lime Cauliflower Recipe is soooooo amazingly good. Since roasted vegetables are a great way to add more volume to a meal, I am always experimenting with vegetables and various flavors. Cauliflower is a great vegetable to play with, because its own mild flavor allow for it to really pick up the flavors of whatever you cook it with. Its such a versatile vegetable and I use it a ton of my Weight Watchers Recipes. With a few simple spices and some fresh lime juice, the cauliflower takes on some wonderful aromatics and flavors in this incredibly easy recipe. At 0 Points + per serving, my Roasted Chile Lime Cauliflower makes a wonderful side dish for just about any main course.

          As temperatures heat up, its time to cool down with some delicious and light summer cocktails! When I first found about these low calorie non-alcoholic mixes, I was pretty excited to give them a try, but a bit skeptical that they would taste good. So I picked up a bottle of each flavor of the Sinless Cocktail Mixers at my local grocery store and decided to give them a try. Apparently, they have been out for a while, but I never knew about them until recently. I tasted each of them straight up, then I made cocktails with them. They were fantastic! Made with Stevia instead of artificial sweeteners or sugar, each 3oz serving has just 5 calories, 0 fat and 2 carbohydrates, making them 0 Points +. However, dont forget to count the Points of your alcohol when mixing them! They come in 4 amazing flavors: Margarita Mix, Mojito Mix, Sour Mix and Strawberry Margarita Mix. Keep reading to find out more!

          Wow, thats a mouthful of a product name, but Id be happy to say it a million times over for how amazing it is! I am ALL about my morning (and occasional afternoon coffee), and Im sure many of you are too. But I hate spending the 2 Points Plus on the cream that I put in it (Id rather chew those Points!). So when I recently came across this So Delicious Dairy Free Barista Style Original Coconut Milk Creamer at my local grocery store, I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try. Its nutritional stats put it at 0 Points per serving, so I figured that was worth a shot. I was amazed at how good it was! Creamy with a hint of coconut sweetness, its a perfect dairy-free alternative to traditional creamers.  Keep reading to get more details!

           If you want a healthy, 0 Points alternative to french fries, or roasted potatoes, these Roasted Carrot Sticks are a fantastic option. They are so simple to prepare, yet are very flavorful and savory. Roasting the carrots bring out a wonderful new taste, and helps get rid of the some of the sweetness of the carrot. It ends up having more of a potato-like flavor. I roasted mine using salt, pepper and cumin, but you can experiment with this and use any seasonings youd like. Also, this is the ONLY way I can get my 4 year old to eat a carrot. So that alone is a huge plus in my book! These roasted carrots are a lovely and delightful low calorie side dish recipe that will give you a great way to get in that all important veggie serving for 0 Points. Enjoy!

           I adore roasted vegetablesthey give such a different and robust flavor to the veggie and, in my opinion, make vegetables really easy to eat. But one vegetable that I surprisingly havent tried  to roast yet was beets. With a fresh bundle of beets on hand, I decided that now was the time. In just a few quick and easy steps, my beets were roasting away in the oven, and I was anxiously awaiting that first bite. They turned out even better than I expected! The salt, thyme and orange juice seasoning were perfect. They were sweet and tender, but with a kick. Absolutely delicious. And of course, they are 0 Points + per serving which makes them all the more tastier. My husband liked these a lot too, and they will definitely become a go to vegetable side dish in our household. Enjoy!

           Ive been a fan of
           <a href="http://www.laaloosh.com/2012/01/04/baked-kale-chips-recipe/">
            roasted kale chips
           </a>
           longer than I can remember, but it never occurred to me, until recently, to start getting more experimental in my kale usage. It is such an amazing vegetable with incredible benefits, and yet I had only prepared it a few different ways. Since it does have a similar taste to chard, I decided to cook it the same way I would make a sauteed chard recipe. Plus, I happened to have a lot of kale on hand, and I needed a quick and healthy side dish recipe that required little effort. A sauteed kale recipe was just the ticket. And I was thrilled with how it turned out  so delicious and so incredibly easy. This is definitely a great Weight Watchers recipe to go to when I need a quick side that is very low in Points + and super high in nutrition.

           If you have ever seen this odd looking, alien-like vegetable in your produce aisle, you may have wondered what it is and how on earth do you eat it. Well its called romanesco, often referred to as Roman Broccoli or Roman Cauliflower, and its a variant form of cauliflower. I just recently I received two heads of it in my CSA package, and I was extremely eager to try it out! Romanesco is a great diversity for fans of the cauliflower who ran out of ideas on the different ways of preparing it. Romanesco may be prepared similarly as the cauliflower, but it is more easily digested. And are you ready to hear what nutrients you are getting in this beautifully strange vegetable? Its loaded with: Vitamin B1, Thiamin, Vitamin B2, Riboflavin, Vitamin B3, Niacin, Vitamin B5, Pantothenic Acid, Vitamin B6, Pyridoxine, Vitamin B9, Folate, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, Dietary Fiber, Manganese, Magnesium, Protein, Phosphorus, Potassium, Tryptophan, and Omega 3 Fatty Acids  impressive! To get the full appreciation for the flavor of the vegetable, I decided to do a simple roasting of it. I broke it down into florets, lightly misted it with my olive oil mister, sprinkled some sea salt on top and popped it in the oven. It was absolutely delicious. It tastes like a combination of cauliflower and broccoli. I admit that the shape of this vegetable is a little off-putting, but dont let that scare you away! Its so delicious and so easy to prepare and makes a wonderful 0 Points side dish. Plus, it will make one heck of a conversation piece at the dinner table. Give it a try!
