     When
looking up what is the biggest dinosaur, people usually get presented
with the image of a
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/articles/sauropod-dinosaurs.html">
      sauropod
     </a>
     ,
but the exact owner of this title
depends upon a number of factors, particularly the definition of
largest be it by length, height or weight. Although incomplete,
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     is thought to be one of the largest
dinosaurs but not
necessarily the largest. It does however appear to have been
one of the last of the giant sauropods alive in North America since
remains are dated to the Aptian to Albian stages of the early
Cretaceous. Even by this time the sauropods were rare when compared
to their numbers in the late Jurassic and eventually they seem to have
been replaced by
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/articles/ceratopsian-dinosaurs.html">
      ceratopsian
     </a>
     dinosaurs and
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/articles/hadrosaurs.html">
      hadrosaurs
     </a>
     as the dominant
herbivores.
     <br/>
     The
first remains of
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     were discovered in
1994 by a team
led by Dr. Richard Cifelli, however at the time they were
misidentified as petrified tree trunks. It was not until 1999
when Cifelli removed them from storage and passed them onto Matt Wedel
for study that their real identity of being sauropod vertebrae was
discovered. What really made the discovery exciting was the sheer
size of the vertebrae that were some of the largest ever seen. The
remains were officially named
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     in
2000, but
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     still made headlines towards the end
on 1999 when the
discovery was announced in a press release.
     <br/>
     This
sparked a short lived media sensation about the discovery of the
biggest dinosaur, but as is often the case concerning stories about
palaeontology, the headline got in the way of the facts. The
vertebrae came from a very big dinosaur but the only clue we have to
the size of
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     is comparison to related
dinosaurs with a
similar body form. For this purpose palaeontologists used
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/g/giraffatitan.html">
      <i>
       Giraffatitan
      </i>
     </a>
     due to it having some of the most complete remains,
although a complete skeleton from a single individual is still
unknown. Comparison to
     <i>
      Giraffatitan
     </i>
     has allowed
for reconstructions
of
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     where it was capable of lifting
its head to around
seventeen meters off the ground, something which if accurate would
place
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     as the tallest dinosaur.
     <br/>
     However
the comparison to
     <i>
      Giraffatitan
     </i>
     may not be perfect
because while
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     has longer vertebrae, the overall
construction suggests
that
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     was more gracile, which
basically means more
lightly built. This has led to speculation that
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     may
have had a neck that when compared to the size of the body, was
proportionately longer than that of
     <i>
      Giraffatitan
     </i>
     .
The cervical ribs
that supported the girth of the neck also suggest that the neck was
lightly built despite its large size. As such it seems that like with
other sauropods, as
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     got larger the
body changed to be
not as heavily built as its smaller relatives. This is a clever
progression as it means the body would not require a directly
proportional increase in calories to fuel a more massive body,
however it also means that
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     is
unlikely to claim the
title of largest dinosaur in terms of weight. At the time of writing
the best contenders for biggest dinosaur are
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/argentinosaurus.html">
      <i>
       Argentinosaurus
      </i>
     </a>
     from
South America, or possibly even
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/amphicoelias.html">
      <i>
       Amphicoelias
      </i>
     </a>
     .
     <br/>
     When
fully grown
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     was virtually attack
proof since even
the largest predator known to be active in North America at the time,
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/a/acrocanthosaurus.html">
      <i>
       Acrocanthosaurus
      </i>
     </a>
     ,
would have probably been less than half the length
and many times lighter than
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     .
However before an
individual attained this size it would need to spend many years as a
much smaller juvenile and here is where the danger of predators like
     <i>
      Acrocanthosaurus
     </i>
     would have been at its greatest.
Additionally the
large
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/articles/dromaeosaurs.html">
      dromaeosaur
     </a>
     <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/u/utahraptor.html">
      <i>
       Utahraptor
      </i>
     </a>
     was also active in North America at
roughly this time and with its size advantage over other related but
generally smaller dinosaurs, it could have easily killed a very young
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     .
     <br/>
     The
name
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     is a reference to the Greek god
Poseidon, who
while usually depicted as a deity of the sea, also held domain over
earthquakes. With
     <i>
      Sauroposeidon
     </i>
     being such a
large and heavy dinosaur
weighing many tons, it was thought to shake the ground like there was
an earthquake when it walked, hence the connection.
