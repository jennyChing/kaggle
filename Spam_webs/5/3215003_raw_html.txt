   William Safire's Rules for Writers:
  </h1>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Remember to never split an infinitive.
   </li>
   <li>
    The passive voice should never be used.
   </li>
   <li>
    Do not put statements in the negative form.
   </li>
   <li>
    Verbs have to agree with their subjects.
   </li>
   <li>
    Proofread carefully to see if you words out.
   </li>
   <li>
    If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal
of repetition can be by rereading and editing.
   </li>
   <li>
    A writer must not shift your point of view.
   </li>
   <li>
    And don't start a sentence with a conjunction. (Remember, too,
a preposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.)
   </li>
   <li>
    Don't overuse exclamation marks!!
   </li>
   <li>
    Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long
sentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.
   </li>
   <li>
    Writing carefully, dangling participles must be avoided.
   </li>
   <li>
    If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a linking verb is.
   </li>
   <li>
    Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing metaphors.
   </li>
   <li>
    Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.
   </li>
   <li>
    Everyone should be careful to use a singular pronoun with
singular nouns in their writing.
   </li>
   <li>
    Always pick on the correct idiom.
   </li>
   <li>
    The adverb always follows the verb.
   </li>
   <li>
    Last but not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek viable
alternatives.
   </li>
  </ul>
