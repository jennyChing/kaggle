  Like Rondo Hatton,
  <b>

  </b>
  needed little makeup to play monsters.
  <b>
   Johnson
  </b>
  was not deformed like Hatton, but was possessed of a 300-pound-plus frame which lent itself well to the portrayal of superhuman monsters, roles that
  <b>
   Tor Johnson
  </b>
  played in a number of films in the 1950s. Usually the actor appeared with a shaved head and little other makeup in fashioning a series of bizarre brainless giants in films like

    Tor Johnson
   </b>
   was born in Sweden around the turn of the century and by the early 1930's was barnstorming the United States as a professional wrestler, usually under the name of the Super Swedish Angel. In 1935 he appeared as a wrestler in the W.C. Field's comedy
   <a href="trapeze.html">
    <b>
     The Man On The Flying Trapeze
    </b>
   </a>
   and for the next two decades he would continue to make fleeting film appearances while remaining one of the most popular attractions in the wrestling world. By the mid-1950's
   <b>
    Tor

   had retired from wrestling and settled into a new career a movie monster. In 1944 he had his first brush with fantasy films with a bit in the Universal comedy
   <a href="ghost.html">
    <b>
     The Ghost Catchers
    </b>

   <b>
    Johnson
   </b>
   had a great deal of footage as the lumbering Lobo and he soon became a favorite of horror film fans and the part became closely associated with him. Next he was featured as the mindless giant Curry in
   <a href="black.html">
    <b>
     The Black Sleep

   <a href="un.html">
    <b>
     The Unearthly
    </b>
   </a>
   , one of the last films released by Republic. Here Lobo was the servant of a mad scientist (John Carradine) whose gland experiments had turned him into a brainless giant. The film did give
   <b>
    Tor
   </b>
   a few lines of dialogue and in the end he aided the heroine (Allison Hayes) in escaping the fate he had befallen. In 1959

   again repeated the part of Lobo in

   During the 1960s
   <b>
    Tor Johnson
   </b>
   made occasional television appearances on such programs as People's Court, You Bet Your Life (with Grouch Marx) and The Red Skelton Show and he also made a few television commercials. In the late 1960s he recreated the role of Lobo for a series of personal appearances in Southern California.

   died on May 12, 1971, in a Los Angeles hospital after a brief illness and was survived by his wife and son.

  <p>
   It goes without saying that
   <b>
    Tor Johnson
   </b>
   was a giant in the horror film genre and while not a great actor he was certainly adept at playing mindless monstrous giants; occasionally he added a little pathos to those parts, which have endeared him to horror film followers.

   Recently,
   <b>

   life was essayed in Tim Burton's brilliant film
