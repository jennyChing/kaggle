              Quote:
              <br/>
              JADE (Joint Assistant for Deployment and Execution) is a knowledge-based mixed-initiative system that supports force
              <br/>
              deployment planning and management. JADE uses case-based and generative planning methods to support the development
              <br/>
              of large-scale, complex deployment plans in minimal time. JADE incorporates the technology of three tools:
              <br/>
              Prodigy-Analogy (a combined case-based and generative planner developed by Carnegie Mellon University); ForMAT
              <br/>
              (Force Management and Analysis Tool) that supports case-based force deployment planning developed by BBN
              <br/>
              Technologies); and PARKA (a highly-indexed knowledge based management system developed by the University of
              <br/>
              Maryland).
              <br/>
              With JADE, a military planner can build a preliminary force deployment plan, including the Time Phased Force
              <br/>
              Deployment Data (TPFDD) in less than one hour. This speed in plan construction is possible because JADE supports the
              <br/>
              rapid retrieval and reuse of previous plan elements for use in the development of new plans. In addition, JADE employs an
              <br/>
              easy to use map-oriented drag and drop interface where force modules (FMs) from previous plans (cases) whose force
              <br/>
              capabilities and composition match the requirements of the current situation can be dragged from the case library and
              <br/>
              dropped onto a geographic destination. Plan modification and/or adaption is supported through remindings, e.g., each time
              <br/>
              that a force module is created or is copied into a plan (TPFDD) the user is automatically reminded of the need for
              <br/>
              geographical changes. :Unquote:

             </p>
             <p>
              JADE HELM has been ongoing for awhile. First came the infiltration into key communities and local militias and organizations to assess the risk. Second came the report and later deployment of the needed military equipment to the local sheriffs and police departments. We have seen the procurement of arms, ammunition, food and water in crazy amounts and then those supplies were delivered to key locations.
             </p>

              The trap is set, all is left is to herd us rats into the trap.

              The revolutionary development of modern weapons within a world divided by serious ideological differences has produced a crisis in human history. In order to overcome the danger of nuclear war now confronting mankind, the United States has introduced at the Sixteenth General Assembly of the United Nations a Program for General and Complete Disarmament in a Peaceful World.
              <br/>
              This new program provides for the progressive reduction of the war-making capabilities of nations and the simultaneous strengthening of international institutions to settle disputes and maintain the peace. It sets forth a series of comprehensive measures which can and should he taken in order to bring about a world in which there will be freedom from war and security for all states. It is based on three principles deemed essential to the achievement of practical progress in the disarmament field:
             </p>
             <p>
              First, there must be immediate disarmament action:
             </p>
             <p>
              A strenuous and uninterrupted effort must be made toward the goal of general and complete disarmament; at the same time, it is important that specific measures be put into effect as soon as possible.
             </p>
             <p>
              1
             </p>
             <p>
              Second, all disarmament obligations must be subject
              <br/>
              to effective international controls:
             </p>
             <p>
              The control organization must have the manpower, facilities, and effectiveness to assure that limitations or reductions take place as agreed. It must also be able to certify to all states that retained forces and armaments do not exceed those permitted at any stage of the disarmament process.
             </p>
             <p>
              Third, adequate peace-keeping machinery must be established:
             </p>
             <p>
              There is an inseparable relationship between the scaling down of national armaments on the one hand and the building up of international peace-keeping machinery and institutions on the other. Nations are unlikely to shed their means of self-protection in the absence of alternative ways to safeguard their legitimate interests. This can only be achieved through the progressive strengthening of international institutions under the United Nations and by creating a United Nations Peace Force to enforce the peace as the disarmament process proceeds.
             </p>

              DISARMAMENT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES
             </p>
             <p>
              The over-all goal of the United States is a free, secure, and peaceful world of independent states adhering to common standards of justice and international conduct and subjecting the use of force to the rule of law; a world which has achieved general and complete disarmament under effective international control; and a world in which adjustment to change takes place in accordance with the principles of the United Nations.
              <br/>
              In order to make possible the achievement of that goal, the program sets forth the following specific objectives toward which nations should direct their efforts:
              <br/>
              The disbanding of all national armed forces and the prohibition of their reestablishment in any form whatsoever other than those required to preserve internal order and for contributions to a United Nations Peace Force;

             </script>
             <p>
              The elimination from national arsenals of all armaments, including all weapons of mass destruction and

             <p>
              the means for their delivery, other than those required for a United Nations Peace Force and for maintaining internal order;
             </p>
             <p>
              The institution of effective means for the enforcement of international agreements, for the settlement of disputes, and for the maintenance of peace in accordance with the principles of the United Nations;
             </p>
             <p>
              The establishment and effective operation of an International Disarmament Organization within the framework of the United Nations to insure compliance at all times with all disarmament obligations.
             </p>
             <p>
              TASK OF NEGOTIATING STATES
             </p>
             <p>
              The negotiating states are called upon to develop the program into a detailed plan for general and complete disarmament and to continue their efforts without interruption until the whole program has been achieved. To this end, they are to seek the widest possible area of agreement at the earliest possible date. At the same time, and without prejudice to progress on the disarmament program, they are to seek agreement on those immediate measures that would contribute to the common security of nations and that could facilitate and form part of the total program.
             </p>
             <p>
              GOVERNING PRINCIPLES
             </p>
             <p>
              The program sets forth a series of general principles to guide the negotiating states in their work. These make clear that:
             </p>
             <p>
              4
             </p>
             <p>
              As states relinquish their arms, the United Nations must be progressively strengthened in order to improve its capacity to assure international security and the peaceful settlement of disputes;
             </p>
             <p>
              Disarmament must proceed as rapidly as possible, until it is completed, in stages containing balanced, phased, and safeguarded measures;
             </p>
             <p>
              Each measure and stage should be carried out in an agreed period of time, with transition from one stage to the next to take place as soon as all measures in the preceding stage have been carried out and verified and as soon as necessary arrangements for verification of the next stage have been made;
             </p>
             <p>
              Inspection and verification must establish both that nations carry out scheduled limitations or reductions and that they do not retain armed forces and armaments in excess of those permitted at any stage of the disarmament process; and
             </p>
             <p>
              Disarmament must take place in a manner that will not affect adversely the security of any state.
             </p>
             <p>
              DISARMAMENT STAGES
             </p>
             <p>
              The program provides for progressive disarmament steps to take place in three stages and for the simultaneous strengthening of international institutions.
             </p>
             <p>
              FIRST STAGE
             </p>
             <p>
              The first stage contains measures which would significantly reduce the capabilities of nations to wage
             </p>
             <p>
              5
             </p>
             <p>
              aggressive war. Implementation of this stage would mean that:
              <br/>
              The nuclear threat would be reduced:
             </p>
             <p>
              All states would have adhered to a treaty effectively prohibiting tile testing of nuclear weapons.
              <br/>
              The production of fissionable materials for use in weapons would be stopped and quantities of such materials from past production would be converted to non-weapons uses.
              <br/>
              States owning nuclear weapons would not relinquish control of such weapons to any nation not owning them and would not transmit to any such nation information or material necessary for their manufacture.
              <br/>
              States not owning nuclear weapons would no~ manufacture them or attempt to obtain control of such weapons belonging to other states.
              <br/>
              A Commission of Experts would be established to report on the feasibility and means for the verified reduction and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons stockpiles.
              <br/>
              Strategic delivery vehicles would he reduced:
             </p>
             <p>
              Strategic nuclear weapons delivery vehicles of specified categories and weapons designed to counter such vehicles would be reduced to agreed levels by equitable and balanced steps; their production would be discontinued or limited; their testing would be limited or halted.
             </p>
             <p>
              6
             </p>
             <p>
              Arms and armed forces would be reduced:
              <br/>
              The armed forces of the United States and the Soviet Union would be limited to 2.1 million men each (with appropriate levels not exceeding that amount for other militarily significant states); levels of armaments would be correspondingly reduced and their production would be limited.
              <br/>
              An Experts Commission would be established to examine and report on the feasibility and means of accomplishing verifiable reduction and eventual elimination of all chemical, biological and radiological weapons.

              MANY Wal Mart Closings In Jade Helm States A Sign They Will Be Used In An Event
             </p>
             <p>
              Published on Apr 14, 2015
             </p>
             <p>
              With news of numerous Wal-Mart supercenters now being temporarily closed (6+ months each which brings us to October 2015 or later) in at least 4 different states now tied to the Jade Helm 15 exercises due to what were being told are plumbing problems, will these massive stores soon be used as food distribution centers and to house the headquarters of invading troops from China, here to disarm Americans one by one as promised by Michelle Obama to the Chinese prior to Obama leaving the White House? Astute story commenters were quick to point out that any plumbing problem can be fixed in much less time than 6 months, even in such large supercenters, and to have several of these 6-month closings all at once in states tied to Jade Helm 15 and martial law exercises (Florida, Texas, California and Oklahoma) reeks of something much deeper than plumbing issues. The fact that China has DEMANDED Americans be disarmed and the scheduled reopening dates (if they EVER reopen at all!) of these stores will be after Jade Helm 15 is completed are raising many questions about what is really going on among those who are paying attention to events in Barack Obamas new America as seen in more detail below. One reader tells us that one of these Wal-Mart stores had just recently been remodeled and didnt have any plumbing problems while the note below is from a source who recently called her local Wal-Mart and discovered they may NEVER reopen!

                From my heart I tell you I wish I did not believe this to be true, but to do so would make me a liar. At 72 years of age this may be the most disturbing domestic civil situation I will have ever been forced to confront. I shall not rant and rave about what should be done because I do not have the answer. You may say to me if you do not know what to do, get out of the way because you are part of the problem and I will understand. Anyone with a common sense solution is more than welcome and I may listen, but far be it from me to advise anyone to haphazardly to take up arms in protest of this. Do I believe it could come to that? The answer is yes my friend! However, I hope anyone entertaining such an idea will give it due consideration. For should it eventually come to that, I will be there also.

                  Take up arms??? For what? Are you going to fight our own boys in uniform? Look, someone is lying to you. So ask yourself: who would want Americans fighting Americans?
                  <br/>
                  Not patriots. Not people who love America. Real Americans do not threaten war on our own military. Not really Semper Fi to turn your gun against your own country, is it?

                    the answer to your question is so obvious, and has been since the federal government has been working so hard to create racial, ethnic, and any other kind of warfare they possibly can. It started before this administration, but has escalated and become much more blatant with this one. It is ruled by the one world global government, aka the new world order.
                    <br/>
                    Unless you are one of their higher up useful idiot puppets, tell me again how stupid I look when you find yourself detained in a FEMA camp for resettlement, which may not be continental or include any of your family members.

                    I have no idea where you were in early to mid 60s during the civil rights protects but, I do know where I was! I was training for riot control! We were told, should we be called into action, we would be issued live ammunition and we were NOT to fire a warning shot into air as you see in movies but to fire to KILL! Now such on that tit awhile AH!

                Biggest pile of HORSE HOCKEY EVER! this is pure tabloid junkI mean really! The US Military is going to stand by and allow an INVADING ARMY of Chinese to subdue the entire (133 MILLION) population of this country. That MASSIVE army has to fit into 4 Wal-Mart supercentersPLEASE! I guess the REPUBLICANS are in on this too right? I mean, this to be true the level of CO-OPERATION at the top levels of GOVERNMENT would have to be massive. NOT ONLY having AMERICAN Admirals and Generals as well as ten of thousands of US TROOPS in on the PLOY.. Sorry, I had to stop for a moment cause I fell to the floor LAUGHING! How many guns are in private hands? How much ammo? There are more weapons than people. Almost 250 million firearms in public hands. Now you tell me how ANY army is going to be able to subdue the American population? Let alone control the US Military who will be in open revolt because that is not what WE signed up forYOU PEOPLE ARE JUST SO STUPIDI dont know if I should openly mock you or pity your ignorance and hatred of our country and our military. If you HATE our military so much then lobby to have EVERY military installation removed. I know this, when it comes to Texas and future military spending, no one will be in too much of a hurry to award Texas anything. Hell, I YEAH! Move our military out of TEXAS and let them deal with the boarder and the drug warlords on their own! If you knew anything about the way our government works you would know how stupid this whole MADE UP story is. Who is telling it and what is their REAL agenda? It is either MONEY, POWER or BOTH! Get educated and learn something before you hurt yourself and stop attacking the Military! Look up this phraseOPFOR we have been using it for decades! JADEN HELM is a COMBAT READINESS EXERCISE with a STAGED theme as the state of warfare is ALWAYS in flux. You think people would want our military to be ready? NOT THESE IDIOTS! There has to be a conspiracy cause that is what they heard! Well.SO AND SO said it, so it must be true! MORONS!

                  I dare you to find any US soldier who would go along with the massive conspiracy you are imagining. There is no way this is anything more than what our military needs: Training in desert areas and fighting terrorists in the middle east. Do you really want the billions that the Army spends in Texas every year to go somewhere else? You idiots would cut off your nose to spite your face?
                  <br/>
                  Wake up, someone has hypnotized you, and you dont even know it.
                  <br/>
                  Believe the gossip but disbelieve your government, and the US military? Buddy you have been lied to and now you look stupid.
                  <br/>
                  Look at this article. You know how you can tell its a package of lies? No authorship, no research, no verifiable quotes from actual leaders its a smear campaign and you are a sheep because you let someone (you dont even know who!) pull the wool over your eyes.

                      What a load of crap. No wonder the right wing keeps a stranglehold over Congress. The training in Flint is over, the trainees left (hopefully well-trained for their military duties) and no one was kidnapped, not even the wackiest tin-foil hat in the whole state.
                      <br/>
                      So now, after the fact, knowing it was all twaddle, do you still think the military is out to capture the citizens of Flint Michigan?

                    Seems like I struck a nerve by calling attention to your lack of the brilliance to dazzle but an overload of BS for trying to baffle everyone. Failed again, tankrose. You are still what you are, which makes me seriously doubt that you ever served any time in our military. If you had you would be more than POd by what this administration is doing to our veterans  older ones and recent returnees. I admit never serving the military, but had 6 siblings, numerous uncles, cousins who did, and some of them did not come back and some of those who did come back lives were never the same as they were before seeing combat. This does not give me the right to mock anyone and mocking anyone is not one of my favorite things to do, as it seems to be yours, but I do believe in sharing what is likely to be the truth and it is not to be found in the Enquirer or other sleazy sheets you might read or in the mainstream media which has become nothing more than a propaganda outlet for the one world global government, aka the new world order.
                    <br/>
                    Since you seem to be wasting time on the Enquirer, perhaps you should spend more time on things like the FBIs latest pamphlet on what to watch for in terrorists, like all our older veterans and our currently returning troops. You might even become aware of this administrations move to prevent all veterans from owning guns, as well as their obvious efforts to disarm all American citizens. While on this subject, reading Lotts book on More Guns: Less Crime which is another source of truth might help you if you are really interested in truth.
                    <br/>
                    Truth is something I have found to be seldom told by the politicians, especially those in Washington, DC.
                    <br/>
                    I find it very disgusting that this administration has plenty of money to import illegal aliens and render all kinds of service from medical to welfare, at taxpayers expense, yet our veterans are being given Sorry but we are not accepting any new patients when they apply for help from the VA Hospitals or VA Clinics. Another thing I find distressing is those like you who claim to have served in the military, and see nothing wrong with what is being done by this administration
                    <br/>
                    It makes me proud when I do read a blog from a true veteran who states that he swore to support and protect our Constitution from both foreign and domestic threats and would never fight against American citizens and most of them are not happy that our politicians are not living up to that same oath that they took.
                    <br/>
                    tankrose, are you happy with the job your politicians are and have been doing.
                    <br/>
                    If you are  may I ask what countrys military did you serve in???
                    <br/>
                    Were you one of those foreign or UN troops on American soil?

                      Wonderiing women, NO you didnt strike a nerve. However, I find it so interesting that you and your conspiracy theroiest really think that the Obama administration has their SHICK together too the point where they can use the military to envade your tiny little town and take your guns. I have read so many variation of this PLOT that it get goofier and goofier every day. The Chinese are using wal-marts to house troops that will take over Texas, the Military is going to seize the most LOYAL TEXANS and send them to internment camps ohand lets not forget my personal fav! That the military is going to wage war on ISIS in TEXAS! Oh..GEEZ! That is my favorite. ISIS cant even hold onto it own territory and is running out of ammo and troops. So they are going to call a TIME OUT and meet our troops in your town? OH and lets not forget the LIBERAL AGENDA! To take your guns!

                      3 thousandnow..over 8 THOUSAND! So, the president allows the gun industry unfretted access, more than at any time in our history and now he wants those guns back? WHAT?!? You say I never served..really? So I am a liar? Tell me what is 81172? here let me give you the more current one 3PO72. ALSO find out what is this military designation. A.A.R.G.WELL!!! YOUR SO SMART TELL US!! As for your FBI reports..Ive read them off and on for almost 25 years. So you are cherry picking some data and misrepresenting others. GIVE US the FBI report number or its file designation so we can read the ACTUAL document. Oh, you dont have that information do you? Oh..Someone TOLD you about it! You wont heed reason so let me quote your own TEXANS. Lets start with the TEXAS RANGER you guys keep talking about. By the way..HE WAS ONCE A 811X0look it up! Chuck had this to say,

                      The U.S. government says, Its just a training exercise. But Im not sure the term just has any reference to reality when the government uses it, Norris wrote in his column. Whatever Jade Helm 15 actually is, I think it is more than coincidental that the FBI director just confessed in February that the presence of ISIS can be felt in all 50 states of the U.S. and that the Pentagon is suddenly running its biggest military training exercise with every branch of the military across seven Southwestern states.

                      Former GOV. PERRY says, Its OK to question your government. I do it on a regular basis. But the military is something else, Perry, a potential 2016 contender, told the Dallas Morning News on Tuesday.
                      <br/>
                      Our military is quite trustworthy. The civilian leadership, you can always question that, but not the men and women in uniform, he added.
                      <br/>
                      One thing is for sure wondering women, You label everyone who doesnt buy into your envastion fantasy as a liberal or unpatriotic and that is PATHETIC! You can take it out on me or others who have half a brain, but DONT YOU DARE TAKE IT OUT ON MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS in the military. THEY DONT DESERVE IT! That is what you WAKKOS dont understand. YOU are saying that our military would WILLINGLY do this! NOT POSSIALBE and the MILIARY had NEVER made JADE HELM a secret!

                        <br/>
                        I am disgusted with the way our military troops are currently being treated as well as veterans who are no longer in the military. Nothing is more disgusting than the hypocrite politicians sitting safely far from any danger with armed guards protecting them, talking of cutting the pay and the pensions of our troops  yet they frequently vote themselves a cost of living raise, while others get none.. Dont forget Obamas proposal that our troops use their personal insurance before seeking help from the government, even for combat injury. Yet you have the audacity to try and twist what I said and seem to praise what this man has done and is doing to them ever since he usurped the White House.

                        Since you seem to prefer numbers, try looking up AGENDA 21, Department of State Publications 7277, and FM3-39.40, That last one should keep you occupied for an hour or two. Oh yes, do look up REX84 which was exercises authorized by Ronald Reagan in 1984 to test FEMAs ability to contain and control American citizens in the FEMA camps.
                        <br/>
                        Dont know where you got those statistics on gun manufacturers, but its veracity is doubtful.

                        Well, first of all I have no idea where you are coming from. My first post was all about this IDEA that our military is going to invade TEXAS.. I mean how stupid can that be? How many Military Bases are there in TEXAS? How can a MILITARY invade itself? I was stationed at one and enjoyed my time there. I would say which but you called me a LIAR. So you have to figure it out, I gave you the clues. As for the weapon numbers..you read FBI reports, then you should know that 47% of applicants for a firearm are denied because they are felons. As for the number of Weapons Manufactures, have you been in a Gun store lately? How many NAMES on weapons would you know from just 5 years ago. From where I sit, Obama has been a HUGE BOOM to the industry. Every time they yell BOO, people run and wipe out supplies. Now I can get ammo without a 2nd mortgage. Next is all this other stuff about Agenda 21 is a G,W. Bush thing and Agenda 21 is a legally non-binding statement of intent and not a treaty, the United States Senate was not required to hold a formal debate or vote on it. It is therefore not considered to be law under Article Six of the United States Constitution. President George H. W. Bush was one of the 178 heads of government who signed the final text of the agreement at the Earth Summit in 1992, As for all that other stuff your rambling on aboutI still have no idea what that has to do with JADE HELM..You are injecting other issues that has NOTHING TO DO with what I was commenting on. SO, did you look up those numbers?you are the one who called me a liar..so prove it. I am NOT a REPUBLICAN nor am I a DEMOCRAT, but because I challenge this notion of a Military takeover I am somehow an OBAMA supporter,, if it makes you feel better. See, you look at America as RED and BLUEI see just AMERICANS. Do you think We care what your political affiliation is when the bullets fly? NO! and that is where YOU have LOST perspective because you fail to do the most basic of research and understand ONE THING..EVERYONE has an AGENDA! HOWEVER! when it comes to the President, I have defended and protected both, H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. My job has NO BEARING on what the public thinks of them..my job is to do my job. I really dont care about all the politics you seem to care about. What I do know is that no matter who is in that chair, he is and was my commander in chief and we cant afford to have a military that acts like you do. We follow LAWFUL orders handed down. JADEN HELM is an EXERCISE and I now understand why you people have been making such a ruckus. To draw attention to all this other STUFF your going on about. Look, he is going to be out of office soon, so buckle up there butter cup. You can go after the government and politics all you wantbut stay off the militarys back. That is what you have done, dragged our service members into the mud to bring attention to your complaints..REALLY! Chinese taking over Wal-Marts and then subduing Americans with our troops help? COME ON! HAVE YOU READ ALL OF THE CRACK POT THEORIES? If you cant admit that most of that stuff is non-sense then I think we all know where youre really coming from. One of your JADE HELM conspiracy pals was asking question of Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria, who stood there for 3 hours and answered DUMB ASS questions. He keep repeating this EXERCISE has no element of invationso tell me what was the RESPONSE..Says You! Yeah, says an ARMY Lt. Col. so let me guess he is a plant or has had his mind altered? Not to worry, the BRAC list will start again and there is ALREADY talk of moving 3 MAJOR military installations out of TEXAS and into a more AMERICAN LOVING state. One thing is FOR SURE, there will be NO future military exercises in TEXAS..Nevada will get that money! So, well just leave you and your state militia to your conspiracy theories! Last question, Who released that map? THE MILITARY! DUH! Now why would the MILITARY release a map of an ACTUAL invasion to the people being invaded? You People watch WAY TOO MUCH TV!

                        tankrose, me thinks that you need to turn off that TV, and stay away from other mainstream media which has become nothing more than the one world global government, aka the new world order.
                        <br/>
                        If you are as nave as you sound, you have had your head stuck in the sand too long, and you probably will not have time to really figure out what is really going on all over the planet. It isnt just here in America.
                        <br/>
                        I will give you one more idea that might get you off the TV and your head out of the sand. Dont have that much time to take someone by the hand and lead them through what you should be able to navigate yourself.

                        Just like all conspiracy theorist you dance around without answering the question. That question was, do you honestly think that our military would invade a bodunk town in Texas and do what? Take away your guns., even though there are more guns in private hands than ever. The NRA reports an annual increase of 46% in gun sales compounded from the previous year. 1.5 billion fire arms , that is enough evidence weapons so that every one of our 133 Million citizens to own 2.4 guns each. I got that right offf the NRAs own website. So your saying that without request from the state of Texas and without constitutional powers, our President will invade some jerk water town in no where Texas? That is what you saying? This agenda 21 is more crap. Non binding and not a legal document, I quests you missed that part. Just because you read on the Internet or watch it on you tube doesnt make it credible. Hell, the Republican Party would love it if it were true and so would I. Cause frankly our government cant do the simplest things without fracking it up. It would be nice to have a government that could pull something like that off. However just like all conspracy theories it takes little to no proof and only the gullibility of an undereducated people to buy into this non-sense. So, let put our money where our mouth is. If your right and Im wrong then Ill have a shirt made that says, WONDERING WOMEN WAS RIGHT If Im right and nothing happens other then a military exercise then you must wear a shit that proclaims you are with Hilary Clinton. So we would both agree to place and image of the loser on Facebook and Twitter. Time to put up or shut up. You either believe an invasion of America by American WILL happen or notthe rest is all noise.

                You mean people are stupid enough to believe this crap? Come on, people, I know you are smarter than this! It is so anti-American to spread these ignorant rumors. Do you really hope that people will panic and attack our soldiers?

                If sane, you belong in jail for espousing harm to our troops. Otherwise you should be in a mental hospital so your disease can be diagnosed.
