          When operating a small and independent business venture, it is all too easy to become complacent and neglect your legal requirements as the owner. This reflects the transition that takes place when you switch from being an employee to someone who is in control of their own destiny. Although it is a largely positive experience, it brings with it a great deal of responsibility and accountability, and the failure to recognize this can result in disastrous consequences for your small business. With this in mind it is crucial that you employ the services of a reputable law firm, in order to establish your business correctly and in line with existing government legislation.

            While the fundamental principles of business may remain the same across multiple industries, each individual sector has its own regulatory procedure and specific points of order. With this in mind, your first step should be to identify reputable firms that have experience within a chosen industry, as this will expose you to relevant and trustworthy legal advice. They will also understand the jargon that defines your businesses particular market niche, and will therefore be able to offer a clear representation of what is required from your firm.

        As the worlds of commerce and small business have evolved, so too they have encountered a range of new and diverse threats. While the small business owners of the past were preoccupied with locking their places of businesses and ensuring that their merchandise was kept in a secure location, now they have to consider additional measures to protect the integrity of their commercial interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the advent of technology has been largely positive for small businesses, however, it is also responsible for the increasingly sophisticated threat posed to intellectual property. Although as an owner you can patent your innovative concepts, blue prints and auto-CAD designs, for example, this means little unless you are able to store the associated digital files in a secure online location.

        I am old fashioned and dont even own a fax machine (I JUST got a Facebook page up for goodness sake) But my other half, the techie, bought this gadget and made me learn how to use it (after meeting a lady at a nearby bakery who had one, he fell in lovewith the POS, not the lady!) I LOVE to blog and think I was meant to be a writer (despite being a happy small business owner) so heres the low down

        The new POS (point of sale system) can replace almost any other system most small business use, be it a manual cash register and hand written receipts or an expensive POS like Aloha.

        offers a variety of POS (or point of sale) options for small to medium sized retailers.Here are 5 reasons to use the POS to help your business run smoother and more productively.

          Its Cheap.

         Far less expensive than most business owners realize, a POS system basicallypays for itself in the long run by increasing sales and eliminating the need for paper and ink.

        <li>
         <strong>
          Forget about paper.
         </strong>
         Imagine helping the environment and saving money at the same time! Most credit card machines print out 2 copies of the receipt, one for you and one for the customer. Most times the customer throws out the receipt or says they dont want it. With the POS system you dont have to print a copy even if

          With m-commerce now starting to dominate in terms of how consumers source, review and purchase products, owning and operating an online fashion store front is emerging as significant business. As this business grows, however, you faced with a difficult time management challenge in terms of how to maximize your efforts and realize the full potential of your store. So how should you go about managing your time as an online entrepreneur when working from home, and ensuring that you are as productive as possible?

          Regardless of the nature of your business, there are likely to be several tasks that are crucial to organizing it on a daily basis. In terms of online fashion e-commerce, these are likely to include shipping, liaising with customers and stock management, it is important to create a regimented schedule that dictates when and how you undertaken these tasks. While some degree of flexibility is always necessary, creating a prioritized schedule of work eliminates procrastination and disorganization from your business.

        As long as there have been consumers (forever), sellers have been trying to influence their behavior. In the twentieth century advertising firms made influencing consumer behavior an art form and developed an array of psychological theories to explain it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fast forward to the twenty first century and the playing field has changed completely again. Thanks to modern information technology consumers approach their purchases in an entirely new way.
       </p>
       <p>
        When modern consumers want information on a product they dont go to the producer, they go to each other. Online forums have become the site of intense debate over the relative benefits and flaws of different products. Consumers trust each other because they know they have nothing to gain from the exchange but relevant information.
       </p>
       <p>
        So where are these conversations taking place? Well one interesting development of the twenty first century has been the emergence of Social Media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc. Increasingly marketers are going to these places and influencing consumer behavior directly.
