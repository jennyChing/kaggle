    Alas,
    <b>
     Ned Gerhart Publications
    </b>
    is no longer in business.
   </p>
   <p>
    Self-publishing my collection of piano music has not been a 
success. Now I am searching for a real print-music
publisher for my music book. Who knows, that could happen!
   </p>
   <p>
    Send me an
    <a href="mailto:ned@nedgerhart.com">
     email
    </a>
    if somehow 
you have an interest in my piano music collection,
    <i>
     Studies in Song
    </i>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    You can download the
    <a href="StudiesInSong_NedGerhart.pdf">
     first few pages
    </a>
    to 
print and review at your piano. 
I hope you enjoy it.
