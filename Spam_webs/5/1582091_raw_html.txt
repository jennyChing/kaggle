           <em>
            How do I cat urine from a leather couch? My cat urinated on some clothes that I had sitting on my leather couch. The urine soaked through to the couch, and it smells really bad. Ive tried all sorts of cleaning products, but yet the smell remains. Im about to have to throw the couch out. Its only three years old and was a gift from my hubby, so I really dont want to do that.

          Cat urine contains proteins that create the odor and are difficult to remove. There are products available that will remove these proteins and the odor that lingers.

          This home remedy does not remove stains, only odor. Always test a small, hidden area of the leather first as hydrogen peroxide can have bleaching effects and may discolor some leathers.

          Steps to Remove the Odor:

          <li>
           Mix together one quart hydrogen peroxide,  cup baking soda and 1 tablespoon liquid soap in a non-metal container. Do not stir or shake vigorously when mixing. Hydrogen peroxide and baking sodacreate a large amount of oxygen and over mixing will cause the mixture to overflow out of the container.
          </li>
          <li>
           Place the mixture into a spray bottle and gently mist the affected surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
           Blot the areas if needed to remove the moisture.
          </li>

           Allow the area to dry completely.

         <ul>
          <li>
           The proteins in cat urine are similar to those in skunk spray. Cleaning products used to remove the skunk smell can also be used to remove cat urine odors.
          </li>
          <li>
           Cat urine odor must be neutralized with either a commercial product or chemicals that will break up the proteins. Normal washing will remove the stains, but not the odors.

            In your directions for the homemade remedy to get rid of cat smell on a leather sofa, the list of ingredients does not include vinegar, yet the directions say not to mix it too vigorously due to the reaction of the peroxide and vinegar. Is there indeed meant to be vinegar in the mix or is that a typo? If there is meant to be vinegar, how much? Id like to try this, but am uncertain as to what to mix.

            Our cat is 11 years old, and in the last year she has decided that going poop outside her litter box was the way it was going to be. She has pooped on my leather furniture, and I am unable to get the smell out (I need help). This morning she pooped on my rug by the front door and her litter box was completely clean.  I am desperate and need help with our cat, I am on the last straw and I am thinking of getting rid of her, but she is my daughters cat and my daughter loves her.  Please, please help!

            When you get old and have potty problems  which you will  should your family consider getting rid of you?  I think teaching your daughter that when something or someone becomes inconvenient, to do away with them is an excellent life lesson.

            My cat started going on our furniture because of a health problem. It turned out he had diabetes and his ability to hold and go was lost. The vet saw that inside the mouth or ears was a yellowish color that indicated the liver had stopped functioning properly. Hence, go where they lay.

            What Shelia said rather ticked me off. I love my pets like family but I would get rid of one that continued to spray my home or ruin my house. I would try my best to resolve the problem, but if it couldnt be resolved, I would definitely get them out of my house. Love them or not, the urine and feces does cause health problems in humans as I happen to know first hand. I was lucky and able to fix my past pets problem. To make a comment about a persons parenting skills because they would get rid of a pet before leaving in a home that reeks of animal waste or having their home and furniture ruined is just lousy. Maybe you dont mind living in a house that smells like an old liter box, but some of us do. Thats just nasty. When we age and have bathroom problems as adults, it doesnt ruin our furniture or leave permanent odors or damage. What an ignorant, rude jerk you are.

            I followed a very similar recipe that I found on another site to clean the urine out of my pillowtop mattress. It smelled perfect afterward.  First, I applied the vinegar/water mixture, let it soak in, then dry it out. Next, I used baking soda, then hydrogen peroxide mixed with dishwasher soap (the recipe called for powered but I used liquid just fine) mixed slightly; I soaked it, blotted, and then let it dry. Now, the stain is gone and it smells like fresh scent. I didnt even need to use citrus to mask it.

            Natures Miracle doesnt work for beans! I used almost a whole bottle and it did nothing. The baking soda and peroxide mix didnt work either. Im going to try the vinegar mix too; if that doesnt work, then Im afraid that my lovely leather chair is ruined.

            One of my cats urinated on my leather sofa in two places. I followed this websites cleaning instructions and the smell is now completely gone.  It is crucial to the cleaning process to follow Natures Miracles cleaning instructions. I sprayed the leather cover and after 24 hours, there still remained a slight urine odor. So, I repeated the process.  This time, after 24 hours, the odor was completely gone.  The drying time is important to the process. For me, Natures Miracle really worked and saved my leather sofa from being trashed!

            cleaned to remove the smell. Now that it is out of the house, I realize I still have work to do. My kitty did have a urinary tract infection and is better now. Unfortunately, this has been quite an ordeal and a source of terrible stress between my husband and I.  As much as I love my kitties, I doubt Ill ever replace these pets when they are gone.

            Bravo Sheila, for saying what any animal lover was thinking! Completely agree with you, and NO, I am not an animal hoarder.
            <br/>
            To Als comment, if something (such as an elderly parent or sick child) is interfering with your livelihood, you would get rid of your parent or child??? My cats are my children, and I am currently dealing with my eldest at 22 years old (thats 104 human years old) urinating on our leather couches at the present time (amongst other feline dementia issues). In searching for a good recipe or product online to remove the urine odor, I have to come across horrid peoples comments like these above about simply casting their cat off to the side because of the inconvenience. Hello, we are online searching for ways to fully clean and remove our cats urine odor, hence we are not living in urine or feces; obviously we have cleaned up the messes thoroughly and are just looking for a good way to completely remove the odor  I do not think the slight stench will kill you until you can find something to remove it! The thought of getting rid of my 22-year-old cat, or any age for that matter, has never and would never cross my mind! Shame on people like you, dogging Sheilas comment  you should be coming down on Deb! You all are the people I have to read about that dump their poor, helpless, innocent animals off to over-crowded shelters because they dont like the way their animal looked at them, or some other stupid excuse for ruining that poor animals life. I do suppose if you are not fit, apparently, to handle taking care of a pet, including seeking veterinary care when needed and providing plenty of love and attention, then you dont deserve that pet and it probably would be better off without YOU. But then again, you probably do not deserve to be a parent to a human either. And if Trish loves her pets like family, Id hate to be part of her family! Do something wrong and poof, shell get rid of you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right on, Sheila, right on.  =^.^=

            Sheila, I have 6 cats and even I can say that getting rid of a cat for this is nowhere near the same thing as getting rid of an older person. What you said was rude, negative, unhelpful, and makes you sound just plain stupid. I cannot stand more than anything when a stupid person tries to sound intelligent. Hilarious. What an intelligent person would do by the way, is give a solution to the question that was asked. Not give a personal opinion on a subject that isnt being discussed at all. I am an animal lover with 6 cats and 3 dogs (all rescues) and I can confidently say that if one of my cats had an issue that couldnt be resolved and was affecting my hard-earned lifestyle negatively, I would not let it shit all over my couch because that would be the same thing as my own mother needing to wear a diaper. I feel sorry for you and anyone that has to endure youre immature thinking in their daily life. Have a great night!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone else, thanks for the advice!

            Heather, first calm down. If Trish didnt care, she wouldnt have posted asking for help. Consider her frustration at this point. Maybe everyone isnt like you and super patient when their animal is pooing and peeing on everything. Maybe Trish has a different perspective because she IS NOT YOU. You, as well, sound like an opinionated bitch that has no solution to offer. And consider for two seconds that no one wants to here your story about your 22-year-old kid that is a cat. HANDICAPPED AND ELDERLY PEOPLE DONT SHIT AND PEE ALL OVER THE PLACE. PEOPLE ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANIMALS. And if you think so, then no one needs your opinion because its an opinion coming from an irrational person.

            ^^Jlyn- Thank you, we are on here looking for HELP, not to read all this drama back and forth, trashing others! No one cares about your own personal (and some ignorant) opinions, just reaching out for solutions to a problem. If we werent on here doing so, it would mean we threw our pets out!! But we are looking and asking for help, so maybe you people who seem to like to trash and judge should just scroll on and not comment.
            <br/>
            Now, I have a female cat around 1 1/2 years, spayed (and very spoiled), but every so often she pees on somethinga towel one of my kids left on the bathroom floor, my leather loveseat (the most recent), a blanket, etc Now, it was a problem when she would go into heat and we got her fixed a few months back and she is doing it again. On top of trying to get the smell out of my couch, any ideas of why she is still doing this? ONLY HELPFUL COMMENTS PLEASE  no negative junk!

            Thanks for all your tips everyone. I have new leather theater recliners that I recently splurged on and my old rescue cat accidentally got shut in the room overnight. She urinated on the blanket that was on the cushion and it leaked through. I will give these suggestions a try. Thanks from Colorado.

            Is there anything common that happens around the times the cat does that? Something either physcially or environmentally is causing the cat to do that. For us, it was adding a puppy to the household who loved chasing the cats and playing. We had to learn how to make sure the cats had places to escape, along with teaching the dog not to play so rough and our problem stopped. Watch My Cat From Hell on Animal Planet. He deals with these type situations all the time and we learned a lot from it. So, look for ways the cat may be stressed or upset around these times it happens. Also check with the vet to see if it may be a physcial issue like something causing urinary tract issues. There is a reason for it and can be stopped.

            When I relocated due to illness, had to drive my roadster from the East Coast back to the Midwest (my nephew did the driving). The car only has two seats, and Max, my 17-year-old cat, was either on my lap or on the floor with his blanket along with my purse LONG story short, Max somehow peed in my purse (a $300.00 designer bag)! Granted, its a pretty big purse, but Im still wondering how he managed to pee with me right there the entire time! We made frequent stops throughout our trip &amp; had several disposable litter boxes, which I begged, coaxed and even left him alone for privacy (tied his leash to a bench away from everything) &amp; put his clean litter box close by (his bottled water &amp; fresh food was in a different area). The ONLY time he used any of those boxes were when we were in a hotel! I did an online search &amp; went through several steps and all the odor was gone!
            <br/>
            It had worked!!! I remember using activated charcoal,

            &amp; a solution from the pet store which is used to remove pet odors, a large plastic bag and a box with lid. I wish I didnt have MS or I may have remembered the process, which lasted over two weeks. BUT, my point in writing this is to let you know that it IS possible to get rid of that horrible smell. Today, my handbag looks great &amp; believe it or not, it smells like brand new leather!!! SOOO, get a mug of coffee, put on some music &amp; get to Google! Good luck

            As a former Marine and K9 handler. I APPLAUD &amp; ECHO both Sheilla and Heathers comment! I am a diabetic myself (along with additional health issues),  and I sometimes do without the things I need to simply ensure that my four-pawed loved ones are properly cared for. Animals are dependent on us. They cant go to the fridge or pantry to feed themselves, or the faucet to get a drink when thirsty, or open the door to go outside to relieve themselves or get fresh air, etc. and what they WONT DO that HUMANS WILL, is turncoat, cast you aside or one day determine you to be an inconvenience to them!!!!! They will remain by your side do or die! So to sum it up! To all the people who find an animal to be an inconvenience due to age or an odor issue  perhaps that lingering odor is not from your animal, but your selfish decaying heart! And no product in the world can eliminate that smell!!!!!      SEMPER FI

            I was told to check this out by mother-in-law, since our cat peed on my leather jacket. Vinegar works miracles on clothes for pet odors, as well as b.o., but I wasnt sure if it was safe for leather. My daughter, when potty training, pooped smack dab in the middle of an area rug, which I told my ex not to put out till both kids were potty trained. I laughed. Things are just things. Whats more important here? Stuff that can always be replaced, or living, breathing. companions? I would no sooner get rid of the cat than my child. Our cat, however, will be neutered because that is something I can do to remedy the situation.

            Wow! People! I found this site because my lovely cat just peed on my leather tote bagI was so mad at herand then I realized that while I was on the phone with the bedroom door shut (not usual) because I was on an important private callshe was meowing to get out and I ignored hersoshe peed on my bag.
            <br/>
            There is always a reason why they do these things, not just to inconvenience us. She cant hold it like she used to so that is another reason, not spite. I will try this Natures Miracle; thank you all for your input. I have to add that what some of you said about getting rid of animals that are too much work or interfering with your livelihood made me sad. I would hope at least you would take the time to find a loving home if you could not provide one. Be in peace everyonewe all need to step it up and be kind to all living things or this planet will shake us all off.

            My cat just peed on my new leather couch for no reason. She had been doing this at my old house on different things. I moved and bought everything new and shes had no accidents for two months. Now, she was asleep on one couch, walked over onto the other and peed in front of us! Ive bought carpets and a new mattress and am worried!! She is old.

            Our 11-year-old female cat peed on our leather couch. It soaked into the grain of the leather and the cushion from underneath. She did it while we were asleep, so it had time to really set. I must have washed the sponge out a dozen times and tried every thing I could think of to totally rid us of the odor, but with no avail. I even totally submerged the leather coverings in Natures Miracle for hours, but still we could smell it. Lysol, vinegar, baking sodaanything I could find, I tried. No luck. Then, we had the idea to rub essential oils on the still afflicted areasinstant solution. After rubbing a liberal coating of this stuff on the leather grain just one time, voilaperfect. Four days now since we tried this and the odor has not returned. I can only figure that the oil soaked into the grain too and overcame what was left of the urine. I was seriously ready to give up on this couch until we tried this. Just wanted to share this experience with those others who are at their wits end as to what to do over cat urine odor from their couch. I suspect that this technique might also work on certain jackets and purses too. I would say the grain of the leather item in question and its permeability to oil determines how successful essential oils might be to their situation.

            I dont know what to do. My two-year-old cat Smokey had a bladder infection and peed on our leather couch. Not much, just a little, as it was hard for her to go. We cleaned it up right away and there was no smell. To us anyways. Our seven-year-old cat, who is the dominant one in the house, has now been peeing all over the couch, and on the slipcover to our recliner. Which Smokey also peed on a little during her infection. I dont know what to do. I love both of my cats, but if we cant get that urine smell completely out of the couch so that Lucky cant even smell it, then we either need to find a good, loving home for her or we need to get new furniture and hope to heck that it really was just her trying to cover up Smokeys scent. The thing is, when we got Smokey, Lucky got mad and peed on our bed a few times. We got a second litter box and the problem went away then. The cats seemed to be tolerating each other, but shortly before Smokeys bladder infection, Lucky has started being really mean to Smokey. Hissing at her, attacking her, growling at her. The vet seemed to think stress caused Smokeys bladder infection. If that is the case, the two cant get along and one or both need to find homes alone. I cant imagine only getting rid of one, I wouldnt be able to choose. But, I cant keep Lucky with a urine soaked couch. My daughter loves both cats. I cant decide based on her though. And as much as I love my cats, if they could be happier in someone elses home away from each other or other animals, that might be the best solution. Lucky is so sweet with kids and wont bite or scratch as she is not declawed. Smokey will bite when seriously provoked, but also wont scratch as she is also not declawed. Both are fixed. Maybe Im not really looking for advice, just a way to vent. I want my normal not-peeing-on-anything not-fighting cats back and a couch that doesnt have to be cleaned several times a day and doesnt smell like cat piss. I want everything.

            If you have a window in the affected room that you can open and put a fan in, do so. It sucks a lot, if not all, of the cat urine smell out. I have a leather chair I soaked in vingar. So far, he has not urinated on the chair again.

            I have found Natures Miracle to be a terrible product! It has not removed the odour of cat urine or feces on my duvet or my leather couch. The cat piss dripped down onto the fabric under the leather cushion and the odour is very strong. Will this vinegar solution remove the odour there as well? I am looking forward to trying this out.
            <br/>
            Good on you Sheila!!! Some people just dont deserve to have these amazing little creatures in their lives

            My cat has started peeing on my leather couch. At the moment, Im not sure what is causing it. Physically, he seems quite well and most of the time is using the litter box.
           </p>
           <p>
            He did get really stressed out around the holidays  some shuffling of things in the closet and wrapping presents was, I think, reminiscent of a recent move to a new apartment and freaked him out. It didnt help that the first time he urinated on the couch, I got angry and yelled at him. Whenever I round a corner in the apartment now, he hisses at me. Its terrible and really sad that I yelled at him at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, this method doesnt seem to have worked. The smell is gone to my sense of smell, but I am pretty sure my cat still smells it, which begets more accidents. I have followed this method 5 times now (cleaning up 3 accidents), but whenever my cat gets near the couch, he starts smelling around. The scent cannot be gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I truly hope there is some advice someone can share. Totally agree with the comments on here that you dont just get rid of a cat because they become inconvenient. They are family. It is really, really stressful though.

            Deary me there are a lot of cat lovers who arent really cat lovers on here  I was a bit shocked. Getting rid of an old or sick or upset animal cos it pees? Wow What does it matter; its only an animal after all, eh? Thanks for the essential oils info, Shane  I was thinking of trying that, but wondered if theyd end up removing the colour on the leather too. Ill add some to the

            . Tried bicarb, biological washing powder, and even sprinkled some carpet smellies down the crease where the rescued stray has peed  all nice and cleaned up, but still whiffy. Have a few essential oils in the house, might go for something like pine and lemongrass or grapefruit and rosemary. Mmmmm. Thanks again.

            SHANE- I have an impeccable yet somewhat disturbingly strong sense of smell. I am a daily user of essential oils so Im curious if you have any suggestions of which scents might work best.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does ANYONE know how much vinegar to use? Ive scanned through all the comments made and it seems that vinegar does a decent job at destroying the odor-causing enzymes.

            Years ago, when I had an elderly cat who had accidents, I used a product based on orange oils that worked really well to clean the spots and counter the smell. I have not been able to find it lately and cannot remember the brand, but would recommend to seek a natural cleaner based on orange oil.

            Please stick to cat pee comments; no one cares about your opinions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems like a lot of these cats are stressed out; we had to put some of those plug-ins (I think its called Feliway) in when our dog/cat got into a whos in charge contest and the cat started peeing everywhere, including right in my lap. That was a shocker to say the least. You cant ever say they peed or pooped somewhere for no reason. You may not know what it is, but there is some reason; they usually go in their litter without fail or outside.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our cat now has ruined our leather sofa and Im still trying to find the right cleaner and figure out what is causing it. *sigh* Cats, love em and sigh.
