editions of Leica Manual published from the mid 30's to the early 80's. The 
Leica Manual is a

intended for scientific use on a microscope: the M1, MD, and MDa.

     The M3 of 1953 wasn't just a
new camera, it was an entire rethinking of what 35 mm cameras should be.
    </font>
    It signaled an entirely new level of excellence, not only for Leica, but for
the entire camera industry. The M3 was so far advanced for its time that
it took other camera companies about FOUR years to offer any real competition - -
the Nikon SP. It was kind of like introducing a sports car when
the competition was a four door sedan ! Sales took off like no other pro rangefinder,
before or since.

    This beautiful ugly camera works great, takes great pics, and
qualifies for beautiful because it was bought at the bargain price of $250. The M3
established the shape and layout of all the M's to follow, except for the renegade
M5. It's a good idea to wipe down the vulcanite body covering at least one a
year or so with some kind of preservative, to avoid the brittle chipped vulcanite seen on
this camera. Personally, I use Neatsfoot Oil or Lexol.

       Focus Indicator:
      </font>
      Some electronic
    manual focus SLRs in the 1980's made a big deal out of having a "focus
    indicator" in the viewfinder to tell you which way to turn the lens to get the
    correct focus. Guess what? The M3 (and all later RF M's) have had a focus
    indicator since 1954!

     M3 Lens Choices:
    </font>
    An interesting
strategy is to have the 3 lenses the M3 is framed for (50,90,135), and then skip to the
super wides, your choices of the 12, 15, 21, 24/25. Do you really need a
28 or 35 with your M3? Maybe, maybe not, depending upon what you shoot.

    You can improve it with the now

easier.  Even after the Quickload kit, they are much slower to load than the
M4 and later cameras. The M3 is slower to load than the M2 because you must
remove the film spool to reset the film counter, the M2 has a manually set film
counter. Another option is installing the easier M4 type loading, but the
conversion is not cheap.

    Some dedicated Leica nuts
are just sure their Leica will be better if it has another finder in it. Upgrading
the M2 finder to the .72 M6 finder is easy. I have also heard of some people
paying the extra dough to have a M4 finder in the M3. It can be done, but it's
a custom job and expensive. Likewise a M3 can be put in a M4 if you are
willing to pay the bill, but this makes little sense today with the .85 M6 being

     A lot of people, myself included,
consider the M4 to be the last classic standard production M.

     The M4

      finder brightlines for

     The M4 finder was basically a M2 finder, with the 135
paired with 35 frame. The M4 has ALWAYS BEEN one of the best and most popular
M's. Only 58,000 M4's were made, compared to 225,000 M3's and 83,000 M2's. This
helps keep the M4 prices up. While made primarily in chrome, both black paint and black
chrome versions were produced.  The M4 became the basis of the later M4-2,
M4-P, M6, M6 .85, and M6 TTL. The M4 finder can be changed to the later
28/35/50/75/90/135 finder system of the M6 as a standard Leica upgrade. Personally,
I prefer the M4 finder as it is, less cluttered. If you love your M4,
about the only change to it I would recommend is to add a hot shoe next time you give it a
CLA (clean, lubricate, adjust).

     Unfortunately later black M4's had the black chrome finish of the

  Black Enamel VS Black Chrome is a game collectors like to play. There is little

  differently. I prefer the brassing of the black enamel to the discoloration of
  the black chrome -- but it's in the eye of the beholder.  I believe

     1978-1980: The Plain Jane Camera that 
SAVED Leica

    <strong>
     <font color="#0000FF">
      The M4-2 deserves credit for
something not generally acknowledged: fame as the camera that saved Leica.
     </font>
     With poor M5 sales, the decision was made to stop making M's and concentrate on the
R series. With 2020 hindsight that decision would most likely have
killed Leica, as R sales were always less than anticipated.
 Luckily, Walter Kluck, the CEO of Leitz Canada managed 
to convince Leitz
Germany to produce a new lower cost to manufacture M4, called the M4-2.
     <font color="#0000FF">
      This was a critical event for the Leica M, and for 
the Leica camera company. Without his intervention, the M 
camera would have likely died with the shut down of the M5 production line.
     </font>
     Leitz management wrongly believed the future of the camera company 
was the Leica R system. HA HA HA. Unfortunately all Leica SLRs 
have always been outdated body designs from their day of introduction, albeit 
with great lenses, and very poor sales. The M line stayed in 
production to become Leica's best selling interchangeable lens camera.
     <font color="#0000FF">
      Even more fascinating is that the stuffy Leica 
management to this day don't officially acknowledge that the M4-2 is the camera 
that saved Leica -- talk about living in denial!

   <strong>
    The M4-2 was a simplified, cheapened M4, without the 
famous Leica script top plate engraving and the traditional vulcanite body 
covering.
    <font color="#0000FF">
     The M4-2 was the first of the Plain Jane 
Leicas.

    <strong>
     <font color="#0000FF">
      Real world, the 
M4-2 amounts to a cheapened M4 with a hot shoe and out of the box motor 
capability added.
     </font>
     With production moving to Midland Canada, 
many believe the M4-2 initially suffered teething problems and quality control 
compared to either its M ancestors or M descendents, yet many owners report they 
are quite happy with their M4-2.
    </strong>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <strong>
    <font color="#0000FF">
     The bad part of the M4-2 (and the standard
production M's that followed), is the noticeably lower quality of exterior finish compared
to the M's that went before it.
    </font>
    It's the story of the plain sister who could never
quite compare to her older beautiful sister. The wonderful Leitz engraved
script on M2/M3/M4 top plates was replaced by cheaper stampings. The vulcanite
was replaced by a cheaper plastic material which in my experience does not wear as well.
 The old chrome finish is replaced by what seems be a thinner finish with less
luster. The magnificent old black enamel was replaced by less expensive black chrome
(which looks very ugly when it wears). The great majority of M4-2's are black
chrome, they were unfortunately not produced in black paint. Chrome examples are rare and
expensive. There was also a gold M4-2 commemorating Oskar Barnack, the inventor of
the Leica camera.  The most desirable M4-2's were made in Wetzlar at the start of
M4-2 production, numbering only 100 or so. While a half frame M4-2 was 
planned, only a hand full were actually produced before the project was dropped. 
Fake half frame M4-2's probably outnumber the real ones about 1000 to one.

  <p align="left">
   <strong>
    <font color="#0000FF">
     Now to be fair about it, all camera
manufacturers offer cheaper products now compared to the 1960's. It's just that Leica has always been held to a
higher standard than the rest by virtue of its higher prices.
    </font>
    To
Leica's great credit, Leica found a way to adapt and survive -- something that the
great German made cameras by Zeiss, Voigtlander, and Rollei did not discover in those
changing times. Some claim that the interior of the cameras were
improved as they time went on to make more dependable cameras. Perhaps,
perhaps not. In thirty years, we might have some definitive answers, but not
now.

       Mr. Horst Braun,
Manager of Leica Repairs, has confirmed a modification of the M4-2 finder about half way
into production. As I understand it, a small condenser lens was removed from
the frameline masks which had the effect of increasing the brilliance of the finder image
and its frames. Unfortunately, it is not possible to retrofit this into later M's.

       Apparently this was
done to improve Leica's profit margin. Well, I guess it worked...Leica is
still around today. However, the downside is that the new improved rangefinder
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       has ghosts or flare which makes focusing difficult. I have
reports that sometimes one of the RF images are difficult to see. Others opine
the newer RF image is definitely not as bright as the earlier M3/M2/M4 finder -- though
frankly the brightness difference is hard for me to see.

       An easier to see
difference is that the new finder requires the photog's eye to be centered in the
viewfinder to easily see the RF image. Off center, the RF image can disappear.
 The older finder had more tolerance for the off-center photog.

       Guess what? 
This new finder made its way to the M4-P and continues today in the M6.  Personally
I very seldom encountered the ghosting problem, but enough people have emailed me
about it, so that I have no doubt it can be bothersome in
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       lighting
conditions.  Picky picky picky. I guess Leica didn't know the
trouble it would get itself in by establishing such a high standard in the 1950's and
60's. Apparently more modifications were made in the M6 to fit 
the LEDs in. The M with the worst reputation for patch flare out is 
the M6 .85 TTL. The M7 improved the problem somewhat with 
better finder coatings. The MP 2003 finally introduced a finder up to the 
old standards by adding another condenser to the finder design, a change which 
was also made to the M7. If you are a newbie and this is new info, 
you need to understand that we are splitting hairs here. Any Leica M 
finder in good working condition is a great picture taking machine.

    <font color="#0000FF">
     Starting with the M4-2, Leitz changed the
M camera design philosophy and internal construction.
    </font>
    Originally, the
M's were all designed to be adjusted to the Nth degree in order to attain the highest
standards.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    With the M4-2, Leitz started shifting to a "right or replace" construction
philosophy. Adjustments starting
    <br/>
    disappearing. The new way was to simply replace out of tolerance part with a new one which
was within tolerance.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The claim is this makes for a stronger, more reliable camera since adjustments can no
longer go out of
    <br/>
    whack. But of course, they neglect to mention the overwhelming consideration here is
lowering cost!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The "old construction" proponents like myself argue that individual
adjustments produce overall tighter tolerances and a better working camera.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Which is better? Each camp argues they are right. Perhaps in 30 years, we will be sure. 
Of course Leica "experts" with close factory connections were usually the ones 
arguing the loudest that the new cameras were not only as good, but better than 
 
the older designs using different construction criteria.
    <font color="#0000FF">
     Alas, their spurious arguments left a lot of egg on their 
face when the new Leica MP was introduced in 2003. After all, how could 
the new MP be an improvement, if the intervening mechanical standards starting 
with the M4-2, were not a bit lacking? The emperor has no clothes.

cams for complete focusing compatibility with the rest of the M system. The CLE
rangefinder is longer and with a brighter RF focusing spot than the CL. The CLE was
the 1st M mount camera with TTL flash as well as AE aperture priority.

    Eventually Leica closed the Midland Canada 
plant, selling Elcan (E Leitz Canada) to Hughes Aircraft (founded by Howard 
Hughes) in 1990. Hughes completed the sale of Elcan to Raytheon by 1999. 
Today Elcan still exists, see
    <a href="http://www.elcan.com" target="_top">

      Black or Chrome or Titanium?
     </font>
     Long term, a worn black chrome looks downright ugly, although black may be easier to shoot
without being noticed -- maybe. The chrome has a nice "retro" look about
it which I like more than the black. Overall, I personally prefer
the Titanium, which has the most rugged and scratch resistant finish.
Unfortunately the M6 Titanium was produced with a rather odd artificial ostrich body covering which does not go well with
the top plate -- at least in my opinion.  Titanium M6 classic production stopped with
the introduction of the M6 TTL. The Titanium M6 and its matching Titanium
lenses are rather low production, and sure to be future collectibles.
Yes, before you ask, the M6 classic finishes are limited to black chrome, silver
chrome, and titanium. My personal favorite is
the titanium M6. Too bad the M6 classic was not made in black paint.

oddly run off the camera's battery. This prevents the flash

     .58, .72, or .85 Finder?

   </font>
   <strong>
    <font color="#000000" size="3">
     Until 
Photokina 2004, standard production M7's had your choice of finder 
magnifications.  The .72
magnification finder has been the standard finder, and for many years the only
finder, since the introduction of the M4 in 1967. It is the standard
by which the other finders are judged. Listening to users, Leica introduce
the higher magnification .85 finder in 1998 for increased focusing accuracy with
fast lenses such as the 50/1.1 and 75/1.4. Sacrificed was the 28mm
frameline. Going in the other direction, the wide angle .58 finder was
introduced in 2000, sacrificing the 135 frameline. In practice the .85
finders proved to be more flare prone than their lower magnification
counterparts, while most 28 and 35 lovers just fell in love with the .58 finder
for its clarity and easy to see even with glasses 28 and 35 framelines.
Then choices got complicated in 2002 with the introduction of the 1.25x M
Eyepiece Magnifier which turns the .58 into a .72, the .72 into a .9, and the
.85 into a 1.06. Damn. If you are going with only one M
body, a good case can be made that you only need a .58 with a 1.25x Eyepiece
Magnifier, or a .72 with a 1.25x Eyepiece Magnifier.

     How
to tell which finder magnification is which?

    <font color="#000000" size="3">
     The finder magnification is etched in the bottom right front of the M6 TTL 
finder -- .58, .72, or .85.
The .58 finder has only been used in the M6TTL and M7, though a good repairman
could probably install it any M series camera. The .85 finder has only been used
in the very late M6 "classic," the M6 TTL, M7, and MP 2003. 
Again, a good repairman could probably install it in any M.

     March 1st 2003 at PMA in Las

    Imagine the 
classic M6 w/o TTL flash metering, the M6 Classic style shutter speed dial which 
turns in the opposite direction of the M6 TTL and M7, an old fashioned M3 style 
rewind knob which you can upgrade to the pleasures of a rewind lever for the 
small sum of only $175 with the new Leica M-Rewind Crank, all metal M3 style 
advance lever, real brass top and bottom plates with real engraved Leica

Initially it will be offered in a beautiful black paint finish for the .72 
finder, with silver chrome available with your choice of .58, .72, and .85 
finder magnifications. Serial numbers start with "MP." The 
black paint .72 will likely become the most popular new MP. Real

higher quality mechanical fit and finish. Until September 2004 at

     Why call it the MP?
    </font>
    Leica originally made the now rare classic Leica MP (M Professional) in 1956. I for one will call this camera the "MP 2003" to avoid confusion 
with the original MP. The new MP stands for "Mechanical Perfection" 
according to Leica.Sounds like some ad guy who didn't have a clue 
about Leica history had a bad day, to me.  Leica also re-introduced the bottom 
trigger operated Leicavit M (in either black paint or silver chrome) after 
an absence of only almost half a century. The new Leicavit M 
has a MAP (Minimum Advertised Price) of only $995 -- or twice that of the 
superbly reliable
    <a href="http://www.rapidwinder.com">
     Abrahamsson 
Rapidwinder
    </a>
    (which works in the same way). Contrary to hopes of the 
Rapidwinder fans, the new Leicavit M is a new Leica design not made by Tom 
Abrahamsson.
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <strong>
    Despite the higher cost of the MP over the M6 TTL,
    <font color="#0000FF">
     I believe it's remarkable Leica finally upgraded the fit 
and finish of the mechanical M camera to approximate M4 levels.
    </font>
    The better finish, brass top and bottom plates, black paint finish, "classically 
correct" turning shutter speed dial, and engraved Leica script are simply 
wonderful in the context of the Leica finally returning to the high finished 
camera standard Leica cameras of old. As a shooter, Leica really 
blew it with the slow old fashioned M3 style rewind knob, even if the problem is 
partially cured with the
    <a href="LRWlev.htm" target="_self">
     badly designed $175 rewind crank accessory
    </a>
    .  On 
the other hand, as a limited production camera it would readily fill collector's 
shelves. The 
Fix? A new version with M4 rewind lever. Time will tell. 
Nevertheless, it is a damn good thing the new Leica M turned has the traditional 
mechanical shutter, instead of a stripped down M6 shutter with no AE, as was 
strongly rumored. The mechanical shutter Leica rangefinder stays in 
production after the announced end of the M6, I am very happy about 
that. The traditional back to classic MP is proving very popular. 
Some sales areas are even having difficulty supplying demand. 
Unfortunately Solms management has yet to get picture and return to the 
traditional vulcanite body covering. The MP introduces yet another body 
covering, this variation looks like a $1 sheet of black wet/or/dry sandpaper. 
Geez. When are these guys going to get it right?

     MP "Classic" February 
2005
    </font>
    Schmidt Marketing, Leica's Hong Kong distributor, had the 
interesting idea to produce an MP much close to the original 1957 MP. 
Schmidt specially ordered 500 to their specifications (hey, you can too, if you 
have that kind of bucks). 400 were intended for the China market, 100 for 
the rest of the world. The MP Classic is a nice looking camera with M3 
style vulcanite, M3 style engraving, original MP style number, a MP 2004 style 
film reminder, a beautiful 1957 style rigid black paint 50/2 Summicron, 
and even has a 1957 MP style TTL metering. In other words, Schmidt thought 
it a good idea to order 500 cameras without a meter for only about $6500. 
I see the logic, but I personally think having no meter in this otherwise nicely 
done camera was a terrifically bad idea from a marketing standpoint. Time will tell if Leica ends up 
offering a "MP Modern" meter upgrade kit for the meterless "MP Classic."

chrome, along with a matching retro styled 50/1.4 ASPH. These amount to 
the modern MP's restyled to 1956 like the original Leica MP with M2 style film 
advance and film counter. They are GORGEOUS! Long term I believe 
they will prove superb collectibles. Three thumbs up!

      One of the favorite 
Leica past times is rumors of new products.
     </font>
     Towards the last quarter of 1996, rumors of a new
M6 or M7 were rampant. The M6 rebate helped feed these beliefs since it made sense to
clear shelves of old stock before bringing out the new model (s). I believe
Leica was definitely planning to introduce new M models, but just as their museum is
full of things they almost made, they changed their mind on the last moment.

  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <font size="3">
    <strong>
     About the time the Leica M6 rebates started, an
Italian Leica dealer announced the impending introduction of these new M versions and
started quite a ruckus:

  </p>
  <p align="left">

     1) A M6E with electronic shutter 2)
a M6W with a viewfinder for the 21-50 and 3) a M6T with a viewfinder for the 50-135
    </strong>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <font size="3">
    <strong>
     In this scenario, the expectation was that the M6E
would have an M6J finder with higher magnification for the 35-135 range.
    </strong>
   </font>
  </p>
  <p align="left">
   <font size="3">
    <strong>
     A friend of mine, an American Leica dealer, got an
informal confirmation of versions 1-3 above from a Leica bigwig. It was one of those yes,
but don't quote me things. I know this person well, and he knows Leica. If he says he got
the confirmation, he did--regardless of Leica's public denials.

    <strong>
     January 98: With the
uncertainty of today's worldwide economies, Leica apparently opted for a minor M6 revision
with a modified M6J finder, rather than a major update with loads of investment capital.

     Things were looking up for M

    </font>
    <font size="3">
     Since that time, the M6
rebate has been extended three (or 4?) times, Leica has sold a slew of M6's, the Japanese
stock market has gone down further, the Thailand and Indonesia stock markets did their
version of our 1929 crash, and the dollar remains strong against the yen and mark. 
Add to that Leica's embarrassment and problems in getting a production R8
motor on the shelves. It's not like motors are a secret technology--everyone else
has them after all. Finally in Feb 98, something like a year after
 introduction, the hunchback of Solms AKA the R8 will have a motor. It makes
me wonder what Leica is using for a design and product development department.

     In the same time frameline, another Japanese
acquaintance told me about the field testing of two different Japanese made M cameras by
Ricoh and Minolta. Ricoh and Konica, among others, have recently marketed M
mount lenses.  I am told that Minolta will soon (1999) be marketing a 20 and
28 M mount lens.  While Konica made several prototype M cameras, I have
it on good authority that Konica will not market it. And of course,
there is the new Yasuhara screw mount camera scheduled for delivery for March 1999
and the new Cosina made Voigtlander BL LTM camera with its much appreciated 15 and 25 LTM
lenses. There is speculation Cosina may introduce a new model with
rangefinder/viewfinder and M mount later in 1999. We will see.
 The M bayonet patent expired in November of 1998, opening the door of
opportunity for M copies.

    Ricoh M. Ricoh has shown some interest in the RF market by selling a 28mm LTM
    lens. (9/2000) it might have been a prototype, but Ricoh left the 35mm camera

nearly identical rangefinder / viewfinder. If Konica copies much more

     New rumors from Japan suggest a new

Rangefinder on the market which might fill the bill, with a M mount and a Leica name
tag, the Cosina made Voigtlander Bessa R. latest Tokyo rumor (9/2000)
 is that this project was dropped, with Leica and Cosina instead exploring the
possibility of a Cosina made electronic M7. Alas, the Leica long time faithful
would never fully accept such a Japanese camera as the "big" M body, 
unless Leica and Cosina management had the foresight to manufacture it  in
Germany. Hard to believe they would go to the extra expense, but it would
probably mean a big difference in sales. Since it would probably require
a new factory, this might be the perfect time to add "Wetzlar" once again on
Leica top plates. Not likely I know, but time will tell.
