  It is relatively common knowledge that members of the 7th calvalry were
awarded Medals of dis-Honor for their valiant efforts in defense of what
has come to be known as the Great American Way. This was discussed in an
earlier post entitled "
  <a href="http://www.dickshovel.com/medals.1.html">
   ...18 [sic] Medals of
dis-Honor.
  </a>
  " That post was prompted by a current Wasichu proposal to
turn the massacre site into a theme "Park." I suggested that, if Wasichu
was serious as to making amends for the massacre, the Medals of Honor
should be rescinded, trashed, melted down...this as an first-step
indicator of Wasichu sincerity.
  <p>
   As an ex-Marine infantryman (1961-1965) with considerable exposure to
flying pieces of metal, I must admit that I take the Medal of Honor
seriously. Yet, the awards discussed previously, and now herein, were
not Medals of Honor, but Medals of dis-Honor.
  </p>
  <p>
   "The Medal of Honor, established by Joint Resolution of
Congress, July 12, 1862 (amended by Acts of Congress, July 9, 1918 and
July 25, 1963), is awarded in the name of Congress to a person who,
while a member of the Armed Forces,
   <b>
    distinguishes himself or herself
conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity
   </b>
   at the risk of life above
and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against any enemy
of the United States; while engaged in military operations
   <b>
    involving
conflict with an opposing foreign force
   </b>
   ; or while serving with
friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing
armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party.
   <b>
    The deed performed must have been one of personal bravery or
self-sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual
above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life.
Incontestable proof of the performance of service is required, and each
recommendation for award of this decoration is considered on the
standard of extraordinary merit.
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   "Prior to World War I, the 2,625 Army Medal of Honor awards up to that
time were reviewed to determine which past awards met new stringent
criteria. The Army removed 911 names from the list, most of them former
members of a volunteer infantry group during the Civil War who had been
induced to extend their enlistments when they were promised the
Medal."

   The first of all Army Medals of Honor was earned in February 13-14, 1861
by Assistant Surgeon General J.D. Irwin who 'Voluntarily took command of
troops and attacked and defeated hostile indians he met on the way."
Surgeon Irwin volunteered to go to the rescue of 2nd Lieutenant G.N.
Bascom, 7th Infantry, who with 60 men was trapped by the Chiricauha
Apaches under Cochise. Irwin and 14 men, not having horses began the 100
mile march riding mules. After fighting and
capturing Indians, recovering stolen horses and cattle, he reached
Bascom's column and helped break his siege. 

 Note (1.21.95): 

Since this article was written Grosvenor Pollard has
provided new information regarding the above mentioned J. D. Irwin.
Sadly, this recipient of the U. S. Army's first Medal of Honor was party
to the unjustified hanging of First Nations prisoners:

   . [based on the official reports of Bascom and 1st Lt.
Isaiah N. Moore, who reinforced Bascom with troops from Ft.
Breckenridge, Arizona Territory]:
  </p>
  <p>
   Assistant Surgeon Bernard J. D. Irwin had been sent from Fort Buchanan
to tend to a wounded soldier and a wounded Butterfield employee holed up
with Bascom's command in the stage station in Apache Pass. He and his
escort overtook three Coyotero (i.e., Western) Apache warriors driving a
herd of 13 stolen cattle and 2 horses on the way and took them prisoner.
Thirteen days after arriving at Apache
Pass, Bascom and Moore found the bodies of four American hostages
Cochise had been holding, hoping to exchange them for the five members
of his extended family Bascom was holding: a brother, two nephews, a
wife, and his youngest son, Naiche [his great-granddaughter on the
Mescalero Rez identified him as the boy held by Bascom]. Irwin declared
that he was going to hang his three captives in retaliation and advised
Bascom to do the same with his hostages.
  </p>
  <p>
   Bascom protested until Moore, who outranked him, stated he would take
full responsibility. Cochise's wife and son were taken to Fort Buchanan
and later released, but

   </a>
   hanging of
his brother and nephews caused the Chiricahua leader to make war on
Americans - vowing to kill 10 for every one of his people slain - for
the next nine years and seven months. 

The last Army Medal of Honor awarded in an Indian campaign was granted
to Private O. Burchard on October 5, 1898:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
   "For distinguished bravery in action against hostile Indians
for action during the uprising of Chippewa Indians on Leech Lake,
northern Minnesota."
  </blockquote>
  Now...as to Wounded Knee. American Horse set the stage:
  <blockquote>
   "They turned their guns, Hotchkiss guns [breech-loading
cannons that
fired an explosive shell], etc., upon the women who were in the lodges
standing
there under a flag of truce, and of course as soon as they were fired
upon they
fled...There was a woman with an infant in her arms who was killed as
she almost
touched the flag of truce [which flew over the Lakota camp], and the
women and
children of course were strewn all along the circular village until they
were
dispatched. Right near the flag of truce a mother was shot down with her
infant;
the child not knowing that its mother was dead was still nursing, and
that
especially was a very sad sight. The women as they were fleeing with
their babes
were killed together, shot right through, and the women who were very
heavy with
child were also killed...After most all of them had been killed a cry
was made
that all those who were not killed or wounded should come forth and they
would be
safe. Little boys who were not wounded came out of their places of
refuge, and as
soon as they came in sight a number of soldiers surrounded them and
butchered
them there...Of course it would have been all right if only the men had
been
killed; we would feel almost grateful for it. But the fact of the
killing of the
women, and more especially the killing of the young boys and girls who
are to go
to make up the future strength of the Indian people, is the saddest part
of the
whole affair and we feel it very sorely."

   W.H. Prather, "a colored private of I troop of the 9th calvalry [was
inspired to write a ballad] The Indian Ghost Dance and War...It became a
favorite among the troops in camp and the scattered frontiersmen of
Dakota and Nebraska, being sung to a simple air with vigor and
expression and a particularly rousing chorus, and is probably by this
time a classic of the barracks":
   <blockquote>
    The Red Skins left their Agency, the Soldiers left their
Post,
    <br/>
    All on the strength of an Indian tale about the Messiah's ghost
    <br/>
    Got up by the savage chieftans to lead their tribes astray;
    <br/>
    But Uncles Sam wouldn't have it so, for he ain't built that way.
    <br/>
    They swore that this Messiah came to them in visions sleep,
    <br/>
    And promised to restore their game and Buffalos a heap,
    <br/>
    So they must start a big ghost dance, then all would join their
band,
    <br/>
    And may be so we lead the way into the great Bad Land.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    Chorus:
    <br/>
    They claimed the shirt Messiah gave, no bullet
could go through,
    <br/>
    But when the soldiers fired at them they saw this was not true.
    <br/>
    The Medicine man supplied them with their great Messiah's grace,
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    And he, too, pulled his freight and swore the 7th hard to
face.
    <br/>
    About their tents the Soldiers stood, awaiting one and all,
    <br/>
    That they might hear the trumpet clear when sounding General call
    <br/>
    Or Boots and Saddles in a rush, that each and every man
    <br/>
    Might mount in haste, ride soon and fast to stop this devilish band
    <br/>
    But Generals great like Miles and Brooke don't do things up that
way,
    <br/>
    For they know an Indian like a book, and let him have his sway
    <br/>
    Until they think him far enough and then to John they'll say,
    <br/>
    "You have better stop your fooling or we'll bring our guns to
play."
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    Chorus:
    <br/>
    They claimed the shirt, etc.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    The 9th marched out with splendid cheer the Bad Lands to
explo'e-
    <br/>
    With Col. Henry at their head they never fear the foe;
    <br/>
    So on they rode from Xmas eve 'till dawn of Xmas day;
    <br/>
    The Red Skins heard the 9th was near and fled in great dismay;
    <br/>
    The 7th is of courage bold both officers and men,
    <br/>
    But bad luck seems to follow them and twice has took them in;
    <br/>
    They came in contact with Big Foot's warriors in their fierce might
    <br/>
    This chief made sure he had a chance of vantage in the
fight.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    Chorus:
    <br/>
    They claimed the shirt, etc.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    A fight took place, 'twas hand to hand, unwarned by
trumpet call,
    <br/>
    While the Sioux were dropping man by man - the 7th killed them all,
    <br/>
    And to that regiment be said "Ye noble braves, well, done,
    <br/>
    Although you lost some gallant men a glorious fight you've won."
    <br/>
    The 8th was there, the sixth rode miles to swell that great command
    <br/>
    And waited orders night and day to round up Short Bulls band.
    <br/>
    The Infantry marched up in mass the calvalry's support,
    <br/>
    And while the latter rounded up, the former held the fort.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    Chorus:
    <br/>
    They claimed the shirt, etc.
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    E Battery of the 1st stood by and did their duty well,
    <br/>
    For every time the Hotchkiss barked they say a hostile fell.
    <br/>
    Some Indian soldiers chipped in too and helped to quell the fray,
    <br/>
    And now the campaign's ended and the soldiers marched away.
    <br/>
    So all have done their share, you see, whether it was thick or thin
    <br/>
    And all helped break the ghost dance up and drive the hostiles in.
    <br/>
    The settlers in that region now can breathe with better grace;
    <br/>
    They only ask and pray to God to make John hold his base.

    "...One woman, Blue Whirlwind, received fourteen wounds but
lived. Another woman, maddened by wounds, crawled from the edge of the
village. With a butcher knife between her teeth, she made her painful
way over a distance of ten yards to where a soldier lay on his back,
wounded. She raised the knife over him and, as he screamed, plunged it
into his breast. Another soldier, in the square, saw the act and sent a
bullet into her head. She dropped next to her victim.
