@INTEGRATION NOTES:

"Gotchas" to deal with during integration of the UI. Watch for the code marker "INTEGRATION NOTE:" throughout the build,
I've used that to flag details to handle.

- "Whack a Mole"
	To balance page layout variations requested by Product as the media query ("MQ") shifts
	happen, I'm suppressing a sub-set of content items in some modules under one
	resolution or the other.

	That's done by the addition of class="whack" to the content item in the markup as a hook
	for the CSS rendering cases. So the first part of the list will be "&lt;tag&gt;...content...&lt;/tag&gt;"
	but the last part of the list will be "&lt;tag class="whack"&gt;...content...&lt;/tag&gt;."

	Note that the position in the data loop where the switch occurs varies by module: I've included the
	point to include the whack class as a comment at the beginning of each module.

- Login/Account Menus
	Both logged-out and logged-in states of this menu are provided, with one commented out.

- Scripts
	Please try to keep your &lt;script&gt; tags at the end of the document if possible for performance reasons.
	Use unobtrusive scripting and avoid "blocking" scripts as much as you can to avoid bogging the pages
	down.

          Daedric Weapons
         </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          The Daedric weapons come in many forms; battleaxes, bows, daggers, swords, greatswords, war axes, maces, and warhammers. Choose the weapon that best fits your character build.
         </li>
         <li>
          Daggers can be dual-wielded and swung quickly, while battleaxes are slow but provide more damage per hit. In the center of the curve is the greatsword used two-handed.
         </li>
         <li>
          While Daedric weapons arent the best in the
          <a class="linkify" href="http://www.gamefront.com/games" target="_blank">
           game
          </a>
          by default, they can be upgraded, unlike the unique weapons listed below.
         </li>
         <li>
          To create a truly powerful weapon, pick one that fits your build, that matches your skills, then smith and enchant. Increasing your smithing and enchant skills to maximum with perks will allow you to upgrade Daedric weapons.
         </li>
         <li>
          The trickiest part of building Daedric weapons is getting your hands on Daedra Hearts. Daedra Hearts are dropped by Daedra, or demons, and these monsters alone are very rare in Skyrim.
         </li>
         <li>
          After reaching level 25, all Achemist vendors have a chance to carry a Daedra heart for sale. Play the Thieves Guild faction quests to unlock a College of Winterhold Fence, they will also sell Daedra Hearts.
         </li>
         <li>
          Another source of Daedra Hearts is through Enthir, in the Hall of Attainment in the College of Winterhold. Introduce yourself, theyll sell and restock Daedra Hearts every two days. Beware, completing the College of Winterhold faction quest string will make you unable to purchase Daedra hearts from Enthir.
         </li>
         <li>
          To create Daedric Weapons, you need a skill level of 90 in smithing, and taken the Daedric Smithing Perk. While leveling up your Enchant skill, take the Enchanter perk until it is maxed out at 5, then your weapons will become 100% stronger.
         </li>
         <li>
          Use fortify smithing potions to boost your smithing skill once Enchantment is fully leveled up to boost the strength of your smithed weapons even higher. With full Smithing and Enchantment skills, an upgraded Daedric two-handed sword can kill everything but a dragon in one hit.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Daedric Dagger can also be a destructive weapon with a Sneak skill higher than 50, allowing the player a times 15 damage bonus to sneak attacks. For the stealth player, this can be a very deadly weapon.

          This unique weapon isnt very powerful but it does offer a series of strange and random effects with every hit. To find the Wabbajack, you must complete The Mind of Madness quest. Start the quest by talking to Dervenin, a beggar wandering around Solitude.
         </li>
         <li>
          The weapon is enchanted to cause an unpredictable and random effect. Not every effect is good though, so check out the list of known effects: fireball, thunderbolt, frost rune explosion, invisibility on the target, disintegrate, clone target, summons a dremora to fight for the target, and transformation effects.
         </li>

          Transformation effects range from chickens, to mud crabs, to Dremora Lords. Very rarely, the target will transform into a coin.

          The Wabbajack is a Daedric Artifact, but its effects must be recharged, and the effects dont work on dragons.

             No unique bows I feel somewhat ripped off, but you can upgrade the uniques unlike it says, Blade of Woe at Legendary level does 25 damage per hit and with the 15x bonus sneak attack from the perk it is insanely powerful.

             @wharrl drawven bow of animus is the unique bow with 10 seconds of soul trap and is an misc quest item.
             <br/>
             btw if you enchant a weapon and give it the name of a guild or faction it will immediately be changed from a regular weapon to a stolen weapon.
             <br/>
             example an ebony bow i made minutes prior to enchanting it with shock and renaming it Blades bow is now a stolen item.
             <br/>
             and if you want your companion to have no limit on how much to hold, tell them to pick up items and sell them later.
             <br/>
             the only warning is you have to drop stacked items 1 at a time

             After you complete the quest for Mehrunes Razor, you can fast travel between the Shrine of Dagon where the razor is put together and any other location to rapidly collect Daedra Hearts.

             Havent found Chillrend, huh? At the right level its probably the best sword in the game. Higher base damage than Daedric, with 25 ice dame, and best of all a chance(happens often) to paralyze.

             Ok TBH the best weapon in the game is a daedric sword/great sword or what not. The only reason is when you get 100 smithing + 100% smithing increase by enchantments/potions you can upgrade it to TWICE TIMES THE LEGENDARY. With 100 1 handed and daedric sword we are talking 160 damage a swing with no enchantment charge. After this you can custom enchant it for that extra umph. this is tried and true to work by me but you have to have a high smithing and high enchanting and if you can get your hands on a smithing potion that helps alot.

             With 100 smithing, 100 enchanting, a full set of fortify smithing +25% on four pieces of armom = +100% and plus a 50% fortify smithing potion, you find that the legendary weapons do not increase in damage as much as the daedric. With not even 100 onehanded and only +60% damage my daedric swords were doing 280 damage with fority onehanded damage enchants. not counting plus 50 elemental enchant damage i put on them.

             My Daedric Greatsword is at 589 dmg without buffs and with orc racial and potion it has a proud damage of 2708. Done with +29% smithing on 4 items and smithing pot. Pot was crafted with +29% alchemy enchant on 4 items and so on. So far i think that this should be the highest dmg you can achieve with the greatsword. Ill do the same thing with the warhammer again and see what damage it will have.

             Just a suggestion. If you want awesome weapons and armor. Focus on alchemy and smithing. You can get insane bonuses for smithing with potions and find an enchantment that increases one handed and make yourself some armor.  My glass Axe is swinging 347 currently and Ive only got alchemy up just a tad.  Still working at it.  Have fun!

             There is also the Nord Greatsword of Burning, i found it somewhere east of Solitude i think (it was definately one of the cities far north. There were bandits i fought and retrieved it from their chief. Must say im not far in the game and its my main weapon of choice but i havent upgraded it or anything, so its definately got more potential. Could be the fire version of chillrend

             Chillrend is in Mercers (the guy who runs the thieves guild) house that *Spoiler* you have to kill. Its in the very last roomof his house where you find out where he has hidden. In a glass case or something. Great weapon

             There is an enchantment I learned that increases weapons/armor upgrading too. So far I can put it on clothes/armor, necklace, and a ring. I have smithing and enchanting at 100, so now I am going to create some stuff with potions that let me create better and see what I can make.

             So has anyone done some work with bows?
            </p>
            <p>
             I have my alchemy and smithing to 100, working on enchanting and got called away on business.
            </p>
            <p>
             Going to work on enchanting to 100 when i return.  Looking to maximize my bow damage.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Nightingale Bow is nice but glitchy, have found better in chest drops.
            </p>
            <p>
             Take lockpick perk to treasure hunter for nice world drops, since gaining that perk, i have found Ebony Bow with Tier 5 Soul Trap, and a Daedric Bow with Tier 4 Lightning.  Converted both to Legendary, and without archery maxed, i have base damage on the Daedric at 160 with no buffs aside from overdraw

             You dont have to have a smithing potion people.  As SOON as you find an item thats enchanted with an increase smithing by X% Just unenchant the item and learn it.  Then use grand soul gems to enchant cheap armor and always keep it somewhere (house chest, person, etc.).  I have a necklace that increases smithing by 15%, ring for 15%, gauntlets for 15%, and boots for 8% (boots werent a grand soul gem
             <img alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn2.gamefront.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif"/>
             ).  Screw the potions you randomly come by or have to purchase for A LOT of gold.  Just enchant your stuff once, keep it, and be done with ever having to worry about it again!

             There is one weapon that is unstoppable. Unlike your weapons with over 300 dmg etc etc. This weapon is called Whindshear and can be found on the last dark brotherhood quest on the boat. The enchant on the weapon makes it so good, on every hit ot makes your foes recoil and some times makes them fall to the ground. If you max out with smithing and pots and smithing enchanted armor you could probably get the damage up to 150-200. The enchant of the weapon never runs out, it sucks that you cant disenchant it. =(

             Ok, well off weapons and onto armor, if you want to be the stealthiest motherf***er ever youll require these items: dark brotherhood boots as they muffle noise, ebony mail which is daedric artifact and makes you significantly harder to see, in sneak turns your character black. Then enchant other items for stealth and max all stealth perks. This along with mehrunes dagger is amazing, I know its not the best dagger but it makes you feel good knowing its a daedra lords weapon

             For anyone struggling to find a daedra heart there is one in jorrvaskr in whitrun, Go down to the sleeping chamber and take a right down the main corridor and there is a heart on a plate, the room always has a companion in it so you can steal it and pay the fine (250 gold) or use an invisibility spell or temporary potion and get it for free.

             I am surprised no one has mentioned the daedric mace.  Why is this when the mace does more damage initially?  Does it not do more as you enchant it and upgrade it?  At base level, my legendary daedric mace does 51 damage while my base level other legendary daedric weapons do 49 or less.  It may be only two points, but it can also be dual wielded.  This being said, why all the focus on the great sword and not others?

             ok, the best weapons for dammage output are always duel weild daedra weapons. from there you use your 100 smithing (obviously), your 100 enchanting to make potions gear, your 100 alchemy t make enchanting potions and so on until u hit max mdifiers. from there on you make your fortify smithing potions and enchant your weapons. drink potions and increase weapons to maximum possible dammege. this is technically the way to get the best dammage output in the game, as well as armour ratings. using this method you can easilly be 100% immune to every element and have maximum enchantments on your weapons and armour, in short you can kill everything in one hit and can barely be killed. dragons may require a special but since you will be immune to the fire and frost, its frankly no problem. hopefully this settles this debate about all of these other things like chilwind being better. theyre not. maximum potential daedric is.

             Let me tell yall the way to get the ultimate armor
             <br/>
             And weapon. First you enchant some noob armor
             <br/>
             Helm and boots neckless and a ring for enchanting x%
             <br/>
             Better (if you have a falmer helmet you can wear
             <br/>
             2 helmets so that would help), if youve got your better
             <br/>
             Enchanting clothes or armor, you can do this again,
             <br/>
             and again, and again, and again if you want to.
             <br/>
             Now you should enchant maybe 5 or 10 time better,
             <br/>
             Depends on how many times you did this. If you enchant some
             <br/>
             Clothes and stuff for better smithing, you should smith
             <br/>
             Alot better as well. Now start improving your armour and weapon.
             <br/>
             (If you wear a falmer helmet, and wear another helmet (in my case volslung, but it works with others too) over(or under, doesnt matter) you wont see your head
             <br/>
             Youll just see a floating falmer helmet, pretty cool)
             <br/>
             Have fun!

             sneak attacks with the dark brotherhood gloves can get you a 30x multiplier. soooooo, with an ebony dagger or anything halfway decent can get you one slash kills with around 600 damage for the first slash. this pretty much kills everything youll run into. It would get old if it werent for the sweet stealth assassination shot. enchanting a dagger with soul trap is also nifty

             How about instead of general damage, you focus on the practicality of the weapons?  Want to have a higher Enchant skill?  Get the Mace of Molag Bal (found in Markarth at the abandoned house, do the quest yourselves), and the Black Star.  You run into considerably more humans in the game rather than creatures, so soul trap away.
            </p>
            <p>
             The mace itself has a soul trap enchantment on it (and deals relatively decent damage), so having some empty soul gems in your inventory will help, and the Black Star never breaks down after using it.  As for higher smithing, if your enchant skill is being brought up with the Mace/Star combo, then enchant one item at a time to fortify Smithing.  Itll stack and there you go.

             how about chillrend? you get it in the riftweed manor during the thieves guild questline, and is in a expert locked display case.  And there was also a random bandit out in the middle of nowhere, and he was carrying a elven sword with 45 burn damage.

             Ebony blade is actually pretty goodif your very new to the game. Like lvl 20.  It classifies as a two handed weapon, but uses 1h wep perk, and 1h wep speed. and it only does 15 damage, no disenchant and cant be upgraded.

             I prefeer using bows, with my bow perk/skill being at an all time high, I really enjoy using bows, the 2-hand melee weapons are horrible, but I do sometimes use 2-handed melee and staffs/spells.

             Glass Bow is the way to go during the early stages of the game. Craft + enchant maakes it deadlier.

             @ReconDino666  Raise the difficulty to maximum. I broke my game by getting 100 smithing/100 enchant  it just wasnt fun anymore when I could run through a dungeon swinging my sword 1-3 times at each enemy and theyd die, and nobody being able to dent my armor. Put the difficulty up to the max in the in-game menu options and it became fun again.

             I have smithing, alchemy, and enchanting all at 100 (with the perks in each category needed to maximize created items, dmg etc. I crafted smithing/alchemy gear for better smithing/alch (pots, weapons/armor 29% bonus on each of 4 items). Use crafted alchemy potion of 130% smithing increase. Archery is currently at 91 and my daedric bow has a base damage of 545 plus dual ench of frost/stam 67 pts and shock 67 pts, magicka 1/2. Plus add crafted poison pots of 159 or more and a goo arrow. Dragons die in 2 hits. One hit if you get a sneak attack or crit.

             I consider a daedric warhammer to be exceptional at destroying anyone, since if you spec your talents in it, it will ignore 75% armor.. Which I consider 75% extra damage

             There are certain enchanted items such as Shrouded Hand Wraps and Jesters Gloves that double one handed sneak attack damage. If used with the assassins blade perk,daggers can do 30X normal damage if you can manage to sneak up on your target.

             i found a steel warhammer down to the far right of the map called Trollsbane. You will fight two trolls to achieve it. Its laying beside some dude that was a troll hunter. The only cool thing is it has 25 fire dam. against trolls. Not great but a cool unique weapon for unique weapon collectors as myself. Also Halidar Staff is cool.

             To get the best damage possible get level 100 smithing, alchemy and echanting.. Enchant clothes to make your alchemy skill better then make a potion to make enchanting skill better, get a new set of clothes, drink potion that ups enchanting and repeat until it reaches the cap. Then use an enchantig potion, make clothes that are enchanted smithing, drink a smithing potion and upgrade your daedric weapon. And enchant it.. There we go Best weapon in the game.

             If youre into bows like I am, I really enjoy the Nightingale bow. It is an Ebony bow with strong effects against everything but dragons. This bow can be earned late within the Theives Guild questline along with the Nightingale sword and armor (which if youre into light armor is also very awesome).

             I have a deadric warhammer dishing out 269 damage.  To get this I have enchanted boots, a necklace, ring, and gauntlets that increase two-handed 21%, 25%, 35%, and 40% respectively. Still not maxed out on enchanting yet so I can probably get something better going later. All that along with the poisonous ebony armor mentioned above and nothing can stop you.

             This game needs to stop with the bears too. I mustve killed enough to permanently affect the food chain in all of Tamriel.  Too few enemy types.

             If you want to find unlimited daedra hearts and are strong enough to fight for them, go to the shrine of Mehrunes Dagon in Hjalmarch. As soon as you fast travel/arrive, you will be greeted by two daedra minions,(only if completed Mehrunes Quest prior to arrival) each wielding powerful enchanted weaponry both two handed and one handed.  After eliminating them, you can loot there bodies for a deadra heart a piece and for there awesome weapons. Then, go inside the shrine to fight two more daedra minions and collect their daedra hearts and weapons. Also in the shrine you will find 6 gold ingots and lots of other goodies.
            </p>
            <p>
             This whole scheme can be repeated every 7 days as the daedra minions will respon. Overall, you will be getting 4 daedra hearts and a lot of other wonderful weapons and items for your destructive and financial purposes in Skyrim. Trust me this works.

             Armor redommendations:
             <br/>
             Ebony Mail- Acquired through Boethia Daedric quest. This heavy black and blue aromor makes you move more silently and produces a poisonous aura that hurts anyone within melee range for 5 pts per second to their health. It also provides a hefty amount of defense and weighs only 27 pounds. Its like an assassins heavy armor. Worth getting!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             Nahkrinn- dont know if i spelled it right but this dragon priest mask is heavy armor and weighs 9 pounds. It comes with an increase to your magicka by 50 points and Destruction and Restoration spells cost 20% less magicka to cast. It is also upgraded through ebony ingots and on legendary can produce a whopping 100 armor points.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vokun- another dragon priest mask that is great for the every day adventurer. It is light armor and weighs 5 pounds. It gives you 20% better store prices, the ability to breath underwater forever, and adds 20 points to carrying capacity limit letting you hang onto that extra weapon or valuable. It is upgraded through corrundum ingots.
            </p>
            <p>
             Spellbreaker- a wonderful shield that when equipped, provides a 50 magic dmg resistence ward spell that resets every second, i like to call it the mage stopper.  It also has one of the highest armor ratings i have seen on a shield and is upgraded through dwarvern ingots. It looks really weird but it works like a charm.  This shield is the reward for completing the Peryite Daedric quest.

             Actually, all kind of weapon and armor are good in the game, you can kill a dragon with a iron sword dude
            </p>
            <p>
             just for effect , more damage, more armor, you use another kind a weapon / armor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im currently using full daedric armor.
            </p>
            <p>
             How much money? Just a little bit 8000 gold and you can go daedric + improve it

             Messed around with some daedric stuff and got the daedric warhammer up to 351 damage now.  Blacksmith elixirs, smithing increases due to wearing different types of attire and/or items helps quite a bit.  I need gold ingots so Im going to check Hjalmarch as suggested.  And yes, the ebony mail is fantastic.  Its my most valuable piece of equipment so far.  I dont even use my daedric heavy armor.  Is it possible to enchant valuable gold necklaces and rings crafted from scratch to raise two-handed skill 50% or greater?  I have found a ring that lets me do 40% more damage when using two-handed weapons.  Can I make a ring that lets me do.. lets say 75% more?  Thanks.

             My Daedric Greatsword currently does 235 base damage.  Heres how:
            </p>
            <p>
             I created a series of smithing clothes:
            </p>
            <p>
             At my current enchant skill (around 60) I created four pieces (tunic, necklace, ring, gloves) each providing a 15% smithing boost.
            </p>
            <p>
             Combined with a 50% enchant potion, I was able to add 110% improvement to a Daedric Greatsword. (My smithing is already at 100 so its a big boost).
            </p>
            <p>
             I also have a set of 2-handed skill boosting items (ring, necklace, dragon boots, dragon gloves), each proving a 20% boost to my 2-handed damage.  Im at 84 in 2-handed with all 5 base perks and 2/3 sword perks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thus, the total base damage I do with my Daedric Greatsword is 235.

             If you want a daedra heart, if u ever find a guy in the wilds named balbus, who says he is gathering supplies for the gourmet, kill him and he should have a daedra heart.

             Completely game breaking, but I have  daedric sword that does around 80,000 dmg and its REALLY simple to do.  You name it, you can make it..  My dragon light armor all added up is around 350,000 and I have a daedric bow that is around 100,000 dmg.  Add a fortify health + fortify magic and you simply cannot die and you never have to let your magic regen.  As I said, game breaking.  Want unlimited carrying capacity, you can do it.  It involves a Resto potion glitch and is WAY easier than the previous alchemy + enchantment loop.  It also can be done at very low levels.  Google is your friend but be warned, make a save file before you do it cuz it takes the challenge out of the game, even on master.  But if you wanna walk around in God mode and one hit kill everything give it a shot.

             good early game weapons -
             <br/>
             blades sword. dont remember where i got it but you can pick it up through one of the questlines, from Delphine (?. she has you go kill a dragon at a dragon burial site. when you first start the quest you go into a secret room and its on the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
             ebony war axe  found this in Valthuume (?) in a sidequest. you have to get 3 vessels for a dude and then perform this ritual. throughout the dungeon you kill 2 Draugr warlords, one has an ebony dagger and ebony battle axe, the other an ebony war axe (base damage of 36) and ebony shield. once you return you do the ritual then have to kill a dragon priest, who has a great mask (wear is immune to poison and disease)

             Full-on 100% Smithing and Enchanting created Deadric Armor boosting Endurance as much as possible, plus I wear a +52 Endurance ring I smithed and the Galdur Amulet (+30 to each Endurance/Health/Magicka.  Add this to the Steed Stone and you can basically Sprint for a full minute and use your dual weild power attack multiple times.  Takes about 2-3 of those multi-strikes to kill a dragon depending on the Dragons stats.  Im weilding Daedric swords with enchantments for soul-sucking/Health drain on one and Magicka drain/paralyze on the other.  Add that to the Daedric gauntlet bonuses for one handed weapons and I dont know the numbers but Giants fall in one stroke.  I have blacksmith apron and other clothes/jewelry for a total of 103% bonus smithing.  Working on building the Alchemy perks up so I can make badass Smithing and Enchanting potions.  Level 47 and I need to max up the difficulty becasue I can jsut stand there and let people wail on me and my armor absorbs almost everyting.  Resorting to barefist punching with no hand to hand perks to have an enjoyable fight.

             Ebony Blade:
             <br/>
             -Enchanted kantana like Greatsword.  Increases in power every time you kill someone who considers you a friend, has a quest for you, or is 100% innocent.  Asorbs health for you with each swing.  Never runs out of charge.  Cannot be improved at a gridstone.
             <br/>
             -You can only aquire it once you reach level 20.  Go to the inn in Whiterun (Bannered Mare) and ask for the lastest gossip.  They will tell you the Jarl has trouble with his son.  Go to the Jarl of Whiterun (If you captured Whitrun for the Stormcloaks he will not be in the throne room but in a different part of the palace) and ask him about his son.  He will tell you to talk to his son because his son will not listen to him.  The boy tells you he talks to a Whispering Door and will direct you to it.  The deems you more worthy than the boy, but it is locked and you must locate the key.  Go to the Jarls son again and he will tell you the Jarl or Farenger the mage have it. You must pickpocket it, then return to the door and unlock it.  Inside there is the blade, and a book on how dangerous it is.  I hope this has helped.

             You forgot the chillrend blade which when enchanted is a good and easy weapon to get. To get it just follow the Thieves guild quest in Riften and you will be given a job to break into a house. Follow the secret passage way to the basement, (there are lots of traps) an you will enter a room a legendary sword cabinet will need lockpicking. Bring lots of lockpicks and you will get a chillrend sword.

             I used a skyforged sword shield and armour. went up to the giant Uahg Rodah (shout words)
             <br/>
             the giant went like 10 feet in the air! But the shout kept going and hit a mammoth! so the maamoth chased me and since I couldnt fast travel it kept chasing meAll the wy to Markarth. It ended up being killed my some forsworn and a Hagraven.So the forsworn killed me which turned out to be some Markarth guards fighting a hagraven.

             Most of the best items are daedric artifacts, earned through daedric quests.Dawnbreaker has a fairly low base damage compared to others, but the enchantment can be useful when fighting undead.Wabbajack is especially useful at low levels, but still useful later on, and its always fun. Volendrung is a very good warhammer, possibly more base damage than daedric, andhas an absorb stamina enchantment, which basically means you can continously power attack until it runs out of charge. Mehrunes razor is most useful at lower levels, but the enchantment is most useful in combat rather than stealth,as a dagger is normally best for. Sanguine rose is extremely useful when you need a hand. Skull of corruption is useful, but not as fun as the one in oblivion. Ebony Blade can be pwerful, if you are willing to sacrifice freinds (followers, people youve done quests for, etc.) as each ally you kill adds 2 to the absorb health enchantment, up to max 30.Also, although it is wielded with two hands, base damage is affected by the one-handed skill. Then thers the rueful axe, which can be swapped for the masque of clavicus vile in his daedric quest. The axe has an absorb stamina enchantment like volendrung, it think its a bit weaker though. I think thats it for weapons, but theres armor too, like ebony mail (poisons people who get too close) or spellbreaker (a shield which projects a ward, negating magic up to 50 points), or other objects like azuras star (a reusable soul gem).

             All you guys obsess over damage output and enchantments but I find that doing all the skill boosts and numbers ing ruins the game like prison ruins arseholes. I used Iron daggers to 100 my smithing and though to myself Well that was ing boring. So I made my dragon scale armor and now I use mehrunes razor and whatever I feel like putting in my other hand. I enjoy the game for the quests and dialogue. As awesome as it is to be able to one hit EVERYTHING that you guys meet there really isnt much challenge is there? Its much more interesting to simply pick up the best stuff you find and use that instead of whoring over your enchanting tables and forges to get a perfect weapon. Just try going with the flow and stop turning it into some sort of competition instead of the beautiful art and entertainment that it was intended to be. (Im just saying how I enjoy doing things. Say if you agree please

             If your on the 360 and you want lots of money, ramp up your alchemy &amp; get plenty of daedric hearts heres how to do it. Go to the thieves guild in riften. Go to the dude selling potions &amp; ingredients (he ususally has a daedric heart). Now buy all his ingredients. wait for 24 hours  but press the dashboard button this speeds up the wait time to just a few seconds , repeat to get the 48 hours waiting time. again buy the ingredients keep going until you decide to now make potions. (use the giants toe &amp; wheat for a strong potion). now sell the potions back to the same guy &amp; tonilla, Rinse &amp; repeat 1hr alchemy 100 30+ daedric hearts and lots of cash

             For the absolute best BOW possible, follow these instructions:
            </p>
            <p>
             I apologize, its a little long, but hopefully quite comprehensive
            </p>
            <p>
             -Smithing to 100 (easy to do if you keep making leather bracers)
             <br/>
             -Enchanting to 100. again, easy to do if you do a power trip through dwemer ruins and pick up soul gems. Make sure you then visit some creature caverns and use an enchanted soul trap sword to fill a LOT of soul gems.
            </p>
            <p>
             To actually get enchanting to 100? Use ALL those leather bracers you made, enchant them with SKILL upgrades; these both ensure the highest resale value AND give you the biggest enchanting skill increase. This will require a few HUNDRED (I heard somewhere it was 640 for smithing and about half that for enchanting) items per smithing and enchanting and is best done when you have some down time and some extra soul gems.
            </p>
            <p>
             ENSURE YOU SAVE YOUR GRAND AND BLACK SOUL GEMS FOR LAST!
            </p>
            <p>
             Raise Alchemy to 100. At this point, since enchanting might be close to 100, you will need to enchant a ring, necklace, helmet, and gloves with alchemy bonuses. There is no potion for fortify alchemy, for obvious reasons (infinite improvement if that was possible).
            </p>
            <p>
             Side Note: If you ahve enchanting at 100 with Extra effect (2 enchantments per item) you can make a set of crafting gloves, ring, and necklace that have +25% alchemy and smithing bonuses with them. You will need a separate armour, like leather, for a +25% raise smiting bonus. You will also need a +25% alchemy helmet. The +25% can only be gained using items enchanted with GRAND or BLACK soul gems containing GRAND souls. If alchemy is high enough, you can even use a potion to enchant each to a max of +29%  and that is the absolute MAX; the game is structured to limit the possible improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once this is all complete, you should have:
            </p>
            <p>
             1.Smithing, Enchanting, Alchemy at 100
             <br/>
             2.A set of Crafting gloves, ring, and bracers that add a +29% smithing and alchemy bonus
             <br/>
             3.An Alchemy helm that raises alchemy by +29%
             <br/>
             4.A smithing tunic that raises smithing by +29%
             <br/>
             5.Potions of fortify enchant ( Blue Butterfly Wing, Hagraven Claw, Snowberries, Spriggan Sap) that will increase enchanting +32% (this is how you go from +25% to +29% enhancements on items)
             <br/>
             6. Heres the real kicker that no one has caught so far: you can make a potion of fortify smithing (Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, Sabre Cat Tooth, Spriggan Sap). Crafted using ALL alchemy enhacements at skill 100 with all perks this will yeild a +130% smithing bonus for 30 seconds (or 60 if you have the right perk).
            </p>
            <p>
             AFTER this hurculean effort, youre ready to make the dragons quiver in their scales.
            </p>
            <p>
             Step 1. Buy Daedric hearts from Enthial at the winterhold college (DO NOT FINISH THE QUEST LINE FOR THE COLLEGE OR HE WONT SELL ANY MORE TO YOU). Wait two days, repeat until you have about 15.
            </p>
            <p>
             Step 2. Collect 30 or so ebony ignots. After L40 or so, they can be bought pretty much at any blacksmith or general goods store. I usually check in on them every time Im in town. I usually just buy them and then leave them by the forge in whiterun for future use.
            </p>
            <p>
             Step 3. Put on ALL you smithing gear. This should be Skill 100 + 116% bonus from smithing items + 130% bonus from smithing potion. Keep in mind that these are non-linear; they are multipliers of one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             Step 4.Create your Daedric weapon and armour set.
             <br/>
             Step 5 Enchant your Daedric weapon and armour set.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for WHAT enchantments to use, think about this. Bows do damage from far away. If you create rings, bracers, boots, helms, and necklaces that increase bow damage (Max of 47% bonus per skill using the +32% fortify enchanting potion we made earlier), your bow can generally have damage levels of 500 base damage with archery at 100, with paralyze and soul trap thrown in to boot. At those damage levels, its not worth enchanting the bow with +50 elemental damage.
            </p>
            <p>
             You might say: 500 damage for all that? Bollocks. Well, my friend, Think about sneaking. with the right perk, you can get a 3x damage boost to 1500 damage. One arrow. From far away. While no one sees you. Thats better than running in like a madman and having all hell break loose around you IMHO. ALSO. You can creat a potion of fortify marksman of 130%, giving you a base damage of close to 1150, sneak damage of 3450. THATS ALMOST 3500 DAMAGE  ENOUGH TO TAKE DOWN ALMOST ANYTHING IN THE GAME ON MASTER.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seriously, Ive done it. No cheats. and No, I dont have a life. Single Tear.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope that helps you create the ultimate bow!

             I was thinking about doing this but Im not sure if I want to 1 shot everything, I feel like that would just take the fun out of the game and make it unchallenging and boring.

             personally, i think the best two weapons i have discovered is the daedric bow and battle axe. once you upgrade them to ledgendry, the bow can kill a more or less anything especially if you sneek attack them. and the battle axe is just awsome and will kill anything from a gaint to a sabbo cat. by far the best weapons, although do take a while to get

             Should you ask people to train you in smithing/alchemy/enchanting, or are you better of increasing your skills the old fashioned way.
             <br/>
             P.S is the Dagger of Woe (the one you get off Astrid) any good, or do I just ignore it.
             <br/>
             P.P.S. a Deadric Dagger would (including enchantments, smithing, alchemy, etc) pwn if you got the Assassins Blade Stealth perk (15x stealth attack damage increase with daggers) and was wearing Dark Brotherhood Shrouded Gauntlets (Double backstab damage), allowing for a total of 30x damage with a single stealth attack. Any thoughts on this theory?

             I dont know if my game has been glitched, however I have tested this with several itemsFor some reason I can smith glass weapons higher up than deadric weapons.  Once my gear was maxed out in regards to +% smithing.  The base damage is obviously higher on all deadric weapons compared to glass, but somehow my glass sword, dagger, and bow I was able to smith higher. (using same exact gear + potion)  Anybody else find any information on this?

             about the chillrend its a nice sword n all but by no means the best. the chillrend doesnt upgrade like a regular sword and is considerably weaker because of it. the chillrend at its best is about 360ish were as a deadric one handed sword you can get to about 518 dam (not including the enchantment damage, about 590 after) dual wield that combined with the orcs ability and a sneak attack you can easily hit over 12k dam with 1 hit.
             <br/>
             oh and it is possible to 1 hit a dragon

             <br/>
             to get a deadric sword to over 500 damage max out smithing enchantment and alchemy. make alchemy armor and use it to make enchanting potions. then use the enchanting potion to remake alchemy armor. and make more enchanting potions. after that make blacksmith potions that should be at +130% smithing. the combined bonuses from a good blacksmith armor set, a 130% potion, and the blacksmith skill. your swords base damage should come out close to 500 i remade my alchemy armor numerous times is why mine came out over 518.

             i think that glasses war axes are good as when upgraded to legendary they do 58 damage (base) ad a strong enhancement like 69 shock damage, and you have a weapon with 127 damage

             The best weapon of course is your Fists, Fists of steel, the perks for increased armor rating and ways of improving your smithing x%, and enchantments for extra armor rating and unarmed damage lets me kill anceint  dragons in four or less hits not using power strikes. dont be a kajiit because then you too are also a , be a nord, be a viking.

             Erm seriously the best for damage is level 100 one handed and dual weild legendary daedric war axes with incineration enchantment does 100 fire damage and has 25% chance to maker enemies blow up and scatter if you smithing is high enough you can get each war axe to do 150 damage each just stack smithing potions and smithing clothes simple it kills elder dragons in 1double power attack and it is easy to get once you get the enchantment from the sword in soverngard (to the right of the in path under the dragon body bridge) simple!!!

             To get chillrend you need to progress in the thieves guild questline when you break into Mercers house.  Its in the basement in an expert locked case.  It does the most damage for a 1h sword.

             Well I believe honestly that the best armor is a full set of deadric armor, obviously, but theres a better mask that I havent seen anyone talk about(or have the patience to read) but it is the hidden 9th dragon priest mask, look it up its beast, when your health is low it knocks back your opponents, heals you and your allies, might put you in a fire cloak, and might send a dragon priest to fight for you. Now with all those potions and all the level enchanting yes I am pretty sure that you can make the best sword possible I work with shield bow sword Classic am I right lol But deadric everything I think is best, others might be similar but yes and if you want deadric stuff get you smith up to lvl 90 go to the very top of the throat of the world and get a enchanted pick axe, go to gloombound mine and mine 48 ore so ebony ores, smelt, and go but deadric hearts from enthir or findem in jorrvasker where kodlak was Helmet: 9th dragon priest mask, Armor: deadric set with all enchantments and leveled up, Sword: deadric w/ all enchantments and leveled up, Bow: deadic with same as others, and that would be all, Im sure thats the best you can get/make. I rlly hoped this helped I even said how to get everything you wanted good luck, have fun, dont take an arrow to the knee lol, and plz tell me how I did thanks

             Ive never found a better weapon ingame (including Oblivion) than I make myself.
            </p>
            <p>
             I went the path Allanon and others recommend; put the early grind into Smithing/Enchanting/Alchemy, made the dual Crafting [Alchemy &amp; Smithing] set, made some Enhanced Smithing [119%] and Enchanting [29%] potions, collected many soul gems and chose my Smithing and Enchanting perks so I can dual-enchant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, even stock game items like Valdrs Lucky Dagger [base dmg 9] can be smithed to crazy-and-back: I have that dagger doing 68dmg per hit, and its 25% chance of Critical Strike coupled with my one-handed Criticals perk gives me almost a 1-in-3 chance of a Critical (and it only weighs 2.5 lbs)
            </p>
            <p>
             My own preferred sword, Achmed, is a Curved Sword with 161 base damage, a 2-second soul trap, Fire enchantment of 5pts per hit (just for fun and cheap at that level)and at 10lbs, I can carry several of various configurations with the same weight-footprint as a greatsword or war hammer. You can see Achmed here (actually, since that shot Ive gotten a few perks and levels so Achmed is now doing 220+ dmg per hit). I have the perk to capture 5% of a soul to feed the blade and the small amount of fire damage means lots of charges; I havent had to use a soul gem to recharge it in a long time.
            </p>
            <p>
             I prefer daggers and fast swords, counting on the faster attack times; that coupled with bash-blocking usually gets me the first three strikes while enemies are stunned, and three strikes is all I need for most things. Maybe for fun I will see what kind of damage I could get on a Daedric War Hammer, although Id never use it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ive neglected Archery, preferring intimate face-to-face encounters, so my smithed Glass Bow of Harm only does 64 base damage; I really only use it to get chicken dragons to quit circling and frying wolves, bears and goats and pick on someone their own size or stop them from house-sitting
            </p>
            <p>
             I enjoyed putting in the time to do the smithing/enchanting/alchemy path. Each one of those Iron Daggers I made, then enchanted (no matter how weakly) gained me good gold, allowing me to buy more soul gems and ingredients to raise skills further
            </p>
            <p>
             I wanted to see just how insane the Smithing/Alchemy/Enchanting chain would let you make stuff. I also figured that looking for random buff weapons in the game could take almost as much time as sitting down to the grind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ive never been completely happy with any stock game weapon no matter what its enchantments as a match to my style of play. For lower levels, sure; but Id rather spend the soul gems on increasing Enchanting than using them to keep recharging a stock Enchanted Weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can see a sample of the rest of my my enchanted gear here at level 48.

             I have a skyfroged steel sword from joining the companions, i smithed it to make it superior and now it has 28damage and 10weight which is pretty beast especially if you upgrade all your one-handed perks on the skills menu

             I make my own weapons and armor. And i have to say that i have not noticed a difference in the ebony and daedric weapons except that the daedric ones are heavier and require the daedric hearts which seem to be quite rare.
            </p>
            <p>
             so basically, a tip to those who cant find daedric hearts, make ebony weapons.

             Free Daedra heart, easiest in all of skyrim!!! Near the base of Bleak Falls Barrow there is a small cabin belonging to the mage Anise, Shes the only on there and an easy opponent for even a level 1, kill her and loot her house, you may find a daedra heart in the basement or main room.

             Everybody, its obvious daggers are the best weapons, not only can you kill humanoids with one hit with assassinations, but if you have the right dagger and a high sneak level, they can be almost as deadly still. I used all the armour for smithing, potions, enhancements etc. my Legendary ebony daggers now do 724 damage or so each. No glitch. Just pure skill. This is possible with any wep. Im also running round with a buff iron dagger.
             <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn2.gamefront.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>
             Sneak attack with either one or two is over 14,000 damage. But only if you have high enough sneak to have the 15x attack perk. i also suggest you trade in for the bow perk for 3x damage also. Very useful.

             Right now I use a combination. I have a twin set of Elven Daggers, one steak magikca one steal health. The other combo Im using is dual Ebony Swords, both fully upgraded and enchanted to steal health and stamina. With the two sets, you can mix and match to any situation. To cap it all off, using Daggers in the dungeons is EXTREMELY beneficial as you can sneak up on many sleeping drauger and take them out in one hit, if you cant search them, they can and will attack you. These are my two favs right now until i can get myself a set of Daedric daggers.

             To all the people complaining about no unique bow: its call the Cuda Bow. You have to kill Grampy The Mammoth to obtain it.

             Every single moron on here acts like this game is somehow difficult, its not, all you do is play a lot and eventually your character becomes nigh on unstoppable.

             I love to hear people say how they  1shot dragons and dragon priest lol Im lvl 81 finnaly and full alchemy ench and smithing, best armor 2 handed legend weapons at the damage cap. You Ned to put the game on master on trust me you wont 1 shot or 2 shot anything almost. But I started a new character anyway I find that skill in conjuration destruction far out damage crafted weapons. Also after the recent patch theres no 100% resistance to any elements anymore

             I agree with the above post . Exploiting crafting makes the game no fun and on master enemies health tripples as well as damage definitely the hardcore gamers setting.No matter how high your crafting is legend weapons you have on master a melee character will get 1 shotted by a expert mage or dragon priest if you dont play your cards right.

             You can also use Mehruness Razor on the grindstone to make it a very, very powerful dagger if your a dagger fighter.

             My scimitars can currently do 455 damage each with the right equipment, you need enchanting at 100 and if you do it right you can enchant 4 pcs eq up to 29% each for fortify enchanting and do the same for smithing, then you can also make a potion up to add an additional 32% on smithing.  Still dont know best weapon, but my scimitars do more damage then daedric fully legendary

             what about chillrend? if you wait until level 46 to pick it up it has a higher base damage than the daedric sword plus the enchant im pretty sure it deserves a place on that list

             Windshear is pretty awesome. Only as good as a Cutlass but it staggers any opponent every hit (including dragons) so basically no damage gets done to you

I have hide armor enchanted with health, hide boots with stamina, imperial guantlets with health regeneration, and a ring with one-handed. Im a complete newb, only on level 14

             ok, i got pretty bored with the thread. Im a level 81 with all skills at 100.
             <br/>
             two handed is really not that good. why? no spells, its slow and blocking isnt that good with it. Some of you are bragging about 2 handed swords that do 200 damage.
             <br/>
             I have a pair of daedric swords that do 350 base each.  One has frost and fire damage 50 and the other has shock 50 and paralyze 6 secs (dual enchanting thanks to 100 enchanting).
             <br/>
             I also have a daedric dagger that does close to 200. For stealth use that with ebony mail, Konahrik (final dragon priest mask), nightinggale boots shourded gauntlets. You become real difficult to see or hear and can do 30x200dmg. That will pretty much kill anything in the game on hardest in one hit.
             <br/>
             My Daedric bow does 400 base. Using steel arrows it will kill most people/creatures in 1 hit if sneaking.
             <br/>
             I have a 1500 armor rating using all daedric armor.
             <br/>
             To get this high you need 100 enchanting smithing and alchemy. you can make fortify smithing 130% potions if you have a high enough alchemy.
             <br/>
             You can make fortify enchanting 40% (if you have a high alchemy) which you can then use to fortify alchemy enchantments (35%) which can then be used to make stronger fortify enchanting potions that are slightly higher and so on and so forth. you could do this infinitely if you wanted to but i got tired of doing it.
             <br/>
             So ultimately, the best weapons are definitely daedric.

             i found you can purchase 2 daedra hearts for around 600 gold each Southeast of Windhelm, inside the Orcish Stronghold of Narzulbur. so if ur not strong enough to kill dremora this is a good start to make urself a good daedric weapon.

             Wuuthrad, Especially damaging to all mer,(lots of mer)If you get 2 handed to 100 then it does around base 87 dmg on 360, dont know how these other guys are gettin hundreds and thousands dmg,( thats bull) you can only get to level 81, get enchanting up and you can make Ysgramors weapon somethin for even Alduin to fear the pain of(even at high levels), youll dispatch the draugr deathlords like flies bandits will be dust before you, for dragon fire just enchant the armor to be resistant to fire and frost, train restoration or stock up on potions, then youre set. merc some fools! Never discredit the usefulness of lightning storm, master level destruction, wastes a dragon in midflight in seconds. dragons crashing their dead bodies into the ground is a preeeetttttyyyy sight

             I tend to prefer the elf sword found in dragonsreach. Its in the jarls quarters in one of the many locked boxes.  I used it for nearly the whole game. Its great.  Especially upgraded.  Great for anyone looking for a free sword that does some damage

             I only want to make good weapons for the fun of making them and selling them but I want some of the best weapons for melee on ground foes and on quests I use magic and bows with enchantments for dragons as well as shouts but thanks for putting down all us melee types we still like to have a good scrape once in awhile.

             I do lots of baking and cooking for my husband that is ohhh about 78 years old he works as a fishermen on Lake Victoria and we own a 12 by 12 shack right on the shoreline &lt;3 when hes gone fishing i throw on some comfy clothes and sit in my rocker and play skyrim. &lt;3 (grandma sure likes her hearts) I myself am 78 years old. Anyways when my husband is gone i play skyrim and all you suns a es that have ur heads stuck in ur crack that is probably hairy. You all need to focus on just playing the videar game and having yoursolf some good ol' fashioned FUN. Yaaa sureee your sex mobile sword that uses 1 handed perks can 1 hit a dragon on its periodwho gives a rats behimen. I use a broom stick and a shovel and still have as much fun taking down a stray fox. So play some skyrim when you get off your jobs or get home from school and just have some nice fun. Grandma Loves ya! God Bless and tiggle biddies to all!

             just a suggestion, if you get dragon or daedric armour with high levels in heavy armour and blocking it doesnt matter what weapon you have you can just look for weapons with good enchants, my character has top spec dragon armour with shield, and i change my weapon between the nightingale blade and the Mace of Molag Bal, my shield has 50% magic resist, with this spec i havent died in skyrim in a long time, even when i put the difficulty up after the main quests.

             If you are level 56 like me youll find some dragons weapons they are really hard to find they have an attack of 87 (one handed) and I a have only 45 in skill one handed !!! Good luck or you need 70 dragon bones and scales to create one ( 100 skill of enchanting and smithing) soooo good luck

             I go around skyrim using weapons and armours I find, which is Dawnbreaker, steel armour and ice spike/summon dremora, but just for those difficult areas I have a set of glass/daedric armour mix with a soul trap and magicka draining, and the armour has fortify one handed and sneaking on it. That is how skyrim is made to be played

             If you want to get the headsmens axe( a giant axe used by executioners) you have to kill ahtam who is housed in the castle dour dungeon in solitude. or if it is ur first time going to solitude, you can kill ahtam right after the public execution.
            </p>
            <p>
             The axe isn not the good and has no enchantments, its good for keeping enemies back because it is so big( also it is very fun to go on a killing spree with!)

             You can add a 5th piece of armor using a circlet and falmer helmet that when enchanted to the max in alchemy lets you make enchantment and smithing potions even greater than previous. I got enchanting potions to 37%.  The most smithing and alchemy enchantment is 29% but you can still improve armor and weapons more than what was thought.

             The armor cap is 567, it can go higher, but anything higher than that sadly does not help any more. Unless you have enchantments like protect from shock, magic, fire, etc. the armor wont be any better. After 567, the only difference between two armor sets would be the weight. Just letting you guys know.

             All of the Blade of Woe stuff mentioned earlier, and with Dark Brotherhood gloves (or Ciceros gloves or Clowns gloves) you can do 30X sneak damage which is slightly insane.

             Coupled with high sneak and invisible to make yourself undetectable, you are now invincible.

             Ive read through most of these posts and I have learned a lot but everyone has failed to find the absolute best weapon in the game  WINDSHEAR  A one handed sword that knocks back your enemy.  Just stand there and keep swinging.  While it does not come with a tremendous amount of damage, it really does not matter because like I said, it knocks em back!  You can find it on the ship where you kill the Emperor.  I will give you a clue  you have to climb.  Good luck and kill em all!

             If you are having troybles leveling or are not leveling up fast enough try focusing on
             <br/>
             two too four areas at first like what i did i focused on light armor sneak and archery
             <br/>
             with sneak i managed to get the perk that allows daggers to have fifteen times damge sneak attack with archery i was able to kill harder enemies when i was stil early in the game
             <br/>
             with almost no effort and would level up quicker and with light armor it really had no affect it is just easier to sneak in than heavy armor when your sneak is low but doing this allowed
             <br/>
             me to level up quickly and i still have not finnished the main story line yet so yeah have fun

             I have a special weapon saved up, it is so deadly that it can kill most things in one hit. Im talking about poisen, specifically made with jarren root, human heart and nirnroot at lvl 100 alch it makes a potion that does over 2500 poisen damage and it damages magicka by 50+ points. Ive got this applied to my fully upgraded legendary deidric dagger that is also enchanted with 50 fire and 50 frost damage. If you facter in the backstab perk this should 1 hit anything. + I get 2 tries at using it because of a perk and dualwield it with another identical deadric dagger.

             how about taking your smithing skill to 100 then find some materials for daedric weapons drink blacksmith potions until youre drunk go to the forge and make a nasty daedric warhammer then drink more blacksmith potions (as much as u can ) and improve the daedric warhammer to LEGENDARY it sure have a 400+ damage without an enchantment .
             <br/>
             takes down every one with just  1 hit . you can also improve it by taking your 2 handed skill to 100 and pick relevant perks SIMPLE

             Breton + Lord stone + Agent of Mara(Riften temple) + Max magic resistance perk = 95% magic resist.
             <br/>
             Max upgraded Daedric armour and shield means your armour will overtake the reduction the game can provide and the shield means you stagger less and two handed enemies are nuetralised.
             <br/>
             Add a max level upgraded Daedric mace with no enchantment + poison + Elemental Fury and you maximise your damage output.
             <br/>
             Alternatively enchant said mace and use Slow Time (these are shouts).
             <br/>
             You now have max armour, max resist, max damage and max defence within this particular builds allowance, in other words a tank with maximised damage output.
             <br/>
             all other arguements become moot when you can stand in front of a Lich, stop playing, smoke a cigarette and talk to your mate whilst not looking at the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh yes and if you use Stoneflesh then this build requires minimal perks to be effective.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope you enjoy this build.

             High elf + max Illusion tree + follower (southwest of riften in a tower if memory serves, forget the name) + max Attronach/Zombie tree + Dead thrall (high level Conjuration spell) makes for a VERY interesting build, infighting enemies + 3 summons + a follower with her own Attronach is like controlling an army.
            </p>
            <p>
             oh and i missed JZhargo off the Breton build list, he maximises the damage possible.

             Hey, these weapons are great and all, but u should get a modded wep. Id suggest the frostmourne mod, because if you make it just right, you can enchant it to do over 1,000,000 damage!!! OMG!! the enchant is of frost damage btw

             Honestly, you said ones that any idiot knows and forgot the weapons that are better that noone knows about.
             <br/>
             Chillrend is the hands-down BEST ONE HANDED SWORD IN THE GAME. Its proven. It has the highest possible base damage and a very strong Frost enchantment that does the damage to health and stamina as well as parylise the opponent.
             <br/>
             The Nightingale Sword and Bow are insanely powerful, nuff said.
             <br/>
             You mentioned all these Daedric Artifacts but didnt bother with Vollendrung? It drains opponents stamina, which means you can power attack until the enchantment goes out. It is a two-handed hammer with the swingspeed of a greatsword.

             The best weapon, by far, is the (ignore the name please.) Dagger of Crap on top of Whiteruns main gate.

             Use Telekinesis to grab it off wall

             533 base damage, oh dont believe me? Its on youtube and even if you STILL think its not real, check out comments of skyrim players.

             2 one handed deadric daggers 81 dmg per dagger 162 dmg without enchantments for both= a kickass time on master, if your looking to play the game the way it was susposed to be played I recommend these with the ebony mail armor, brotherhood boots, brotherhood shroud, gauntlets of your choice with unrelenting force shout. if you can use the double enchantment perk use the 6-10 second kill soul gem fill + 10-20 points of fire dmg + extra dmg when enemys on fire.    Really makes for a good time espeacily if your not just trying to rumble through this game like most of the idiots in the world, AND one more thing. After you defeat Aldvin do not get upset when there isnt a party thrown for you, sit back complete some quest and enjoy the game or give it to someone who would, a game like this does not deserve all the hyped up hatred its recieving because someone is not being praised for completing 20% of the total missions in 2 1/2  3 hrs. Thanks and happying SKRIMMING!!!

             Personally, self made weapons are the best ones. Im pretty much a one-man army. I made a soul trapping Daedric Bow and named it Soul Catcher. My armor is daedric as well, all enchanted and named. Helmet: Eyes of the Hunter(Increase Bow damage 48%), Gauntlets: Dark Archers Gauntlet (Same enchantment as helmet), Boots: Creeping Death(muffled and silent) and for the torso I have Ebony Mail(Daedric quest armor and AWESOME!!!). Finally, I also carry enchanted jewelry (Ring and Necklace) which increase my bow damage by 48% each). How did I get the stats that high? KEEP ANY ENCHANTERS POTION YOU FIND!!! Why soul catching? I carry Wabbajack and Sanguine Rose along with Arch Mages robes and  2 Dragon Priest masks for mages along with Destruction cost reducing jewlry. I can switch between Mage and Archer at anytime. Depends on my mood. It sounds like alot but its really not very heavy, especially since I have the perk where Heavy Armor weighs nothing while wearing it.

             the blade of woes enchantment does not increase with level, but unlike any other weapon, you need no items to improve this just blacksmith skill, with 100 blade and blacksmith you can easily get this to 90 some damage, if you increase your blacksmith with enchantments by another 100% and drink a blacksmiths ELIXIR(50% increase) i got mine to 120 damage, not bad for a dagger. oh and the dragons bane does 40 plus damage to dragons not 25

             Babette the 200 year old child in the dark brotherhood has one for sale that respawns everyday I think. Not quite sure how long it takes to respawn but its not long and she has one for sale at a time for 750 coins.

             the windshear is the best because its enchantment, knocking someone back, doesnt work on just some hits but on every hit. I killed an Ancient Dragon barely taking any damage with the thing.

             This is a very impressive list of weapons. The cool part about finding wuuthrad is that you have to become a member of  the circle, (a group of awesome companions) then you become a lycan. (werewolf) go to some random city and go CRAZY with this new power. But save first, because werewolves spotted means

             1000 bounty plus 1000 for every person you kill. I killed Ulfric stormcloak. (or at least put him down temporarily)

             These are all good weapons but they missed the ebony blade. The ebony blade is a two-handed weapon the is strengthened by killing innocent people. Its found from a quest in Whiterun (Talk to the in keeper she may not have it at first).

             there is also the Kahvozeins Fang, Skull of Corruption, Chillrend, and Trollsbane. My opinion on the daedric weapons: I have to daedric war axes (dual wield) and they are enchanted. I found a glitch where i was able to upgrade my war axes to exquisite without the daedric weapon perk. I enchanted my weapons and bought the upgrade enchanted weapons perk. Hope this Helps.

             Im lvl 6 now, but when I was lvl 3, I dual-casted frostbite (lvl 1 destruction ice spell) with the dual-cast perk to spam a giant. Ended up with LOTS of stuff that I shouldnt get at my lvl xD was fun! How it worked: Ice magic slows targets, giant didnt hit me once.
             <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn2.gamefront.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif"/>

             <img alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn2.gamefront.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif"/>
             Now I carry a (fine) steel sword to kill those annoying ward-using fails! &gt;:/ I killed the dragon above Krosis, but was too scared to try attacking Krosis. xD Used Ice Spike (btw, bought all my spells from Farengar) and the sword to destroy it. Killed 3 giants so far. (still lvl 6) (all by using Frostbite) Also, try shooting Ice Spike at an elk running directly away from youLOL! (You will see) Killed a bunch of bandits all over Skyrim.. Stole gold, joined the College of Winterhold, brewed potions that Im never gonna use, planning to visit the greybeards..

             Theres a scimitar (one-handed) that you can find stuck in the prow of the Emperors ship (this ship only appears during the Dark Brotherhood questline) called Windshear. It doesnt do huge amount of damage, but it causes enemies to stagger with every hit. Its not great against multiple enemies, but if youre fighting a single enemy that can do tons of damage, theres no doubt that its the best sword in the game. Your enemy doesnt even have the chance to fight back.

             The best weapons are the ones you make because you can upgrade them twice as much. Also if you enchant a few sets of armor with fortify smithing and do the glitch to wear multiple sets of armor at once and then upgraded your weapon you could get weapons to their maximum damage if they have one.
             <br/>
             It would take a while but to one-hit a legendary dragon, I think its worth it.

             The best bow for me is the nightingale bow but i didnt upgrade the glass bow yet (100 blacksmith) but a bow is great to have because you can shoot a dragon just right and it will crash into the ground.

             There is a unique bow for archery-focused players to get, you get it in the Thieves Guild Questline: The Nightingale Bow. However, the thing about Skyrim is that you are in reality, meant to create your own unique weapons with enchanting. I find it rather dull, personally, because I prefer having named weaponry, but hey, you live with what you get. I would probably add the Rueful Axe to this list, which does a nice stamina drain on hit. Really useful against dragons if you didnt do the main questline and dont have Dragonrend Shout. (Because stamina = Dragon flight) and not to mention its very useful against Trolls and the like. Theres a two-handed hammer named the Longhammer which is also very useful; it has a fast attack speed making it actually very handy when facing any enemy (I believe it has the same attack speed as a one-handed axe or sword)

             There are 2 powerful bows, the Nightingale Bow given to you in the later part of thieves guild quest and Auriels Bow, aquired by completing the Dawngaurd main quests, this bow allows you to 1: use special arrows that exploded with light on contact of any surface. 2: use special arrows that blot out the sun when shot from Auriels bow. There is one other unique bow aquired on the Dragonborn DLC a Black Dwarven bow located in Dwemer ruins just below Meiracs temple, in these ruins you can also gain 2 Dwemer robot companions.

             I have found a differnent weapon to be extremely useful. It is known as WindShear.  It is a weapon that has a chance of knocking down your opponent, but it is also a weapon that can have another enchantment applied onto it. I have used it to win a fight against draugr death lords, as well as many types of dragons. It is definitely useful.

             These collections could serve as memorabilia and are also employed to match up with the trend
             <br/>
             statements they have. These radiations may cause either short-term
             <br/>
             or long-term ocular complications like snow blindness, photokeratitis, cataracts, pterygium and even cancer of the
             <br/>
             eye. The Gucci sunglasses are manufactured to meet this requirement and are always labeled as UV400; an indication that they
             <br/>
             block ultraviolet rays of that wavelength.
