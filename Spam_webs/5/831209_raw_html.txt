       "I am." is the shortest
complete sentence in the English language.
       <blockquote>
        <i>
         NOTE:  I've received a lot of emails from people stating that the shortest sentence is "Go." and not "I am"
The fun fact above states that the shortest
         <b>
          "complete"
         </b>
         sentence is "I am." 
While it's true that the term "complete sentence" can be debated, my interpretation is 
that it means there is both an explicit subject and an action. (Noun, Verb)
        </i>
        <p>
         While "Go." can be considered a complete sentence, the subject is dependent on previously described context.  
Without the proper context, the subject of the sentence is ambiguous.  For instance, the subject of the 
sentence "Go." could be a group of people or one person or a pet, etc.  One would need to know the 
surrounding context before the sentence "Go." could be considered complete.  Are we splitting hairs here?  
Probably, but it's all in good fun. :-) Opey

       The term "the whole 9 yards"
came from WWII fighter pilots in the South Pacific. When arming their airplanes
on the ground, the .50 caliber machine gun ammo belts measured exactly
27 feet, before being loaded into the fuselage. If the pilots fired all
their ammo at a target, it got "the whole 9 yards."

       Until 1965, driving was done on
the left-hand side on roads in Sweden. The conversion to right-hand was
done on a weekday at 5pm. All traffic stopped as people switched sides.
This time and day were chosen to prevent accidents where drivers would
have gotten up in the morning and been too sleepy to realize that *this*
was the day of the changeover.
