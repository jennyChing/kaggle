says Neil Gehrels, principal investigator at Nasa for the Swift mission. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a beam of gamma radiation that&rsquo;s flying through the Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if one of these cosmic death rays of high frequency electromagnetic waves hit the Earth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w94\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;For a planet 1000 light years away, it would destroy the ozone layer. If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black holes and revelations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time warp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasas cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

Her clients come to her with an issue, a question, a mystery, and she figures out the best way to find the answer &ndash; using whatever tools she can. &ldquo;I use a combination of new technology and old technology, because I have to solve a problem. So I&rsquo;ve used everything from geese and dogs to Roombas to drones to GPS.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright is a private investigator &ndash; and owner of the Wright Group &ndash; based in Anaheim, California. She&rsquo;s worked in the business for more than 40 years, and has seen the tools available to investigators change dramatically. Early on, stakeouts in vans were important. More recently new technology in the form of tiny cameras and social media has begun to play a role. And she&rsquo;s embraced those changes. Today, when the problem calls for it, she uses drones to do her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gives me a few examples. If two people are meeting in a public place, a drone can be a helpful way to discreetly watch them. &ldquo;We stay at about 50-75 feet [15-23 metres] above so nothing can be heard.&rdquo; Drones are also helpful for aerial surveillance of locations that are hard to access on foot. And if a school or church is worried someone might be stealing or vandalising property, drones or small off-road vehicles (&ldquo;Roombas on steroids&rdquo; as she calls them) can film the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yhk\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one case, Wright was asked to figure out whether or not a soda salesperson was crossing county lines and cheating on his contract. California is one of many states in which salespeople have regional contracts &ndash; for instance, Bob sells Pepsi in Los Angeles County and Nancy sells Pepsi in Orange County. If Nancy arrives at her usual businesses to sell her Pepsi and finds the soda supply has already been topped up, there&rsquo;s a good chance that someone (perhaps Bob) has crossed county lines and sold illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hi-tech toys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright was asked to figure out whether this was happening. To do so meant visiting every major soda wholesaler from San Luis Obispo to San Diego &ndash; about 300 miles (480km) of California coast &ndash; and checking whether any were selling soda from the wrong salesperson. When there was illegal soda on sale, she would use a drone to follow the soda delivery trucks back to their depots. In one case, the warehouse the truck led her back to was out in the desert and would have been impossible to approach by car or foot without being noticed. But the drone was able to spy on the trucks covertly. &ldquo;We could see between the warehouse door and the truck loading.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright gets her drones from high-end toy stores, for about $200 each. They&rsquo;re an expensive investment: not only do you have to buy the device, you also have to pay one or two people to pilot and spot the thing. And if you lose one during a mission, you&rsquo;re out a good chunk of your budget. But it can be worth it, because for the cases in which they&rsquo;re useful, they can be very useful indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7yh4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright doesn&rsquo;t pilot the drones herself. &ldquo;I try to hire gamers. I go to the colleges and high schools and I find out who the geeks are, and then I hire them.&rdquo; She said that her pilots are more skilled than she would ever be &ndash; and they like the challenge. Some of them are working towards their own private investigator licences, and their hours piloting the little devices can count as hours towards their certification. (None of Wright&rsquo;s gamer pilots were willing to talk for this article. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re introverts,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Not shy, but introverts.&rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, the idea of using drones to spy on people isn&rsquo;t something everybody is comfortable with. &lt;a href=\"http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2013/05/chs-x-files-capitol-hill-drone-pilot-spotted-glowing-orbs-phone-thief-on-wheels/\"&gt;In a case in Seattle&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, a woman reported that someone was using a drone to spy on her. &ldquo;This afternoon, a stranger set an aerial drone into flight over my yard and beside my house near Miller Playfield,&rdquo; she told the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog. &ldquo;I initially mistook its noisy buzzing for a weed-whacker on this warm spring day. After several minutes, I looked out my third-story window to see a drone hovering a few feet away.&rdquo; Her husband asked the drone operator, who was standing nearby, to move along &ndash; but the operator claimed to be acting within his legal rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tightening regulations&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Whether that&rsquo;s true isn&rsquo;t always clear. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/current-uas-state-law-landscape.aspx\"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures&lt;/a&gt;, 35 states considered adding drone bills to the books last year, and 10 states actually did add new laws. In Iowa, for example, it&rsquo;s now illegal for the state to use drones to enforce traffic laws. In North Carolina, no one can use a drone for surveillance of a person or private property. And Tennessee now specifies that it&rsquo;s a misdemeanour to use drones for surveillance of people who are hunting or fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&rsquo;s drone operations might soon become legally questionable too. Earlier this month, a California senator &lt;a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/calif-lawmakers-consider-drone-privacy-bill/31326004\"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would extend property rights into airspace, meaning that drones flying over private property would be considered trespassers. Just a few days before that, President Obama and the Federal Aviation Administration &lt;a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2015/02/15/a-brief-summary-of-the-faas-new-drone-regulations/\"&gt;announced new drone regulations&lt;/a&gt; as well, requiring &ndash; among other things &ndash; that drones must be under 55lb (25kg) and that operators must keep the flying vehicles in sight at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02m7xlr\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the laws are murky, many private investigators steer clear of drones. &ldquo;The use of drones for surveillance is highly restricted by law,&rdquo; said Kelly Riddle, a private investigator in Texas. &ldquo;There are air space regulations as well as privacy laws that can easily be violated. Obtaining video using a drone has thus far been something that we have been advised is illegal.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s because drones are often used to observe activities that can&rsquo;t be seen via a direct line of sight at ground level. Going out of your way to spy on such activities is considered an invasion of privacy, says Riddle. A lot of Wright&rsquo;s work sidesteps this privacy question, because it involves helping schools and churches monitor their own property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all likelihood, the use of drones will be restricted under a more comprehensive set of rules and regulations in the United States sooner than later. But in the meantime Wright will continue to use them when they can help with her work. But she also says that regardless of the legality, if someone thinks their privacy is being compromised, they&rsquo;re going to do something about it. That can mean shooting down drones &ndash; another activity that &lt;a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/article/technology/man-shoots-down-drone-lawyers-scratch-their-heads\"&gt;may or may not be legal&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;I think a lot of my colleagues have lost them and realised that it is a tool, and if you invade someone&rsquo;s privacy, well, if they can hit it they will.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-18T11:27:45Z","HeadlineLong":"The private investigator who spies using drones","HeadlineShort":"I use a drone to spy on people","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Aerial vehicles are the latest tool for private detectives  but for how long?

The pair have been friends since childhood. Within the first year of their friendship, nerve damage inflicted by an inherited genetic condition robbed Haug of his sight and hearing. He was nine. But children are natural innovators. &ldquo;We started to invent languages and forms of communication just because we were kids and we wanted to play,&rdquo; says Schwengber. &ldquo;It was annoying that he couldn't hear me, and I couldn't write something down,&rdquo; she says. So the two invented their own tactile language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Haug and Schwengber grew older, they replaced their private language with one that is more widely understood: Lorm, a tactile alphabet spelled out with strokes to the hand. It was invented in the nineteenth century by Hieronymus Lorm &ndash; an anonymous pseudonym, for Austrian-born poet, journalist, and novelist &lt;a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12762.html\"&gt;Heinrich Landesmann&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; and is still used today by the deaf-blind community in German-speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv0k9\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the importance of Lorm to Haug and Schwengber. But Lorm, and other forms of tactile signing, have their limits. A reliance on physical contact between communicators has historically constrained the social circles of the deaf-blind to those they can meet face-to-face (or more accurately hand-to-hand) on a regular basis &ndash; and even within this relatively small group of people, only those who take the time to learn and practice Lorm can really become part of a deaf-blind individual&rsquo;s social network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Haug&rsquo;s social circle currently consists of about five people: his mother, Schwengber, teachers, and therapists. Once a year he spends about 10 days visiting relatives in Stuttgart in Southern Germany. &ldquo;The first five days they need to practice Lorming, so they can remember the letters, and by the tenth day when they are quite fast, it's time to go back home,&rdquo; explains Schwengber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these drawbacks might soon disappear, if a new invention by Tom Bieling is commercialised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactile translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling, a researcher at the Design Lab in Berlin, has developed a &lt;a href=\"http://www.design-research-lab.org/projects/mobile-lorm-glove/\"&gt;glove kitted out with fabric pressure-sensors&lt;/a&gt;. By translating a tactile hand touch alphabet into digital text, the mobile glove could eliminate the necessity of hand-to-hand physical contact for deaf-blind communication. Even better, because a great deal of online communication is text-based, the glove could act as a translating device that allows people who are deaf-blind to communicate freely with anyone &ndash; and for anyone to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an invention reminiscent of the outlandish gadgets seen in James Bond movies, and it won Bieling first prize in the 2014 Falling Walls Lab competition &ndash; a kind of TED Talks meets Dragon&rsquo;s Den &ndash; held annually in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1kq\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first prototype was made from Gore-Tex fabric and felt much like an ordinary glove, Bieling explains. It&rsquo;s embedded with small vibrating motors, and &ldquo;as soon as you receive an incoming message, it starts vibrating on those dots where the letters are positioned&rdquo;, he says. In the current version, users can adjust the intensity and speed of the incoming tactile messages according to their reading skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&rsquo;s more, the whole hand area of the glove is now wired for sensory input, &ldquo;just like a tablet [computer]&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;The system recognises both the position and pattern of the finger movement.&rdquo; So users can also spell out their own messages.If a sign isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;typed&rdquo; quite correctly, the Lorm glove system recognises the closest symbol &ndash; just like a spell checker on your smart phone. For example, a circle in the hand would be an &lsquo;S&rsquo;, explains Bieling, and even if you type a triangle or a square, the system is clever enough to recognise the letter &lsquo;S&rsquo; as the closest correct symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enhancing independence&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking through Schwengber&rsquo;s translation, Haug describes the glove prototype as a bit slower than what he is used to in terms of receiving messages. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his teacher or his mother Lorming,&rdquo; says Schwengber, compared with her own speedy pace. &ldquo;But he really likes it,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the glove, &ldquo;I can send and receive &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; says Haug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieling&rsquo;s project is part of his doctoral studies exploring links between design and ability. He argues that feeling disabled is a question of design &ndash; a ramp, for instance, is easy for anyone to ascend, even if they are in a wheelchair. He hopes that his design will enable deaf-blind people to engage with a broader spectrum of their community and &ldquo;gain access to a broader range of information, thus enhancing their independence&rdquo;. But he also hopes that gaining knowledge about alternative communication systems can profit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lv1wv\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haug, now 22, currently lives with his mother in Spreewald, about 100km south of Berlin. He is studying massage therapy in the hopes of pursuing it as a profession. He would like to move to Berlin, explains Schwengber, but it&rsquo;s a possibility that has thus far eluded him because of the lack of assistance available. The glove could expand Haug&rsquo;s ability to stay in close touch with those closest to him while living at a distance. But it could do more than that: it could allow him to expand his currently small social circle dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World in your hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Haug, with help from Schwengber, has been having fun on Twitter, a medium enabling him to converse with people who need never know that he is deaf-blind. On social media, Haug is &ldquo;just a person behind the Twitter account saying something&rdquo;, explains Schwengber. Haug describes it as a bit like playing carnival, because &ldquo;you just mask up and say anything you want&rdquo;, translates Schwengber. &ldquo;Content matters, not the person,&rdquo; she explains. So Haug gets a kick out of the reaction from followers when he Tweets amusing things, something he&rsquo;d be able to do more easily and independently with his own Lorm glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the first thing he would say with a Lorm glove of his own, Haug says he would talk to his cousin in Stuttgart and ask him if he can remember the name of an interesting film they recently spoke about. (Schwengber and Haug often go to the cinema &ndash; where Schwengber simultaneously translates the movie for Haug via Lorm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us take for granted the digital revolution and the amazing new connections it has offered. For those constrained by a barrier of unseen sights and unheard sounds, it was once unexplored territory &ndash; but with the Lorm glove, they might just have that world in the palm of their hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-13T09:29:01Z","HeadlineLong":"The glove that transmits touch over the internet","HeadlineShort":"The glove turning touch into talk","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Blind-deaf people are often forced to live in a small and isolated world.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at &lt;a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\"&gt;TED2015 in Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\"&gt;handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with&lt;a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"&gt; bodily motion and visualisation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like &lt;a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\"&gt;accent and articulation&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious giggles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\"&gt;to open up about personal information&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; paving more common ground between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\"&gt;laughter correlates with increased pain threshold&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be &lt;a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\"&gt;asking visitors of different ages to judge&lt;/a&gt; the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a &lt;a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\"&gt;charity gig&lt;/a&gt; the following evening, she is very funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Share this story on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google+&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

Nor does he read tea leaves, the lines on your hand or claim to speak to people &ldquo;from the other side&rdquo;. Yet, the research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) claims he can predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the ongoing Republican nomination race. Late last year, Newt Gingrich was surging in the polls and some pundits thought he may well overtake frontrunner Mitt Romney. But Gloor predicted he would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was true that chatter on Twitter seemed to be giving an edge to the former House speaker, but analysing edits to Wikipedia, Gloor predicted that Romney would beat him. Gloor ended up being right: &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16633750\"&gt;Romney beat Gingrich by a wide margin on the night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you could argue his prediction was just a fluke. But Gloor says his forecasts have worked time and again. In some cases, his analysis can even help predict electoral results where polls fail. For example, in 2009 Switzerland voted to bar the construction of new minarets on mosques. The polls wrongly indicated that people would reject the measure, while &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8386456.stm\"&gt;Gloor&rsquo;s analysis, based on an analysis of social media, correctly predicted it would pass&lt;/a&gt;. &ldquo;People lied to the pollsters, because they didn&rsquo;t want to appear racist,&rdquo; says Gloor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research is part of a growing body of scientific work, often called predictive analytics, which involves using software and computer algorithms to mine emails, social media and other public websites to help make predictions about the future. It is a field that has caught the attention of everyone from movie moguls, who want help identifying which films will be popular, to captains of industry, who want advance information on which stocks are winners. And for those interested in politics, it is being used to forecast who will win in upcoming elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Enter the Swarm&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of mining publicly-available data to help predict the future is nothing new, but past efforts focused primarily on the news media. In the run-up to World War II, the US and British governments monitored world media to help predict the course of hostilities, and during the Cold War, the US government sponsored academics to come up with mathematical models that would analyse media reports to help predict the actions of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, however, the advent of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a real-time flood of news about the world. &lt;a href=\"http://www.kalevleetaru.com/\"&gt;Kalev Leetaru&lt;/a&gt;, a computer scientist at the University of Illinois, describes social media as something akin to &ldquo;a gateway for humanity&rdquo; because of the sheer abundance of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There are three billion items posted to Facebook every day and 200 million tweets,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One of my favourite figures is that right now, every day, there are more words posted to Twitter than were in the New York Times over the last 60 years.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick is in understanding what that data means, and which data is important for what topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Gloor says that Twitter is very good for predicting behaviour that is influenced by the crowd &ndash; the general public. When it comes to seeing a new film, for example, people are heavily influenced by what the crowd seems to say: is it a good or bad movie?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a finding that has been put to the test by computer scientist Hsinchun Chen at the University of Arizona. Chen and his group have looked at data from hundreds of Hollywood movies and have attempted to correlate ticket sales with online data generated by social media users. The model worked &ldquo;beautifully&rdquo;, suggests Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lab&rsquo;s models also correctly predicted that &lt;a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321860/\"&gt;the 2011 Mel Gibson movie The Beaver&lt;/a&gt;, about a man who speaks through a hand puppet, would bomb; so too would &lt;a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396218/\"&gt;Jim Carey&rsquo;s Mr. Popper&rsquo;s Penguins&lt;/a&gt;. Neither received much pickup on social media, according to Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesson learned from looking at social media data and movies is that it does not matter who the star is, how much you spend on the movie, or even how good the movie is: what matters is what people are saying about it online. &ldquo;The movie industry is buzz,&rdquo; Chen suggests. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not content.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst this crowd approach works nicely for films, it starts to break down when applied to political events. Instead, researchers have to look for different types of data. This is where the &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; comes in, says Gloor. The swarm is a group of more neutral experts, such as those who regularly edit Wikipedia. &ldquo;There are lots of Wikipedians, but just two or three thousand do most of the work,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We track those, how well respected they are, who&rsquo;s editing what.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Republican primaries, Gloor&rsquo;s analysis in December noted that even though the masses on Twitter seemed to indicate a Gingrich victory, the swarm on Wikipedia was pointing to Romney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future clues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those working in predictive analytics acknowledge that the wealth of information provided by social media is important, they are circumspect about its ability to be applied to all areas. Some events cannot be predicted well using social media, namely those which people simply don&rsquo;t talk about online. &ldquo;We probably cannot find any crimes,&rdquo; says Gloor. &ldquo;They will not be discussed in public.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leetaru is even more wary of overly relying on social media to make predictions, arguing that in many cases even seemingly public events, like protests, have a hidden side to them. &ldquo;If you look at &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14452097\"&gt;the UK riots&lt;/a&gt; [in 2011], the first thing everyone said was [look at] Facebook and Twitter. But when they checked further, they realised that actually the rioters were using encrypted peer-to-peer Blackberry messages.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Leetaru is also involved in forecasting social and political events, his current work focuses more on culling information from traditional media, including a retroactive analysis of news reports, which he said located Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s hideout within a radius of 125 miles (200km).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media, while providing a wealth of data, does not necessarily provide first-hand information, or better information. &ldquo;All the work that is coming out seems to suggest that social media is more of a sounding box,&rdquo; says Leetaru. &ldquo;Something happens and social media reports on it.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, in looking at Kenyan election violence several years ago, Leetaru suggests that most of the social media messages coming out of the country were not necessarily first-hand reports about what people personally saw, but rather people retweeting or rebroadcasting news media reports. &ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t that they were reporting that they saw a tank heading down the street, they were basically using it almost as a real-time bulletin board,&rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many of these more complex cases, researchers are combining social media with news reports and other public data to help hone their forecasts. For example, Swedish-American firm Recorded Future, now based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, trawls hundreds of thousands of pieces of data, from government filings to social media, hunting for clues to the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=\"http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-03-07/tech/29999286_1_intelligence-agencies-business-insider-spotfire\"&gt;Christopher Ahlberg, the CEO of the firm&lt;/a&gt;, the company&rsquo;s proprietary software grew out of a decade of previous work on large datasets. He and his coworkers grew interested in looking at ways to organise data in a time-based manner, allowing people to do Google-like searches on future events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Media is full of these facts about the future,&rdquo; suggests Ahlberg. &ldquo;So, what we asked ourselves is could we build a machine &ndash; we used to jokingly call it a DVR for everything spoken and written about the future &ndash; and organise that data meticulously into a dataset, and set it up as a cool user experience?&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did just that, and today, Recorded Future&rsquo;s software is being used by private customers and government clients interested in data-mining the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example of how Recorded Future&rsquo;s technology could be used, according to Ahlberg, might be someone following pharmaceutical stocks. The user clicks on a specific date, and Recorded Future shows all of the data mined from public information about things that are supposed to take place on that date, such as a review by the US Food and Drug Administration, the release of a new drug, or the expiration of a drug patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this information can hold vital clues for those in the know. And it could be a step towards predictive analytics&rsquo; ultimate prize: picking winning stocks. But Ahlberg and other researchers know this is a long way off. &ldquo;Sometimes I find people want magic predictions,&rdquo; Ahlberg says. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t reflect reality.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information overload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others agree this is still a tricky area. Gloor, who has used his models to try to outsmart the markets, has so far had only limited success. However, the work has thrown up at least one intriguing result: the models work best with alternative energy stocks. &ldquo;There we have the tree-huggers, and tree-huggers are honest,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They talk about new developments that correspond to alternative energy.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen also concedes that financial markets are harder to predict than movies. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to predict a stock return: You can predict the movement, volume and volatility,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The return is still the Holy Grail.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if such analysis cannot always make precise forecasts, its potential for forecasting trends and events has increasingly attracted interest from the US government. Recorded Future, whose technology can also mine social media to forecast political protests, such as &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15732661\"&gt;Occupy Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;, or track criminal activity, such as cyber attacks, has already attracted interest from the national security community. &lt;a href=\"http://www.iqt.org/\"&gt;In-Q-Tel, the venture capital firm founded by the CIA&lt;/a&gt;, has invested in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the intelligence community&rsquo;s interest in predictive modelling, particularly based on social media, has been growing over the past few years, especially in light of &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12813859\"&gt;the Arab spring protests&lt;/a&gt;, which were at least partly fuelled by social media. Last year, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.iarpa.gov/index.html\"&gt;Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (Iarpa)&lt;/a&gt;, a research and development arm of the US intelligence community, launched a project called Open Source Indicators, designed to mine information from social media and other public data and to come up with predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon has also launched a number of forecasting projects in recent years, hoping, for example, to predict insurgent behaviour. &lt;a href=\"http://www.mitre.org/about/technical_centers/itc/about/staff/bio_maybury.html\"&gt;Mark Maybury, the US Air Force chief scientist&lt;/a&gt;, likens this sort of human-data collection &ndash; whether from social media, foreign news, or elsewhere &ndash; as something akin to the images collected by drones flying over Afghanistan. Only instead of information about bombs, it is collecting information about how people behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;At the strategic national level, you&rsquo;d like to do things like predict state failure,&rdquo; said Maybury of the modelling work the Air Force is doing. &ldquo;More tactically, you&rsquo;d like to be able to do things like discover illicit shipping routes, human trafficking routes, and narcotics routes.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet one question that is only just starting to be discussed is whether the public is aware that their tweets, their Facebook posts and their Wikipedia edits are being sucked up by academics, private companies, the Pentagon, and even the CIA. In the modern world, people often do not think twice about tweeting their dinner plans, broadcasting their political opinion, or posting updates about a street protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who avoid Twitter or Facebook may be contributing information in ways they didn&rsquo;t realise: a product review on Amazon, a comment on a news site or even something a simple as a search on their smart phone can all be collected and analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;People have become jaded to the information overload,&rdquo; says &lt;a href=\"http://www.cgu.edu/pages/5148.asp\"&gt;Mark Abdollahian&lt;/a&gt;, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate University, who also works with a private company that creates political forecasting models. And it is not just social media: Abdollahian points to &lt;a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/9620723.stm\"&gt;the latest iPhone&rsquo;s popular new Siri voice application&lt;/a&gt;, which sends data back to Apple, where it is analysed along with other user information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this data, whether from social media or smart phone searches, is being analysed by someone for some purpose, whether to predict a political protest, a stock price, or even just to figure out what restaurant you&rsquo;re trying to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Your queries go in there to make a better user experience. What do people do with the information?&rdquo; Abdollahian says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question we all need to ask.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-02-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Predicting the future: Forecasting the news of tomorrow","HeadlineShort":"Forecasting the news of tomorrow","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Want to know who will win the next US election, which films will bomb or which stocks will rise?

With a few taps on the screen, I can send a replica of Nasa&rsquo;s &lt;a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/msl\"&gt;Curiosity rover&lt;/a&gt; trundling - at a slow walking pace - across the rocky terrain of JPL&rsquo;s outdoor test area, known as Mars Yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find myself treating the experience like a video game: starting out cautiously with a few gentle turns, before commanding the car-sized rover to cross some sizable boulders. Mobility test engineer Daniel Fuller calls &lsquo;game over&rsquo; when I manage to ground one of the vehicle&rsquo;s six wheels on a particularly large lump of stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the real rover, some 200 million kilometers (125 million miles) away on the Red Planet, is in safer hands. And the way it&rsquo;s driven is rather different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a common misconception that we&rsquo;re just &lsquo;joysticking&rsquo; it or we&rsquo;re driving and sending these commands and we&rsquo;re suffering a 15 minute delay,&rdquo; says Fuller, who divides his time between the rover control room and Mars yard. &ldquo;We actually plan an entire day &ndash; or a sol as it&rsquo;s called on Mars.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these daily missions is overseen by people like &lt;a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.gupta\"&gt;Sanjeev Gupta from Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt;. When I meet him, the geologist and senior member of the JPL science team is living on Mars time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;During the Mars night we prepare the sequences the rover has to do,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Then we uplink those commands and, when the rover wakes up, it carries out those tasks. But a Mars day is 40 minutes longer than an Earth day so you get progressively out of synch, so the time I arrive at work changes by an hour every day.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&rsquo;s not all. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get a signal direct from the rover to Earth,&rdquo; says Gupta. &ldquo;It has to go through communications satellites - &lt;a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro\"&gt;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&lt;/a&gt; (MRO) and &lt;a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/odyssey\"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; - and these obviously have different times [when they&rsquo;re overhead].&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;Generally you&rsquo;re moving an hour forward each day but suddenly, like tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to step back two hours. I&rsquo;m progressively getting used to it but the first three weeks were awful,&rdquo; he groans, &ldquo;I was permanently exhausted.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Martian night, dozens of scientists, including Gupta, anaylse the images and data coming back from the Red Planet and discuss what they want to do next. They hold a series of meetings to prioritise time on the instruments, choose which images to capture and where the rover&rsquo;s going to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite complicated because you have to work out how much power each instrument is going to use and how much heating time they require,&rdquo; Gupta says. &ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re so many instruments, everybody wants to have a go &ndash; so one instrument might get five minutes, another ten minutes.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the arguments are had and decisions reached, the drivers get to work, coding the next day&rsquo;s instructions. And this is way more complicated than programming one of those &lsquo;80s-era Big Trak robot toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is the fourth rover (since the 1996 Pathfinder mission) Nasa has run on Mars in recent years, and the procedures have got better with every mission. Armed with 3D images from its navigation cameras, the drivers work through the Martian night to map out the best, smoothest, route to the next destination. They factor in any stops along the way, to take pictures or operate an instrument, and run a simulation of the journey to double-check they have got it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is that when a new day dawns on Mars, the drivers are ready to go. Once either the Odyssey or MRO satellite is in the right place, they send a command to wake up the rover and upload its commands for the day. A bit like emailing a &lsquo;to do&rsquo; list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta admits that the whole process is more time consuming than he first imagined. &ldquo;Things that I can do in an hour on Earth, take days on Mars. Usually on Earth I work by myself, here we&rsquo;ve got a team of 200 scientists so we have to work out these interactions and protocols.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once it&rsquo;s started moving, Curiosity also has the ability to think for itself using data from its hazard avoidance cameras and built-in safely protocols. This autonomy should prevent it grounding on a rock or falling over an unexpected cliff but also adds to the pressure on the drivers and scientists planning each sol&rsquo;s activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the rovers in Mars Yard come in handy. This dusty outdoor arena at the back of the lab is around the size of a couple of tennis courts. Strewn with boulders, mounds of sand and even a cliff face, it&rsquo;s home to two full-scale mock-ups of Curiosity. Although the real thing was tested extensively before launch, these rovers are still in use everyday by drivers trying to choreograph movement on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;We do have a pretty good idea how it&rsquo;s going to perform,&rdquo; Fuller confirms. &ldquo;But these give us a chance, in flight, to modify and fine tune and to get as much bang for our buck as possible.&rdquo; Specially, they allow engineers to test movements, software and work on any glitches that develop on the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first rover is an identical copy of Curiosity; it&rsquo;s even loaded with the exact same software. The second &ndash; and the one (for obvious reasons) they let me control &ndash; is not fitted with the same onboard computers, earning it the nickname Scarecrow, because it doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;brain&rdquo;. Although it&rsquo;s the same size as Curiosity, Scarecrow is lighter, to simulate the effects of moving around in the lower gravity of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarecrow is little more than an impressively large remote controlled car. Scroll the tumblers to set distance and angle of movement on the iPhone app, hit go and it reacts instantly, there&rsquo;s even a stop button if things start going awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the efforts of its drivers and the engineering team behind them, Curiosity has covered (at the time of writing) more than 300m (1,000ft), including a single push of 42m (138ft), its biggest roll to date since landing on Mars two months ago. Despite being millions of miles away, it&rsquo;s considerably further than I achieve before grounding Scarecrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most fun a reporter has ever had with our rover,&rdquo; says Fuller. I&rsquo;m not sure he is paying me a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Tales from the new space race.

For every successful Russian Mars 3 or American Viking 1, there&rsquo;s a failed Beagle 2 (UK) or Mars Polar Lander (US). In fact, of the 42 missions listed, only 17 have been successful. The odds, over the past half-century, of a Mars mission succeeding are around 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, several early missions didn&rsquo;t even make it off the launch pad and the chances of success have improved considerably over the decades. But you don&rsquo;t have to go back far to see failure. Only last year, Russia&rsquo;s Phobos-Grunt mission to the Martian moon Phobos &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15631472\"&gt;failed to make it out of Earth orbit&lt;/a&gt; (well, it did eventually when it burned up on re-entry). Perhaps the most infamous though is &lt;a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1998-073A\"&gt;Nasa&rsquo;s 1999 Mars Climate Orbiter&lt;/a&gt;, where a mix-up between imperial and metric measurements sent the spacecraft careering into the Martian atmosphere to be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 6 August (GMT) 2012 Nasa will try again with what is almost certainly the most ambitious and exciting Mars mission ever launched. The &lt;a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl\"&gt;Mars Science Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; (MSL) with the Curiosity rover is designed to investigate whether the planet ever had the conditions to support life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rover is essentially a robotic geologist, that will collect and analyse soil and rock samples as it trundles across the Martian surface. And it is big: around the size of a Mini Cooper or small SUV; at 900kg (almost a tonne), it&rsquo;s heavy and when hurtling towards the planet, it&rsquo;s travelling at some 5km/s (mps), roughly 18,000km/h (11,000mph).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here&rsquo;s the engineering challenge: successfully land a rapidly moving, car-sized rover on an alien planet. Remember to show your workings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When you have a big vehicle, it&rsquo;s actually very difficult to slow down,&rdquo; says Dan Rasky from Nasa Ames in Silicon Valley, California. Rasky, now the director of the Emerging Commercial Space Office, helped develop the MSL heat shield that will protect the spacecraft as it enters the Martian atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The major part of slowing down is being done with your heat shield,&rdquo; says Rasky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very tenuous atmosphere &ndash; similar to 100,000 feet [30,000 metres] here on Earth &ndash; but if you design things right, you can still slow things down enough that you can land safely.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Scary&rsquo; idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nasa engineers originally planned to employ the same material that was used to land the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/viking/%5d.\"&gt;Viking missions in 1975&lt;/a&gt;. But when they tested it in a special wind tunnel, equipped with high intensity heaters designed to simulate the conditions the MSL spacecraft will face, things didn&rsquo;t turn out as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;The material didn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Rasky tells me. &ldquo;The very high heat just burned through the heat shield which would have burned into the structure of the spacecraft. So you would have got to the surface in pieces.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the engineers turned to Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator, or PICA for short. Phenolic is the same material that we use for saucepan handles, a plastic that burns but doesn&rsquo;t melt. PICA was first used on &lt;a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html\"&gt;Nasa&rsquo;s Stardust mission&lt;/a&gt; and is also fitted to the &lt;a href=\"http://www.spacex.com/dragon.php/\"&gt;SpaceX Dragon Capsule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s part of it that gets burned away. The Phenolic burns to generate a pyrolysis gas, which turns out to be an important way that it absorbs the heat,&rdquo; Rasky explains. &ldquo;SpaceX intends to get multiple uses out of its heat shield, which you can do if you size it correctly.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the heat shield has done its job, the MSL spacecraft should have slowed to around 400m/s. With the rover still encased in the shell of the heat shield, the parachute deploys to slow the descent down even further. Parachutes have a proven track record on Mars &ndash; most recently with &lt;a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/main/index.html\"&gt;the Phoenix mission&lt;/a&gt;. But with MSL, the parachute is only the first stage in a much more complex landing process. This will be the first mission to use a &lsquo;sky crane&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;It looks scary but it actually eliminates a lot of the problems that previous designs had,&rdquo; says Nasa&rsquo;s Steve Sell, an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena who helped develop the concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, the sky crane looks unnecessarily complicated. Once released from its parachute and protective shell, the lander uses engines to slow the descent. At this stage, the MSL resembles a flying bedstead with the rover slung underneath. As this combination nears touchdown, the rover is lowered towards the surface on cables and its wheels unfurl. On contact, the cables are severed and the skycrane (bedstead) flies away and crashes and the rover starts work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent entry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask Sell how they ended up with something that&rsquo;s so complex. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re designing rover style missions in particular, you quickly run into a problem where if you&rsquo;re going to put the rover on top of a lander, with legs and rockets, you have to get it off there somehow when you&rsquo;re going to touch down,&rdquo; he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very complicated issue of designing a way to reliably, on all kinds of different circumstances &ndash; on slopes, on rocks, on sand dunes - drive something off the top of a platform. You also have the additional complexity that for Curiosity, this rover is over five times larger than any previous rover built to land on Mars.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that if they put the rover on top of the lander, there&rsquo;s every chance it would make the whole arrangement too top heavy, causing it to topple over. Likewise, if you attached the rover beneath the lander, it could get trapped if the legs sank into sandy ground or landed at an odd angle. So that&rsquo;s out too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option that&rsquo;s been used successfully &ndash; most notably on the recent Spirit and Opportunity missions &ndash; is airbags. With this design, the rover bounces across the surface encased in a cocoon. When it comes to a stop, the airbags deflate, the cocoon unfolds and the rover trundles away. So why not use that system?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;When you start trying to make that [airbag system] bigger, so it could safely land a one tonne rover, you end up with an airbag system that is very, very large&hellip;it just doesn&rsquo;t scale up.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it was back to the drawing board. Eventually, by a process of elimination, they ended up with the sky crane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You can think of the rover wearing a jet pack on its back,&rdquo; says Sell. &ldquo;When we get 20m above the surface, the jet pack lowers the rover on three bridles and that whole system keeps moving down towards the surface with the rover held seven and a half metres below the jetpack. When it touches down, the jet pack stops, it cuts the bridles free, then the jetpack flies away and crashes...it&rsquo;s a way of landing without ever having to land the spacecraft.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landing sequence from entry into the atmosphere, to the rover landing takes place automatically in just seven minutes. The last command sent to MSL will be two hours before touchdown and, because of the time delay between Earth and Mars, mission control won&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s succeeded until some 14 minutes after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;By the time we get the signal that says &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve started entry&rsquo; &ndash; it will already have been on the surface for seven minutes!&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does all this make Sell nervous? &ldquo;It actually makes me very confident. Most of us on the project have been involved in the design and testing of the spacecraft for years now&hellip;we understand how everything on the spacecraft was built and tested and put together.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasky, though, is a little more cautious: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a risk that something won&rsquo;t go well but we are certainly hoping for the best&hellip;there&rsquo;s always that lingering doubt.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hear from a scientist working on the mission and more about the landing system in &lt;a href=\"http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/podcasts/astronomy/show/20120710/\"&gt;Richard&rsquo;s latest podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:15:45Z","HeadlineLong":"Nasa's 'untried' technology to land Curiosity on Mars","HeadlineShort":"How to land on Mars","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"On 6 August, the largest rover ever sent to Mars should touchdown on the planets surface.

Almost 50 years after physicist Peter Higgs first theorised it was out there, public elementary number one has finally been captured in the data from two detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at Cern. Case closed. Champagne popped. Boson nova danced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If only. That handily simplified and heavily fictionalised telling of the tale has helped transform a spectacular scientific success story into one that is also global front page news. Without it &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18702455\"&gt;the 4 July announcement&lt;/a&gt; might not have generated such a frenzy of coverage and so many claims about it being a historic milestone for our species. One particle physicist only half jokingly told me that in future the date may come to be celebrated as Higgs Day, rather than anything to do with American independence.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. What has happened at Cern represents a magnificent accomplishment; big science at its biggest and boldest. And it&rsquo;s fantastic that it has been perceived and received as being of such importance. It&rsquo;s just that there is more to the story from the very beginning right through to the, probably false, ending.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, as Peter Higgs himself acknowledges, he was just one of several scientists who came up with the mechanism which predicted the particle which bears his name, but the others rarely get a mention*. As to the finish &ndash; well, as small children are fond of saying, are we there yet? There is very strong evidence that the LHC teams have found a new elementary particle, but while this is exciting it is far less clear that what they&rsquo;ve detected is the fabled Higgs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is, it seems curiously lighter than expected and more work is needed to explain away the discrepancy. If it&rsquo;s not, then the experimentalists and theorists are going to be even busier trying to see if it can be shoehorned into the current Standard Model of particle physics. Either way, it&rsquo;s not exactly conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;The real prize&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might seem to be nit-picking &ndash; except on an infinitesimally smaller scale.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Higgs, Schmiggs&rdquo;, some will say: the news isn&rsquo;t that they&rsquo;ve discovered a particular particle, but that it is (very probably) an elementary boson, one of fewer than 20 building blocks all matter as we know it is thought to be made from. That, they will argue, is why the find is hugely significant and the reason for all the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice try. But wrong. Do you remember all the media excitement the last time an elementary boson was found?&nbsp; No? That&rsquo;s because there wasn&rsquo;t any. The same happened &ndash; or, rather, didn&rsquo;t happen &ndash; the time before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of people remain at best only dimly aware of the W and Z bosons &ndash; not the most inspired names, admittedly &ndash; but they are arguably every bit as crucial to the Standard Model as the Higgs, and their discovery again at Cern in the 1980s was almost as much of a scientific triumph. The difference is that both finds barely registered in the media beyond dedicated science pages, publications and programmes. So it&rsquo;s not that major breakthroughs in particle physics are of themselves automatically newsworthy, the intense immense coverage we&rsquo;ve seen is something specific to the Higgs. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly it&rsquo;s a matter of increased media savviness &ndash; in recent years large research centres like Cern have become considerably cleverer at turning the often incremental nature of scientific progress into attention-grabbing events. Partly it&rsquo;s a matter of time &ndash; the particle was postulated almost half a century ago, and waiting decades to design and build powerful-enough particle-accelerators to stand a chance of finding it adds to the anticipation. Partly it&rsquo;s a matter of expense &ndash; having spent billions of public money on a 17 mile (28km) underground proton smashing circuit, we all have a greater (in)vested interest in what happens there. And partly it&rsquo;s a matter of divine intervention &ndash; the random rebranding of the Higgs as the &ldquo;God particle&rdquo; by some sections of the media may have irritated Peter Higgs and many other scientists, but it has only further fuelled the coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on top of all these, what amplifies our attraction to the Higgs boson is its elusiveness. Not just elusive as in hard to find, elusive as in hard to get our heads round what it does. That&rsquo;s not down to all the myriad articles and analogies of recent days being poor or the boson being beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. It&rsquo;s because the Higgs and its associated field convey mass....and mass is something we are most pretty comfortable with on a day to day basis, but which suddenly gets very complicated when you try to couch it in terms of particles and fields. So the net result is that instead of gaining illumination, we can end up feeling dimmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a conventional story, even a science news story, not easily being able to get a handle on what it&rsquo;s all about would be a problem. &nbsp;But not the Higgs. Instead the slippery business of its involvement with mass is downplayed, or often simply not mentioned. And the fact that it is the Higgs associated field which is the &ldquo;true prize&rdquo;, as &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/higgs-triumph-opens-up-field-of-dreams-1.10970\"&gt;Nature journal put it&lt;/a&gt;, is simply overlooked in most publications. &nbsp;Instead, the focus is on various permutations of how momentous it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more of us were clear about why rather than the wow, the results from Cern would have had less impact as we&rsquo;d have our own views on the significance of what they had found. Instead we are expected to just accept that if enough Higgs bigwigs say it&rsquo;s monumentally important, then it must be.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or as Lewis Carroll put it, &ldquo;what I tell you three times is true&rdquo;. &nbsp;The reality is that science is often complex, collaborative and continuous. But with stories we like beginnings and ends and strong lead characters, so when we take research down the rabbit hole and into the media things tend to shrink and grow. It&rsquo;s fitting then, that Cern made their announcement 150 years to the day after Carroll first came up with the story that became Alice in Wonderland.

Sixty years in which the planet has changed beyond recognition. As part of the Diamond Jubilee festivities &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/the-new-elizabethans/\"&gt;the BBC asked the public to help select the sixty &ldquo;New Elizabethans&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; living or dead, British or not &ndash; who have had the most impact on life during her (or possibly Her) reign. Which in effect means fifty-nine since HRH herself is pretty much a shoe-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given all the myriad ways science and technology have left their mark on the last 60 years, it&rsquo;s a list which you might expect scientists and inventors to dominate. And I&rsquo;ve no problem thinking of worthy contenders.&nbsp; Indisputable geniuses like Sidney Stratton, Ned and Philip Brainard, Robert Campbell and Alexander Hartdegen. Don&rsquo;t know them? More familiar may be Emmett Brown, Caractacus Potts or Eldon Tyrell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each is responsible for one or more world-changing inventions and breakthroughs. Unfortunately, as you will have no doubt figured out, each is also fictional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton, played by Alec Guinness, devises an indestructible fabric in wonderful Ealing comedy The Man In the White Suit; Brainard with a change of first name invents gravity-defying flying rubber in both The Absent Minded Professor and the Robin Williams remake Flubber; Campbell is Medicine Man Sean Connery curing cancer; and although in HG Wells&rsquo; novel and the first film version he has no name, in the most recent remake it&rsquo;s Alexander Hartdegen who builds The Time Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time travel &ndash; by flying DeLorean &ndash; is rather more stylish from Doc Emmett Brown in the Back To The Future trilogy; Caractacus Potts also gets a car to fly and creates whistling confectionery in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang; and Eldon Tyrell gives life, and death, to Bladerunner&rsquo;s replicants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Nutty professor&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may seem a long and very male list of characters who have come up with things that, if real, would be ranked among the greatest advances of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because it is.&nbsp; Well, apart from the &ldquo;toot sweets&rdquo; in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Now try to do the same for the individuals behind genuine inventions and breakthroughs. It&rsquo;s almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might say Watson or Crick for the structure of DNA &ndash; but while both did key work they also needed &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin\"&gt;Rosalind Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and a host of other supporting characters. There is also far more to DNA than its structure. Or what about Tim Berners Lee who &ldquo;invented&rdquo; the World Wide Web?&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly &ldquo;TimBL&rdquo; was vital to its development but what about his less well lauded partner &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau\"&gt;Robert Callieau&lt;/a&gt; - or the many thousands of others who have left their mark on what it has become? And Ian Wilmut &ndash; the man who brought Dolly the Sheep to the world&rsquo;s attention? Sure enough, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/dolly/385810.pdf\"&gt;the paper that describes&lt;/a&gt; just how the world&rsquo;s first cloned mammal was &ldquo;created&rdquo; shows the names of at least four other scientists involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a problem that can only get worse. Think of the growing number of &ldquo;big science&rdquo; projects, from the Human Genome to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). All involve thousands of people working in myriad disciplines. Naming an individual who is single-handedly responsible for the project &ndash; and its findings - is an impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Prizes &ndash; perhaps the organisation that has done the most to promote the idea of individual triumph &ndash; is already under pressure to change its ways. Last year&rsquo;s prize for dark energy &lt;a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/oct/04/nobel-prize-physics?CMP=twt_gu#block-23\"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; from the Astronomer Royal &ndash; the Queen&rsquo;s own astronomer - for not accurately reflecting the true number of people who carried out the work. I don&rsquo;t envy the Nobel Committee faced with plucking out three individuals if - and when - the Higgs Boson is discovered at the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because genuine scientific progress is usually collaborative and collective even if the nature of fame, and fiction, is to single out individuals and hand them all the credit. We like to make heroes, and a century ago stories about dashing, dynamic inventors saving the day, and the world, through their indefatigable ingenuity were so popular they even had their own name &ndash; Edisonades, inspired by the famously sweaty Thomas Edison. Such tales peaked in popularity long before EAM Windsor became QE2. Now even in fantasies in which a scientist makes some amazing advance, they are usually portrayed as nutty, absent-minded, eccentric or plain weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it will be interesting to see which scientists, if any, end up being allotted a place among the New Elizabethans.&nbsp; For all their incalculable influence on life as we now live it, few have changed anything single-handedly, while many who have made a significant difference have achieved little or no public recognition. Unlike their fictional counterparts, the scientists who have transformed our world seldom get starring roles, just an uncredited cameo as part of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","HeadlineLong":"The myth of the lone genius","HeadlineShort":"The myth of the lone genius","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Genuine scientific progress is usually collaborative even if the nature of fame, and fiction, is to single out individuals, writes Quentin Cooper.

They also have something else in common: they&rsquo;re bald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s often said that bald men are more virile. The popular theory is that they have higher levels of the male hormone testosterone, which makes them more masculine and increases their sex drive, but they lose their hair at a younger age than average as a result. The truth, though, is a little more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is true that balding is dependent on testosterone. Back in 1960 a Yale doctor called James B. Hamilton studied twenty-one boys who were undergoing castration. Shockingly this was sometimes done to boys diagnosed with behavioural or mental problems. He followed them up, some of them for as long as 18 years, and found that they showed &lt;a href=\"http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/20/10/1309.abstract\"&gt;no signs of developing male pattern baldness&lt;/a&gt; as they aged. On the other hand, men of the same age who were still intact, and therefore producing testosterone, already had receding hairlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamilton wasn&rsquo;t the first to discover a link between testosterone and baldness, both Hippocrates and Aristotle had made the same observation centuries earlier. Hamilton&rsquo;s finding suggested that high levels of testosterone might lead to baldness, but in fact the level is irrelevant, providing there are some quantities of the hormone present. Castrated men, who have almost no testosterone, may retain their hair, but men with low testosterone levels can still go bald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s because it is not the amount of testosterone circulating in the bloodstream that dictates baldness, it&rsquo;s down to genetics. Several genes are thought to be involved, all resulting in hair follicles becoming particularly sensitive to tiny amounts of circulating testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process still isn&rsquo;t fully understood, but it involves an enzyme that converts testosterone into a substance called dihydrotesterone, which causes the hair follicles to shrink in some people, possibly by choking off their supply of blood and nutrients. As the follicle shrinks, the growing cycle gets shorter and new hairs become finer and finer until only the finest so-called vellous hairs remain on the scalp. Eventually the follicle becomes dormant and no more hair is produced. This starts on the top of the scalp and then moves down over the head in the characteristic shape of male pattern baldness. Bald men are genetically more predisposed to be more sensitive to dihydrotestosterone, but the follicles on the chin are unaffected by the hormone, which is why beards continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As theories about the influence of testosterone have developed, so have various avenues of treatment. In the 1960s there were curious attempts to treat baldness by adding more testosterone directly to the scalp. First researchers tried an ointment, but it was so heavy and oily that men didn&rsquo;t want to stick out the trial, so they suspended the testosterone in a cream instead. Still most men dropped out of the study before the ten months were up. The cream didn&rsquo;t make hair grow back, and although half the men who took part said they thought this might have slowed down the rate of hair loss, this was &lt;a href=\"http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=530786\"&gt;not confirmed by the experimenters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people who don&rsquo;t lose their hair have low levels of the enzyme that converts testosterone, and so more recently researchers have been seeking ways of blocking the enzyme in others. A treatment called finasteride works on this principle, but it is expensive and needs to be &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10365924\"&gt;used continuously&lt;/a&gt; or hair loss begins again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, scientists are still trying to understand the mechanism by which the hair stops growing. In 2010, researchers examined sections of scalp with and without hair and found that stem cells were still present in the follicles in both areas, but in bald regions they &lt;a href=\"http://www.jci.org/articles/view/44478\"&gt;weren&rsquo;t progressing onto the next stage&lt;/a&gt; where they would normally develop into so-called progenitor cells. This study raises hopes that one day hair could be grown on bald parts of the heads, if scientists can find a way of &lt;a href=\"http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/publication/frame.php?i=112555&amp;p=13&amp;pn=&amp;ver=flex\"&gt;triggering growth&lt;/a&gt; or blocking whatever is preventing it, and researchers are currently investigating particular proteins that &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17457098\"&gt;might provide that trigger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baldness seems to involve more myths than many other conditions, possibly because its distribution feels so arbitrary that we look for explanations. If you have lost your hair sadly you can&rsquo;t claim to be more virile, but you can blame your parents. They passed on the genes after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hear more Medical Myths on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\"&gt;Health Check on the BBC World Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

The sky was clear and the crew were happy because they had some extra Malaysian satay that night. But as they flew over Java, an engine failed. And then another and another. Minutes later there were no working engines left. In his calmest pilot&rsquo;s voice Moody made an announcement: &ldquo;Good evening ladies and gentlemen, This is your captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress.&rdquo;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Moody also showed little sign of being terrified as he managed to make an emergency landing at Jakarta airport &ndash; later he discovered that a plume of ash from a volcano had knocked out all four engines. But within six months of the incident he noticed that the tip of his quiff had turned white. Within a year the rest of his hair had done the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captain Moody is not alone. The same thing is said to have happened to several historical figures, but in a far shorter time frame. When the French queen, Marie Antoinette was led to the guillotine at the age of 37, her hair is said to have turned white the night before in anticipation of her execution. The English lawyer Sir Thomas More, who was later canonised, was executed in the Tower of London in 1535, and again his hair was reported to have &lt;a href=\"http://www.derma-haarcenter.ch/files/Directory/Publikationen/Thomas+More+syndrome.pdf\"&gt;turned white before his death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are good stories, but are they scientifically possible? Can hair really turn white overnight? Is there a physiological process through which extreme stress can cause hair to change colour this fast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hair gets its colour from two types of melanin pigment &ndash; eumelanin which dictates how dark the hair is, and pheomelanin which determines how red or yellow it is. As we age, the cells in hair follicles stop producing these pigments and the resulting hairs are colourless. Eventually, the overall effect of a combination of coloured and colourless hair, especially in people with dark hair, is grey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process behind this is not well understood. One study showed that hair naturally greys through the &lt;a href=\"http://www.fasebj.org/content/23/10/3253.full\"&gt;same chemical used to bleach hair from bottles&lt;/a&gt;. The idea proposed from studies in mice is that melanin-making cells produce hydrogen peroxide, which is normally broken down by an enzyme called catalase. However, production of the enzyme drops as we age, and the build-up of hydrogen peroxide blocks melanin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical name for the sudden whitening of the hair is canities subita. The best explanation for it is not that the hair changes colour, but that the pigmented hairs fall out. A condition called alopecia ariata causes the hair shed suddenly, resulting in bald patches. It is thought to be caused by an auto-immune response, where the body&rsquo;s defence system turns on itself. It can be exacerbated by stress, which could account for the association of white hair with terrifying experiences. In some cases the white hairs are unaffected by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a severe shock could trigger hair loss, but with only the coloured hairs falling out, leaving someone who already has some grey with a whole head of white hair. Or perhaps the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588848/%5D\"&gt;immune response might target&lt;/a&gt; the pigment-producing system, which would explain why those no follicles no longer producing coloured hair are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock spot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explanation might well account for cases like that of Captain Moody. His hair took a year to turn completely white. The overnight cases like Marie Antoinette&rsquo;s are harder to explain. She was imprisoned for a year, so perhaps she was denied hair dye in captivity and by the time she appeared in public again at her execution with her hair cut short her grey roots had grown out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this doesn&rsquo;t explain other anecdotal tales, for instance in young people who would have so few white hairs that if all their darker hair fell any white hairs remaining would be very sparse. Then there&rsquo;s a more recent case study of a 54-year-old woman in Switzerland who had a small patch of hair loss. She was given steroids, which treated the hair loss successfully, but within a few weeks &lt;a href=\"http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=712060\"&gt;all her hair had turned white&lt;/a&gt;, even though she had not had a frightening experience and had stopped losing her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a study from a research group led by no less than one of this year&rsquo;s recipients of the Nobel prize in Chemistry, Robert Lefkowitz, offered some clues. They &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7364/full/nature10368.html\"&gt;outlined a mechanism&lt;/a&gt; through which a hallmark of chronic stress causes DNA damage in mice that could lead to conditions like greying hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The puzzle of whether your hair can turn grey sounds like a simple one for medical science to solve, but it&rsquo;s not. Ultimately, to study exactly what happens you would need to examine the hair before and after a shocking incident, carefully assessing its colour and thickness. Life-threatening situations are not only rare, but unpredictable and no ethics committee is going to let you induce a sufficiently terrifying experience in a lab volunteer.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there is something about the idea of hair changing colour through shock that is fascinating. Maybe it&rsquo;s the idea that the body reveals more than we think, that underneath the impressive calmness which allowed Captain Moody to save the lives of 247 passengers, his body was telling a different story.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hear more Medical Myths on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\"&gt;Health Check on the BBC World Service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

When we talk about longevity, it is usually described in terms of &ldquo;life expectancy&rdquo; &ndash; the average length of life &ndash; but averages can be misleading. After all, people in the UK have on average one testicle each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, the 90th Psalm declares, at least in the King James version of the Bible, that &ldquo;the days of our years are three-score years and ten&rdquo;, although up to recently you had to be fairly lucky to reach this biblical sell-by date. Some historical figures did manage it: Augustus Caesar conquered that barrier to reach 75, while Michelangelo hammered on to the amazing age of 88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the ancient Greeks, there was also a superstition about the risks of ages that are multiples of seven &ndash; the &ldquo;climacteric years&rdquo; of 49 and 63 were seen to be positively dangerous. Partly in order to combat this belief, in 1689 a priest in Breslau in Silesia (now Wroclaw in Poland) collected the ages at which people died. These data eventually found their way to Edmond Halley in England, who took time off from discovering comets to construct the first serious life table in 1693, which uses estimates of the annual risk of dying to work out the chances of living to any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no evidence of any increased risk at age 49 or 63, so Halley neatly demolished the idea of climacteric years. Unlike the Bible&rsquo;s declaration, Halley&rsquo;s life tables went up to 84. He estimated there was a 2% chance of reaching this age, and just to prove it he died when he was 85, thus by some margin outliving Bill Haley, also of Comet fame, who only lived until 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fab (sixty-)four factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the case of survival, life expectancy is strongly influenced by a lot of deaths in childhood &ndash; the average will be low, but the survivors may then live to a good age. So perhaps taking another cue from the music world might provide a better way of assessing life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul McCartney was 16 when he wrote When I&rsquo;m 64 &ndash; an age when 64 seemed as old as old. But if we look at the chances of surviving childhood and getting to 16, and then the chance of such a survivor getting to 64, we can get a better picture of what has changed over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if we consult wonderful resources such as the &lt;a href=\"http://www.mortality.org/\"&gt;Human Mortality Database&lt;/a&gt;, we find that back in 1841 (the first year we have data for), 31% of children born in England and Wales died before they were 16, but if you did survive there was nearly a 50% chance of reaching 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Beatles recorded When I&rsquo;m 64 in 1966, 2.5% of children died before 16, and surviving girls had an 85% chance of reaching 64: for boys it was only 74%, the difference reflecting the unhealthy lifestyles of so many men. By 2009&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the last year we have measurements for, less than 1% of children died before 16, and the chance of reaching 64 rose to 92% for women and 87% for men. This gives an overall life expectancy of 82 for women and 78 for men.&nbsp; &lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life-expectancy figures do have a value, though, as behind the cold columns of numbers in historical tables lie powerful events. Apart from the World Wars, Napoleon&rsquo;s march on Moscow, which killed 400,000 men, temporarily reduced life expectancy to 23, the influenza epidemics of 1918-1919 &lt;a href=\"http://www.lifetable.de/\"&gt;took 10 years off life-expectancy&lt;/a&gt; for females in France, while Aids has meant &lt;a href=\"http://understandinguncertainty.org/node/272\"&gt;life expectancy in South Africa declined&lt;/a&gt; from 63 in 1990 to 54 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extraordinary changes have occurred elsewhere. In 1970 Vietnam had a life expectancy of 48, and it is 75 now &ndash; it took England and Wales from 1894 to 1986 to make this transition. We can also see the effects of inequality within a country. For instance, in 1901 &lt;a href=\"http://www.lifetable.de/\"&gt;life expectancy for Black men in the US&lt;/a&gt; was 32, with 43% dying before 20 &ndash; for White men the corresponding figures were 48 and 24%. After 100 years and a civil rights movement, the gap in life expectancy was still visible, though it had narrowed from 16 years to five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ageing future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, we are told that the &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15391515\"&gt;global population is at seven billion and rapidly rising&lt;/a&gt;, and we can also make some reasonable guesses for the life expectancy of people born now. If we allow for future improvements in health, the &ldquo;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lifetables/period-and-cohort-life-expectancy-tables/2010-based/index.html\"&gt;principle projections&lt;/a&gt;&rdquo; estimate that males born now in England and Wales can on average expect to live until 90, and for females it is 94, with 32% of males and 39% of females expected to reach 100 in 2112.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind boggles at these figures. But these projections are, understandably, rather controversial. Is there some inbuilt ageing process, and can it be reversed? Or is there some natural ceiling that we are going to bang our wrinkled heads against?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain for children born in the future &ndash; there are going to be a lot of old people around for them to look after, as those already plodding through their middle-age are not going to go away. The UN estimates that the proportion of people over 60 &lt;a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/globalissues/ageing/\"&gt;will double between 2007 and 2050&lt;/a&gt;, as people will live longer and lower fertility rates mean fewer young people. There will be two billion people over 60 in the world by 2050, and around 400 million over 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what sort of state are all these old people going to be in? After the bit about three-score years and ten; Psalm 90 continues with &ldquo;and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away&rdquo;, which does not exactly paint an encouraging picture of ageing. Are we making all this effort to live longer, just so that we can spend even more time sitting round the edge of a room, television blaring, struggling to grasp what reluctant visitors are shouting at us?&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it does not look so bad: in 2008 UK men at age 65 had around 17 years of life expectancy left, 10 of which would be considered as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;very good&rdquo; health, and this is quite a stringent criterion. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pensions/pension-trends/chapter-3--life-expectancy-and-healthy-ageing--2012-edition-/index.html\"&gt;Women had more than 20 years left&lt;/a&gt; on average, 11 of which would be classed as being &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which is something of a comfort to me. I will be 64 in a few years, and I have already lost most of my hair. But I am aiming to wait as long as possible before entering &ldquo;Dunsummin&rdquo;, the retirement home for statisticians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this story, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-04-10T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Life expectancy: How long will you live?","HeadlineShort":"A matter of life and death","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Behind the cold columns of statistics regarding when we are likely to die lie insights into social changes, global events, and future ageing trends.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Behind the cold columns of statistics regarding when we are likely to die lie insights into social changes, global events, and future ageing trends.","SummaryShort":"What statistics (and the Beatles) reveal about how long we will live","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"75be4ec2-6162-4af4-bc07-c97434704436","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120410-a-matter-of-life-and-death","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120410-a-matter-of-life-and-death"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120410-a-matter-of-life-and-death","_id":"559a55ec284227dc8c6bbbe5"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch your death of cold&rdquo;, my grandmother always used to warn me, if I ever dared to leave the house on a winter&rsquo;s day without drying my hair properly. For centuries there has been an idea across many parts of the world that you will develop a cold if you are exposed to low temperatures, particularly if you get wet as well. We even use the words &ldquo;cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;chill&rdquo; to describe the combination of a sore throat, runny nose and cough that you end up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as any doctor will tell you, the common cold is caused by a virus. So if I have just washed my hair, but I really need to leave the house urgently, should I worry about my grandmother&rsquo;s warning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasonal triggers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living in Britain, I will naturally begin by examining the weather. Studies in &lt;a href=\"http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/6/861.full\"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15337339?dopt=Abstract\"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; have found a higher incidence of colds in the winter, while in warmer countries such as Guinea, Malaysia and the Gambia peaks have been found during the rainy season. We could conclude from these studies that cold or wet weather causes colds, but there is an alternative explanation. When it is freezing or raining we spend more time indoors in close proximity to other people and their germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens when we get cold or wet? Scientists have set up experiments under laboratory conditions where they lower the temperatures of volunteers and deliberately expose them to a cold virus. But overall the studies have been inconclusive. Some studies found the chilly group were more likely to succumb to a cold, others found they were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=\"http://fampra.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/6/608.short\"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; conducted in a different manner offers the intriguing suggestion that there could be some truth to the saying.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ron Eccles, director of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/biosi/subsites/cold/index.html\"&gt;Common Cold Centre&lt;/a&gt; in Cardiff, UK wanted to know whether getting cold and damp activates the virus, which then sets off the sneezing and streaming. To do so, people were chilled under laboratory conditions, but then they returned to their real lives and mingled with people, including those who had a cold virus present in their nose or throat without becoming ill with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of Eccles&rsquo; volunteers had to sit with their feet in cold water for twenty minutes, while the other half kept their socks and shoes on, but sat with their feet in an empty bowl for the same length of time. There was no difference in the cold symptoms reported between the two groups in the first few days, but four to five days later twice as many people in the cold-water group said they had developed a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower defences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this to make any sense there needs to be a mechanism by which getting chilled feet, or for that matter wet hair, could give you a cold. One theory is that when your body gets chilled the blood vessels in the nose and throat constrict. These same vessels deliver infection-fighting white blood cells, so if fewer white blood cells reach the nose and throat your defences against a cold virus are lowered for a short time. When your hair dries off or you go indoors your body warms up again, your blood vessels dilate, and the white blood cells continue to fight the virus. But by then it could be too late and the virus might have had enough time to replicate and trigger the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So although we talk about &ldquo;catching a chill&rdquo;, the chilling has not given us the cold, but might have activated a virus already present at the back of the throat. Bear in mind though, that this area is still controversial, and Eccles&rsquo; study only demonstrated that more people who had been chilled said they had cold symptoms. No medical tests were done to confirm that they were definitely infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final point is that there is a curious parallel with Norwegian health folklore, which says that women are more likely to develop cystitis when the weather is cold.&nbsp; Researchers found that cooling people&rsquo;s feet did seem to &lt;a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/02813439209014054\"&gt;activate cystitis&lt;/a&gt; in some women, suggesting that the same process might be occurring in the urinary tract, as in the blood vessels of the nose and throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there might well have been some truth in my grandmother&rsquo;s advice not to go out with wet hair. It will not give you a cold, as she said, but it might trigger one. In the meantime, until more research is carried out I think I will dry my hair before I go outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; or message us on &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can hear more Medical Myths on &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\" target=\"_self\"&gt;Health Check on the BBC World Service&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

Sixty years in which the planet has changed beyond recognition. As part of the Diamond Jubilee festivities &lt;a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/the-new-elizabethans/\"&gt;the BBC asked the public to help select the sixty &ldquo;New Elizabethans&rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; &ndash; living or dead, British or not &ndash; who have had the most impact on life during her (or possibly Her) reign. Which in effect means fifty-nine since HRH herself is pretty much a shoe-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given all the myriad ways science and technology have left their mark on the last 60 years, it&rsquo;s a list which you might expect scientists and inventors to dominate. And I&rsquo;ve no problem thinking of worthy contenders.&nbsp; Indisputable geniuses like Sidney Stratton, Ned and Philip Brainard, Robert Campbell and Alexander Hartdegen. Don&rsquo;t know them? More familiar may be Emmett Brown, Caractacus Potts or Eldon Tyrell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each is responsible for one or more world-changing inventions and breakthroughs. Unfortunately, as you will have no doubt figured out, each is also fictional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton, played by Alec Guinness, devises an indestructible fabric in wonderful Ealing comedy The Man In the White Suit; Brainard with a change of first name invents gravity-defying flying rubber in both The Absent Minded Professor and the Robin Williams remake Flubber; Campbell is Medicine Man Sean Connery curing cancer; and although in HG Wells&rsquo; novel and the first film version he has no name, in the most recent remake it&rsquo;s Alexander Hartdegen who builds The Time Machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time travel &ndash; by flying DeLorean &ndash; is rather more stylish from Doc Emmett Brown in the Back To The Future trilogy; Caractacus Potts also gets a car to fly and creates whistling confectionery in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang; and Eldon Tyrell gives life, and death, to Bladerunner&rsquo;s replicants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lsquo;Nutty professor&rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may seem a long and very male list of characters who have come up with things that, if real, would be ranked among the greatest advances of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because it is.&nbsp; Well, apart from the &ldquo;toot sweets&rdquo; in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Now try to do the same for the individuals behind genuine inventions and breakthroughs. It&rsquo;s almost impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might say Watson or Crick for the structure of DNA &ndash; but while both did key work they also needed &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin\"&gt;Rosalind Franklin&lt;/a&gt; and a host of other supporting characters. There is also far more to DNA than its structure. Or what about Tim Berners Lee who &ldquo;invented&rdquo; the World Wide Web?&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly &ldquo;TimBL&rdquo; was vital to its development but what about his less well lauded partner &ndash; &lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau\"&gt;Robert Callieau&lt;/a&gt; - or the many thousands of others who have left their mark on what it has become? And Ian Wilmut &ndash; the man who brought Dolly the Sheep to the world&rsquo;s attention? Sure enough, &lt;a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/dolly/385810.pdf\"&gt;the paper that describes&lt;/a&gt; just how the world&rsquo;s first cloned mammal was &ldquo;created&rdquo; shows the names of at least four other scientists involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a problem that can only get worse. Think of the growing number of &ldquo;big science&rdquo; projects, from the Human Genome to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). All involve thousands of people working in myriad disciplines. Naming an individual who is single-handedly responsible for the project &ndash; and its findings - is an impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nobel Prizes &ndash; perhaps the organisation that has done the most to promote the idea of individual triumph &ndash; is already under pressure to change its ways. Last year&rsquo;s prize for dark energy &lt;a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/oct/04/nobel-prize-physics?CMP=twt_gu#block-23\"&gt;came under fire&lt;/a&gt; from the Astronomer Royal &ndash; the Queen&rsquo;s own astronomer - for not accurately reflecting the true number of people who carried out the work. I don&rsquo;t envy the Nobel Committee faced with plucking out three individuals if - and when - the Higgs Boson is discovered at the LHC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because genuine scientific progress is usually collaborative and collective even if the nature of fame, and fiction, is to single out individuals and hand them all the credit. We like to make heroes, and a century ago stories about dashing, dynamic inventors saving the day, and the world, through their indefatigable ingenuity were so popular they even had their own name &ndash; Edisonades, inspired by the famously sweaty Thomas Edison. Such tales peaked in popularity long before EAM Windsor became QE2. Now even in fantasies in which a scientist makes some amazing advance, they are usually portrayed as nutty, absent-minded, eccentric or plain weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it will be interesting to see which scientists, if any, end up being allotted a place among the New Elizabethans.&nbsp; For all their incalculable influence on life as we now live it, few have changed anything single-handedly, while many who have made a significant difference have achieved little or no public recognition. Unlike their fictional counterparts, the scientists who have transformed our world seldom get starring roles, just an uncredited cameo as part of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","HeadlineLong":"The myth of the lone genius","HeadlineShort":"The myth of the lone genius","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Genuine scientific progress is usually collaborative even if the nature of fame, and fiction, is to single out individuals, writes Quentin Cooper.
