   On behalf of Canadians everywhere I'd like to offer an apology to the United States of America. We haven't been getting along very well
 recently and for that, I am truly sorry. I'm sorry we called George Bush a moron. He is a moron but, it wasn't nice of us to point it out. If it's any consolation, the fact that he's a moron shouldn't reflect
 poorly on the people of America. After all it's not like you actually
 elected him.

   I'm sorry about our softwood lumber. Just because we have more trees than you doesn't give us the right to sell you lumber that's cheaper and better than your own.

   I'm sorry we beat you in Olympic hockey. In our defence I guess our
 excuse would be that our team was much, much, much, much better than
 yours. I'm sorry we burnt down your White House during the war of 1812. I notice you've rebuilt it! It's Very Nice.

   I'm sorry about your beer. I know we had nothing to do with your beer but, we feel your pain.

   I'm sorry about our waffling on Iraq. I mean, when you're going up
 against a crazed dictator, you want to have your friends by your side.
 I realize it took more than two years before you guys pitched in against Hitler, but that was different. Everyone knew he had weapons.
  </p>
  <p>
   And finally on behalf of all Canadians, I'm sorry that we're constantly apologizing for things in a passive-aggressive way which is really a thinly veiled criticism. I sincerely hope that you're not upset over this. We've seen what you do to countries you get upset with.
