               Quickbooks
              </a>
              and perhaps more affordable? I recently wondered the same thing and went on a hunt to explore alternatives. I searched high and low on Google, Quora, startup forums, and asked fellow entrepreneurs. Most of the services below offer a free trial, mobile app, invoice templates, and payroll services  so what separates them? Heres a list that includes comparisons of unique features, pricing, and more. I hope you find it useful.

              </strong>
               Frustrated with managing invoices and expense tracking? Freshbooks allows you to see when customers open invoices, send automatic late payment reminders, and even lets you send paper invoices without having to visit the post office. Freshbooks offers a free service with limited features but the next level starts at $20/month and allows you to manage up to 25 clients. This basic plan only includes access to 1 user but purchase one of the higher tiered plans and receive access for up to 5 users. Some of their cool features include employee time tracking for payroll and the ability to snap pictures of your receipts for better expense tracking. Freshbooks also has a large number of 3rd-party apps integrated with their service to help you better manage your business and finances.

                LessAccounting
               </strong>
              </a>
               If you're a small business owner with no employees or a freelancer that is trying to better manage your revenue, LessAccounting may be a viable answer. LessAccounting, which considers itself the underdog compared to some of the companies on this list, provides standard core accounting reports with invoice templates available. One of the few services on this list to offer a money-back guarantee, their freelancer plan starts at $20/monthly and is for companies with less than $70k in annual revenue. Once you break the $70k annual revenue threshold, you can upgrade your plan and wont have to do so again until you break $500k in annual revenue. The freelancer plan only includes 10 invoices/month but every plan priced higher includes unlimited monthly invoices. The drawbacks include no mobile app or payroll capabilities, if thats important to you. However, if you fall into the category of early entrepreneur discussed earlier, they provide a free e-book to help guide you through the burden of interpreting your financial reports.

                Xero
               </strong>
              </a>
               Possibly the easiest service to transition away from Quickbooks, Xero offers a similar feel with comparable products and services that a business owner may have become accustomed to with QuickBooks. It even provides the ability to convert your current Quickbooks data right into Xero dashboards (one of the few services on this list to offer such a feature). Xero is currently offering a 30-day free trial, in addition to a promotion for 50% off during the first 6 months. Their basic plan start at $20 a month with limited features, but spend an extra $10 per month ($30 total) and get unlimited users, bills, invoices, and bank transactions to reconcile. They offer standard accounting reports; with advanced financial reports available such as foreign currency gains and losses (if youre doing business abroad). Xero seems to have the largest 3rd-party app integration of the list, including all of the big players, such as Stripe, Square, Paypal and Zenpayroll.

              </a>
               Small businesses on the rise, which expect to scale and want their accounting services to do so with them, might consider looking into Saasu. Their monthly pricing is a little different than the traditional pay model since its based on expected annual transactionsso what do transactions entail? According to their site, transactions include: a sale, purchase, bank transfer, payment, or journal entry. Their starter plan begins at $15/monthly and includes all of their core features, up to 1,000 annual transactions, and 3 bank feeds. If you become an overnight success, you can switch to their X-Large plan which includes up to 100k annual transactions and 20 bank feeds. If thats still not enough, you can reach out about their Enterprise plan which is priced on application. Some of their best features include detailed sales reports, a KPI report builder, and cash flow forecasting that is simple and easy to digest.

               </strong>
              </a>
               Free accounting reports, invoices, and receipt scanning  Wave doesnt charge you unless you want specific features. For instance, payroll service will cost your business $9/month or the ability to accept credit cards costs 2.9% + $0.30 per invoice. Wave also has a portfolio of mobile apps for each of its products and a network of professional accountants to help you find one if necessary. Similar to LessAccounting, it could be a perfect fit for a freelancer, contractor, or small business owner with few employees. However, unlike LessAccounting, it offers payroll services and a mobile app. Ive read reviews and heard friends dream of a better user workflow but remember.its free! Depending on your business needs and budget, it may provide the best value which should be something to keep in mind.

              </a>
               Another affordable option for freelancers and entrepreneurs alike, Kashoo provides standard accounting reports, bank reconciliation, and payroll services at a low cost. One of the few services on this list to offer a money-back guarantee and the ability to directly convert data from Quickbooks, it also prides itself on providing a secure platform that backs-up data daily. Service plans are broken down by solo ($5/month or $50/year) and business ($20/month or $200/year) which evidently include a 20% discount if you plan to use them long-term. Unfortunately, they have a limited number of 3rd-party app integrations so be sure to check their selection if youre hoping to pair them with a different service that you currently use.

               Unlike all of the other services on this list, Shoeboxed doesnt provide may accounting features such as financial reports, invoicing, or payroll. However, its one of the ultimate services for tracking expenses, regardless of business size. Use it for free with limited features, or purchase the starter plan for $10/month and track 50 docs monthly with 1 user account. The next tiered plan costs $30/month but lets you track 150 docs monthly with 2 user accounts and includes Quickbooks integration. It has cool features such as mileage tracking that uses your phones GPS to help track your travel expenses or magic envelopes that lets you send Shoeboxed paper receipts to have them logged digitally. It has a highly reviewed mobile app and provides a money-back guarantee. Despite not offering necessary accounting features, it has 3rd-party app integration with Xero and Wave which allows Shoeboxed to provide a nice assist for your financial reporting.

              As entrepreneurs, we're always on the look out for resources that can help us streamline and cost-effectively build our startup. Whether it's building a website, creating a logo, looking for free legal docs, coming up on with business/domain names, optimizing our site, editing our photos, sending email campaigns, managing our online community, running A/B tests, sending surveys, finding free creative common photos we can leverage, testing out collaboration tools with the team, organizing our tasks, or even figuring out how to split equity with our co-founders.
             </p>
             <p>
              If it sounds like a lot, it is. And now there's a comprehensive site that lists all of these resources across 5 categories - Business, Marketing, Design/Code, Productivity, and Learn - called

              to make them easy to find. Each list has a mini description next to the resource so you can quickly scan and discover which one suits your needs best.
             </p>
             <p>
              This was our goal with this blog - to share, evaluate, and test new tools as well as post about what we're learning as we build our companies. We'll continue to do so and for now,

              We are fortunate to have serial entrepreneur Yasmine Mustafa as part of the Cheap Revolution team.  Yasmine is currently working hard on her fourth startup called ROAR for Good - a social impact company that seeks to reduce violence against women. ROAR provides a device to empower women to protect themselves in dangerous situations.

              Check out our 5 minute interview with Yasmine (transcript below). (Apologies for the noise near the end of the video... we were in a classroom and someone lowered the projector screen to prepare for class.)

             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Cheap Revolution:
              </strong>
              Please start off by telling us about what ROAR is.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Yasmine:
              </strong>
              Sure. ROAR is a social impact company. We are aimed at diminishing violence against women using technology and educational programs. We are building, as a short-term solution, self-defense wearables. So, picture jewelry that you would wear that, when you activate it, will trigger a high-frequency alarm, a bright, flashing strobe light, or you can launch a silent version as well that will message your friends and family your location and call campus security, 911, whatever you designate in the emergency line. And the idea there is, when you're threatened and when you want help, you can distract and disorient someone and instantly get help. And, then, it integrates with a mobile app that kind of acts like Waze, but for safety, so it uses crowd-sourced safety tips so you could text somebody and know if you're about to enter a dangerous area.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, for example, let's say a mugging just happened. Everybody whos nearby would get a push notification. The idea is youd be more vigilant of your surroundings and know what's going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the final piece of it is we are using some of the proceeds from the wearable and partnering up with non-profits that host educational programs for young boys and young girls to teach them empathy, and respect, and consent, so -- to really get to the root of the problem. And, so, then one day, this device is hopefully obsolete.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Cheap Revolution:
              </strong>
              Terrific.What gave you the idea for this?
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Yasmine:
              </strong>
              A lot of things. I'm from the Middle East and, over there, women are oppressed. They don't have the same opportunities that I have here. And I feel like I cheated the birth lottery a little bit. So, I always think about how my mom had an arranged marriage, and she has to ask permission to do stuff, and her sole purpose was to have a family, and preferably boys, and of course, cover up, and what my life would have been like if I would not have come here during the Persian Gulf War. And I feel very lucky that I am here and I want to do something to shift kind of the gender inequality that exists.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, then, the real trigger happened when -- I think it was late 2013, I had just come back from a big trip. I did a six-month solo trip through South America. A week after I came back, a woman was raped a block from our apartment, a street that I walk by all the time. She had just moved from Chicago. It was her fourth day here. She was out at a bar meeting some people and she went off to refill her meter, ten o'clock at night, when a guy grabbed her from behind, punched her, dragged her down an alley, and brutally raped her. And, when I read this news story the next day, I had the initial idea, which was taking existing self-defense tools and making them wearable. So, the initial idea was actually called the Macelet, like Mace in a bracelet. But, then, I did some market research, talked to a lot of women, and learned they actually don't like some of these self-defense tools because they're either intimidated by them, or they're really afraid that they would be overpowered and it would be used against them. So, then, the idea shifted to what it is now.

               Cheap Revolution:
              </strong>
              Okay. So, that's an interesting insight into some of the early days of the product, the concept. What are some of the things that you came across as you were building the product? What were some of the challenges?
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Yasmine:
              </strong>
              Well, I've never built a hardware company before. This is new territory. It's actually my fourth company, but still
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Cheap Revolution:
              </strong>
              It's your fourth startup?
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Yasmine:
              </strong>
              Fourth startup.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Cheap Revolution:
              </strong>
              Wow.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Yasmine:
              </strong>
              But, still kind of brand new in the hardware space. So, learning about that was really interesting, but a lot of fun. So, one of the earliest challenges that we had was how to design the prototype, how to make it so that it's functional, it's beautiful, it's something people would want to wear, and it's not accidentally triggered because you can just imagine that, like, someone accidentally brushes against the device and now, 911 is called and its not an emergency. So, how do you create it so that it works well, is easy to use, but also not so easy its accidentally triggered. That was our biggest design challenge within the company. And, yeah, hiring the right people helped a lot. And, then, we used is the lean startup methodologies. So, we test everything that we do. So, we've had focus groups. We've done some surveys. We held a mock self-defense class. We had people try things on to see how they may react to common moves with the device. And we even used them to help inform the process along the way.

                Before you embark on any path ask the question: Does this path have a heart? If the answer is no, you will know it, and then you must choose another path. The trouble is nobody asks the question; and when a man finally realizes that he has taken a path without a heart, the path is ready to kill him. At that point very few men can stop to deliberate, and leave the path. A path without a heart is never enjoyable. You have to work hard even to take it. On the other hand, a path with heart is easy; it does not make you work at liking it.

              To me, existing marijuana prohibition is nothing short of a violation of our civil liberties. I believe that it's an extension of unjust laws that were founded in racial prejudice and propaganda. Today, we imprison a disproportionate number of American citizens in large part due to marijuana prohibition. Furthermore, medicinal and therapeutic properties of cannabis are being discovered regularly; often providing relief where none could be previouslyfound. It's a plant - and it's a farce to think that the government can tell us how we can use nature. However, my position on this industry is a topic for another post.
             </p>
             <p>
              As you consider possible new business ties with the cannabis industry, I recommend you first consult with your inner circle for guidance and feedback. It's important that you check in with those most important in your life. You can't control what your broader network will say, but you can find out where your family stands.
             </p>
             <p>
              I checked in with family, close associates and friends ...and do you know what I found? It has been surprising how many people are ready for this change. Are you?

              One of my least favorite parts of a business is the legal process whether it's incorporating a company, devising the operating agreement, filing a provisional patent, trademarking a name or phrase, compiling the terms and conditions, and the list goes on and on. It's necessary and much-needed but I find it numbing to read the documents not to mention how time-consuming the process can be.

              It's also expensive and the fees can quickly add up depending on what your needs are. Luckily, there are more resources today than ever from free templates, discounted services, and legal resources.Below is a list of our favorites.

              As entrepreneurs, we sometimes find ourselves in a rut.  The work that fired us up when we started, has become dull and uninspired.  Pretty soon, you feel like you are punching a time clock.

              Steve Jobs famously said, "If I find myself not liking what I'm doing more than a few days, I stop - and go do something else."  Some find Jobs' attitude impratical and somewhat arrogant, but his allegiance to his in-born passion is undeniable.
