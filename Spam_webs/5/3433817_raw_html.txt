          I began collecting antique vibrators around 1997
                  when I began finding them while out hunting for
                  typewriters and other antiques. I thought some of
                  the vibrators were interesting so I began buying
                  them. I have been collecting aggressively and have
                  assembled an extensive collection with many unusual
                  examples.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is my public display for some of the more
                  unusual items in my collection. This site is new
                  and is little more then a shell of what I would
                  like to make it. Currently I am focusing on getting
                  more pictures posted with a little information
                  about the items. Only a portion of the collection
                  is currently represented on this web site, I plan
                  to add the majority of my collection as time
                  permits and there are many interesting items yet to
                  be added.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have two major objectives in developing this
                  site. The first is to provide a forum for the
                  public display of one of my more unusual
                  collections. The second is to create a resource of
                  information on the history of massage vibrators. I
                  use several sources of information for preparing
                  and updating this site and put considerable effort
                  into assuring the accuracy of the information
                  provided. Some information comes from books and the
                  web. Primary sources of information include trade
                  catalogs, advertisements, user manuals,
                  manufactures data plates, and patent records.

          The value of massage in physical therapy has
                  been well know for thousands of years and massage
                  is by no means considered medical quackery. From
                  the late 1800's to the early 1900's when medical
                  quackery was in it's heyday, vibrators were
                  marketed as a cure for all that ails you earning
                  them a classification as quack medical in the field
                  of collectibles.

          The vibrator has an especially amusing place in
                  medical history in that it was invented in the
                  1860's to aid doctors in the treatment of what was
                  then a common female nervous condition known as
                  hysteria. Independent scholar Rachel P. Maines
                  encountered the early history of the vibrator when
                  she began finding ads for vibrators in early
                  women's publications wile researching a graduate
                  study on textile arts in the late 1970's and early
                  1980's. After graduating Rachel Maines became
                  increasingly curious about the subject and began
                  extensive research into the history of vibrators.
                  She has published several papers on the subject and

          Why a person collects anything in particular is
                  a mystery often even to the people who collect.
                  There are a variety of reasons I will purchase a
                  particular vibrator for my collection. I am
                  especially interested in the very old or unusual
                  examples. Like many collectors I tend to develop
                  themes or groups within my collection and will
                  purchase items that fit in with established themes.
                  Some vibrators I acquire to fill in gaps in the
                  time line of design represented in my collection.
                  Many are purchased simply because I liked the name.
          <b>
           I am actively expanding this part of my
                  collection so if you have an item that you think
                  would go with my collection I would be delighted to
                  hear from you

          A note to researchers: I do try to find the time
                  to respond to request from researchers for
                  information but am often not that good at keeping
                  up with email. Try not to wait till the last minute
                  to ask questions. If I don't get back to you in a
                  few days sometimes it helps to email me again.
