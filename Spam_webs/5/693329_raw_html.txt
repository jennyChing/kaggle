             Public Broadcasting Station, Colorado Public Television (cpt12.org), have courageously thrust themselves at the forefront of our nations public service media network. CPT12 recently aired this powerful and controversial film as a featured premium during their Summer fundraising campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             The PBS national website then posted the re-broadcast which quickly became one of their Most Watched as well as Most Shared programs on PBS.  We are approaching the 11th year since that fateful day in September and more and more people are becoming aware that they havent gotten the whole story on 9/11.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over 1700 architects &amp; engineers are leading the way at AE911TRUTH, with dozens of additional professionals joining them in this documentary to put their careers on the line in their demand for a new independent investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             High-rise architects, structural engineers, scientists, physicists, chemists, scholars, educators, firefighters, forensic fire engineers, demolition experts and others have put together a ground-breaking scientific assessment of the events at the World Trade Center.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sudden, complete collapse of the third skyscraper on 9/11, WTC Building 7 at 5:20pm, is now being seen around the world as the smoking gun which disproves the official story about 9/11. These experts also introduce additional overwhelming evidence for a controlled demolition hypothesis at WTC which is disturbing to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
             The film does not speculate, and empathizes with viewers by also presenting the most popular segment of the film, which introduces the professional perspectives of eight psychologists who explain some of the reasons why it is so hard for people to face the scientific evidence. This is the most scientific and compelling 9/11 documentary film to date, containing vital information that demands action from all of us. We can no longer afford to ignore the World Trade Center evidence.
            </p>

                 This is not a conspiracy theory. Its a Physical Reality and its all based on Hard Science. There is a big difference between the two. I agree, Its not something that makes anyone warm and fuzzy but it was never about that. It was about Control and nothing is as effective as Fear for that.

                         The religion of the source of this information has no bearing on the evidence presented which is quite solid and refutes the claims of the government. Clearly you have bought into the hatred and are blinded to the facts.

                         kayla, there are two ways to win an argument, either by solid reasoning and evidences, or by simply silencing the others by mocking them and introducing fear in them! The one who inclines for the later tactic, obviously lack the first! And Chris is just emulating the DESIGNED popular behavior/reaction!

                         @Chris..After reading your comment and noting the lack of any real intelligence and common sense behind it (or rather the intelligence and common sense you would expect from an adult,) I reached the conclusion that you must be no older than 13 years old. Therefore, I will try to put this as nicely as possible: Sweetie, stick to playing your wii and let the grown ups do the talking in this forum.

                         Luis, I am so glad that I saw your reply, even if it I saw it 7 months later. Why? Because  I had NO idea that a condescending tone was reserved strictly for childrens use, or that the use of said tone by an adult relegated one to a child. You learn something new everyday on online. Thank you so much!!!!!
                         <br/>
                         By the way, your initial statement Oh my god you are all so fucking stupid is so amazingly adult that it made me feel like going to my room for a month. When it comes to being an adult you obviously have the right stuff!!!

                         You should be more carefull who you insult too. Many victims and families of victims have joined hands and are making this same statements. trying to get replies from the government (though not very effectively yet)! I dont believe them to be american haters, but american victims, who love their country as much as any other american, but are simply asking what was there blood sacrifice for, a very legitimit question in my opinion? I guess its easy for you to judge those who shows any sign of free thinking! Trying to intimidate and censure them by conditioning their questioning to being antipatriotic! Well, kindly answer my question, why would any one be an american hater or antipatriotic just for demanding the truth? You dont believe that the corner stone of over a decade of bloodshed all over the world do not deserve our consideration, and that we should just accept US oficial versions the same way we did in the WMDs of Iraq?

                       Or its so ridiculous why even justify the thought with a response? So many gullible people on here it was not an inside job. sorry you are wrong. I know it would be nice to think the government is this horrible thing that is taking our rights asway left and right (please tell me which rights have been stripped?) but its not true. SOrry you are wrong.

                   Evolution is settled science with no fossilized proof of one kind of animal becoming another. Global Warming is settled science with fraudsters creating data that support it and destroying data that debunk it. So much for settled science  its not an argument with a lot of credibility.

                 The Long Term Goal is NWO and Fighting Terrorism helps bring it about. The CIA (our left hand) and FBI create our Boogey Men for us so we dont have to ask to many questions. Meanwhile were borrowing from the Banksters  to Arm the world cause they sell one to our enemies so well buy two. Same reason CIA runs the Heroin Trade..  [They make bank (paid x2)]. The Left Hand can always guarantee it lands on our soil and they get paid when it does[paid first time] but because it does it is on American Soil we must fight it and Now We Fund them and the War On Drugs.. [paid second time]

                 Think about it, how many Rights have we lost so far in the war on terror Theyre using the Hegelian Dialectic and it works.  Problem  Reaction  Solution.. The solution is what they want to do already.. they just need the right problem so you will react and when you do, they have the perfect solution.. So when you see the problem you should instead be investigating the solution, hopefully before the problems are in the media.

                   I agree. When will the sheeple of the United States grow up and realize that there is no such thing as the lesser of 2 evils and break their 2 party {really just 1} addiction?

                     There are a lot of lunatics. Look at Einstines definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Look at the decades the sheeple of America have been voting the lesser of 2 evils. They are called the lesser of 2 evils because the people know neither should be elected. Yet election after election the sheeple vote the same way. Insane lunatics.

                         Its good to ask questions, but that isnt an argument. You shouldnt be here to ask questions, you should be here to answer them. By asking questions, youre admitting that you have no reason to believe in what you believe.  Look at all those stupid questions youre asking!  Who gives a shit?  Come back when you actually have answers, and not negative, dishonest debate tactics. Thank you!

                         Wow Ted, subjecting others not to rise questions would really serve you a medal in Nazi Germany, and Bush might already have given you a couple, but the thing is, that we demand out  resourceful governments to come with answers to our questions about their actions and responsibilities, and when their answers are unreasonable, we ask again, and failing to answer should lead to a kick in the ass, jail time and even head chop. Its a small little concept known as accountability, with out which no real democracy can be, so the question that follows is, are we in a real democracy?

                         Out of context.  Please pay attention.  People can ask all the questions they want, but when they attempt to make assertions and base them on questions alone, well, that wont get you anywhere at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The answers are actually already out there.. but you conspiracy buyers pretend as if they arent.  If you have questions, and feel there arent answers, then go Google it, or go out into the field and find them so they will be available on Google.
                         <br/>
                         Otherwise, dont come onto message boards, asking your otherwise seemingly ridiculous questions, trying to use them as evidence.  Thats not how the world works.

                         I agree, the answers are already there. So there stands some assertions alone: Such collapse defy the load and heat-load calculus. That out of the wreckage and after such an extraordinarily high temperature claimed fire, terrorists passports where retrieve defy common sense, its just another lie. BBC reported the third tower collapse 23 minutes before it actually happen, its a fact. Agencies confiscated all video proves of the pentagon crash, its a documented true. Witnesses claiming they heard a blast at the bottom of the building, plus the seismic readings, its again, documented and the assertions just go on and on, and as a causality of this assertions, questions rise upon why the official version does not matches the evidence. So let me make you clear that contrary to what you suggest in a deplorable attempt to undermine the evidence by use of faulty dialectics, our questions are base in our assertions!

                         My dear friend, for an atheist you do seem to keep a strong hold of faith in empty theories! The main different between the official crazy bullshit and this crazy bullshit is that Official version had strong channels and
                         <br/>
                         spread fast, far and deep. By the time people start to wonder, drums of
                         <br/>
                         war and patriotism where already sounding, so rising questions was
                         <br/>
                         socially rejected, thus making people auto-censure themselves and switch
                         <br/>
                         their brains off! The same way people dont dare to question what is written on a book cause its suppose to come from a some sort of divine authority, and choose not to pass those words through the filter of logic!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         People dont like to get involve, they just require a model that would explain their realities in order to satisfy their basic nature and need of knowing and control, and are more than happy to let their government create those models for them with out questioning. Let me make you clear that Im not some sort of anarchist who wants to see the government burn, but to the contrary, I believe that the authority and legitimacy of it, is condition to them to honor their oath to the people, furthermore, every promise made at a pre-election should be accounted for too, and the moment they dont compel, they lose their legitimacy of their authority! Obviously, no one should be taking any sort of action with out proper prove, and the truth in it self doesnt qualify as prove,  for this purpose all we demand is an independent serious investigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         As our craziness, many G20 governments supports that the official version and investigation were and are conveniently faulty, and this includes governments such as the German! So after all, maybe our claims are not as crazy as they might seem, but I do not expect a fanatic and blind devote follower like yourself to be able to see that!

                         The facts simply dismantles the Official Version. Which leaves us with a huge vacuum, which we fill with logically reasoned hypothesis, and further demand proper independent investigations in order to either verify those hypothesis or propose alternative hypothesis which satisfy the so called common sense criteria! You can choose to believe that the official version is the only truth, and everything else is bullshit! But do not expect to subject the rest of the world to your will and view! Cause if every person in this planet decided to adopt your attitude, this already F..cked up planet of us would be in a much worse state! And you would now be sitting in some wood shelter, believing that the earth is flat and that there are dangerous dragons waiting for you to adventure into the oceans in order to serve them an heady meal!!

                         Well, until you get evidence that supports your conspiracy theory, its just a ridiculous guess.
                         <br/>
                         Sorry, nothing will dismantle the official version except evidence in support, which you have none of.

                         Excuse me, but do you see the lack of coherence in your words? It is you who claims to advocate for the ONLY POSSIBLE TRUTH, its you who are subjecting other to not question the official version, and then here you are, lecturing us about being religious! Well, if you believe common sense and logical reasoning to be a religion what ever! Plus you further gift us with your lack of coherence by stating that we will say anything! When its you, who is writing incoherently!! When blind denial, mocking and insults are your main arguments, it just proves that you have actually got no argument at all. You have just defeated the purpose, there is no debate or reasoning here, so it futile, I do not see the need to further reply you or read you, so why dont you go back and do your home work, attaboy!

                         You see, opinions are as valuable as the people who make them. Thus your view and statements carry less weight and meaning than your farts. So feel free to continue jerking off what ever shit comes from your brain. But as I have already said, your farts are more coherent and valuable than the words you speak or write. So good luck in your life, its evident that you are gonna need heavy doses of it! Now that you have expose how a retard you are, we couldnt care less about your views or comments!

                         Religion has sweet fu#$all to do with it Ted. However Ted the sceptic believes the official version that 911 was perpetrated  by alchoholic drug taking free-riders who couldnt even fly a cesna and were able to get past the best air defense in the world, who just happened to be living next door to the FBI   all co-ordinated by a ghost in a cave in Afghanistan. And a passport from one of them survived the impact and was found on the pavement intact. With NO security footage of them boarding the planes. Grey military planes that were not anything close to the commercial ones. Hundreds of witness reports from Firemen and people who were there reporting EXPLOSIONS. WTC 7 which was not hit by a plane magically freefalls to the ground from a couple of fires  the very same building that just happened to house the IRS, US Secret  Service and  the Office of Emergency Management ! When FEMA was there the day BEFORE.The entire US Military machine was busy practicing  drills with mock hijacked aircraft flying all over the place. Even though half the hijackers turned out to be Saudi Arabian pilots who are still alive and doing just fine and no hijacker HAS EVER BEEN TRIED in a court of law. It just goes on and on but Ted the sceptic still believes that there are sophisticated bunkers in the caves of Afghanistan and weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq.Please enlighten us Ted as to why you still believe in all this bullshit ??

                         Yes. But its okay for you to call anyone questioning the official version a conspiracy nut  right ? Come to think of it you really havent said ANYTHING and havent responded to any of the countless points raised here. If there is a gormless metronome ticking towards its own destruction it is you Ted. You HAVE PRESENTED NOT ONE SHRED OF SUPPORT  for the official version that a couple of oxygen-starved fires that burned for 2 hours turned 2 of the most massive and strongest buildings ever built into dust in a couple of seconds. But hey thats okay because you dont believe in God.Which makes you clever and special.Do me a favour Ted and answer this one teeny weeny question. Why did WTC 7 freefall into the ground ? Lets see if you have a response even if it is limited. My guess is that you will revert to form and have NOTHING TO SAY  about it.And that pretty much sums you up. Empty vessels make the most noise.

                         Yes, its ok for me to call these conspiracy theorists nuts because they have no evidence for their claims.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         There is nothing to respond to because there is no evidence to respond to. There are only their questions and disinformation, which is easily covered on the debunking conspiracy sites already.

                         Um, there is plenty of evidence for the obvious version of what happened. Its quite well known why the towers fell. You see, people make up conspiracy theories for kicks, and then watch as people act like sheep and buy into them, as you have.  Now, its become like a religion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You see, you have no evidence to show it was any other way, yet you think your concerns (unwarranted) are good enough.. they arent, sorry.

                         Ted you are beyond help. The real victims are people like you who are unable to think for themselves and believe the nonsense put out by the establishment. The truth will come out eventually and 911 is and will remain one of the landmark events in human history. Once again your post is devoid of any content. When you finally realize that you have been lied to you will be disgusted by your own gullability. The US of A has been waging war around the planet for the last 50 years, has bombed more than 50 countries and to this day is involved in the illegal and  immoral murder and destruction of countless people.What the fu$k  do you think has happened in Afghanistan and Iraq ? I suppose you think the Iraqis should thank you for invading their country and murdering their citizens ? It is people like you that support the evil state and you have blood on your hands. Who killed JFK Ted ? People like you Ted. Sheeple like you.Take your disgust and shove it up your ass.Your self-satisfied smugness reeks of ignorance and arrogance. I have never had to endure such condescension from someone who is so utterly clueless.

                         Um, it makes no sense to tell a skeptic, whom goes by the evidence presented and not by conspiracy theories, that he is beyond help on the topic. O_o

                         Yea, you say the truth will come out eventually.. yea, sure it will.  When was this, 2001? And its what, 2013? Need another 10+ years?

                         Theyve been saying that forever.. kind of like the Christians saying that Jesus will be back soon! haha
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         If there is new information that comes out, and its convincing, and it goes against what we know now, then so be it  THEN.  Until THEN, we go by what we know to be true.  We dont jump on bandwagons beforehand.

                         Im totally against the wars weve been doing. But the wars weve been doing and your conspiracy theory are two different topics.

                         You really are as thick as a brick. If you cant make the connection between the War on Terror and 911 and invading Afghanistan and Iraq then I dont know.You should do yourself a favour and go to the library and start to read a bit about history and war and economics. If you dont realize that the American WAR MACHINE is kept busy by people who CONSPIRE to CREATE WARS then you know nothing. For Heavens sake Ted spewing bullshit on sites like these is not gonna get you educated. Here is a list of some of the countries that America has bombed since World War 2 ( I say some because you never know what the dirt shadow government is up to )

                         I have made thermite and thermate from ingredients off eBay and I got the results found at wtc.  The pentagon Show me any plane crash with no wreckage?  The USA has carried out false flag operations before many times. Look it up!  Any idiot can see the explosions listen to firemen describe hearing explosions and again Find ANY steel building that collapsed due to fire. And show any building collapse that is that neat without being controlled. How stupid must you be to believe the official story. Very!

                         The answers are in the video  and theyre well supported by expert opinion and academic references, along with common sense   the only baseless assertions here are yours! You sir are simply a troll in denial and until you have a rebuttal to the EVIDENCE presented arent worth our time.

                         If they are in the video, why are they being asked so much? So no, they are NOT in the video. Only ridiculous interpretations and disinformation.  Hah expert opinion and academic references &lt; too funny.  Oh yes, "common sense" &lt; Yea, sure buddy.

                         youre actually a moron, if you dont ask questions how do you get answers? what im seeing here is alot of people posting piles and piles of evidence and lots of people ignoring it and saying prove it? well you prove it was terrorists and only terrorists and that the governments official statements are factual.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         oh wait you cant otherwise you would have much earlier in this discussion. you arent proving anybody wrong youre just making a mockery of other people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         now im not saying its an inside job i dont know who committed the attacks on the wtc, but i can look at all of the evidence on offer and make a sensible conclusion and if you sit here and dismiss all of the evidence in this video and say no i believe whatever someone said in a conference on NBC or ABC or FOX or any of the other 1% funded media outlets you are blind and morose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         think about it mate, what on earth did muslims have to gain from that attack? nothing do you think they really wanted to incite a war that they had little chance of winning?

                         Logical? Are you fucking high on bath salts? Lets see nefarious forces withing the government want to make the population scared, so they fly planes into buildings but also plant a load of explosives in the buildings, but wait several hours to destroy Building 7 and crash one plane into a field in Pennsylvania but instead of a plane in the Pentagon they just go ahead with a cruises missile, and land the plane that was supposed to crash their at a secret air force base and then machine gun all the passengers and crew thousands of people are in on the conspiracy, including a culpable media and more than a decade later not ONE PERSON spills the beans not one leak, not one whistleblower????  Yeah, so logical.

                     Anyone who types the word SHEEPLE in SCREAMING ALL CAPS is a moron of the highest caliber. I love how you Conspiratards think that youre privy to the real story, and that anyone who questions you utter bullshit is a government rube. Plenty of us are against the NSA and the gathering police state. It doesnt mean 9/11 was an inside job. It just wasnt. Every major assertion you droolers make has been repeatedly debunked, but you are so wedded to your view of events that to actually admit your taking a gullet full of jizz from the likes of Alex Jones would make you lose face so much that youll never admit to it.

                       Prove it wasnt.  Show me the proof.  You cant, can you? Because there ~is no proof~ that it ~wasnt~ an inside job.  All the hard evidence points to an inside job. Explosives in the buildings, explosions on the ground floor (How could an explosion happen some 40 stories below the point of impact, BEFORE the plane hits?  Oh, and people who think that anyone who uses the word Sheeple is a moron, are the worst possible people. What? Its true because I say it is..ohwait..thats an opinion, and opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one, and they all stink. Yours just happens to be slightly more odoriferous than most.  And no, it WASNT repeatedly Debunked. Not by actual scientists in ~independent~ studies that werent government funded.  Any real scientist would tell you that those buildings coming down at near-free-fall speeds without help from human beings would be practically impossible.

                   yes, those other tragedies happened, no doubt about it. i think this doc is more about the inconsistencies in how the commission explained off the structural failures due to fire of the towers

                   If youve ever seen plane crashes before Ive never seen one like the Pentagon where a speeding plane of that size can come in and hit a building the way this one did. It would have to come in at a very low level and maintain that level to do a direct hit like this one. Look at how the plane imploded upon impact in Pennsylvania. It just doesnt happen like that at the Pentagon in my eyes????

                         Really!!  There was no airplane crash at the Pentagon??  Then what did the thousands of pairs of eyeballs on the ground see?  My father saw the crash from his office in Arlington and he wasnt prone to having hallucinations.  No wreckage, you say??  Again, REALLY??!!  It was scattered across the lawn of the Pentagon  and there was plenty of live coverage from the Pentagon of firefighters extinguishing the burning fuselage.

                     Isnt the Pentagon airspace a no fly zone for commercial aircrafts as well? I mean they shouldve had jets up in seconds once it entered near their airspace.

                   Yeah the thing that hit the Pentagon was a cruise missile. It was painted up in the same scheme as the American Airlines. There is proof out there that the military has painted these things to look like airliners. That explains the localized explosion and the reduced size of the hole. Funny none of the video they have shows anything close to the size of an airliner crashing into the Pentagon. If you blink during the video you miss the tiny blur that races into the Pentagon. Cruise missiles travel at high speeds which would have needed a high speed camera to see it. A regular camera would have caught the plane on its way in. Sorry no plane at the Pentagon.

                         The oil, for our allies and the world economy was important, but more important was destabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan, the way we have destabilized the Korean peninsula. Next, we wanted the strategic location. All of this supports our economy.

                         We get free oil. We trade paper dollars for oil. We trade paper dollars for everything. Iraq, Libya, Iran, Syria, all wanted to trade their oil for gold, or non-petrodollars. We needed an excuse to get the folks behind an anti-Muslim bogeyman war.

                       Theres no film footage of the plane or its occupants publicly available. There are four frames of CCTV camera footage from the most-watched building on the planet!

                       There was, however, alleged black box recorder data released under a FOI request from pilotsfor911truth.org and the commercial, airline and military pilots associated with the site closely analysed the data, running it through flight-sims to plot out actual flightpaths, altitudes etc for the flight. Their conclusion was that at the supposed point of impact into the Pentagon, the plane must have been at around 150 feet, not skimming the lawn. Go and watch their videos and then come back here to discuss the interesting questions they raise about the official explanations and why none of them are completely accurate. Always remain sceptical, because theres no way the official narrative can be true with all the factual evidence showing it to be impossible. Thats not to say there are inside-jobs going on here, but theres certainly a cover-up of some sort. Whether thats a cover-up of ineptitude or something more sinister it still needs to be reinvestigated to get to the real truth of what happened that day. Its the only way critics will be satisfied and the memories of the dead be truly honoured.

                   You mean how there was no documented or filmed evidence to confirm any plane wreckage ever occurred at the pentagon? Look all you like, you wont see any, fucking joke it is. All the passenger manifests on all 4 planes were fake. This is a great site to really read about the inconsistencies of those flights :

                     You may be the dumbest person Ive ever responded to.   Every person on those planes was real and all the families are still here and there is plenty of pieces of the plane.

                         Yes. There are photographs of an absolutely pristine lawn with no wreckage.Then there are photographs of agents carrying wreckage onto the pretty lawn. There is a tiny little hole in the building(before the collapse). There are no holes for the wings or engines.There are eye witnesses who were right there when not a plane flew over them. Have you investigated this at all? Or does it just seem obvious to you ? Do you believe the pilots when they say it is impossible for that plane to have done what it is supposed to have done ? Or are they just making it up ?

                   can you say for certain that they actually happened? Then again, how many times has someone killed people at random when they were only after 1 target? Why did Bush fly the Afghanistans out of the country after the no fly went into effect? The very ones that claimed responsibility. Why did it take all those years to catch the  bad  guy with todays modern surveillance and why was the body disposed of before anyone could see it? Way to many unanswered questions to just accept the main stream media explanation.

                 When The towers came down I watched this as it was relayed over and over on every channel  and my first reaction was that it was too controlled to be a tragic occurrence of jet fuel burning a building.  I knew instinctively that it was a controlled demo but no one would listen to me and over and over from family and friends I heard the words I refuse to believe. I stopped talking about it because no one would listen.

                         to know instinctively suggests subconscious weighing of evidence leading to a judgement without full cognition of the reasons for it. Perfectly reasonable as far as Im concerned considering that the footage looked like a controlled demolition and explosions below the fall were visible.

                         a controlled demolition might have been spot at the time by a trained eye (per example, professionals of that field) but for a normal person, its quite hard to arrive to that conclusion, not till he search about it and compare the towers video with other controlled demolitions, or other buildings in fire! So I must disagree with you. What did made me wonder at the time, was the collapse of a third tower! And the little covering it was getting! Later I read that bbc informed about the collapse moments earlier before it actually happen, which indicates the implementation of a planned communication strategy, but could never confirm the later! nevertheless, at the time, it was strange how little covering and desinformation about the third tower was in place.

                         well Im afraid I have to disagree because footage of controlled demolitions is widely available even on mainstream television and i consider it to be quite possible to subconsciously make that connection, the brain is very quick to recognise things that are the same. I believe this would leave to a gut feeling.

                         Well, I have to admit that if the subconsciousness had to find similarities of the images of 911 with footage registered in ones brain, most likely it would be controlled demolition footage, as footage of skyscrapers in fire collapsing in the same fashion are practically non-existent!

                       Thats the point youre missing. The truthers dont KNOW the govt was behind it. They suspect it may have been involved and thus are looking for the truth one way or another  the clue is in the name.

                   I have to admit that at the time, i show no reason to undermine the official version. I was to shock from what my eyes where watching, and had little information at the time. But there is one simple rule wich I follow in order to make sense of things, though it can;t be applied instantly, but in retrospect, and that is to see who got the bigger benefit out of it, and you probably end up with the responsible in the first place! Plus the government reaction at the aftermath was and is a joke!

                   the demo was ready to go before the attack, they were just waiting for the planes to crash and then the plan would unfold and the wars could begin, clowns

                     How could you possibly know that? It is a guess that explosives were planted. Its a fact it was hit by planes. I give up.

                       also a fact that no plane debri was found at the pentagon, and a fact that the buildings crumbled down exactly as professional demolition people do it, a fact that top managers were not inside the towers at the moment, a fact that you see explosions in the biulding even before the planes crashed, a fact that there are diagonal cuts in metal structure at an incredible precise angle, and a fact that 99% of people in the US have their brains washed.

                         Your Pentagon assertion is absolute bullshit. There are photos of clear jetliner debris on the lawn just outside. The plane penetrated deeply into the 2nd ring of the building at incredible velocity, obliterating much of it and making most of what debris there was not visible from the outside. Hundreds of eye-witnesses saw a plane crash into the building and have attested to it, but I suppose they all were drugged by the CIA or were just crisis actors. I am just amazed at the ludicrous lengths 9/11 Truthers will go to convince themselves of their preposterous theories. You guys are like brainwashed cult members. Anyone who points to the real, overwhelming evidence that the Towers and the Pentagon were hit with planes piloted by Al Qaeda members, that no explosives were involved, are shouted down as sheeple or whatever full-tard word you toss around like a ten cent frisbee.

                         that supposed debri was just enough for a lawnmower crash, not a plane lol, plus the analysis of no WINGS (with jetfuel) on the sides of the crash hole, all BULLSHIT there was no plane

                         Ted, you should go back to school and take some physics.  You think a building can come straight down at free-fall, fall into its own footprint, without controlled demolition? Well they could sure use your knowledge in Las Vegas. Next time they want to build a new casino just let Ted start a few fires and it will cook for a couple hours and come straight down. Really Ted, go back to school By the way, Jet fuel is 80%   kerosene. That would be like holding a steel rod over a candle. You think it would blow up.  Try it, like Stephen said, fire wont melt steel.   Well it will at very high temps, over 2700 degrees.  That fire was 1700 degrees.  Even if it was 3000 degrees it could still not come down it 11 seconds. Maybe you should watch this video a few more times to let it sink in. Remember from 6th grade, a thing in motion remains in motion unless acted upon by another force.  Did you make it all the way to 6th grade?

                         Dude, your 9/11 conspiracy stuff is like a religion. You dont have to do this to yourself.   If all you have are questions, then youll get nowhere.
                         <br/>
                         Its really sad to see stupid people like you think the world works other than it does, and inside on it, even in light of obvious evidence to the contrary.

                         Steel does not need to melt in order to lose structural strength.  It only needs to soften, which it begins to do in the 600 deg.F range.  At 1800 deg. a steel beam will soften enough to bend under its own weight.  Steel (in fact, all metals)  also transmit heat over long distances w/very little loss of energy.  With a 1700 F fire raging for 45 minutes, even the foundational steel will soften to the point of losing all structural strength and integrity..

                         Once again, I have been given no data. There is no evidence of this conspiracy.. just people thinking they can ask questions and think that that would be good enough.  Its not. Do you have any evidence? No, right? Then I guess you look pretty stupid right now for your above comment.

                         Just watch a freakin video of the towers EXPLODING and take it from there you numbskull. You obviously know nothing about nothing and seem quite proud of it. As an Architect I can tell you that high rise buildings are built to withstand fire. NO steel frame building has EVER collapsed from fire and you just will not see it happening. It is interesting that the FIREPROOFING on the steel at the WTCs had asbestos in it. Those buildings were a health hazard and were set for demolition. But hey it would have been too expensive to demolish conventionally and would have shut down Manhattan. You obviously havent thought about any of this ???????

                 Most of us that lived through the disgraceful tragedies of the Vietnam era dont see the USA as necessarily the good guys, anymore.  Still, the strong indication of demolition from the inside does not in any way prove that the government or forces within the government, were necessarily involved.  I would certainly look at a man like dick cheney, and without a doubt believe that the man COULD be involved in something this malignant, (others also come to mind) it just does not make enough sense to me that people like this were necessarily involved.  Members of the same group of people that took over those planes, could also have been planting detonating materials, could have been embedded in some jobs that gave access to the parts of the building necessary, etc.

                   well said, very few countries anymore have any respect for america, they are the playground bully that cries when it dosnt get what it wants, then goes and destroys lives and countless countries just in an attempt to take what it wants and to feel bigger than everybody else, some of the stuff theyve pulled off over the years have astouneded me, from using nuclear weapons and chemical weapons on innocent people to saying you cant use chemical weapons, so now we are coming to invade to HELP out in this situation because its wrong but not wrong when america does it, its so so sad to see though that most americans still dont see this and so they cant shun this image of themselves, theyll never be repsected because of this, ofcourse i dont blame the people, some are sheep and just simply happy living their day to day lives in ignorance, others arnt, but either way its no one persons fault.

                 Yeah, i agree the whole thing stinks a bit, but exactly how, we dont really know and maybe never will..There are still so many questions to make you doubt about every different theory..But somehow in the whole, they wanted to start some war and it did no matter how many lives it costed..Thats very scary people..

                         Except that the video was full of evidence, both physical and circumstantial, along with a surprising number of academics and experts in agreement. Theres evidence, yet you have no rebuttal, just denial and a refusal to even consider another point of view.

                         Buildings are designed to resist overturning moment.  They have very deep piles that resist this (due to wind etc).  If you watch the video, the place where the planes hit fails first.  This weakened the columns and trusses until they buckled, causing the top portion of the tower to colapse upon it.  Towers are not designed for that kind of shock or load.  If you know anything about physics and vectors, you know that forces act in one direction and cause reaction in the same direction.  If I push you backward, you dont fall sideways.  So once the top portion of the tower failed, it created a domino effect on the rest of the building.  THAT is how the building fell the way it did.  BTW, I am a PE.

                         Ok so did you watch the parts of the video that showed that whilst the top of the tower weakened and fell it would have met too much resistance to create a domino effect? the structural integrity of the rest of the building would have been intact and as such able to withstand that weight. evidence was also presented to suggest that the tower was in fact designed for that kind of load, it was a steel structure not a house of cards.

                         The buildings were designed for MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE IMPACTS. They could easily have handled the impact. The buildings dont even move when the planes hit. The planes shouldnt even have penetrated the steel facade ( planes are made of aluminium see ).Pity that the Project Manager for the WTCs mysteriously diappeared after 911. There is no buckling as you suggest but simply free fall failure.Physicists who have analysed the energy of the free falling top section conclude that it would NOT have been strong enough to destroy the building. Collapse also would not have have PULVERISED 600 000 TONS OF CONCRETE AND STEEL INTO DUST.You never see that top section coming down because it is BLOWN UP in mid air.

                         Any Scientist or Engineer who looks at this (and there are many who have if you care to look ) knows that the official story is bullshit. Please reconsider your conclusions. PS I am an Architect.

                         PS Im an Engineer and I know Architects know nothing about structural engineering.  All your assertions are bullshit.. The top portion doesnt blow up you would see that.  The pieces of building would have been blown out.  If youre talking about controlled demolition, then yes, there would have been buckling.  Thats what controlled demolition relies on.  The problem wasnt the impact, clearly the building stood for a while after impact.  The buildings DID withstand the impact.  It was the impact AND the fire the brought them down.  Many scientists and Engineer HAVE looked at it and the MAJORITY dont believe it was cotrolled demolition.  There are crazies in every field.  Cars are mostly plastic but they penetrate buildings ALL THE TIME when someone loses control.  These steel buildings also have a lot of glass.   What makes you think a plane would just bounce off the building instead of penetrating it.  I know as an Arichitect you should have some understanding of physics but you clearly didnt pay much attention.

                         Thanks for the generalized insult about Architects. You obviously havent watched any good videos of the WTC demolition. You can clearly see the building fragments being laterally ejected which is impossible in the case of a gravity- driven progressive collapse. The fantasy concocted by NIST does not explain the explosiveness (for the love of God watch some decent videos) , systematic pulverisation of concrete and steel (this is not possible in a collapse) speed and symmetry of the collapse. NISTS assumption that collapse initiation will inevitably lead to global collapse is unfounded and unscientific. In the full scale tests conducted by NIST on the effects of fire on the trusses they did not collapse. Even the sagging was insignificant. Even when they tested unfireproofed steel they could not get the trusses to collapse after 5 hours of fire far hotter than what could have been achieved in the WTCS !THis is from NIST ! How is it Rachel that most of the columns and beams came down in 30 foot sections ? Is that from buckling ? Please explain what happened to the 600 00 TONS of concrete and steel that should have been piled up at least 5 stories high ? It was turned to dust.Dont you think its interesting that NIST left out Building 7 ? Have you read any of their joke of a report.
                         <br/>
                         You dont seem to understand that any Architect, Engineer or Scientist who comes out against the official story is putting his career at risk. As have all the brave and genuine Architects and Engineers for 911 TRUTH. People you so glibly refer to as crazies. What an insult ! Have you heard the countless testimonies of Firemen who were there that heard explosions ? Testimonies that NIST chose to IGNORE.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Cars are not mostly plastic ! The engines and chassis (structural skeleton) are made form steel and aluminium. Aluminium would disintegrate on impact with steel.Yes I do have some understanding of physics and am deeply passionate about Architecture. Do you really think that any high rise building that is built is not designed to withstand fire. As an Architect I have experience with this and I can tell you that the fire requirements for such a building are extremely exhaustive.Why have NO OTHER STEEL FRAME buildings ever experienced global collapse from fire in the History of Construction !!!!!! You are obviously NOT and Engineer and I would warn you against mouthing off about something that is extremely important to Humanity and the Construction Industry.

                    what part of any of that makes people stupid exactly? i mean are you trying to tell me that the american government hasnt done this before? because there is proof for that, its called history, you should try looking into it mate, its not hard to use your brain instead of dismissing something without proper basis, if you think that tower fell like a controlled destruction yet was due to the plane that hit it nowhere near the bottom of the tower. then you are truely stupider than you think, sorry, but its true.

                 Any Jackass who can watch the videos, see the evidence of an inside job, and still claim it wasnt, should just shut the hell up and go back to being the obedient little sheeple they are, because thats what the government wants. Obedient, uneducated (Read: STUPID) people they can turn into wage slaves, etc..
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anytime you present people like Tim W. Brown with evidence to support an inside job, they roll their eyes as if they cant possibly compute that evil dictators can come from anywhere, even the US.  Hitler wasnt the first evil superpower, and he certainly wont be the last.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hitler used a False Flag Operation to kick off WWII.  ~OUR~ government committed to a False Flag Operation on 9/11 to get the citizenry to follow angrily, blindly behind them into the War on Terror against Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Heres a bit of wisdom for the lot of you knuckleheads out there who think this is a war that can be won.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You are incorrect, and I have to say you must be really fucking stupid if you believe that wad of garbage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The root word of that whole phrase is Terror.  Where there are evil people wanting to scare the living shit out of a populace, there will be terrorism. As long as HUMANITY exists, there will be people causing terror to other people for property, money, or other gains.  You bought into this war hook, line, and sinker.  Thanks a whole fucking lot for that, by the way, because now the whole goddamn world hates us, and its the citizenrys fault for not DOING something about it!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Oh..And one more thingWe werent supposed to see Saddam get Hanged and beaten, but it was leaked.
                </p>
                <p>
                 How the fuck did Osama Bin Laden die without anyone ever getting a photo of him?  All those Photos of dead Bin Laden you see are fucking PHOTOSHOPPED. Not one of those photos is real, ESPECIALLY the one where it looks like he got shot through the eye. Thats the face of another Afghan Militant who got shot in the face at least 2 years before Bin Laden was killed super-imposed onto another persons head.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So explain to me how we got leaked footage of a dispicable despot like Saddam being hanged and bludgeoned, but we didnt get any of the Real Bin Laden being shot, or at least the aftermath of it?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Burial at Sea..huh..they didnt do that with Saddam, or any other Terrorist, now, did they?  I call bullshit on the whole thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Because he either doesnt actually exist, or they never really killed him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Bin Laden confession tape for 9/11 is also FAKE. Anybody who has seen Bin Laden knows what he looks like and sounds like.  The man on that tape was NOT Bin Laden. His nose was too big, his face was too chubby, his beard was wrong, and his voice was completely off.  Go back, look at that video, and compare it to photos of Bin Laden.  Also, the video quality was SHIT compared to any other time Bin Laden has been on tape talking about ~anything~.  When Bin Laden is on film, its high quality film, not some 1980s camcorder garbage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 YOu ignorant fucks do know what Evidence is, right?  You know..that stuff they use to convict murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc
                </p>
                <p>
                 People like me have shown you non-believers the HARD, IRREFUTABLE evidence for 11 years nowMOUNTAINS OF IT, but you still turn a blind eye because youre too goddamned ignorant to see the truth for what it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Go ahead, keep your heads in the sand. It wont stop the government from raping your upturned asses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But Ill present some evidence for you to pour over, anyway, because Im such a nice fucking guy.

                 Traces of Thermite were found at Ground Zero. POOLS of liquid hot thermite and melted steel were found at the bottom of the rubble that burned in excess of 3,000 degrees for more than 3 weeks.  WHy the fuck would there be thermite in the WTC?  Its not like they were doing construction on it when this all went down, so why was thermite and melted steel pooring out of the sides of the building, accompanied by the white smoke that indicates Thermite burn-off?  Why did they find steel girders still standing that were cut at 45degree angles, but not cut traditionally, cut with the only chemical that can burn through steel, which they use in controlled demolitions?  BECAUSE IT WAS AN INSIDE JOB.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Eye-witness reports claim that there were explosions coming from the bottom of the buildings just before the planes hit.  Video footage shows this smoke pooring from the first floor windows and doorways.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Video footage shows explosions occurring below the point of impact as the towers started to collapse in on themselves.  You cant seriously tell me that air pressure caused all of those explosions 10-20 stories BELOW the pancaking portions of the building.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No bodys were found of ANY of the victims from the planes. Not even a finger or a hair folicle.  No, they didnt burn up on impact because Jet fuel does not burn long enough, or hot enough, to destroy evidence of that nature. There would be bones, and blackened bodies raining down onto the plaza. It didnt happen..Why?  Because there were no people on board the planes aside from the hijackers, several of which were found later, quite alive and well and surprised to find out they were supposed hijackers.  Nobodys heard from them since.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Eye-witness reports state that one of the hijacked passenger airliners made an unscheduled stop earlier that morning at another airport (Perhaps a military base, Im not entirely sure).  All of the passengers were ushered into a hangar and never seen again.  Could it be these people were paid off to go to other countries, change their names, and never come back?  If someone offered you a million bucks to change your name and move to the country of your choice, youd do it, Im sure, especially if it were in the interest of National Security?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Leaked footage from the Pentagon showing that ~NO~ airliner hit it.  Instead, what we see is a cylyndrical object, much smaller than a passenger airliner, colliding with the side of the building. the ONLY evidence they found was a single jet engine that was too small to fit a Passenger airliner, but was, coindicentally just large enough to fit a missile, and eyewitnesses reported either hearing or seeing a fighter jet in the vicinity, flying lower than usual over the buildings.  There were no bodies, other than those caught within the Pentagon at the time.  Ironically, most of the people who were there were sent to the other side of the building for unknown reasons earlier that morning.  Also, in all that footage of the pentagon?  Not ONE downed power line or light post.  Youd think that if a passenger liner came in on the trajectory the investigators claimed it had, every pole within 200 yards or more would have been snapped in half by the wingspan of the passenger liner itself. There would also have been more debris had an actually passenger liner hit the pentagon, and it would have been spread over a much wider area, and youd be able to see a tail section, part of a cockpit, a wing, even.  But, no, there is none of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The passenger liner they say crashed into the Pennsylvania fieldWhere is it?  In all that footage, there were no bodies, no real debris..just a trench/crater where they say it went down.  They say they found the little black box, but I doubt it.  The black box doesnt even coincide with their story of oh, the plane disintegrated on impact.  If the crash was that powerful, that it destroyed bone, teeth, steel, in such a manner that there wasnt a piece big enough to hold in one hand left, then how the hell did they find a Black Box?  They changed their story shortly after to say oh, well, the ground here is really soft, so the plane buried itself in the ground..  I call bullshit on this one, too.  I dont care how soft it is, when 200 tons of airliner hits the ground, theres going to be a huge explosion, body parts, plane parts, etc.  Planes are not solid objects, theyre hollow, and as a result, when hitting the ground, tend to crumple in the same manner a beer can does against a rednecks forehead, only more explosively, because of the jet fuel.  No bodies, no burned treesand a debris field roughly 2 miles away.hmmmmmmm

                <p>
                 NORAD was told to Stand Down.  Imagine that..In the midst of a Terrorist Strike, NORAD, those people who police the skies and scramble fighter jets, told the Air force to Stand down, and grounded all military aircraft.  Why the fuck would they do that, unless they KNEW something was going on that they were told to keep on the hush-hush?
                </p>
                <p>
                 And the biggest evidence of all?
                </p>
                <p>
                 George W. Bush was still reading to children in an elementary school classroom when the terrorist attack went down.  Every president weve ever had, when weve been attacked, has been ushered ~immediately~ to safety by the Secret Service.  Bush was as calm as a stagnant pond when he was told, and he remained that calm.  He didnt get up or go anywhere to be kept safe, he kept reading.  The only reason this could happen in such a way, is that if there ~was no outside threat~ to the nation, and that Bush was in on the False Flag Operation and knew about it before it even happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Dont reply to me unless you can refute ALL of the evidence presented here, because I dont have time to listen to sheeple try to make sense of the bullshit theyve been led to believe.

                         So according to you architects and engineers should start constructing buildings on simple trial bases. maybe construct an skyscraper in an uninhabited location, and if it holds for fifty years, then construct the proper one in the city. As all their load-calculus and heat load calculus is ambiguous and useless!

                     Stephen is correct regarding Williams evidence and assessment.  It may be helpful if you considered whether or not you are the brain-washed idiot, Chris.  It certainly looks like you have fallen for the hate a Muslim prejudice which was the goal so that you wouldnt poke much more closely into the facts.  Best wishes on you spelling course.

                   I am sorry for the overwhelming rage that burns in you when confronted with the a@holes who think that the official story is believable at any level.  I used to communicate (email) with a woman who lives in North Dakota (I live in BC, Canada).  I have gone through all the Evidence that you have, and she says that everything I say is just too weird.  She had only the crap in the Popular Mechanics planted story to justify the science.  She is not stupid, but there is some huge defensive wall that is protecting her ego from being scared out of her mind.  In the end, though, she is just as much a part of the problem as Mr. Cheney.  Dont people wonder why a duly constituted International Court found both Bush and Cheney and others in that Administration guilty of crimes against humanity?  Anyway, I share the rage, but I am an old guy now and I know it is not great for our health to let things generate the acid rush.  So?  Nothing  just sending you my best wishes and hopes that well see some Justice before we die.  (Jordan/Tarl)

                 More conspiracy theory bullshit.  When are these idiots going to grow up and realize they have absolutely no evidence whatsoever  only questions questions questions  thinking that thats good enough to constitute as evidence?
                 <br/>
                 There is no reason to ask people to answer questions. If you have an alternate theory as to what happened, present it.. dont ask questions.  If youre asking questions, then you dont have enough data yet, and you need to STFU.

                 Cmon people.  You have to deny the evidence of the people on the plane that crashed in PA, talking to their loved ones live by phone, that theyd been hijacked by muslims.  You Truthers are effing crazy.  The entire last 20 mins of the video could apply to the truthers: youre afraid that the fact that muslims attacked these buildings, not the government, and you cant handle the truth.

                   You make sense (or at least I agree with you that the coordination required would be almost impossible), but that doesnt mean that the government didnt take advantage of the situation to clamp down with the patriot act etc.

                     Tony I agree, but thats not the point made of this video.  After
                     <br/>
                     9/11 suddenly the govt and congress made intrusive laws and edicts, but
                     <br/>
                     the govt blowing up several commercial buildings in several locations?
                     <br/>
                     And the Pentagon?  And what, hire actors to pose as Muslim extremists
                     <br/>
                     for the flight that crashed in PA?  The whole premise of these people
                     <br/>
                     that its some kind of inside job is laughable.  Ever heard of Occams
                     <br/>
                     Razor?

                     <br/>
                     the premise that the simplest hypothesis is usually the right one.  in this case, for the truthers to be right, i. e. there is some nefarious hidden govt plot
                     <br/>
                     to bomb its own citizens, a TON of complicated assumptions must all be
                     <br/>
                     right.  For it to be exactly as most reasonable people believe it to
                     <br/>
                     be, 9/11 needed only a few Muslim terrorists capable of suicide who hate
                     <br/>
                     America.  That is a pretty large population of Muslims to choose from.
                     <br/>
                     Fly planes, kill people.  Simple explanation. And shockingly easy to
                     <br/>
                     pull off.

                   Except that it would have been possible for them to make those phone calls as there was no coverage at that altitude and NO phones on the planes. But you sure swallowed that one didnt you ? Good sheep, now take your pills.

                 You are all stupid. These are terroist making you believe and making it look what it was not them. America is not lying the muslims are, and brain washing all of you to believe it was an inside jod. Use your heads ppl. And all of you who are agreeing with this BS just get out of America if you hate it so much.

                   America vs Muslims? Get out of America because you hate it? Wow! Irrational much? Terrorists make people think its not them?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Did you know that English is the official language of the USA, by the way? You may want to learn how to use it effectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But back to your points, everything you said is purely emotional. Basically, the facts are really complicated, terrorists wont publicise the details, and your government has a lot of reasons to cover up their various involvements, however i have no doubt that both sides are to blame for one thing or the other. Do you think terrorists grow up wanting to be a terrorist? No. The USA obviously provoked these people in some way (imagined, real, brainwashed or otherwise) and they are behaving in this sad way in some sort of misguided revenge.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   By the way many of you are fucked in the head for using terrorists and muslims interchangeably. Dont you know the difference? Muslims are like christians except with a different guy from history and a slightly different set of rules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Terrorists on the other hand are strung out desperate cases that do outrageous things to try and gain notice for their cause. They can be christians, islamists, or whatever. I know you yanks are keen on Ireland, have a look at their history why dont you? All their terrorists for a hundred years have been christians!

                     Correct. America creates terrorism and more terrorists than they can ever hope to destroy. The CIA  created Al Qaeda and with Saudi Arabia is arming them in Syria calling them Freedom Fighters. Good for business of course which is the name of the game.

                 The issue is this. Not one conspirator has got drunk and blabbed to a buddy , told their now ex-wife, had a death bed confession, been tempted to clear their guilt and admit what happened etc etc There are whistle blowers everywhere and It would have a took a conspiracy of hundreds if not thousands to do this, if the US government cant control Snowden, Wiki Leaks, Stop China hacking their secrets, cover up Benghazi  how the hell can they pull this off ?? You would need tens of thousands of people just to keep monitoring the hundreds who supposedly carried out the attack !!!!! The only conspiracy is the one to cover up the FBI/CIA incompetence in not catching the terrorists and the subsequent white washing of Saudi Arabias involvement in funding Bin Laden and Pakistan protecting him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also Russia warned the US an attack was imminent, why would they do that ?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Did Cheney and Rumsfled deliberately ignore the threat in the hope something would happen or Israel. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia have knowledge they didnt pass on ? An outlier at best but more likely than the looney tune conspiracy nuts.

                     USS Maine on 15 February 1898, false flag attack! Many US officials would be comfortable admitting it now, but was an outrage to do so hundred years ago! We should learn from the past, and stop burring possibilities just cause they sound like sacrilege!

                   Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld all knew it was going to happen. Bush was in on the cover up, Chaney had the air force out for drills that day.  All the information is out there and has been for a long time.

                  <p>
                   if the US government cant control Snowden, Wiki Leaks, Stop China hacking their secrets, cover up Benghazi  how the hell can they pull this off ??
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think a better question is how could some guy living in a cave 3000 miles away pull this off.
                   <br/>
                   This was pulled off by many people. I dont have all of their names but it is a safe bet that members of the CIA were involved, maybe come contractors from Israel. You have to ask yourself who benefited from this.  Well Chaneys company made something like a half of trillion on the wars.  I am sure the Bush family made out just as well.  I am about 80% sure that the Rothschild family was the main mastermind behind this but that is really only a guess.  Try Google The New World Order.

                     I agree. When lacking suffice information, common sense invite to search for the maximum beneficiary of an incident in order to track the responsible! So in retrospect, why would one of the poorest country of the world disregard human life and attack US soil? . to get invaded and F.Up the As.. ( mind my bad language). And, why would Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and friends disregard human life and destroy the WTC?. To get insultingly reach! People then find it easy to believe that people living in this caves regards the Americans as aliens and have no sympathy for americans, though disregard their lives, but Bush and company proved in Iraq their disregards of human live, and im pretty sure that they feel so apart of Iraqis as they do from the average american, thus share the same level of sympathy! Why would they care if a thousand (mostly working class) americans die, if they would gonna get reach and world liberators!

Google it. by the way do you think that they had any regard for human life in Libya, Iraq or Afghanistan? Maybe they should paint crosses on the drones to indicate that they come from a Christian country in peace and with love?

                         really interesting the Northwoods data! It just prove the rotten shape of the realities governing US politics! It comes up to a single person to pull the trigger. If we are lucky enough to have some sufficiently decent president at the time (who wasnt so lucky himself), it doesnt happen, if we got some dump elected by means of irregularities, we are doom! Cause the machinery to implement all this is there, just waiting for the right moron

                   .that is a bogus argument..anybody involved in this event could easily have been misled or left out of the loop completely as to the exact nature.  Do you really think that they would have told a welder that he was going to wire up explosives for a controlled demolition that would be used as an excuse for continuing to invade muslim countries to steal their oil and make a profit on supplying the troops?   There were probably no more than 20 or 30 who knew some of the real story.  Unless you include the israeli involvement.  We dont have a clear number of how many of the mossad were involved.  It is laughable that somebody that believes what you seem to believe could make has the audacity to call others *looney tune conspiracy nuts*.  If you are getting paid to be a disinformation agentwhoever pays you is getting robbed.

                   Your argument is not bad. But I dont believe that it would take as many people as you say to carry such an hypothetical false flag attack. Most keen players could be kept in ignorance of the real reasons of their acts. Getting a bunch of retard terrorists to implement their role would be the easiest thing! Destroying physical evidence of a conspiracy by blowing part of the pentagon and the third tower its also plausible. I wonder how big a demolition team must be in order to undertake such task. But the questions that rise from this looney tune conspiracy nuts are actually easier to answer than those which rise of the fiasco of the official version! Why Norad was virtually disabled under their exercises at the time! Why security at the WTC was relaxed the months prior to S11, why the towers felt in such a fashion, including the THIRD tower, where servers containing the data of the legal cases against EON, among other where located. Why all images of the Pentagon crash were confiscated? Why the government instantly came with the passports of the terrorists out of the wreckage of a plain crash fire that was suppose to be so high temperatures that it melted the steel structure of the building? Why Osama was never caught till such a convenient moment (ending of a war on terror, Nato forces retrieving from afganistan)? Why the most wanted of USA wasnt brought to public? Why the investigation commission of the biggest event of the century had such a little budget and time, and their findings were censure? Why the wreckage of the towers was instantly shipped abroad for recycle? Why the government lied about never having contemplated the possibility of such attacks? Why USA decided to ignore the warning from their allies (as you very welled highlighted!).. and the questions just go on and on, and on

                 To everyone who thinks the Government is telling you the truth, wake the F*** up, stop being a sheep.
                 <br/>
                 Your President is a puppet just like in most countries. Do you honestly think the way the world is run is fair and just or could you dream of a more peaceful place where we are all treated like equals. The banks rule the land and the rich keep on getting richer, the medicine we are given is harming us, the banks want a one world electronic currency, the is the power to create cars and transport without harming the Planet, there is inventions for endless free energy, the schools are dumbing down the youth of today unless you have lots of money and are part of the chosen Elite. Wake the F*** up and realize only we the people can stand together and stop the world ending up like the populations before us which is not taught in Schools the real history of the world. The truth will come out and hopefully by them it will not be too late!!! Think of your kids and there kids what kind of a world are we leaving them. Your Government does not give a shit about you and it is time you realized this!!!

                 <br/>
                 A lot of innocent people and families paid the price that day but has it stopped America ? made them think twice about war ? Not a chance . They will always be targets for terrorism because of wars they have started .

                   Stephen Riley it is true enough that America still continues to make its self a target, however the majority of events that has happened in or to the USA in the last 10-15 years is by the powers that be  and I am not talking about Bush or Obama, those are front men for an operation deeper then any person could possible imagine. And just so you  do not feel picked on, it is not just your government that is like this, it is world wide, and has been going on for many many many years, predating my life existence and I would even venture a guess predating my parents existence.

                 Islamist terrorists did the downing of WTC because they hate unbelievers of Islam, as they usually called them infidel,  1. Israel, 2. the more they hate US for heading the middle east wars, 3, the allied nations . Their main mission ever since and the more nowadays because they claimed they are now educated,  is to convert the world to ISLAMthese people who prepared this conspiracy theory video are just a bunch of  IDOTS who were just brain washed by educated islamists .

                 It makes sense in the case of disaster to pull buildings even though you kill those in the building to drop them in their own footprint in a controlled way. Rather than have them topple onto surrounding buildings.
                 <br/>
                 No conspiracy just cold blooded logic in a crowded precinct.
                 <br/>
                 The core of the twin towers that housed the lifts should have remained like pinnacles sticking up out of the wreckage. Yet each floor fell freely into the space below it as planned in demolition.
                 <br/>
                 Just accept that some terrible decisions were made when the buildings stood in place. Set to come down if ever the awful decision had to be made.
                 <br/>
                 It was US authorities who now live with a truly terrible but needed decision to pull those three buildings.
                 <br/>
                 I am convinced that no one needed a manufactured excuse to go to war!

                 Okay, throw a ball straight up and it falls straight down.  Cut a tree at its base and it topples over.  Crash into a building on the 88th floor and cause a huge fire with jet fuel and knock the fireproofing off the structural members and the 88th floor will collapse and crush the floor below, falling straight down 30 feet to the 87th, so on and so forth, until there is nothing but rubbleat the base of the building sound familiar?  So how is it that bush supposedly planned all this and the attack on the Pentagon and the jet crash in shanksville PA.  Perfect timing?  By a guy you claim is so dumb?  Get real people, you dishonor the innocent victims with your speculation.  Get back on your meds!

                 Does anybody really believe that the US government was so determined to create the conditions for the war on terror that they would plan to murder thousands of innocent civilians, many of them foreign citizens?  If this was a controlled demolition, the charges would have had to be in place and wired for detonation before the planes were hijacked  it couldnt have been done after they hit!

                 Obviously no one is in the right position to say what the truth is, and that is the problem. Goverment investigations have proven to be a desinformation excercise. Main stream media limits it duties to broadcast the information given to them by the goverment! After 12 years no real justice have been made to the victims and their families, but in name of a false justice, more victims have risen all across the world! I simply fill discusted with the world be live in!

                 Its amazing how people find it so hard to believe that people among their own government would be capable of such an atrocity, but find it really easy to believe that some guys living in a cave in afganistan would some day simply come with the idea and means to implement it! How some people find so hard to believe that there government would be willing to sacrifice inocents peoples live, while they take it as popular knowledge that people outside their boundaries are not humans, but phyco aliens thursty for blood!

                 When will voters wake up to the FACT that (1.) their government lies to them routinely and (2.) elected representatives are nearly universally COWARDS and thus unwittingly complicit PUPPETS (for their failure to serve as advocates for those that entrusted them with a vote).

                 Let me play Devils advocate here.  While the evidence is compelling, what baffles me is that the entire plot needed, detailed planning, intricate timing and a massive covert operation that included pre-fitting the building with charges etc.  Obviously, however sick, its a work of very intelligent people.  How could they afford to leave such gaping holes in their work?  Or did they take into account the mass-trauma and fallibility of the masses during the trauma period.  And if the truth came out 10 years later, so be it.  They were sure to be high and dry  by then and only the fools will be caught.  Planned collateral damage?!

                 A flip side to believing that EVERYONE IS LYING. Try to lay down your cognitive dissonance and watch the evidence this conspiracy video glosses over.

                   Ive read the Quran. Its a horrendous book, both in its boring as shit prose and its ridiculous as shit premise. I mean, Mohammad even got to having revelations about how he needed alone time from his many wives after eating. And Allah decreed it to be divine.
                   <br/>
                   Oh, and of course theres all that shit about how non-Muslims arent really human.
                   <br/>
                   So, what was your point?

                 what would be easier, even if a government so dumb as to leave gaping holes in a conspiracy intended to bring down a building? Train 19 ideologues to use pocket knives to take over aircraft with less security than an Atlantic City casino, or execute a controlled demolition in front of live television camera, exactly timed to look like it happened at just the moment most engineers would expect the building to collapse after an aircraft flew into it at 500mph? Are all the suicide bombers doing less high profile attacks around the world also fabricated by fascists overlords who pull of controlled demolition at the exact moment these known ideologues walk into a crowded street wearing what looks exactly like a suicide vest? How many of these hundreds of annual attacks are we supposed to believe are controlled demolitions? What about the guy who decapitated the Brit soldier then stood in front of his cell phone, bloody knife in hand, explaining himself? Another controlled demolition? Or powerful mind control was that one? But the people figuring out this vast complex conspiracy of mind control and controlled demolitions, they are immune to the mind control why? Because theyre just so darned smart? Because they had sit-downs with the families who were talking to their loved ones on cell phone on the planes that flew into the buildings, and recognized those surviving family members  each and every one of dozens of them  as obvious liars?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Missing in all these conspiracy accounts is any accommodation for the random, the misguided, the effect of counterbalanced ideologies paralyzing both sides from action. Those are forces we all see at play every day in our jobs, our families, our social circles, but somehow these government conspiracies are choreographed in perfect time, with only enough evidence showing through for conflicting theories to whisper that we can no longer afford to see their version of the truth? And which version is that  the one that says the planes were empty? That they were autopiloted? That there was a missile attached to the bottom of one? That the one at the pentagon was really a missile and not a plane? and that all of them also involved controlled demolitions to cover up the fact that those hundreds of people on the planes werent really on the planes, but they are either taken somewhere else and murdered, or that they were all government agents secreted away to new lives doing something obviously nefarious that we just havent yet figured out?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Everybody wants to be a hero. Thats what drives these circle-jerk stories that claim were all so ignorant not to see what the circle-jerkers say we cant afford to ignore. They really feel inferior, but compensate by convincing themselves they are the ones smart enough to figure it all out. Their inferiority complex glares through in the bizarre story lines they fabricate in which omnipotent government forces are able to dupe the vast majority of the public, except those who are in on the big joke  none of which has ever broken ranks to say, yeh, I was in on the 911 conspiracy.

                 Colorado Public Television is NOT PBS.    Architects, for the most part, are not engineers.  Guesswork and armchair quarterbacking are kind of the rule these days, and I must have run across 1000 web posts detailing how some kid who watched a Star Trek episode thinks he can out-design Apple.  BS.  The reason you dont get consulted by the experts is you have nothing to offer.   The only mystery in this WTC nonsense is how we can produce so many gullible, untrained, stupid citizens who insist on seeing the bogey man under every bed.   Grow up.  Every piece of history is not a conspiracy.  The government is just as stupid as we are, just as unable to keep a secret, and just as incompetent.  This wasnt a Batman movie.  It was a pretty clever, coordinated attack from a small group of fanatic people with a bold plan and some money from a guy who hated us.  We were the incompetents.  We let them in.   In response to it, we invaded countries that had nothing to do with it, like Iraq.    If you need proof of government incompetence, look no further.  Hurricane Katrina, anyone?  Cant-find-Bin Laden-Mr. Bush anyone?   Bay of Pigs?   Viet Nam?   Iranian Airliner shootdown anyone?  Space Shuttle explosions x 2 anyone?   Hubble Space Telescope Myopia?  Thalidomide?    Massive failures and incompetence in government and I am not even trying hard.  A million examples come to mind.  And theres an effective conspiracy to do this? Get real.  And shut up.  You have to be kidding.   Honestly, you forfeit ALL of your credibility when you start spouting conspiracy theories about stuff like this.  Its just childish blabber from lunatics.  Just look at the sidebars here.  Is everything all mysterious and spooky and evil and conspiratorial or did someone just go off the meds too soon?   I vote the latter.

                 Consider the possibility that it was an
                 <br/>
                 accident (the deaths) and is not as sinister as it appears but was a
                 <br/>
                 totally ignorant scheme, the bombs in basement were intended to go off
                 <br/>
                 an hour before the Jets forcing evacuation. So there would only
                 <br/>
                 be a replaceable material loss (at great profit to some) which had been

                 insured just a week prior. But there was a mistake probably related to

                 Ok first of all we (the world) are not American haters. We are only worried about who is actually in charge of your country. America (thru its dogma of excessive consumerism) has given us all an unbelievable deluge of fascinating toys (its been fun no doubt)..  but America is also the worlds largest polluter (Capitalist China.. factory to the world is soon to take over) and instead of cleaning up its act it seems to be getting worse (Out of control destruction of nature thru mining, palm oil.., Fracking, GMO, .. know how is now spreading rapidly to every country) .. now what if.. just what if (800 scientists unanimously agree that man made climate change is a reality) the 1% that control the wealth of your country are really not interested in sustaining life on this planet (drunk on power and wealth) but just like those kamikaze pilots that crashed into the towers.. the 1% are hell bent on flying us all into a wall.. maybe theyve got an exit button that we all dont know about.. but while we are all on this trajectory its worth cracking the whip (I somehow trust scientists as opposed to businessmen).. who knows maybe these sudden outbursts  from the people might actually help save lives in the future,

                 The scientific evidence is compelling. I watched the twin towers
                 <br/>
                 collapse on TV, and thought I was watching a sci Fi movie, it was all so
                 <br/>
                 unreal!! Why had we in the UK no notion of any third tower?? Why was
                 <br/>
                 evidence shipped off to China unchecked? Why did that steel melt to
                 <br/>
                 liquid, and why are there so many reports of explosions??? There are too
                 <br/>
                 many unanswered questions, to just ignore! I do support, and appeal for an investigation. Whether the powers that be in the USA
                 <br/>
                 will allow it, remains to be seen but if not, People Power needs to
                 <br/>

                 So when are the police going to arrest the real terrorists? The evidence is there, if the police had that much evidence on any family in the world theyd be in there right away. We are still waiting for the real war on terrorists aka the elite power families manipulating the USA and the UK with the 7/7 bombings, to begin and end up with some trials and charges being brought. No one should be above the law, or we have no law.

                <p>
                 Every country is guilty of this. Even the United States.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then revisit the term terrorism and youll see how a man in a cave 100,000 miles away could carry out such a campaign. He didnt do it alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then revisit the business deals made between the US, Iraq, and Afghanistan years prior.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Things like this will never make sense unless youre exposed to the real business thats in transaction between countries. And since that wont ever come straight from the horses mouth, picking up a history book helps.

                   if the man in the cave even actually exists. Remember, the confession tape where Bin Laden takes credit for the 9/11 attacks isnt real. Thats not even the Bin Laden weve known visually for years now. Hes too fat, his nose is too bulbous, his hair and beard are the wrong color, his voice is wrong, and his complexion is darker.Dont forget, ~nobody~ got to see Bin Laden ~after~ he was killed, and no ~real~ photos have been leaked of his death. Theyre all photoshops of some other dudes face on another dudes prone body.  Nobody was supposed to get pictures or video of Saddam ~OR~ Gadaffi, but they DID, and it leaked all over the internet, but somehow NOBODY has actual photographic evidence of Bin Ladens death.

                 Though I havent seen video yet. I did watch other videos like Fahrenheit 9/11, loose change 1&amp;2. Look the building actually had survived a plane crashing into it before a few years ago.  Nothing happened.  It was caught on tape.  This was a inside job, think Bush had access to the info weeks before it happened and purposely overlooked it.  The fbi had the info and did nothing about it According to their own director.  The cia brought them evidence and did nothing.  Why? Cause war in the minds of republicans equates to a lot of money.  Those buildings had a insurance policy added to them just days before this happened, every explosive says it looks like a controlled explosion,  the very same terrorist who were said to does are airlines today and its public record in the middle east.  We know Bush a liar, crackhead, social security stealing thief who no for people of during Katrina, so whats difference in a if color to kill and steal their and resources like company Halliburton did by gaining the contactto secure the iraqi oil pipe line. Sounds like made cause he kicked out of office yet people wanna kick Obama out for  stopping that war. Face the bin Laden was a board member at Bushs company, look it up.  He was also a childhood friend.  Why not place blame on him,  never find him,  yet kill the entire family of man who tried to kill his daddy by lying about wmds and taking his oil away from him and imprisoning his people,  all in the name of freedom.

                 So many wittiness saw the explosions,? not ONE saw them Planted? How on earth someone can plant so many explosives in such a populated building without ONE person seeing it is beyond me. when we see  buildings that need demolishing it takes weeks of preparation . So my question is ,how did they get the explosives planted in the first place??  I guess it must have been the  NIGHT SHIFT who planted such explosive material..:))

                 Every year you screwballs create more and more anti american sentiment.  Youve already seen the hate from the Boston marathon bombs to the LAX gunman.  Keep spreading your conspiracies and NWO garbage, youre part of the problem not the solution.

                 Hundreds of high level architectural engineers have weighed in on the
                 <br/>
                 probability of the tower 7 imploding and have explained that the physics
                 <br/>

                 <br/>
                 demolition.They have all agreed it could not of happened. This is not

                 knowledge. These were hundreds of experts attempting to tell the public

                 this is not a discussion, it is Americans doing what comes naturally to them, and that is finding things to complain about, blaming their Govt for the worlds problems and destroying their own people and country. No wonder the govt has so many security services, half the population cant be trusted and the other half are blabbing reveloution. So where is the Red White and Blue and Stars and Stripes or is that just bullshit for dumb tourists. Because the state of the states frome this discussion makes Moscow look like paradise. Personelly I believe that terrorists attacked the WTC and the USA was caught short by a long shot. Binladen was more than likely killed in the first couple days of the War in the sand pit, and his mates were hunted and killed off over the duration of the war until 2013 when withdrawl was announced. Disgusting thing about this discussion is your very own folks died and you lot dont give a damn, your to interested in fighting amongst yourselves about what happened to the extent you have to drag survivorr into the mess. Maybe the World opinion of Americans is right after all and that is fuck off back to America and leave us alone.
