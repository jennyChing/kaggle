						&lt;p&gt;Slavery is so obviously wrong. So is beating your wife and kids. So  is lynching ethnics. So is torturing dissidents. These things happen  nowadays, but not by us. We&#8217;re better than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But ask yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_11096" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honor-Code-Moral-Revolutions-Happen/dp/0393071626/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1286422291&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-11096 " title="book-honor-code" src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/book-honor-code.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="227" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text"&gt;This book, by Kwame Anthony Appiah, examines our notions of honor and changes in morality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we all doing &lt;em&gt;today &lt;/em&gt;that will be looked upon with  disdain  by our descendants? Kwame Appiah dares us to ask this very  question in a  recent Washington Post &lt;a title="&quot;What will future generations condemn us for?&quot; by Kwame Anthony Appiah at The Washington Post on September 26, 2010." href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092404113_pf.html" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might see ourselves at the top of a moral pyramid, but history begs to differ. In asking this question, Appiah provides &lt;strong&gt;three clues &lt;/strong&gt;that a practice we take for granted is headed for the historical dustbin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080;"&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;people have already heard the arguments against the practice&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span style="color: #808080;"&gt;The case against slavery didn&#8217;t emerge in a blinding moment of moral clarity, for instance; it had been around for centuries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080;"&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;defenders &lt;/strong&gt;of the custom tend not to offer &lt;strong&gt;moral counterarguments but instead &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;invoke tradition, human nature or necessity&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span style="color: #808080;"&gt;(As in, &#8220;We&#8217;ve always had slaves, and how could we grow cotton without them?&#8221;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000080;"&gt;And third, supporters engage in what one might call &lt;strong&gt;strategic ignorance, avo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iding truths that might force them to face the evils &lt;/strong&gt;in which they&#8217;re complicit. &lt;span style="color: #808080;"&gt;Those  who ate the sugar or wore the cotton that the slaves grew simply didn&#8217;t  think about what made those goods possible. That&#8217;s why abolitionists  sought to direct attention toward the conditions of the Middle Passage,  through detailed illustrations of slave ships and horrifying stories of  the suffering below decks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a title="&quot;What will future generations condemn us for?&quot; by Kwame Anthony Appiah at The Washington Post on September 26, 2010." href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092404113_pf.html" target="_blank"&gt;Appiah&lt;/a&gt;, emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prime contenders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These clues in hand, Appiah identifies four possible traditions that may be condemned by the generations that follow us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prison system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A large proportion of the populace is incarcerated and suffering persistent, violent sodomy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial meat production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Animals suffer in a claustrophobic, shit-covered existence before being cruelly put down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The isolated, institutionalized elderly&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Shoving old folks into homes so we don&#8217;t have to deal with them seems pretty cold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The environment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Even under a not-so-worst case scenario, our grandchildren are likely to be awful angry with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what else? Questions like these stretch the mind into uncomfortable corners. But, what the hell, I&#8217;ll give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Driving around in cars&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 30,000 Americans die yearly in automobile accidents.&lt;a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811291.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-10763 alignnone" title="Source - Early Estimate of Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities in 2009 (NTSA, 2010)" src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/fn01.gif" alt="" width="12" height="12" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; What&#8217;s more it&#8217;s common and accepted &#8211; the price of freedom,  apparently. But advances in sensors and robotics could make the idea of a  &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;-driven automobile seem positively quaint. The underlying technology is maturing surprisingly fast.&lt;a href="http://www.torctech.com/content/darpa-urban-challenge" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10764" title="DARPA's Urban Challenge continues to drive competition in this area. It could be here faster than we think." src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/fn02.gif" alt="" width="12" height="12" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our grandchildren might be amazed that we were perfectly content to  allow tens of thousands of our countrymen die because we were busy  talking on cell phones, applying lip gloss, or just plain drunk. Taking direct  control of our automobiles would still happen, but it would be the  exception (alongside &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;higher insurance premiums), not the rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Excesses of Capitalism&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we determine that a cheap $1.50 box of binder-clips comes at  too high a cost? What if we developed feelings about the role of impoverished  third-world factory workers? Our economic calculus could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may talk a  lot about freedom and self determination, but psychological and  sociological studies continue to identify that we are not equal in  access to opportunities.&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10765" title="Citations? Please. This is a central point of debate - if by debate you mean loud arguments where advocates and opponents shout past each other. I think that potential remedies will come from people well outside our own narrow partisan perspectives. We'll be dead by then." src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/fn03.gif" alt="" width="12" height="12" /&gt; And while we&#8217;re not powerless, we are herded  toward ends that are not our intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the poor aren&#8217;t like that because they don&#8217;t work  hard enough. Chance plays as much of a role as genetics in shaping our  future. And like our inherited genetic traits, we can&#8217;t actually do a  damned thing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s somewhat controversial to say right now, but future Americans  may not accept the primacy of our (often crony) capitalism as a given.  It may be the best of a bunch of bad options, but that&#8217;s only because we  can&#8217;t see the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conventional meat eating&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding upon another of Appiah&#8217;s earlier points, there are reasons to  question industrial meat production&#8217;s future. We might &lt;em&gt;grow &lt;/em&gt;our meat instead.&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10766" title="You can learn the basics about in vitro meat at Wikipedia." src="http://longgame.org/wp-content/uploads/fn04.gif" alt="" width="12" height="12" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Three cultural/technical forces could  converge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;environmental requirements &lt;/strong&gt;of sustaining large numbers of pasture animals is extreme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;animal rights &lt;/strong&gt;movement, while not exactly mainstream, isn&#8217;t an outsider concern anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The development of &lt;strong&gt;biotechnology &lt;/strong&gt;could make meat without animals a reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vat grown meats would assuage the concerns of animal rights folks and   reduce the environmental impact considerably. Assuming the technology   steadily matures, wide-scale adoption would have to overcome the &lt;em&gt;ewww&lt;/em&gt; factor. And while &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; might find the idea of consuming the stuff to be unnatural, successive generations would accept the tech more readily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What else?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are shots in the dark, of course. Nobody can predict the future, but it&#8217;s naive to assume that our inherited notions  of what&#8217;s &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; are going to freeze in place. Many of us take pride in the notion that we&#8217;re improving ourselves, even if it&#8217;s &lt;a title="&quot;In recent years psychologists  have exposed the many ways that people subconsciously maintain and massage their moral self-image. They rate themselves as morally superior to the next person; overestimate the likelihood that they will act virtuously in the future; see their own good intentions as praiseworthy while dismissing others as inconsequential. And they soften their moral principles when doing a truly dirty job, like carrying out orders to exploit uninformed customers.  Now, scientists are beginning to learn how memory assists and even amplifies this righteous self-messaging.&quot; - By Benedict Carey at the NYT on October 4, 2010." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/views/05mind.html" target="_blank"&gt;based in delusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, however clumsy, misguided, and stupid we might appear, we&#8217;ll try to correct our course. So much of contemporary political discourse is predicated on &lt;em&gt;What Is Truly American&lt;/em&gt;, but each generation refashions that conception for themselves. There is no quantifiable, unchanging American ethos. We&#8217;re making it up as we go.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;d suggest gay rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. People definitely have heard arguments in favour of gay rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The recent court case in California demonstrates pretty convincingly that the case against same-sex marriage isn&#8217;t based at all in fact, with applications for gay rights in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Opponents of gay rights have been able to make whatever successes they have because, until quite recently, most people didn&#8217;t know out gays. Now that they do, and know them to be decent people, the idea of supporting sanctions against them seems foolish. The sufferings of gay people are becoming increasingly prominent, as evidenced by the media coverage of several gay teen suicides and the whole &#8220;It Gets Better&#8221; movement on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Thanks for contributing. I&#8217;m embarrassed that I omitted that from my list, since it&#8217;s the most obvious one. Wide scale acceptance of homosexual citizens is the one that will happen the fastest, too (among the three I noted). The demographic trends certainly support the notion. I&#8217;m already pre-embarrassed for my time-period.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The more I think about it, the surer I am that Appiah&#8217;s second criterion doesn&#8217;t stand up.  There _were_ moral arguments made in favor of most, if not all, of the past evils he cites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slavery &#8212; &#8220;The blacks are an inferior race who are doomed to savagery if left to their own devices; we are protecting them, bringing them the blessings of Christianity, and at the same time making them productive members of society.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynching &#8212; &#8220;If we didn&#8217;t do this, the nigras would rape all the white wimmin.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child-beating &#8212; &#8220;Spare the rod and spoil the child.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male-only suffrage &#8212; &#8220;Women are of a delicate nature not suitable to the rough and tumble of politics, which will only degrade them.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I can&#8217;t be bothered to look it up right now, I&#8217;m certain that similar arguments were made in favor of wife-beating, centering on the hysterical and childlike nature of women combined with the father&#8217;s duty as head of the family to maintain discipline.  Whatever we may think of these arguments today, they were couched in terms of advancing a perceived good or preventing a perceived evil, which makes them moral in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is true of the modern examples cited by Appiah and, to a certain extent, by yourself. Prisons: &#8220;they are necessary to deter crime and incapacitate offenders.&#8221;  Industrial meat production: &#8220;this way, we produce meat most efficiently and cheaply, and make it affordable and available to millions who might otherwise starve.&#8221;  Nursing homes: &#8220;through economies of scale, we can give skilled care to the elderly at low cost, prolong their lives, and place them in an environment where they are surrounded by their peers.&#8221;  Environmental damage: &#8220;some damage in the short term is necessary to ensure growth and lift the Third World out of poverty, and this very growth will ultimately provide the technologies and resources to restore the planet over the long term.&#8221;  Capitalism: &#8220;if not for $5 T-shirts, more poor families might have to choose between food and clothing.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Your autopilot-car and vat-grown-meat examples depend on the existence of a technology not available now; their absence in the here and now may make us _poor_ from the perspective of the future, but I don&#8217;t think it would make us _evil_).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral arguments for the nineteenth-century examples are, of course, based on premises now universally believed to be false (at least in the West), i.e., the myth of Africans as inferior and rape-crazed, or that of women as inherently corrupt and in need of male discipline.  I suspect that the arguments against homosexuality will soon be recognized as based on similarly false premises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The validity of the moral arguments for the modern examples is more debatable.  It&#8217;s clear, for instance, that Appiah doesn&#8217;t recognize economy-of-scale arguments, whereas I would posit that in an urbanized world of nearly seven billion people, _ignoring_ economies of scale is immoral.  Some of the modern arguments &#8212; particularly the environmental one, which is contingent on hypothetical future developments &#8212; may someday be as discredited as the arguments for slavery are today.  But I don&#8217;t know if we can reliably predict which ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is even before we get into the issue of what a &#8220;moral argument&#8221; is.  For instance, Appiah differentiates moral arguments from those based on tradition, but could it be argued that cultural diversity is itself a positive good and that some amount of cultural preservation is moral?  And what about religious arguments &#8212; if one subscribes to a religious moral code and considers divine commandment to be the source of good, then is &#8220;God says so&#8221; a moral argument?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that what Appiah&#8217;s thesis comes down to is that there are no moral arguments in favor of prisons, nursing homes, etc. _that he recognizes as valid_.  This viewpoint is arrogant, and it also puts him in no different a position from the early twentieth-century crusaders against alcohol or racy novels: they also did not recognize as valid any countervailing moral arguments.  I don&#8217;t think that the presence or absence of moral arguments is a useful way to distinguish the modern equivalents of the anti-slavery movement from the equivalents of prohibitionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might propose, as a possible substitute criterion, that practice X is likely to be deemed evil in the future if (a) the other two criteria are met, and (b) any moral arguments advanced in its favor are based on myth.  But this too is problematic, because it can be hard to separate myth from fact.  In the nineteenth century, the racial inferiority of Africans was accepted as scientific fact; who knows what cherished facts of the modern day may someday be exposed as mythical.  Alternatively, with respect to another possible future evil &#8212; nationalism &#8212; does the fact that nations are a construct make them mythical?  Something created can still be real, and its self-determination may be a genuine moral good.  Or, for that matter, is the existence of certain myths necessary for collective action and solidarity, rendering their propagation potentially moral?  I&#8217;m afraid we may have to leave it to future generations to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Hi, Warren! I got here via Randy. Appiah&#8217;s idea is fascinating, but I think you&#8217;re slightly off-base with two of your suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider automobiles. People used to ride stagecoachs, at great danger to themselves. They travelled on sailing ships, with no climate control, and little knowledge of nutrition. They used pack animals to pull heavy loads over unpaved roads. Do we look at any of this with &#8220;disdain&#8221;? Not at all! We look at it as the unfortunate hardship of the past; if there&#8217;s any emotion involved, it&#8217;s a vague sense of admiration that people could live with such risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If self-controlled automobiles become illegal, it&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone thinking that there was anything immoral about it, anymore than you think it was immoral to ride horses or clipper ships. Our children may be amazed that we loved our cars, but the emotion will be very different from one Appiah&#8217;s getting at. They won&#8217;t look at it the way we look at slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a different way, I also think you&#8217;re a little off-base about the &#8220;excesses of capitalism.&#8221; After all, what is capitalism? Private property and market exchange? It&#8217;s hard to imagine either of those going away as long as humans are still recognizably human. If there is an alternative to , it doesn&#8217;t meet Appiah&#8217;s criteria, simply because we can&#8217;t see it. You can&#8217;t have a reasonable &#8220;argument against a practice&#8221; without an alternative, and the actually-know alternative of giving full central planning another run seems a bit unpalatable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current institutional set-up of the United States of America? Well, there I agree with you, but that seems mighty parochial. &#8220;America&#8217;s top marginal tax rate was too low back in 2010&#8243; or &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that they allowed so many financial institutions to borrow short and lend long!&#8221; is really not on a par with &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that they thought it was okay to own &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Moreover, there is a lot of evidence in American politics that the practices of the 1870s sit fine with enough people to make a moral revolution pretty damn difficult. If there&#8217;re still much more than a fringe after 140 years, what will it take? I suspect that even in the social democratic future, you&#8217;ll get a lot of Americans in 2150 arguing that now, finally, the time is ripe for libertarianism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But meat, that makes sense. Although it kinda makes me unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Randy: if I may, the significance of the &#8220;It Gets Better&#8221; movement is precisely that it&#8217;s main locus is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; on Youtube. Enough with the internet triumphalism, young man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said &#8230; the fact the Ross Douthat needed to jump through ridiculous hoops to justify his marriage stance is a sign that the debate is over, and we&#8217;re just waiting for society catch up. Lots of people (myself included) will continue to support public policy that heavily discriminates in favor of  couples with children over other couples, but note the modifiers (one beginning with &#8220;h&#8221;; the other a compound phrase beginning with &#8220;n&#8221;) that are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;So much great feedback; let me address a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding much of this, let me note that yes, new technology makes possible options that simply couldn&#8217;t have existed earlier. Whether or not it&#8217;s fair, I&#8217;m inclined to think that contemporaries may still slap an &#8216;evil&#8217; label on something like that without appreciating our limited options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do agree that rather than thinking that, say, human driven automobiles will be something that is deemed evil, later generations will just roll their eyes about it. As Noel notes, we do that when thinking about cattle-drawn wagons. While it&#8217;s possible over-reach on my part, consider another possible future look-back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ton of people are cruising around the roads, yes, but it&#8217;s that we&#8217;re ignorant of the enormous power we wield. What I mean is that a future-us may look at our treatment of the technology to have been like fooling around with a loaded gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my thoughts on the &#8220;excesses of capitalism&#8221; are necessarily vague. This is because there are simply so many practices that may or may not get the evil eye. I am, by no means, anti-capitalist and (quite) agree with Mr. Edelstein that ignoring economies of scale would be a moral evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I can&#8217;t help but think that the cliche of &#8216;armies of children&#8217; making T-shirts won&#8217;t make it into the lexicon of Very Bad Things that people did in the olden days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is notwithstanding the very reasonable arguments made by free market advocates which amount to only counting the bad stuff and none of the good that results (ie &#8211; lifted out of dirt-poor poverty by these &#8216;evil&#8217; jobs), just that the details may not be relevant if the character of future society differs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful contributions, gentlemen! Thanks so much for adding to the discussion and noting my errors. I have more cool comments to chew on the next time I revisit the subject. And thanks, Randy, for pointing people toward my odd musings.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/h2&gt;
					&lt;div class="body"&gt;
						I don't harbor love or hate for computers or operating systems. Debating the merits of Microsoft versus Google versus Apple is amusing, and sometimes even necessary, but the tenor of discussion on the internet is irritating. I don't care. I need what I need, and if someone can meet the need, that's super. Beyond that, I'm ambivalent.

I have a long history using Microsoft products, beginning with BASIC on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 personal computers. Back in those days, I'd have gladly taken part in a good platform debate.

&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XylyBQJT-no[/youtube]&lt;/p&gt;
Of course, I was an Amiga fan. I watched Commodore shovel dirt over their business in spite of superior technology. This helped me to start shedding my inner fanboy. That brings me to another favorite fight: Microsoft Fansvs. People Who Hate Microsoft, sub-fight: MS Office.
The Microsoft Wild-Ride
I've been using Office since the Windows 3.1 era [ref]otherwise known as "The Before Time."[/ref]and often joked that any given MS product requires a service pack or two before becoming useful. Over the years, I have lost and regained trust in Office based on my perception of alleged improvements.

Office has changed a ton over the years. The ribbon is the most recent UI jump I can think of. It scales beautifully to different window/screen sizes and rationalized the structure of application functions.

My line of work has always included Word and PowerPoint. Both have had awful periods, but both have improved considerably. The former languished in UI-hell for longer than was necessary and the latter encouraged the creation of heroically awful presentations. Many eyes have needlessly suffered at the sight of A PowerPoint.

So now Microsoft's flagship productivity suite has embraced the cloud. Finally. I've read about some issues. Personally, I have no reason to upgrade because we have our nonprofit employee discount. If I felt like it, I could spend the $10. But then a friend of mine (who works at Microsoft) handed me an Office 365 Home Premium card. It gives me one year of Office (now billed as a service), an extra 20GB of cloud storage, and 60 Skype world minutes a month.

I didn't exactly need an Office upgrade on my home PC, but I'm not going to turn down free.
My Impressions
Superficially, it doesn't look like much. The UI seems a bit friendlier. You can still install it on your computer (up to 5 PC's or Macs, actually), but you don't have to.

Hah, I thought. What a bunch of crap. I bet it sucks.

I booted up my hacked-together Android-based netbook and used the generic, built-in browser to head over to Office365. I logged in and clicked on a file I'd recently edited and saved to SkyDrive.

There was a bit of delay, but only just a bit. ThenI was typing into a Word document complete with the ribbons and all the expected behaviors. It honestly felt like I was using a slightly slower version of the desktop client, but it lives in the browser. This was on a machine can barely chug through Angry Birds without glitching the GPU. Almost no Android software can run on it because it's not ARM-based. I opened an Excel document and began editing that. It was very snappy. I was very surprised.

When you access Office365 in this fashion, the page streams only the functionality as you need it,which means there's a slight delay the first time, and almost none each subsequent time.
Other Stuff

There's a lot I don't know, being at the start of this exploration. SharePoint is still part of the suite, so it's not all sunshine and roses. For years, I've tried to love this thing and give it the benefit of the doubt. It runs our nonprofit's intranet and has ended up being a glorified document portal, though IT does use something calledFootprints to manage tickets. Whatever other uses it's there for, I wouldn't know. I do know that it hasa dense and obtuse interface that appears to have been developed by people who hate you.

I've also been playing with Outlook.com because, very much to my surprise, the interface is much cleaner than Gmail's. That said, Outlook (the application and something separate) is still annoying. In the past, it's been frustrating back-end stuff. [ref]Like how Outlook can't connect to two identical, up-to-date Exchange servers at the same time. Brilliant interoperability![/ref]Now it's the baffling fact that there's no synchronization with Outlook.com. When you open up the client, it won't reflect what you have already read via web-interface and vice versa. Create all the rules and folders you like, they won't match up. That does not compute.

[aside]SharePointis still part of the suite, so it's not all sunshine and roses.[/aside]

As noted, all this stuff is a service. It costs $99/year for personal use, which is considerably more than Google's $0/year. So I guess it comes down to how much you value Office's additional functions. Even if Google Docs' feature-set doubled right now, it'd still have a way to go before matching what Word can do. But then I think about how most people do not need most of what Word offers them. But can Google's new Vault compete with OneNote?An internal debate ensues.

I do need more than what Google offers me. In the print-on-dead-trees dance-off, Word wins handily. That still comes up a lot. Avery labels, anyone? Putting this or that particular function aside, though, I'm left with the single best reason: I need to be productive offline. That my editing experience can be identical in both places is the most appealing thing of all.

I think it's time to see if Windows 7 can be installed on my netbook.					&lt;/div&gt;

						Mark McKinney once reflected on how The Kids in the Hall fit into the shapeof North American entertainment.
Contextually, it also was the beginning of the cable revolution. Had we come along five years earlier, there wouldn't have been a place for us. But just as your dial started to go from 20 channels to 200, finally, we could have a constituency that was viable - the 1 or 2 million needed as opposed to the 20 million you needed on prime time.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP3X0dSV9kI[/youtube]&lt;/p&gt;

And so it goes.
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;A cancer sketch would go over just finenow. It's the post-South Park era and besides: cable.You can get away with muchless now - on network television, anyway - than you could decades ago. Nowadays, the network model seems so old it's sluffed the dinosaur. It's just bones now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;We're in a weird period. Network TV, as a business, istanking. But television shows, as a medium, is more varied and interesting than it's never been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Entertainment used to be simple: TV and movies. My childhood is filled with memories of trips to the grocery store thatalways included the purchase ofTV Guide. This is a concept so antiquated that I had to link to a Wikipedia article about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Here's a a brief historyfor the kids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyYo3Hm6pS4[/youtube]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I have difficulty conceiving life beforeYouTube,Netflix,andHuluand Ilived back then.Better yet, omit those things. The internet, in it's most basic form,has been beating television with a club for a while now. Political cul de sacs and cat memes started stealing eyeballs and it all began with digital fossils likeHamsterdance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;This isn't the future I imagined. That's kind of the point, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;					&lt;/div&gt;

						Tell your grand-kids about the great rice scare of 2012. Everyone dressed in radiation suits and attended midnight rice-burnings. The flames licked the sky. I still shake my fist at Consumer Reports, whose dark witchcraft revealed the awful truth.
Organic rice baby cereal, rice breakfast cereals, brown rice, white ricenew tests by Consumer Reports have found that those and other types of rice products on grocery shelves contain arsenic, many at worrisome levels.
Many scary words follow intheir report. They explain their methodology and present their data. In the end, they make some recommendations.
Consumers Union believes a standard for arsenic should be set for rice, and industry should accelerate efforts to reduce arsenic levels in rice. They should also develop types of rice that take up less arsenic, and use rice with the lowest possible arsenic in products for young children, such as infant rice cereal.
This is not unreasonable. There are murmurs of corroboration, too. Nobody wants to be seen shoving fistfuls of poisonous rice down our kids' throats. Nobody wants to be that guy. There's so much parental peer-pressure these days.

I didn't learn about this brouhaha on a newscast or anything. I don't even have cable. That stuff will kill you. I learned of this after a visit to Yoni Freedhoff's blog(because I'm a fossil who still uses RSS feeds). He pointed readers toDavid Katz, whoboils things down:
...inevitably, when a peril in our food or medicine cabinet or environment is pointed out to us, it invites the hyperbole of concentrated media attention, an inclination to invoke conspiracy theories, and at least some temptation to panic. When we do give in to panic, we tend to jettison the baby along with the bath water, resulting in net harm.
Consumer Reports put a spotlight ona thing. It's a real thing and the level of concern we should have is non-zero. Arsenic is not part of a nutritious lunch. But the spotlight's the thing: it can warp perspective.When I'm trying to figure out whether to subscribe to the latest pop-health concern, I'm so torn. Some distant newscast is playing creepy-music with a montage of blood-red rice grains superimposed over wailing sheep.

What I need is perspective. And background. Background is hard. It can be boring.But that's what Dr. Katz provides, and it's one of the first casualties in much of lay science reporting.Basically, (1) we don't live in a pristine world, (3) this is old news among scientists, and no, I didn't forget (2), because it's the most important bit:
We have known for decades that thefour leading causes of chronic diseaseand premature death in industrialized countries are smoking, poor dietary pattern, lack of physical activity, and obesity. Yet these four are routinely ignored or neglected by people who get very worked up over the latest chemical threat in our food or environment.We should not ignore big risks just because they are under our control, nor exaggerate much smaller ones simply because they are not.
Bearing this in mind isn't a health thing, but a life thing. It frees us to focus on more appropriate stuff, since we have a finite amount of attention. If you're coping with obesity and looking to make better decisions, don't ditch the rice-bowl for fast-food just because you were spooked by professionally trained frighteners. You're still playing pretty good odds.					&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The people at Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal have a really good quality-to-crap ratio. Frankly, it's better than almost every other internet produced entertainment thingie. They don't let a thin budget stand in the way of awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

						Life is the steady hum of responsibility and action. Some ego-bound middle manager ensures that uncontrolled thought and feelings are a kind of annotation. You know, like the notesthat executives send to people trying make a TV show that's watchable. The result is barely, if at all, intelligible.

The speed at which the stuff overlay and intersect one another is one reason why Ive let my writings gather dust. Well, that and laziness.

If my lifes aim is to constantly feel on the verge of swerving off course and into a tree, then Im a pro. I know just the right time to swerve back onto the road. It's an art.

Most Americans can relate to the things; the great lie is that our fears are so terribly unique. Ha. Bills. Stress. Bills. Sickness. Hell. Crap, we have to be there tonight? Damn. Drink. Sleep. Wake.

Its no wonder that I'm so often hunched in front of a monitor piloting pretend spaceships. I can control those.What I struggle to control is my internal monologue. If I give it too much attention, it argues like my son. But my son'sexcuse is that hes at the dawn of his teen years. It's a damn good excuse. The weird, ephemeral bastard squatting in my braindoesn'thave one that good.

Here's a loose agglomeration of random thoughts to prove that a) my public persona exists, b) Ive been paying attention to the posts of others, and c) I'm capable of putting words on a screen, no matter how rushed and clumsy.

	While its true that the presidential election is always up in the air, it appears less so than in prior elections. I have been trying to limit my exposure to any of this stuff. This is best achieved by viewing as many amusing cats as possible. I cant stress the importance of domestic animal pictures in claiming an sanity within the current election season.
	After completing Fallout: New Vegas, I turned my attention to Star Trek Online. I did this rather than, you know, write. My short review of the game is that its a fantastically absurd exaggeration of every Trek aspect I could imagine. Every noise and chunk of flavor-text is ripped from something that fans are already at least passively aware of. Its fun and completely ridiculous.
	Monthly bills continue to stomp us into a fine paste. The student loan system operates with such efficiency that I half expect to be visited by a guy in a suit whos fiddling around with a bat and letting me know how nice our windows look.
	Facebook is dead to me. Any social network that has a userbase that includes all family members and every tangential friend in the world is something that should, as my brother puts it, be nuked from orbit. Seconded. We all have the right to say whatever we want, but Ive found that few of us have the ability to say it to the right audience. Every existing FB user should learn, at the point of a gun, how to use lists.
	I'm addicted to Pinterest now. I realize that it's pretty new and is considered little more than a clearinghouse for fashion and crafts addicts, but it's got a format that's quite appealing. If you'd like to see, first hand, yet another tool I've been using to manage my aversion-therapy approach to the world, then visit my boards.
	At least Im not standing still. Next week, I begin a new position at the same institute where I work. Rather than being an admin assistant, Ill be an AA with a heavy injection of communications... stuff. Im really excited about formalizing my role as someone who helps scientists speak to lay audiences. Its new territory and not without its risks, but Im sure I can rise to the challenge.

See? I am alive. Sometimes I have to use the paddles, but the hearts still beating and the dreads still dreading. What was that line about pain being a reminder that youre alive? Much of whats passing for pain still registers as a first world problem, but they're my first world problems. I still have a loving wife, a great son, and a family that isnt yet sick of me.

Im keeping an eye on that. I stare at the horizon to keep from getting sick. Plus I do other stuff that qualifies as an overused analogy. Like the pot calling the kettle green with envy and something about killing two birds with one stone. I think it rolls uphill, with no moss. Probably.					&lt;/div&gt;

					&lt;/h2&gt;
					&lt;div class="body"&gt;
						After ninety-five hours, I finally finished Fallout: New Vegas. I played it the way I play every role playing game: carefully allying with as many neutral and goody-goody factions as I can. Don't make waves; only kill the bad people. By the time I was done with this hero business, flowers would sprout up all over the wasteland.

No such luck.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjj-UJQ8K64[/youtube]
The conclusion of my actions&lt;/p&gt;
It turns out that you can ride the line pretty easily through the bulk of the game. In the end, though, supporting one faction means doing very bad things to one or two of the others. This illustrated - perfectly to my mind - one principle of politics: our choices mostly range from bad toworse. I'm sure that there's some way to finesse the game's system to cue the sunshine and roses, but I didn't find it. Frankly, it's more realistic this way.

Mr. House at least seemed to care about the locals. The NCR only cared about securing Hoover Dam, and extending their reach further east. The legion, of course, was noxious. You don't get too many points for banning drugs and alcohol if you're also keeping child slaves. The Great Khans seem to be the whipping boy of the Fallout universe. They're unlucky, constantly savaged by enemies, and always moving away from more dominant powers.

Considering the state of the world, Mr. House seemed to be doing pretty well. Maybe the optimal outcome would have unfolded ifItook control of New Vegas. House was self interested, to be sure, but I'm a courier-cum-bloodthirsty-sharpshooter who's spilled more blood than the legion. I've disconnected more heads from bodies than a French guillotine.I'm not fitto manage the affairs of a state. I really appreciateYes Man's helpful demeanor toward that end, but heroic or not: I'm a monster. Don't give me power.

At least, that's how I see my character: The courier is tough as nails, yes, and surely possessed of a moral center. But no matter how well-intentioned a body may be, the courier is broken. Too many hours were spent in the wasteland. So many caps were spent on weapons and a metric ton of shell casings were expended killing the vicious and desperate. Does that really constitute a happy ending?

I'll take my bittersweet conclusion. It fits. The courier made the best of a bad lot, was thrown into an impossible situation, and had to choose from the available options. Such is life in the Mojave wasteland. You never know what's going to happen next.					&lt;/div&gt;

						A recent Cracked article, 5 Ways We Ruined the Occupy Wall Street Generation, got passed around by my Gen-X peers. Its a hell of a read, and another reminder that some of the most insightful pop-culture analysis comes from what was formerly a low-rent MAD Magazine.

You need to read the piece to fully appreciate how thoroughly weve set the stage for our spectacular, slow-motion failure. Worse, we cant pin this one on a papier-mch donkey or elephant. Its a game of follow the leader where everyones lined up and walking in a circle. I certainly played my part. I fancy myself a free thinker, but I parrot enough shit masquerading as faux-profound to be culpable.
Occupy _______
One reason why Ive become so enamored by the Occupy Wall Street movement can be symbolized by - hands-down - the best quote in that article, a virally circulated (though unattributed) conversation:
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;Me: I just get so pissed off by the older generation.
Therapist: Why?
Me: Because when I grew up, we were force fed the idea that if we didnt want to be flipping burgers at McDonalds then we better go to college.
Therapist: And?
Me: And now weve gone to college, have degrees, cant get a damn job, and the same people call us entitled assholes because we refuse to flip burgers!
Therapist: Touche.&lt;/p&gt;
Heres what we did wrong (along with my personal take), but please, read the original piece.

	We made our youth ashamed to take jobs that involve manual labor.
The society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water. Thats a quote from John Gardner, by the way. Remember that flipping burgers bit above? Its a fancy way of saying thatwe'vescorned commoner work. Thats for serfs. Weve gone all job-snob on the backbone of our nations infrastructure.
	We implied that college would naturally lead to a good job.
Which resulted in flooding the educational market. We, sometimes subtly, sometimes arrogantly, expressed that laborous work is only fit for the likes ofJimbo Jones. With tons of kids in college - many of whom would probably loveto be tradesmen -we generated educational inflation that gave rise to diploma farms.
	We added seven years to being a teenager.
What did we expect? Theyre living at home longer because they have to go to school. Hell, even if theyre employed, thats no guarantee they can cover their expenses. The pathetic man-child archetype is a common, modern gag for a reason.
	We created the notion that entertainment has no monetary value.
Napster. Torrenting. Yeah, we have our reasons. Rationalizations are readily on hand. And yeah, it drove the technologies that my family now rely upon for entertainment, namely NetFlix and Hulu. But its been harrowing, difficult, and a big legal hassle. Feeling entitled? Yeah, Im feeling entitled. I did my part to wreck the entertainment industry, just like the industry itself did theirs.
	We removed every reason possible to go outside.
We used to go outside, not because we were really concerned with our health, but because that was the only place to do fun stuff. Hell, Im from among the first generation of computer users. I experienced this first-hand withoutthe internet. I spent late nights typing ship-routes into my local BBS game of Trade Wars. That and a lousy diet go hand in hand. We accidentally developed technologies - industrial food processing loaded with salt and sugar, and wicked cool video games (among others) - that would make it very difficult for you to motivate yourself to keep in shape and eat right. Now we have an obesity epidemic and record levels of diabetes.

So thats the five, and it makes me queasy. Were deep inside a spectrum of a yet-to-be-written date-range that describes this period. It's hard to see social change from the inside. Some are for this thing, some against that other thing, but it feels like so much flailing of the arms while careening into a deep hole.

When the eventual reckoning materializes, well wrench our guts, stick to our guns, and accept or oppose the new values-package, whatever it ends up looking like. The next technological/infrstructural New Deal will be argued about for decades, just like the last one.

The generational component cannot be understated, even though Im far from understanding it. All I know is that the largest birth cohort in American history appears to have gone off its nut, and many of us who came after it are scratching or nodding our heads, respectively.

I feel as though a bunch of institutions, through no fault of their own, have set up a complex path of dominoes that they wish to admire in some pristine, untouched state. A bunch of jobless, desperate, and increasingly angry toddlers are stretching their flicking fingers, though, and I have no good answers for them. Only an "Im sorry"before I watch more of the things fall down.					&lt;/div&gt;

					&lt;/h2&gt;
					&lt;div class="body"&gt;
						A few weeks into my Fitocracy fitness regimen, I got an achievement: I Seem to be lost.

It was a reward for running 20 miles over the course of using Fitocracy. Naturally, I got slightly philosophical. Why yes, I do seem to be lost.

American physical fitness styles are a special kind of lost. We love our nutty diets and way-too-specific exercise regimens guaranteed to make you lose 30 pounds in 2 days and create washboard-stomachs in 20 minutes. Theres a lot of shit-wading to do before discovering the only regimen that works reliably for everyone: Eat less and exercise.

I've been doing thatfor a while, but now I'm running like a nut. This is ironic because, after golf, it was the outdoor activity that I scratched my head about the most. I mean...youre just run. What the hell?

Now I realize that its about much more: rhythm, endurance, focus, breathing, and injuries.

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;We were once the greatest endurance runners on earth. We didnt have fangs, claws, strength or speed, but the springiness of our legs and our unrivaled ability to cool our bodies by sweating rather than panting enabled humans to chase prey until it dropped from heat exhaustion. Some speculate that collaboration on such hunts led to language, then shared technology. Running arguably made us the masters of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;So how did one of our greatest strengths become such a liability? The data suggests up to 79 percent of all runners are injured every year, says Stephen Messier, the director of the J. B. Snow Biomechanics Laboratory at Wake Forest University. Whats more, those figures have been consistent since the 1970s. Messier is currently 11 months into a study for the U.S. Army and estimates that 40 percent of his 200 subjects will be hurt within a year. Its become a serious public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

That's from The Once and Future Way to Run, by Christopher McDougall. He breaks a few things down: Its not about whether youre barefoot, have fancy sneakers, or special surfaces. Its about form.

The author mentions the running habits of the Tarahumara Indians, who incorporate a soft stride - landing on the balls of their feet - rather than landing on their heel. Its such a simple thing, but it makes such a world of difference, and no fancy gimmicks are required.
Giving earlier-me a break
Im fond of bashing earlier-me. Theres so much in my past to shake my head at. Clumsy interpersonal relationships, lack of focus, laziness - the accounts would unfurl onto the floor like Santa Claus consulting the naughty list. But: Every now and then, I discover something that changes the shape of the stories I tell about myself.

In youth, for almost a decade (though not completely consecutive), I studied the martial arts. It was a rare form of Karate called Uechi Ryu. My father and I both studied together. Before quitting, I attained my second degree black belt; but whatever. I did well enough, I suppose.

To be brutally honest, though, compared to most of my peers, I was somewhat sloppy, less motivated, less confident, and more timid. Sure, there were plenty of times that I gave it my all, but there were so many lazy moments that I can only blame on adolescence and my anti-rose-colored glasses.

I often lament earlier-me, but I have to believe that I was a better student than I remember. Hell, I failed my first black belt test, re-trained and then obtained it on the next go round. I could have just quit in frustration, right?
Reality trumps stories
Heres the thing. I have some very potent memories of the following:

	The smell of feet. The shoe room at a martial arts studio is a scent Ill not soon forget.
	Being drenched with sweat. Form be damned. If nothing else, I got one hell of a workout. Even my lousy diet couldnt defeat the fact that I was getting some excellent cardiovascular workouts on a regular basis.
	I was always standing on the balls of my feet. To this day, I have strong calves and leg muscles. This is because Uechi Ryu requires that you never be truly flat footed. Some of the Kata stances may appear that way, but all pivoting happens on the balls of the feet, and all movement happens right there - at the front of the foot.

Which brings me back to that running thing. How those Indians run? Yeah, thats how I run. I hadnt even realized it until I read the article. All those sparring exercises, all those jogs around the dojo, all those countless other exercises I can barely remember... we pivot on the forefoot and keep the pressure off our heels.

I often remark about humanitys cognitive failures. Its nice to reflect that sometimes, purely by an accident of history, you can do the right thing. I wonder what other aspects of current-me were born in earlier-me that I so often carelessly disregard?					&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;

						Protesting, picketing, agitation - all that stuff - well, it's been with us for a very long time. Though the authorities among us would prefer that we were solemn, quiet, and dignified, the truth is that solemnity doesn't do a hell of a lot to change things.

Assuming that this picture is notapocryphal, it serves as a reminder that damned near everythingwe take for granted - all those thoroughly normal,uncontroversialthings in life - well... they werecontroversial.

Apparently, you just have to look back far enough. We hold on to so many normalthings, unaware that the most trivial among them was a thing to be fought for. It's something worth keeping in mind among the very important protests happening at the moment.

If anyone has more information about this picture, I'd love to learn more.					&lt;/div&gt;

						With a few exceptions, the story of my life has been one of instant gratification. Blame society, blame parents, blame myself, blame my own unique cocktail of Reasons. In the end, I'm just lazy, but in a general and common way.

I'm lazy enough to put off what I know will help me today. But I'm not so lazy that I haven't taken the odd side-class or put genuine effort into learning stuff.Nothing new, there.

I'm sure it's familiar to many of us. Lately, the thought surfaces because so much of my time has been filled with the structured pursuits of a modern, American father. Unless you're hanging out at Moe's Tavern every night,life is very fucking busy. And if you're hanging at Moe's, why are you married?

A job became a career. A hobby became a pursuit. And general healthfulness evolved into the focused variety. The question, as always, is how long can I maintain?

The line graph of pursuits over the course of my life swerves up, down, and all around. Consistency has not been my friend. We fight from time to time. It's a dysfunctional marriage with the part of myself sitting on a beanbag and horking chips in my mouth while Adult Swim is airing content.

But screw that guy. I care more about Future Me. That's theMethat's just a dream; an odd idea. I've neglected that guy for a while.

On the fitness front, I've been using Runkeeper and Fitocracy to keep data in front of my face: this is what you're doing. Don't quit this, you lazy ass.

Professionally, my work's task-lists in front of my face to an insane degree (more on that in the future). I track what's coming and what I've done. Again, it's as if to say: don't screw around; look at all that work you did yesterday.

But no pats on the head, yet. Or ever.How much of this is a function of crises-driven life-stage anxiety? Each of us stares into the void differently. Moreso, though, each of us is a different person staring into the void. There are multiples of multiples; plenty of ways to fear, and cope with, the anticlimax at the end.
&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssf7P-Sgcrk[/youtube]&lt;/p&gt;
So I'm perfecting the art of busying myself until that end. I'd like Future Me to look back on Present Mewith a little more fondness than I have in the past. That requires tools, bits of inspiration, and well grounded advice you can't find in a Time fluff piece.

But, if you want to get a firm handle on why it's so damned hard to reach our dreams, watch this. It's three and a half minutes long, and beyond educational.
