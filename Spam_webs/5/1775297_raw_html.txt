       Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is currently classified as an anxiety
      disorder marked by the recurrence of intrusive or disturbing thoughts,
      impulses, images or ideas (obsessions) accompanied by repeated attempts to
      suppress these thoughts through the performance of certain irrational and
      ritualistic behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). The obsessions and
      compulsions take up large amounts of the patient's time (an hour or longer
      every day) and usually cause significant emotional distress for the
      patient and difficulties in his or her relationships with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some researchers have questioned whether OCD really belongs with the other
      anxiety disorders. They think that it should be grouped with the spectrum
      of such obsessive-compulsive disorders as Tourette's syndrome, which are
      known to have biological causes.
      </p>
      <p>
       OCD should not be confused with
       <b>
        <a href="../Ob-Ps/Obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder.html">
         obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
        </a>
       </b>
       even though the two disorders have similar names. Obsessive-compulsive
      personality disorder is not characterized by the presence of obsessions
      and compulsions; rather, it is a lifelong pattern of insistence on
      control, orderliness, and perfection that begins no later than the early
      adult years. It is possible, however, for a person to have both disorders.

       Description
      </h2>
      <p>
       Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder with two components:
      obsessions, which consist of thoughts, impulses, or mental images; and
      compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors that the person feels driven
      to perform in response to the obsessions. In some cases, the
       <b>
        <a href="../Br-Del/Compulsion.html">
         compulsion
        </a>
       </b>
       may represent a strict rule that the patient must apply rigidly in every
      situation (tying one's shoes a certain number of times, for example) in
      order to feel "right." The exact content of obsessions varies from person
      to person, although certain themes are common. People with OCD experience
      their disturbing thoughts and images as intrusive and troublesome, but
      they recognize that their thoughts are products of their own minds.
      Obsessive thoughts are different from worries about such real-life
      problems as losing one's job or bad grades in school. In addition,
      obsessive thoughts are not usually related to any real-life problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most common types of obsessions in persons with OCD in Western
      countries are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        fear of contamination (impurity, pollution, badness)
       </li>
       <li>
        doubts (worrying about whether one has omitted to do something)
       </li>
       <li>
        an intense need to have or put things in a particular order
       </li>
       <li>
        aggressive or frightening impulses
       </li>
       <li>
        recurrent sexual thoughts or images
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It is important to understand that patients diagnosed with OCD do not
      perform their compulsions for pleasure or satisfaction. A compulsive
      behavior becomes linked to an obsessional thought because the behavior
      lowers the level of anxiety produced by the obsession(s).
      </p>
      <p>
       The most common compulsions in Western countries are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        washing/cleaning
       </li>
       <li>
        counting
       </li>
       <li>
        hoarding
       </li>
       <li>
        checking
       </li>
       <li>
        putting objects in a certain order
       </li>
       <li>
        repeated "confessing" or asking others for assurance
       </li>
       <li>
        repeated actions
       </li>
       <li>
        making lists
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Although descriptions of patients with OCD have been reported since the
      fifteenth century in religious and psychiatric literature, the condition
      was widely assumed to be rare until very recently. Epidemiological
      research since 1980 has now identified OCD as the fourth most common
      psychiatric illness, after phobias, substance use disorders, and major
      depressive disorders. OCD is presently classified as a form of anxiety
      disorder, but current studies indicate that it results from a combination
      of psychological, neurobiological, genetic, and environmental causes.

        PSYCHOSOCIAL.
       </b>
       In the early part of the century, Sigmund Freud theorized that OCD
      symptoms were caused by punitive, rigid toilet-training practices that led
      to internalized conflicts. Other theorists thought that OCD was influenced
      by such wider cultural attitudes as insistence on cleanliness and
      neatness, as well as by the attitudes and parenting style of the patient's
      parents. Cross-cultural studies of OCD indicate that, while the incidence
      of OCD seems to be about the same in most countries around the world, the
      symptoms are often shaped by the patient's culture of origin. For example,
      a patient from a Western country may have a contamination
       <b>
        <a href="../Ob-Ps/Obsession.html">
         obsession
        </a>
       </b>
       that is focused on germs, whereas a patient from India may fear
      contamination by touching a person from a lower social caste.
      </p>
      <p>
       Studies of families with OCD members indicate that the particular
      expression of OCD symptoms may be 
      affected by the responses of other people. Families with a high tolerance
      for the symptoms are more likely to have members with more extreme or
      elaborate symptoms. Problems often occur when the OCD member's obsessions
      and rituals begin to control the entire family.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        BIOLOGICAL.
       </b>
       There is considerable evidence that OCD has a biological component. Some
      researchers have noted that OCD is more common in patients who have
      suffered head trauma or have been diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome.
      Recent studies using
       <b>
        <a href="../Ob-Ps/Positron-emission-tomography.html">
         positron emission tomography
        </a>
       </b>
       (PET) scanning indicate that OCD patients have patterns of
       <b>
        <a href="../A-Br/Brain.html">
         brain
        </a>
       </b>
       activity that differ from those of people without mental illness or with
      some other mental illness. Other studies using
       <b>
        <a href="../Kau-Nu/Magnetic-resonance-imaging.html">
         magnetic resonance imaging
        </a>
       </b>
       (MRI) found that patients diagnosed with OCD had significantly less white
      matter in their brains than did normal control subjects. This finding
      suggests that there is a widely distributed brain abnormality in OCD. Some
      researchers have reported abnormalities in the metabolism of serotonin, an
      important neurotransmitter, in patients diagnosed with OCD. Serotonin
      affects the efficiency of communication between the front part of the
      brain (the cortex) and structures that lie deeper in the brain known as
      the basal ganglia. Dysfunction in the serotonergic system occurs in
      certain other mental illnesses, including major depression. OCD appears to
      have a number of features in common with the so-called
      obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, which include Tourette's
      syndrome; Sydenham's chorea; eating disorders;
       <b>
        <a href="../Py-Z/Trichotillomania.html">
         trichotillomania
        </a>
       </b>
       ; and delusional disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
       There appear to be genetic factors involved in OCD. The families of
      persons who are diagnosed with the disorder have a greater risk of OCD and
       <b>
        <a href="../Py-Z/Tic-disorders.html">
         tic disorders
        </a>
       </b>
       than does the general population. Childhood-onset OCD appears to run in
      families more than adult-onset OCD, and is more likely to be associated
      with tic disorders. Twin studies indicate that monozygotic, or identical
      twins, are more likely to share the disorder than dizygotic, or fraternal
      twins. The concordance (match) rate between identical twins is not 100%,
      however, which suggests that the occurrence of OCD is affected by
      environmental as well as genetic factors. In addition, it is the general
      nature of OCD that seems to run in families rather than the specific
      symptoms; thus, one family member who is affected by the disorder may have
      a compulsion about washing and cleaning while another is a compulsive
      counter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Large epidemiological studies have found a connection between
      streptococcal infections in childhood and the abrupt onset or worsening of
      OCD symptoms. The observation that there are two age-related peaks in the
      onset of the disorder increases the possibility that there is a common
      causal factor. Patients with childhood-onset OCD often have had one of two
      diseases caused by a group of bacteria called Group A beta-hemolytic
      streptococci ("strep" throat and Sydenham's chorea) prior to the onset of
      the OCD symptoms. The disorders are sometimes referred to as pediatric
      autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal
      infections, or PANDAS. It is thought that antibodies in the child's blood
      cross-react with structures in the basal ganglia, producing or worsening
      the symptoms of OCD or tic disorders.

        Symptoms
       </i>
      </h3>
      <p>
       The symptoms of OCD should not be confused with the ability to focus on
      detail or to check one's work that is sometimes labeled "compulsive" in
      everyday life. This type of attentiveness is an important factor in
      academic achievement and in doing well in fields that require close
      attention to detail, such as accounting or engineering. By contrast, the
      symptoms of OCD are serious enough to interfere with the person's
      day-to-day functioning. Historical examples of OCD include a medieval
      Englishman named William of Oseney, who spent twelve hours per day reading
      religious books in order to be at peace with God; and Freud's Rat Man, a
      patient who had repeated dreams of cursing Freud and covering him with
      dung. While the Rat Man was ashamed of these impulses and had no
      explanation for them, he could not control them.
      </p>
      <p>
       More recent accounts of OCD symptoms include those of a young man who
      compulsively touched every electrical outlet as he passed, washed his
      hands several times an hour, and returned home repeatedly to check that
      the doors and windows were locked. Another account describes a firefighter
      who was worried that he had throat cancer. He spent three hours a day
      examining his throat in the mirror, feeling his lymph nodes, and asking
      his wife if his throat appeared normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brief descriptions of the more common obsessions and compulsions follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        CONTAMINATION.
       </b>
       People with contamination obsessions are usually preoccupied with a fear
      of dirt or germs. They may avoid leaving home or allowing visitors to come
      inside in order to prevent contact with dirt or germs. Some people with
      contamination obsessions may wear gloves, coats, or even masks if they are
      forced to leave their house for some reason. Obsessions with contamination
      may also include abnormal fears of such environmental toxins as lead,
      asbestos, or radon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Washing compulsions are commonly associated with contamination obsessions.
      For example, a person concerned about contamination from the outside may
      shower and launder all clothing immediately upon coming home. The
      compulsion may be triggered by direct contact with the feared object, but
      in many cases, even being 
      in its general vicinity may stir up intense anxiety and a strong need to
      engage in a washing compulsion. One man who was afraid of contamination
      could not even take a short walk down the street without experiencing a
      compulsion to disinfect the soles of his shoes, launder all his clothing,
      and wash his hands until they were raw after he returned to his apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Washing compulsions may not always be caused by a fear of germs. That is,
      a need for perfection or for symmetry may also lead to unnecessary
      washing. In such cases, the individual may be concerned about being
      "perfectly" clean, or feel that he cannot leave the shower until his left
      foot has been washed exactly as many times as his right foot. Other people
      with washing compulsions may be unable to tolerate feeling sweaty or
      otherwise not clean.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        OBSESSIONAL DOUBTING.
       </b>
       Obsessional doubting refers to the fear of having failed to perform some
      task adequately, and that dire consequences will follow as a result.
      Although the person may try to suppress the worrisome thoughts or images,
      he or she usually experiences a rising anxiety which then leads to a
      compulsion to check the task. For example, someone may worry about
      forgetting to lock the door or turn off the gas burner on the stove and
      spend hours checking these things before leaving home. In one instance, a
      man was unable to throw away old grocery bags because he feared he might
      have left something valuable inside one of them. Immediately after looking
      into an empty bag, he would again have the thought, "What if I missed
      something in there?" In many cases, no amount of checking is sufficient to
      dispel the maddening sense of doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        NEED FOR SYMMETRY.
       </b>
       Persons suffering from an obsession about symmetry often report feeling
      acutely uncomfortable unless they perform certain tasks in a symmetrical
      or balanced manner. Thus, crossing one's legs to the right must be
      followed by crossing legs to the left; scratching one side of the head
      must be followed by scratching the other; tapping the wall with a knuckle
      on the right hand must be followed by tapping with one on the left, etc.
      Sometimes the person may have a thought or idea associated with the
      compulsion, such as a fear that a loved one will be harmed if the action
      is not balanced, but often there is no clearly defined fear, only a strong
      sense of uneasiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        AGGRESSIVE AND SEXUAL OBSESSIONS.
       </b>
       Aggressive and sexual obsessions are often particularly horrifying to
      those who experience them. For some people, obsessive fears of committing
      a terrible act in the future compete with fears that they may already have
      done something awful in the past. Compulsions to constantly check and
      confess cause such individuals to admit to evildoing they had no part in,
      a phenomenon familiar to law enforcement following highly publicized
      crimes. These obsessions often involve violent or graphic imagery that is
      upsetting and disgusting to the person, such as rape, physical assault, or
      even murder. One case study concerned a young woman who constantly checked
      the news to reassure herself that she had not murdered anyone that day;
      she felt deeply upset by unsolved murder cases. A middle-aged man
      repeatedly confessed to having molested a woman at work, despite no
      evidence of such an action ever occurring in his workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN.
       </b>
       Obsessions and compulsions in children are often focused on germs and
      fears of contamination. Other common obsessions include fears of harm
      coming to self or others; fears of causing harm to another person;
      obsessions about symmetry; and excessive moralization or religiosity.
      Childhood compulsions frequently include washing, repeating, checking,
      touching, counting, ordering and arranging. Younger children are less
      likely to have full-blown anxiety-producing obsessions, but they often
      report a sense of relief or strong satisfaction (a "just right" feeling)
      from completing certain ritualized behaviors. Since children are
      particularly skillful in disguising their OCD symptoms from adults, they
      may effectively hide their disorder from parents and teachers for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unusual behaviors in children that may be signs of OCD include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Avoidance of scissors or other sharp objects. A child may be obsessed
        with fears of hurting herself or others.
       </li>
       <li>
        Chronic lateness or dawdling. The child may be per forming checking
        rituals (repeatedly making sure all her school supplies are in her
        bookbag, for example).
       </li>
       <li>
        Daydreaming or preoccupation. The child may be counting or performing
        balancing rituals mentally.
       </li>
       <li>
        Spending long periods of time in the bathroom. The child may have a
        handwashing compulsion.
       </li>
       <li>
        Schoolwork handed in late or papers with holes erased in them. The child
        may be repeatedly checking and cor recting her work.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For both children and adults, the symptoms of OCD wax and wane in
      severity; and the specific content of obsessions and compulsions may
      change over time. The disorder, however, very seldom goes away by itself
      without treatment. People with OCD in all age groups typically find that
      their symptoms worsen during major life changes or following highly
      stressful events.

       Demographics
      </h2>
      <p>
       As noted above, OCD is a relatively common mental disorder, with about
      2.3% of the population of the United States being diagnosed with the
      condition at some point in their lives. As of 2000, the annual social and
      economic costs of OCD in the United States are estimated at $9 billion.
      Although the disorder may begin at any age, the typical age of onset is
      late adolescence to young adulthood, with slightly more women than men
      being diagnosed with OCD. Interestingly, childhood OCD is more common in
      males, and the sex ratio does not favor females until adulthood. People
      with OCD appear to be less likely to marry than persons diagnosed with
      other types of mental disorders.

      <h2>
       Diagnosis
      </h2>
      <p>
       OCD is a disorder that may not be diagnosed for years. People who suffer
      from its symptoms are often deeply ashamed, and go to great lengths to
      hide their ritualistic behaviors. The disorder may be diagnosed when
      family members get tired of the impact of the patient's behaviors on their
      lives, and force the patient to consult a doctor. In other cases, the
      disorder may be self-reported. The patient may have come to resent the
      amount of time wasted by the compulsions; or he or she may have taken a
      screening questionnaire such as the brief screener available on the NIMH
      website (listed in the Resources section below).
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <b>
        <a href="../Del-Fi/Diagnosis.html">
         diagnosis
        </a>
       </b>
       of OCD may be complicated because of the number of other conditions that
      resemble it. For example, major depression may be associated with
      self-perceptions of being guilty, bad, or worthless that are excessive and
      unreasonable. Similarly, eating disorders often include bizarre thoughts
      about size and weight, ritualized eating habits, or the hoarding of food.
      Delusional disorders may entail unusual beliefs or behaviors, as do such
      other mental disorders as trichotillomania,
       <b>
        <a href="../Flu-Inv/Hypochondriasis.html">

         paraphilias
        </a>
       </b>
       , and substance use disorders. Thus, accurate diagnosis of OCD depends on
      the careful analysis of many variables to determine whether the apparent
      obsessions and compulsions might be better accounted for by some other
      disorder, or to the direct effects of a substance or a medical condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, OCD may coexist with other mental disorders, most commonly
      depression. It has been estimated that about 34% of patients diagnosed
      with OCD are depressed at the time of diagnosis, and that 65% will develop
      depression at some point in their lives.

       Treatments
      </h2>
      <p>
       As of 2002, a combination of behavioral therapy and medications appears to
      be the most effective treatment for OCD. The goal of treatment is to
      reduce the frequency and severity of the obsessions and compulsions so
      that the patient can work more efficiently and have more time for social
      activities. Few OCD patients become completely symptom-free, but most
      benefit considerably from treatment.

        Psychotherapy

      </h3>
      <p>
       Behavioral treatments using the technique of exposure and response
      prevention are particularly effective in treating OCD. In this form of
      therapy, the patient and therapist draw up a list, or hierarchy, of the
      patient's obsessive and compulsive symptoms. The symptoms are arranged in
      order from least to most upsetting. The patient is then systematically
      exposed to the anxiety-producing thoughts or behaviors, beginning with the
      least upsetting. The patient is asked to endure the feared event or image
      without engaging in the compulsion normally used to lower anxiety. For
      example, a person with a contamination obsession might be asked to touch a
      series of increasingly dirty objects without washing their hands. In this
      way, the patient learns to tolerate the feared object, reducing both
      worrisome obsessions and anxiety-reducing compulsions. About 75%80%
      of patients respond 
       well to exposure and response prevention, with very significant
      reductions in symptoms.

       is helpful to some patients who are concerned about the relationships
      between their upbringing and the specific features of their OCD symptoms.
      Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy may be valuable in helping the patient
      to become more comfortable with the prospect of exposure and prevention
      treatments, as well as helping to identify the role that the patient's
      particular symptoms may play in his or her own life and what effects
      family members may have on the maintenance and continuation of OCD
      symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is not intended to replace
      exposure and response prevention, but may be a helpful addition to it.

        Medications

      </h3>
      <p>
       The most useful medications for the treatment of OCD are the selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which affect the body's
      reabsorption of serotonin, a chemical in the brain that helps to transmit
      nerve impulses across the very small gaps between nerve cells. These

       (Paxil) have been found to relieve OCD symptoms in over half of the
      patients studied. It is not always possible for the doctor to predict
      which of the SSRIs will work best for a specific patient. Lack of response
      to one SSRI does not mean that other drugs within the same family will not
      work. Treatment of OCD often proceeds slowly, with various medications
      being tried before the most effective one is found. While studies report
      that about half of those treated with SSRIs show definite improvement,
      relapse rates may be as high as 90% when medications are discontinued.

      with extended treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The onset of OCD in childhood is the single strongest predictor of a poor
      prognosis. Treatment in children is also complicated by the fact that
      children may find the response and exposure techniques very stressful. It
      is also hard for children to understand the potential value of such
      treatments; however, creative therapists have learned to use anxiety
      reduction strategies, education, and behavioral rewards to help their
      young patients with the treatment tasks. Concern about the long-term use
      of medications in children with OCD has further encouraged the use of
      cognitive-behavioral techniques whenever possible.

        People deliberately pursue their rituals of doing things in order to avoid doing something else that they fear to do or wish to avoid. OCD, as something that controls you, doesn't exist! In order to get rid of OCD, focus on finding and confronting what it is that you are wanting to avoid and the OCD will disappear.

        Very good comment by Stephen. I think the cause is that really something else is wrong and the obsession/compulsion, for example, somatic, is merely a sign that something else is wrong.
