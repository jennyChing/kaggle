      Actually using the arguments gets people into worse trouble, including fines, asset seizures, contempt convictions and criminal records, and the few cases touted as "successes" are almost entirely for reasons unrelated to the freeman arguments

      The "Freeman on the Land" movement inherited various indefensible legal concepts from the older

      </a>
      in the 1970s and 1980s, the

      in the 1980s and 1990s and the
      <a href="/wiki/Militia_movement" title="Militia movement">
       Montana Freemen
      </a>
      in the 1990s. Freeman concepts of admiralty law and common law, their obsession with capitalisation of words and various theories on finance can be traced back to almost identical theories from these earlier movements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early examples include "Mary Elizabeth: Croft" in Canada and her 2005 book
      <i>
       How I clobbered every bureaucratic cash-confiscatory agency known to man ... a Spiritual Economics Book on $$$ and Remembering Who You Are
      </i>
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7">
       <a href="#cite_note-7">
        [8]
       </a>
      </sup>
      . This evolved into a Canadian movement, with advocates such as Robert Menard  who appears to have actually coined the phrase "Freeman on the land,"
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-menardfreeman_1-1">
       <a href="#cite_note-menardfreeman-1">
        [2]
       </a>
      </sup>
      with the phrase achieving currency some time around mid-2008.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8">
       <a href="#cite_note-8">
        [9]
       </a>
      </sup>
      However, according to Robert-Scott:Christy who co-founded Thinkfree.ca with Menard, Rob got the idea for referring to themselves as "Freemen on the Land" from an unnamed American source.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9">
       <a href="#cite_note-9">
        [10]
       </a>
      </sup>
     </p>
     <p>
      The movement appears to have morphed out of the earlier Detax movement in Canada headed by names like Eldon Warman and Russel Porisky. Rob Menard's own ventures into pseudolaw appear to go as far back as 2001 with his book "Letters to Authorities". Dean Clifford also sets the date of his journey into pseudolaw starting in the late 90s and as being influenced by the Detax movement. Clifford prefers the term "Freedom Movement", a phrase used by the earlier Detaxers, over FMOTL.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10">
       <a href="#cite_note-10">
        [11]
       </a>
      </sup>
      A potential timeline could be that Tax Protester ideas migrate to Canada in the late 90s, the Detax movement gains popularity then dies out in the early 2000s once followers who stopped taxes began being prosecuted, then in 2008 the movement finds new blood thanks to the financial crisis which culminates with the 2012 Meads decision and a new round of Freeman arrests.

OPCA arguments are never sold to their customers as simple ideas, but instead are byzantine schemes which more closely resemble the plot of a dark fantasy novel than anything else. Latin maxims and powerful sounding language are often used. Documents are often ornamented with many strange marking and seals. Litigants engage in peculiar, rituallike in court conduct. All these features appear necessary for gurus to market OPCA schemes to their often desperate, illinformed, mentally disturbed, or legally abusive customers. This is crucial to understand the non-substance of any OPCA concept or strategy. The story and process of a OPCA scheme is not intended to impress or convince the Courts,

      Freeman methods fail to understand that the law derives its authority from the fact that the state has the means and the will to use force to impose it. You can argue that the authorities have no jurisdiction over you, and you can choose not to recognise their authority, but as long as the authorities have force to back up their rules they can enforce sanctions against you. Freemen would argue that this would be unlawful imprisonment  but at the end of the day you'd still be in jail.

This does not work out in practice and has attracted penalties in return.

      Clause 61 is a historically and constitutionally significant clause. It gave twenty-five barons the right to meet and overrule the will of the king and seize his assets, essentially usurping his authority, should this be considered necessary. This was based on
      <i>
       distraint
      </i>
      (the seizure of someones property in order to obtain payment of rent or other money owed), but it was the first time it had been applied to a monarch. It was one of the first times that there had been any kind of restriction on a king's power from below, and arguably it was one of the first checks and balances on the monarch and the first step toward a constitutional government. Nevertheless, clause 61 was only in effect for three months, as King John later renounced it and Pope Innocent III released King John from his oath to obey it. This led to the

      between the king and his barons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Freemen claim that clause 61 allows them to cease obeying the state. This sometimes involves sending an affidavit direct to the Queen declaring one's intent to become a freeman and removing their consent to be governed. Some freemen believe that the Queen represents the highest authority in the land as
      <i>
       the
      </i>
      sovereign, but that she derives her authority from the people. This then makes them sovereign, such that there is no higher authority than themselves.
     </p>
     <p>
      The actual text of Magna Carta's clause 61 explicitly refers to the King and the Barons (25 of them being required to invoke the clause)  nowhere is there any mention of the people, free or otherwise; nor would there be, given the feudal system in place at the time. The phrase "Lawful Rebellion" appears nowhere in clause 61, being an invention of freeman mythology.
     </p>
     <p>
      Freemen claim that the Magna Carta cannot be repealed, but this simply is not true. It was, in fact, replaced by the Magna Carta of 1297, passed by Edward I in return for new taxes. It is this 1297 version (without any clause 61 or anything resembling it) which is now "in force", although by 1969, all but sections 1 (freedom of the church), 9 (freedom of the City of London) and 29 (right to due process) had been repealed or superseded.

They do not believe that statute law applies without an individual's consent, and that we are merely conditioned and deceived by the authorities to believe that they do.  Freemen claim that statutes can have the force of law as a binding contract under the correct conditions.

      Freemen believe that the government has to establish what they refer to as
      <i>
       joinder
      </i>
      to link yourself and your legal person.  When they ask you whether you are "John Smith" and you confirm that you are, then you are establishing joinder.  You have supposedly connected your physical and legal
      <i>
       persons
      </i>
      .

      The next step is to obtain consent.  Statutes are seen as invitations to enter a contract, which are only legally enforceable if one enters into the contract consensually.  If one does not enter into a contract, statute laws are not applicable.  Freemen believe that the government is therefore constantly trying to trick people into entering into a contract with them.  They often return bills, notices, summons and so on with the message "No contractreturn to sender".

      The claim is that legalese looks like English and uses English words, but is
      <i>
       not English
      </i>
      .  For instance, freemen assert that the word "must" in legalese is synonymous with "may" in English, "summons" means "invitation," "demand" means "offer," and "understand" (as in "do you understand?") means "stand under," as in "do you stand under these words?" (

      They claim that all these terms are sneaky ways of getting you to contract with the government without realising.  No source is provided for this use of language; and some of it is demonstrably incorrect. The English word "understand" derives from an Old English word meaning

      Freemen see a distinction between (what they call) common law and statute law, which they refer to as "
      <a href="/wiki/Admiralty_law" title="Admiralty law">
       admiralty law
      </a>
      ," "law of the sea," "maritime law," or the "universal commercial code" (a distortion of the US-only
      <i>
       Uniform Commercial Code
      </i>
      )  something that only applies to corporations,
      <i>
       e.g.
      </i>
      legal persons, not flesh-and-blood humans.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-kettletrulyfree_26-3">
       <a href="#cite_note-kettletrulyfree-26">
        [27]

      </sup>
      They see admiralty law as being the law of commerce, the law of owner
      <i>
       ship
      </i>
      , citizen
      <i>
       ship
      </i>
      , and indeed anything else ending in "-ship."  They see evidence of this in various nautical-sounding terms used in court, such as "dock," "birth [berth] certificate," "-ship" suffixes and any other fancy word they think might have a vaguely naval sound.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-38">
       <a href="#cite_note-38">
        [39]
       </a>
      </sup>
      Freemen will take this further by referring to the court as a "ship", its occupants as "passengers" and claiming that anyone leaving are "men overboard."  This gives their legal arguments a hilarious nautical theme.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-kettletrulyfree_26-4">

      They see courts as being a place of business intended to make profit for the government corporation.  They sometimes refer to these courts as "de facto courts."  When they receive a summons to appear in court, they insist that this is not a summons but, in fact, an invitation to a place of business to discuss the matter at hand.

      When one initially enters a court they are then operating under "admiralty law" rather than (their version of) "common law". American freemen will sometimes try to argue that if the flag in the court has a gold fringe, this signifies that it is an admiralty court.  British courts tend not to have flags of any type, having the royal coat of arms behind the judge instead, so this claim has largely failed to cross the Atlantic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Freemen believe that a victim must exist for a common law crime to have been committed.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-kettletrulyfree_26-6">
       <a href="#cite_note-kettletrulyfree-26">
        [27]
       </a>
      </sup>
      One attempt at defence will be to demand to see evidence of a victim.  They may also complain that the trial is unfair because the judge and prosecution are on the same team, both being employed by the state.  If a freeman has had their property confiscated, they will request that it be returned to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      They will try to claim common law (rather than admiralty law) jurisdiction by asking "do you have a claim against me?" which supposedly removes their consent to be governed by admiralty law and turns the court into a common law court, forcing the court to proceed according to their version of common law.  (This has never worked.)  Any cooperation with the court is seen as accepting their terms of contract, and freemen will therefore refuse to do anything asked of them.  When asked to stand or approach the bench, they will often refuse to do so, or only do so as long as their "inalienable God-given rights remain intact," in order to prevent them inadvertently entering into a contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      Freemen will also attempt to "put the judge on their oath" to force them to act in accordance with common law, which entails asking to see evidence of this oath.
      <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-kettletrulyfree_26-7">
       <a href="#cite_note-kettletrulyfree-26">
        [27]
       </a>
      </sup>
      Judges typically give short shrift to this kind of request, and either adjourn the hearing or threaten the freeman with contempt of court.  The freeman might then ask whether the judge means civil or criminal contempt; this is because freemen believe that civil contempt would come under admiralty law, and therefore require a consensual contract, and that criminal contempt would require a victim.  When judges leave the courtroom, Freemen will attempt to claim common law authority and then attempt to dismiss the charges themselves, often with a cry of "ship abandoned" or "man overboard."

      They will never accept legal representation, as to do so might entail contracting with the state.  They also believe that professional lawyers and solicitors owe a duty to the crown before their client due to their oath, and therefore cannot represent them effectively.  Professional lawyers are all part of the legal system and therefore not to be trusted.

      Court appearances are by far the most hysterical part of the freeman delusion, as various YouTube videos will attest.  Watching freemen trying to apply their delusions to reality is like watching a video of a slow-motion train wreck onto which someone has dubbed delusional gibberish.  The fact that freemen put these videos (note that most filming in court is illegal in the UK

      ) on YouTube at all suggests powerful cognitive dissonance, since they typically make the protagonist look very foolish.  Techniques used to overcome the manifest failure of freeman logic in court include editing out key moments in favour of voice-overs and mistaking adjournments for acquittals.

      In reality, any entity (corporation, government, individual person, charity or whatever) that borrows money or works on credit will have a credit record so that creditors can assess the risk of lending. Nor are credit agencies the arbiters of what is and isn't a corporation. The idiosyncrasies of how a credit rating organisation's website lists entities are not evidence for outrageous claims.

      Freemen believe that the UK and Canada are now operating in bankruptcy and are therefore under admiralty law. Since the abolition of the gold standard in 1917, UK currency is now backed not by gold but rather by the people, or rather the legal fiction of their

      Freemen claim the government secures the value of its fiat currency using its own citizens' birth certificate "bonds." It is claimed that the value of an individual's "bond" may reach into the billions. It's interesting to see how the alleged value of the Birth Certificate has changed over time. When the conspiracy theory started in the US the value was estimated at ~$630,000 USD more recent versions of this conspiracy theory put the value of Birth Certificates in the billions.
     </p>
     <p>
      This can supposedly be proven by entering the numbers on one's birth certificate into various stock-tracking sites to show the current value of one's "bond" on the market. Several popular Youtube videos claim to show evidence that numbers on Birth Certificates are actually CUSIP numbers. In reality, CUSIP numbers are 9 digit alpha-numerical codes. Birth Certificate numbers for the US are 11 digits long. UK birth certificate serial numbers are 10 digits long. In Canada the number is 12 digits long.

      Notwithstanding this, freemen believe that one can access the money represented by one's own "bond" though various pseudolegal methods and by filing forms with government agencies. There are plenty of conmen, fraudsters and snake-oil salesmen selling methods on how to achieve this to gullible fools. Naturally, none have ever been shown to work.
     </p>
     <p>
      The value of one's birth certificate "bond" can also supposedly be used to discharge one's debts and financial liabilities through a process known as "acceptance for value" or "A4V", without the freeman having to gain direct access to the funds himself. The UK Treasury has stated that the existence of these bonds, as well as various other freeman financial concepts, are myths.

      The accurate responses to most Freeman arguments are "this claim is false", "this is not how the law works", "this strategy has failed literally every time", "this is not what these words mean at all" or "this is completely made-up".
     </p>
     <p>
      The real problem is that Freemen don't seem to understand how coherent argument works on any level. They refuse to believe a loss in court is not, in fact, a win  they put up illegally-filmed court videos on YouTube of them getting thrown out or penalised, and claim these as clear wins. Even if they are quite unambiguously convicted, fined and/or jailed, they claim

      Despite the numerous failed attempts to use freeman legal methods, freemen will always insist that they do work, even clinging to this delusion when arrested and thrown in the cells. Below are some examples.

        </i>
        to take the child into care and not identifying the risk to the child. Not only is it intellectually dishonest to cite an emotive real life example that actually contradicts your argument, to misrepresent a tragic case like this in such a way is downright offensive.
